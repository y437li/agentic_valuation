At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Chuck Triano : Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer's first quarter 2014 performance. I am joined today in New York by our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Albert Bourla, President of Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer; Geno Germano, President of Global Innovative Pharma; John Young, President of Established Pharma and Doug Lankler, General Counsel. The slides that will be presented on this call can be viewed on our home page pfizer.com, by clicking on the link for Pfizer Quarterly Corporate Performance First Quarter 2014 located in the Investor Presentations section in the lower right hand corner of this page. Before we start, I would like to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer's 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. Discussions during this call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's current report on Form 8-K dated today. We will now make prepared remarks and then we will move to a question and answer session. As we expect there will be questions related to our proposal to AstraZeneca and I would also note that there are limitations to place on our responses by the U.K. Takeover Code and to such there will be some questions we are not in a position to answer at this time. With that, I will now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian? Ian Read : Thank you Chuck, and good morning everyone. During my remarks this morning, we will briefly recap the highlights from the quarter and provide some observations on how our strategy is progressing. Before discussing the quarter, I\u2019ll begin with a few words about the proposal we made to AstraZeneca to combine our two companies, and the rejection of our proposal by AstraZeneca\u2019s Board. The proposal we announced publicly last Friday represented a substantial premium of 32% to AstraZeneca\u2019s shareholders based on AstraZeneca\u2019s closing price of \u00a337.82 on the day before speculation began regarding a potential proposal at 39% premium to the closing price of \u00a335.86 on the day before our January proposal, and a 22% premium to the unaffected all-time high closing price since the formation of the company in 1999. This is an opportunity for AstraZeneca\u2019s shareholders to realize near-term value creation well in excess of its standalone prospects as well as the opportunity to effectively trade up their AstraZeneca position for equity in the new combined company with far greater potential for value creation. Up to this point, we\u2019ve only had access to publicly available information of AstraZeneca. Based on what we have learned through their information, we believe our revised proposal is compelling and responds to what we\u2019ve heard from their shareholders. We are very disappointed with their unwillingness to engage in conversations and believe it is in the best interest of both companies and AstraZeneca and Pfizer\u2019s shareholders that we pursue a friendly negotiated transaction that can be recommended by both our Boards. We would like to engage with AstraZeneca to gain a better understanding of their business and prospects. We believe they are an excellent strategic fit to Pfizer, and they have a strong and complementary alignment across and within our product portfolio and research platform. That said, we remain very confident in our go-forward strategy regardless of a combination. We see this as further enhancing our strategy and consistent with creating shareholder value. Regardless of whether we complete this transaction, the main pillars of our strategy remain in place; namely focusing on innovation and advancing our pipeline, maximizing the productivity and returns generated within our commercial businesses, and remaining good stewards of our shareholders\u2019 capital. We believe that our formidable proposal merits serious consideration. Given our position and strength, we will remain disciplined as we move through this process. Turning to our performance for the quarter, overall we continue to perform well in a challenging operating environment. Our financial performance was in line with our expectations. Revenues for the quarter reflected the continuing impact of product loss of exclusivity and the expiration or near-term termination of some collaborations, a disproportionate amount of about one third of the anticipated full-year impact was recorded in the first quarter. If you exclude that impact, we had 1% operational growth. We saw growth from many of our key revenue drivers including Lyrica, Xalkori, and Inlyta globally, Enbrel outside of the U.S. and Canada, recently launched products, Eliquis and Xeljanz in the U.S., and from our collaboration with Mylan to market generic drugs in Japan. I would point out that our business has historically demonstrated seasonality of revenues, and this quarter was no different. In terms of product developments we reported positive results from Prevnar 13 CapiTA study in older adults, and announced FDA approvals including supplementary new drug applications for Xeljanz to include radiographic data in the label, and for Eliquis for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis, as well as FDA approval of Nexium 24-hour for over-the-counter use for the treatment of frequent heartburn in adults 18 and over. And there were several positive elements in our pipeline, including positive results from a randomized Phase II study of palbociclib in combination with letrozole in first line treatment of ER+ HER2- advanced breast cancer. Positive results from a randomized Phase II study of bococizumab in the reduction of LDL cholesterol, and a breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA for our meningitis B vaccine for the prevention of invasive meningococcal disease in adolescents and young adults. For the full year revenue outlook, we anticipate key products will continue exhibiting growth, and that operational growth in emerging markets will be in the mid-single digit range rather than in the 3% range we saw in this quarter. Typically, our sequential annual product revenue pattern exhibits relative strength in the late quarters compared to our first quarter. For the balance of 2014, we anticipate incremental revenue contributions from Eliquis, Xeljanz, Prevnar 13 adult, Duavee and the expected launch of over-the-counter Nexium. As you know, at the beginning of this year, we implemented the new commercial operating structure to position the company for the future and to focus on maximizing growth. We have three global operating segments; global innovative pharma, global vaccines, oncology and consumer healthcare and global established product pharma. These segments are fully functioning and are increasing the focus of management in providing greater transparency to shareholders and enhancing our ability to drive the business. As we previously committed to you, in today\u2019s earnings announcement, we provided the revenues and costs associated with each of these operating segments. In a few minutes, the leaders of each segment Geno Germano, Albert Bourla, and John Young, will provide you with additional context regarding the performance of their particular segment. While we have moved to this new operating structure, our overall focus and priorities have not changed. We remain focused on driving future value creation for shareholders by delivering innovative new products, maximizing the potential of our existing products, remaining diligent in terms of capital allocation, and driving a culture that continues to foster strong ownership environment. Reflecting on the state of our business, I am pleased with our pipeline progress. We are continuing to see the benefit of the decisions we took over three years ago when we decided to focus our research and development in the areas where we have the most expertise and where the greatest unmet medical need exists. Looking at the compounds we have across all stages of our pipeline, I can confidently say that this part of our strategy is on track and gaining momentum. Similarly, our past and current steadfast focus on the prudent management of our capital is enhancing the overall competitiveness of our businesses. This quarter, once again we operationally reduced our adjusted cost of sales, adjusted S&I expenses, and adjusted R&D expense in total. We will continue to build on our solid track record of realizing benefits from cost reductions and productivity initiatives, and as we\u2019ve done in the past we will use business development opportunities as an enabler of strategies for creating shareholder value. Overall, I believe we are performing well in a challenging operating environment. Our pipeline is advancing. We have a strong track record when it comes to using capital to generate value, and we have an engaged and motivated work force that has embraced the culture of ownership. Collectively, these are the elements of our strategy that are helping to drive our overall business results. Throughout this year, you will see us taking actions that execute on our plans to advance new therapies of patients, strengthen our commercial businesses, manage our cost structure, and deploy our capital in ways that yield the greatest value to our shareholders. Now I\u2019ll turn over to Frank. Frank D'Amelio: Thanks Ian and good day everyone. As always the charts we are reviewing today are included in our Web cast. Before I begin I wanted to remind everyone that at the beginning of this year we began operating under our new commercial structure consisting of three operating segments, global innovative pharmaceuticals, global vaccines oncology and consumer healthcare, and global established pharmaceuticals. Consequently, we are now reporting our quarterly and the annual P&L and the quarters with structure for all periods presented. I also want to remind everyone that as a result of the full disposition of Zoetis on June 24, 2013 the financial results of the Animal Health business are reported as a discontinued operation in the consolidated statements of income for the first quarter 2013. Now let\u2019s move on to the financials. First quarter 2014 revenues of approximately 11.4 billion decreased 9% year over year reflecting a 3% negative impact from foreign exchange and operational decline of approximately 6% driven mainly by the expiration on October 31, 2013 of the co-promotion term of the collaboration agreements for Enbrel in the U.S. and Canada, the ongoing expiration of the Spiriva collaboration in certain countries continued erosion for branded Lipitor in the U.S. and most other developed markets, the loss of exclusivity in subsequent multi-source generic competition for Detrol LA in the U.S. and other product losses of exclusivity in certain markets. These were partially offset by the strong operational growth of Lyrica, Xalkori and Inlyta globally, Enbrel, outside of the U.S. and Canada, Eliquis and Xeljanz primarily in the U.S. the contribution from the collaboration to market generic medicine in Japan with Mylan. In addition reported revenue included 57 million from transitional manufacturing and supply agreements with Zoetis. Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.57 increased 12% primarily due to an aggregate operational decrease of 3% and adjusted cost of adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses primarily resulting from cost reduction and productivity initiatives, a lower effective tax rate and a few diluted weighted average share outstanding due to our ongoing share repurchase program and the impact of Zoetic exchange offer. Reported diluted EPS of $0.36 compared with $0.38 in the year ago quarter was positively impacted by the abovementioned items and lower restructuring and assets impairment charges compared at the year ago quarter. Reported results were negatively impacted by the previously mentioned year-over-year decrease in revenues and the non-recurrence of income from discontinued operations associated with our Animal Business and the gain associated with the transfer of certain product rights to Pfizer\u2019s JV with Hisun in China in the year-ago and finally higher legal charges compared with the year ago quarter. And foreign exchange negatively impacted first quarter revenues by 3% or $364 million and had a net positive impact of $195 million on the aggregate of logistic cost of sales adjusted SI&A expense and adjusted R&D expenses. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted first quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.01 compared the year ago quarter. Now moving onto our 2014 financial guidance, historically our business has demonstrated seasonality of revenues and this quarter is no different. That said we\u2019re confirming all components of our adjusted 2014 financial guidance ranges and as such continue to expect our adjusted revenue to be in the range of $49.2 billion to $51.2 billion. We expect that the continued momentum from our new products including Prevnar 13 Adult, Xeljanz, Eliquis, Inlyta, and Xalkori. The expected launch of over-the-counter Nexium and the accelerating operational growth in emerging markets will help to mitigate the impact of product LOEs and losses of alliance revenue. It\u2019s important to note that our adjusted financial guidance continues to reflect a full year contribution from Celebrex in the U.S. If necessary, we\u2019ll update our financial guidance when we\u2019re in a better position to make an informed judgment about the market exclusivity of Celebrex in the U.S. from May 30 through the end of this year. We\u2019d report to reported diluted EPS due to the applicability of the UK Takeover Code to our proposed combination with AstraZeneca, we\u2019re not currently permitted to confirm or update our 2014 reported diluted EPS guidance which is our customary quarterly practice. Preparation of certain reports by our reporting accounts financial advisors in accordance with the UK Takeover Code are currently underway. Because Pfizer recorded a number of charges during first quarter 2014 relating primarily to the resolution of litigation-related matters, Pfizer's previously-issued 2014 reported diluted EPS guidance is no longer valid. Updated reported diluted EPS guidance will be provided as soon as practicable. As required by the UK Takeover Code, the Pfizer Responsible Officers including Ian, Doug Lankler, our General Counsel in May confirmed that the adjusted financial guidance provided has been properly compiled based on the same assumptions set out in the adjusted financial guidance issued on January 28, 2014 and prepared in accordance with the accounting policies of Pfizer. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to the business leads Geno Germano, Albert Bourla, and John Young for the respective commentary and results for the Global Innovative Pharmaceutical\u2019s Global Vaccines and Oncology and Consumer Healthcare and Global Established Pharmaceutical, Geno? Geno Germano : Thanks, Frank, and hello everyone. On the Global Innovative Pharma is our research driven biopharmaceutical business focused on developing and commercializing innovative new medicines. Our current portfolio consist of newly launched products including Eliquis and Xeljanz key in line brands including Lyrica outside of Europe and Enbrel outside of United States and Canada. In addition to the other products that we generally anticipate will maintain market exclusivity beyond 2015. Our strategy involves making targeted investments to help grow our recently launched brands and other leading medicines in order to generate sustainable revenue growth overtime as well as making investments in R&D to support our next wave of innovative products. Well, some of these near term investment objectives include continuing to build on a momentum with Eliquis among cardiologist focusing on its differentiated clinical profile building on the efficacy profile of Xeljanz in the United States through promotion of the data regarding inhibition of structural damage that\u2019s now included in our labeling and also our mono-therapy indication. Leveraging our presence in the women\u2019s health category to launch DUAVEE in the United States as a potential new standard of care from moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Continuing investment in direct to consumer advertising for Lyrica, Chantix and Viagra in the United States plus investment in growth market such as Japan. In supporting ongoing Phase III clinical studies for bococizumab, ertugliflozin and Xeljanz. Now moving to the first quarter results for the Global Innovative Pharma segment. In the first quarter, revenue declined 4% operationally versus first quarter 2013 and this was largely due to the expiration of the Enbrel co-promotion term in the United States and Canada. Revenues were also negatively impacted by the loss of exclusivity of Lyrica in Canada in February 2013 as well as some other smaller LOEs from prior periods. We excluded the impact of Enbrel in these LOEs underlying operational revenue growth was 10% driven primarily by continued growth of Xeljanz\u2019s Eliquis Enbrel outside of the United States and Canada and Lyrica outside of Europe. Now I\u2019d like to review selected financial highlights for the Global Innovation Pharma segment. As a reminder, the revenues and expenses presented are those that were directly attributable to the GIP segment. First quarter 2014 income before taxes declined 5% operationally to $1.8 billion versus first quarter 2013. IBT as a percent of revenues on an operational basis declined modestly to 57.4%. Increased investment in recently launched brands and key in line products partially offset by benefits from cost reduction and productivity initiatives resulted in a 12% operational increase SI&A expenses compared to prior year quarter. Our first quarter 2014 R&D expense grew 29% operationally compared to last year as we initiated Phase III programs for bococizumab and ertugliflozin and continued investment in our expensive clinical development program for potential new Xeljanz indications. Additionally IBT in the first quarter 2014 benefited from a significant increase and other income primarily due to trailing royalties earned on sales of Enbrel in the United States and Canada after October 31, 2013. On that date the co-promotion term of the collaboration agreement for Enbrel in the United States and Canada expired and we became entitle to royalties for 36 month period. In conclusion we are excited about the GIP portfolio and our pipeline. We believe our focused investment strategy this year will drive sustained future revenue growth. And now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Albert Bourla to discuss the Global Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer Healthcare segment. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much Geno and hello everybody. Both these comprised of three separate distinct businesses, vaccines, oncology and consumer healthcare, each poised for organic growth over time. We\u2019ve had an eventful year so far and have several significant milestones. First with vaccines, we presented positive results from Prevnar 13\u2019s CAPiTA trial at the major conference which clearly demonstrated that Prevnar 13 can prevent a significant portion of pneumococcal community acquire pneumonia in adults\u2019 age 65 and old. Evidence from this study is important for population in which age related decline of the immune system makes it difficult to prevent disease. Hospitalizations due to pneumococcal pneumonia in adults represent a growing burden to public health systems. For example, the annual cost of adult hospitalization in the U.S. alone is estimated at $8 billion. We look forward to further discussing this data with regulatory authorities and vaccine technical committees to help inform decisions regarding Prevnar 13 label and recommendation of the age. Regarding ACIP we have had productive interim discussion with pneumococcal working group. We are prepared for more formal ACIP presentation in June should the CDC confirm that topic in their agenda. Second, in vaccines again, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation of our vaccine for meningitis B, a disease that is characterized by rapid onset with high rates of fatality. We intend to a BLA with the FDA by mid-2014. Moving to oncology, we presented positive results palbociclib\u2019s PALOMA-1 trial at the major conference. We are very pleased with the results which highlight the potential for palbociclib to become a new standard of care for women with ER+ HER2- advanced breast cancer. This is encouraging information for these women who represent approximately 60% of the advanced breast cancer population. We\u2019ve continued to have productive and ongoing discussions with the FDA about this data as well as the other necessary supporting data for a new drug application. We continue to envision its potential by way to filing an NDA based on the PALOMA-1 data. Although, no decision has been made. Once one has been made we will communicate it public. We also begun those in patients in two additional Phase III trials one in recurrent advanced breast cancer and one in early breast cancer and next we reported positive results for the Xalkori compare to chemotherapy in the first line setting for all positive non-small cell lung cancer. Final with consumer health care, we receive FDA approval for Nexium 24HR for over-the-counter use. This approval represents the first significant milestone in executing our Rx to OTC strategy. The U.S. launch is set for May 27. We also continue to advance promising candidates to position the next wave of potential innovative launches including the C. difficile and staph oral vaccines as well as our small inhibitor for hematologic cancers. Now let\u2019s go the VOC first quarter results. For this quarter VOC segment delivered revenues of $2.2 billion which represent an increase of 1% operationally versus Q1 2013. Please note that the revenues and expenses presented are those that were directly attributable to the VOC segment. Revenues for vaccines increased 2% operationally driven by the U.S. primarily reflecting government purchasing orders. Internationally, revenues were flat operational with emerging markets growing at 14% rate driven primarily by China and gavi (ph) purchases but essentially offset by declines in the UK and Canada. Oncology revenues increased 10% due to growth for new products Xalkori and Inlyta partially offset primarily by changes in Sutent buying patterns in certain markets. Consumer health care revenues declined 3% operationally due to a soft cough, cold, flu season in the U.S. and Canada in comparison with the same period last year. Extreme winter weather negatively impacting retail traffic in the U.S. and increased competition for our group with the return of certain brands to the market; however, it is important to note that as the year progresses we anticipate revenues to be positively impacted as more healthcare providers appreciate the value of the Prevnar 13 adult indication. Of course the therefore potential will depend upon updated labels and recommendation of the seasons. Additionally we expect revenues to be positively impacted by the launch of Nexium 24HR and other consumer products the timing of certain national immunization programs and continued uptake of recently launched products in oncology among other factors. I would like now to walk you through a few additional highlights from the VOC segment finance as typically regarding our income and our direct managed expenses. VOC segment income before taxes was 1.1 billion or 48.6% of our revenue. This represents an improvement of 2.8% points operationally. Our gross margin was 1.8 billion or 81.2% of revenue, an improvement of 0.8% points compared to the year ago quarter. Due to a greater percentage year coming from our Oncology and Vaccines business as well as further cost efficiencies in manufacturing. SI&A expenses were $531 million, this represents a 2% increase operationally primarily due to prelaunch expenses for Nexium; however, as a percentage of revenues our SI&A expense has remained consistent year-over-year. The VOC R&D expenses were $184 million which represents an 18% decrease due to the completion of certain Phase III trials which more than offset incremental costs related to the expansion of the palbociclib clinical development program. Thank you and I will now hand it over to John Young, Group President of the Global Established Pharmaceutical segment. John Young : Thank you, Alert, and good morning everyone. Global Established Pharma is a large and highly diverse business with unique opportunities across portfolios and geographies. It\u2019s a significant cash generator and its Pfizer\u2019s largest business. For the first quarter of 2014 the GEP business accounted for just over half of Pfizer\u2019s total revenue and about two thirds of Pfizer\u2019s total revenue from the emerging markets comes from GEP. Notably during the first quarter, emerging markets comprised nearly 30% of the GEP segment revenues. Contributed to some perceptions of this business traditional commodity generic products in develop markets are actually very small part of the GEP portfolio. And it came through in May by 5% of GEP revenues. We see our GEP strategic priorities as two fold, one is optimized the financial performance of the decline in components in the developed markets. And two focus on the current and future areas of growth and reversing the decline in trend. I am not optimizing the business margins over the mid to longer term. Before I get into the details of the GEP performance of quarter one, I\u2019d like to give a quick overview of the business and have it structured. GEP is comprised of three components I have different market dynamics. Two of these components are in the developed markets. First, Peri-LOE includes major brands have recently aloft or are approaching a lots of exclusivity. Such as, Celebrex, Lyrica in Europe, Zyvox, Pristiq and Detrol. Secondly legacy established products include mature off pattern products such as Lipitor and Novex and we also have targeted opportunities that exist in this product grouping. We expect to see a decline in both of these areas, featuring tense erosion from generic competition. However, we will continue to focus on growing the patterned brands prior to the loss of market exclusivity, as well as to optimize the transactions of brands to the off pattern stage and extend their life beyond LOE. The third component is the emerging markets including the BRIC-MT markets. This includes all GEP product sold in emerging countries and growth opportunities in emerging markets including the BRIC-MT\u2019s. This component is expected to grow steadily driven by favorable macro-economic and improving social-economic conditions in these countries. Growth opportunities represents fourth dynamic of the GEP business, that includes organic and inorganic initiatives such as partnerships product enhancements and are by similar portfolio spanning both developed and emerging markets. We anticipate these opportunities will drive revenue growth and legacy EP developed and emerging markets portfolios overtime. Now let\u2019s go to the GEP first quarter results. For this quarter GEP delivered revenues of $6 billion which represents of 10% decline operationally, the Peri-LOE products in developed markets experienced an overall decline of 17% operationally. Due to lots of exclusivity and subsequent multi store generic competition for Detrol LA in the U.S. and for Viagra in most European markets, as well as the determination of the co-promotion agreement for Aricept in Japan and the decline in our share of revenues resulting from the winder determination of this three our co-promotion agreement for certain markets. However it\u2019s important to note that certain pattern protected products have shown positive operational growth including Lyrica in Europe, Pristiq in the U.S. and developed international as well as Inspira in developed international markets. Our legacy established product in developed markets experienced a 10% operational decline from early due to the continued share erosion by generic versions of Lipitor in the U.S. in most developed international markets. The legacy emerging markets increased 1% operationally, growth was negatively impacted by certain onetime of shares under moving this operational growth would have been 4% driven by BRIC-MT markets. The growth opportunities increased 10% operationally driven primarily by contributions from the collaboration with Mylan to market generic drugs in Japan and Quillivant XR sales in the U.S. These growth opportunities performance is reflected in the previously mentioned operational results of legacy established products in the emerging markets components. The revive one final metric for how we measure GEP\u2019s underlying performance, expiring alliance product to LOE and Lipitor in developed markets. The operational revenue decline in the first quarter 2014 for the remaining 92% of GEP\u2019s portfolio was 2%, other post to 10% for the segment overall. I\u2019ll now walk you through a few additional highlights from GEP financials and we\u2019ll explains what it\u2019s driving some of the rations and how I see them revolving. In terms of the ratios, obviously speaking to our direct managed expenses relative to our revenues, income before taxes that is directly attributable to GEP was $4 billion in the first quarter 2014 or almost 68% of GEP\u2019s revenue. This represents and improvements of 1.7 percentage points on an operational basis. Our gross margin as $5 billion, or 83% of revenue this is representative of the portfolio profile of the GEP business that is mainly composed to pushed LOE on Peri-LOE brands with a smaller contribution from generics. As large brands with market exclusivity this gross margin will come under pressure. GEP, SINA expenses were $837 million in the quarter this represented a 20% operational decrease and it\u2019s primarily driven by the increased sale force expenses in the both develop and emerging markets, as well as resource allocation favoring higher growth opportunities within the emerging markets. This 20% reduction also reflects a favorable onetime item this quarter related to administrative expenses. We will continue make SI&A expense discipline a focus of the management of our business. The GEP R&D expenses for the quarter are 2.3% revenue and represent a 23% operational decline. This is the result of focused reductions in operational expenses, partially offset by higher spending for clinical trials associated with the development of our biosimilars portfolio. Moving forward we expect to increase investment in those assets that have entered and will enter Phase III. In summary, while GEP is expected to go through a period of revenue decline over the next few years primarily due to the LOEs of major brands in developed markets. We are focused on building our revenue base and stabilizing margins over the mid to longer term and following the period of anticipated LOEs we expect revenue growth to return other growth opportunities become a more substantial piece of the GEP business in the future. Thank you and I\u2019d now like to hand it back to Frank. Frank D'Amelio: Thanks, John. Now moving on to key takeaways our first quarter 2014 results were in line with our expectations with effective loss of exclusivity of certain products, the expiration in near term terminations of certain collaboration agreements and a continued challenging operating environment. We confirmed all components of our 2014 adjusted financial guidance which continues to reflect the full year contribution with Celebrex in the US, we\u2019re now operating under our new commercial structure and presentation of our financial results for the new structure provides transparency and to each of our global segments, with respect to our late stage R&D pipeline we achieved a statistically significant primary endpoint resulting in our PALOMA-1 Phase II breast cancer study of Palbociclib and began dosing patients for two Phase III breast cancer trials and we presented positive results of our CAPiTA trial which demonstrated Prevenar 13 prevented a first episode of vaccine type community acquired pneumonia in adults 65 years or older. We continue to create shareholder value through a prudent capital allocation. Today the 2014 we\u2019ve repurchased $1.7 billion or approximately 54.3 million shares and we continue to expect to repurchase $5 billion of our common stock this year. Finally we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2014 and beyond. Now I\u2019ll turn it back to Chuck. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Frank and I want to thank the audience for listening, I know the prepared remarks were longer than typical but given it was the first quarter with the new financials for the segments we wanted to give our business leaders some time to walk through their segments and the financials. We\u2019ll get ready for the Q&A session and I think I would just reiterate once more related to questions regarding AstraZeneca we will limitations placed on the responses by the UK takeover code. With that operator, if we could please poll for questions, thank you. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from ISI Group. Mark Schoenebaum : Good morning Frank thanks a lot for taking the question. If I could just throw one at you, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve gotten this in all kinds of one-on-one meetings, but it might be good just to address it again. You know the big concern I guess about the AZ deal or proposed deal is that you guys obviously think there\u2019s something wrong with Pfizer if Pfizer wasn\u2019t able to acquire AstraZeneca, so I was just wondering, Ian or Frank, if I could just get a general reaction to that. And then number two, the Street as I understand, it is currently modeling pretty dramatic revenue decreases for GEP as well as more modest decreases for GIP over the long term, and I heard in the prepared remarks you talked about a return to growth in GEP and I was just wondering if you could expand on that a little bit and help us out. I know you did a little bit, but I\u2019d appreciate some more color if possible. And then finally, an easy one for Frank, since you have 2013 segment information at least for the 1Q 13 in the press release, is there any chance that those numbers could be audited such that that would become year one? Thank you very much. Ian Read : Thank you Mark for your one question, you know I think we\u2019ve gone out of our way to say that this, I see this AZ deal as a way to accelerating an already good strategy. I think we\u2019ve gone at pains in this release to point out the exciting developments in our pipeline, the evolution of fixing of any core, the way we return value to shareholders, and so I definitely feel that we did this out of position of strength. In fact we having approached AZ in December and having received a negative from them in confidential conversations decided to wait until we had results of Palbociclib and adult vaccine, so that if we came back into the market it would be seen as we\u2019re coming back from a position of strength. So, you know we will continue to operate our business, continue to drive shareholder value and feel very confident about our standalone strategies. I\u2019m going to ask John to talk a little bit about GEP, and I believe it was interesting enough in GEP when you took out the loss of exclusivity or loss of the deal with Amgen you know and other small LOEs, it was 10% growth which is a really good growth in that area, solid in that area. John, regarding GEP. John Young : So, thanks for your question Mark, I think we\u2019ve -- certainly in my prepared remarks and in the meetings that we\u2019ve had with the analyst community, one of the things that we\u2019ve been very clear on is that we knew that in the short to medium term, we will see pressure on revenues as we experience losses of exclusivity from some of the major brands in our portfolio that are either already post LOE and are still coming under pressure, so brands would include Lipitor falling into that bucket or some of the major brands that we have in our portfolio that have yet to lose exclusivity but will do so over the coming few months and years, so brands like Lyrica in EU, like Celebrex in the U.S., like Zyvox and so on. So to be clear we certainly know that this is a business portfolio which will come under revenue pressure in the short to medium term. But in the medium to longer term we certainly see our revenues plateauing and having the opportunity to return to growth, and the underlying drivers for that opportunity that we see in the medium term would include our biosimilars portfolio. We believe we\u2019re going to have a strong biosimilars portfolio of we hope ultimately five biosimilars that we will aim to bring to market. Clearly, the landscape for that type of portfolio in the regulatory environment is still evolving, but we have regulators that have clarified the regulatory pathway. We actually believe that as a very positive opportunity for growth. And additionally, we see the opportunities for growth with this portfolio in some of the emerging markets including China as an example, but not limited to China, remain very positive. Our China business continues to perform well. And additionally, we see additional opportunities for growth with certain key partnerships such as Hisun in China and our Teuto partnership. So when we put all of those things together, whilst in the short to medium term we certainly will see continued pressure on revenues in the medium to long term, we do believe that this business does have a number of underlying factors which will enable us to return to growth in the medium to long term, so hopefully that answers your question Mark. Mark Schoenebaum : Thank you, Frank. Frank D'Amelio: And Mark, no change from what I\u2019ve said previous. 2014 year one, three years prospective audited financials, and I think the key here is remember audited financials require more than an income statement. They require a balance sheet, a cash flow statement, another comprehensive income statement, and the shareholders equity statement. So, no change from what I\u2019ve said previously. Chuck Triano : Thanks Frank. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. David Risinger : Thanks very much. Good morning, Ian and Frank, and the rest of the team. I just had two questions. First, with respect to Xeljanz obviously the competitive landscape will evolve down the line, but you\u2019ve talked about driving greater uptake, could you just comment on why you wouldn\u2019t consider discounting more to drive greater share? Obviously, the plans are using safety concerns to limit formulary adoption in an attractive Tier 2 status position, but really the plans obviously get tremendous rebates on Humira and Enbrel, so I guess I am just wondering how we should think about the pricing strategy for Xeljanz and if pricing can be a greater lever to driver greater uptake? And I guess just a follow on to that is since you\u2019ve asked for just one question, could you just update us on the once a day formulation development and filing timing? Thank you. Ian Read : Thank you, David. Geno could you take those questions? Geno Germano : Yes, and obviously Dave we\u2019re keenly aware of the kind of pricing and access and reimbursement environment for Xeljanz and then frankly in the whole class of biologics for RA and have run all the scenarios and frankly at this point in time we think the best thing to do is to continue to build on the positive profile that we\u2019re seeing with Xeljanz the data from our Phase III studies from our long term extension now we have the structured data in our label. We have positive outcomes from patient reported outcomes analysis and we think that that will give us the strength that we need with physicians and with payers to continue to grow the business. We saw a nice increase from fourth quarter of \u201913 to the first quarter this year with a 16% uptick in prescriptions and we continue to gather momentum. So we\u2019re feeling pretty good about that. With regard to the once a day we are putting the data together and I believe we\u2019re planning to file next year. Chuck Triano : Thanks Geno. Next question please operator? Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Chris Schott : Great, thanks very much, and I appreciate all the business unit details it\u2019s very helpful to understand the company here. So two questions, the first was if you actually split your business into three standalone entities can you quantify how much more operating expense or dyssynergy the company would incur I think which would be a helpful data point as the street looks to value your various business units? My second question is just managing the company in this business structure it\u2019s been four months. Maybe the business unit leaders could you just talk about what they\u2019re finding in terms of the strategy and expense structure of the business. I guess my question is should we think about are there incremental cost cutting or updated strategic priorities for one of more of these units over time as the new management teams kind of further review their franchises or is everybody pretty comfortable in terms of how the business that they\u2019re positioned today and how they\u2019re being managed? Thanks very much. Ian Read : So Chris on this idea of three segments I think I would sort of withdraw the market to the view that there are actually two major segments inside the company. There is an innovative core and there is an Established Products and as we look to the future optionality, I'll be more focused on that and looking at multiple businesses with multiple dissynergies. So we don't really think there's any material dissynergies, if these businesses were to be standalone or these two segments, in fact, we think that management focus overcomes those types of dissynergies. And on the, sort of getting at this stage given we've taken so long with prepared remarks, I'm really going to just say that I think we feel that we've laid by our opening comments the major strategies of these businesses and during the year it will be ample time I think for the business unit leaders to have conversations with you. Frank, do you want to add something to that? Frank D'Amelio: Yeah. Just a couple of quick things on the first point, Ian on the standalone to respond to Chris. Chris, we gave you all the detail we could relative to kind of the direct managed and then the allocated piece with the big chunks of the allocated piece being research and development through PAC, medical and then corporate centers, so finance, IT, those kinds of functions. In terms of hypothetically, if they were separate companies, there'd be some incremental cost, right? There's one CFO in the company today. They'd each need their own CFO and they'd each need their own General Counsel. So, there'd be those kinds of incremental costs. Then, we didn't assign any of the interest expense or the interest income to the businesses either. We left it out of the allocation. So, there's some items clearly that would be incremental if they were to be standalone but to Ian's point, I don't think there's anything that would be really material to those being standalone. Ian Read : That\u2019s correct. Well, our next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin : Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs : Just a couple. On Prevnar 13, you had mentioned that the next ACIP meeting is June. What are the potential outcomes of that meeting? I would assume that the most realistic outcome given the results of CAPiTA would be that the, the Prevnar 13 would be included in the 65 and older mandated vaccination schedule, if you could confirm that? And then, just one other question or rather two other questions on the new business structure. Ian, how does the business development process work in the context of the new structure? So, if VOC wants to make an acquisition or GIP or GEP, I may have gotten those wrong, wanted to make acquisitions, are they competing with each other for capital? How do you assess which of the three groups get capital to make acquisitions? And just finally Frank, I noticed when you broke down the three businesses that there is a very large R&D expense, $896 million allocated under Other. How do we think about that Other business? How do we allocate that across the three businesses? Ian Read : Well, Jami, thank you for the questions. I'm going to just answer the Prevnar 13, because I think we're -- to say -- we took a long time in the prepared remarks, they will consider in June. Normally, the usual practice is for ACIP to have two meetings, one to debate and then the second meeting they would vote on. They may decide to short-step that in June and both discuss and vote but the normal pattern would be a discussion in June and then a vote in October. Albert do you want to add anything to that or is that fine? Albert Bourla : That's fine. It's not unprecedented what they have done it one\u2026 Ian Read : It's unprecedented -- we're working with them. The data was really good, but we're working with the agencies as hard as we can to get them to see and get excited about this data. On BD, how it works is? That there is a corporate cost of capital and BD is run corporately, in essence each business unit will have projects that they bring forward to the corporation. Competition for capital is not necessarily -- we're not necessarily limited in capital. There's a competition for good ideas and best returns. And I think the most important thing of this structure is that it puts the business leaders on the accountability side of the projects they want to get funding for. So I think it clears up and makes it very, very -- it's good governance that inside the company now, a BUD that says I want to do this project and I stand by it and I'm a champion by it and the accountability attached is which I think brings a great judgment and a great discipline to capital allocation. Frank, do you want to add anything to that? Frank D'Amelio: No. I was going to answer Jami's third question on the ecos, I don't have anything to add on the business dev point. Jami, I think, the best way for me to explain this is to point you into the certain pages of the release and just quickly walk you through it, if that's okay. So, if you go to Chart number 18, you'll see up on the top quarter ended March 30th, 2014,and there's a column called Other and in that column called Other, there's an R&D expense line which amounts to $896, which is the number you quoted. If you go to the next page and you go to the tables on the bottom, but the one higher up on Page 19 you'll see the $896 off to the far right column and then you'll see the breakdown of that between the different organizations. Then if you go to the next page and you go to the table again, but the bottom three numbers, you'll see in the last number there, research and development expenses and you see how we give percentage ranges to drive at each of the BU. So we try to provide drill down for you all so you could see how we take the numbers and then how we drill them down and we gave you ranges of allocation to enable to you to do that by position. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Holford from Jefferies. Jeff Holford : Thanks for taking my question. I don\u2019t know what to answer this to, but obviously AstraZeneca in terms of its statements has pushed back around valuation to mix of cash and equity and also execution risk. Would characterize conversations you\u2019ve had with shareholders voicing similar concerns or perhaps there is a slight different perception as you go around asking about that? And just another side question, just on GEP, I wonder if you could breakdown the current R&D spending in terms of what would be on newer projects such as biosimilars and what might be associated most of the older based business products? Thank you. Ian Read : We listen to the shareholders and we thought it was a compelling offer which fully valued AZ and we\u2019re waiting commentary back or further commentary back from AZ. On the R&D I\u2019m giving you quite a lot of statistics in the backup pages for you to allocate R&D, but perhaps John, do you want to make a couple of comments on the main sort of around spending gap? John Young : Yes. Obviously, the precedent we don\u2019t sort of go into detail on the sort of breakdown of R&D expenses in overall. I think what I\u2019ve mentioned, Jeff, in my sort of opening comments, is that, that obviously includes operational expenses for the business unit as a whole and also includes the expenses for the development of the biosimilars portfolio. I think at this point that\u2019s probably is as much detail as I can give. Operator : Your next question comes from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink. Seamus Fernandez : So first question for Frank and then the second question is actually on Prevnar 13. Frank, can you just talk about your cash and borrowing capacity and remind us what your current reading is and what the difference in the borrowing costs might be from the current rating to a single step down in the rating? Then separately as we think about Prevnar 13 and the adult indication, obviously there has been quite a bit of impressive data already accrued in terms of the herd immunity that we have already seen presented to the ACIP. I am just wondering, if you could help us understand that in terms of the evaluation of Prevnar 13 particularly in international markets and the willingness for national immunization programs to pay for the adult indication? Then just a last question on Prevnar 13, the ACIP also reviewed a possibility of a three dose schedule for Prevnar 13. Can you just update us quickly on how a three dose schedule might actually evolve or if that\u2019s a very unlikely situation or if the product is already being used mostly at a three dose schedule? Ian Read : Okay, so I will ask Frank to answer the cash and borrowing and costs and then will ask Albert to take the Prevnar adult and the ACIP three dose question. Frank D\u2019Amelio: So Seamus let me start with on the current ratings with S&P - I\u2019ll do long-term ratings first; S&P were AA. Moody\u2019s were A1, Fitch were an A plus. On the short-term ratings with S&P we\u2019re at A1 plus, with Moody\u2019s we\u2019re at P1, with Fitch we\u2019re in F1. In terms of cash and borrowing capacity, the end of last year [audio gap] dollars, obviously given that, given our ratings, we have a significant amount of borrowing capacity and in terms of a change in rating, well that due to our borrowing cost. Obviously, you got to make assumptions without notches, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019d be any material notch change. So whatever changes they were would not be material. And quite frankly, if you look at the capital markets these days and investment grade paper it\u2019s a very favorable market. Albert Bourla : Let me start first with the herd effect and then I will speak about the dosing schedule. While Prevnar 13 has led to substantial reduction in the incidence of pneumococcal disease, the residual disease burden in the U.S. and globally is still significant. Even a decade after the introduction in the infant program, in U.S. alone, there are 440,000 cases of non-bacterial pneumococcal pneumonia. They account for 300,000 hospitalizations, 200,000 emergency room visits, and unfortunately 90,000 deaths. And globally, WHO has also similar estimation. 600,000 to 800,000 adult annual deaths due to septa caused pneumonia which is the leading cause of cough. We need to understand that the scientific community and us of course do not regard the herd effect as an alternative to direct vaccination. So in summary, we believe that the vaccination with Prevnar 13 represents a compelling value proposition for healthcare systems around the world. Moving now on the dose schedule. First of all, we support the continued scientific exchange on the topic, but having said that, we have a vaccine schedule in the U.S. that has demonstrated success, and we believe that this clinically proven FDA approved CDC recommended four dose schedule is the optimal way to protect the U.S. infants and young children from pneumococcal disease and also we believe there are no data in the U.S. population to make a decision to divert from this four dose schedule, that it is proven to be so successful. Ian Read : Thank you, Albert. From my point of view and I think from society's point of view, the Prevenar 13 vaccination schedule delivers considerable value and we see that value to society in the overall treatment and don't necessarily really look at it as a per dose cost. It's more an overall value delivered by the protection. Mike, do you want to add a little bit about the herd effect? Mikael Dolsten : Albert described it very well and I could just comment, kind of one clinical aspect, what we learned in Netherlands is that when we typed the serotypes from the pneumonia and IPD cases, which was possible by a proprietary assay that we have developed, it was nicely shown that a significant fraction, about a quarter of the cases requires to serotypes from the regional Prevenar to 7-valent which clearly shows that although there has been immunization, there is a residual serotypes remaining in the population and herd effect is not sufficient to protect. Finally, I just want to add a medical aspect that - with increasing age you're more susceptible to severe outcomes and increased fatality, first by age, underlining the importance that Albert alluded to, to get the campaign rather earlier than later in adults for protection. Operator : Your next question comes from John Boris from Suntrust. John Boris : Thanks for taking the question. Just first question is for Frank, when we look retrospectively at the last big breakup that we had which was Abbott spinning off AbbVie, when we look back at that transaction there was some dilution that was associated with it. By our math, the breakup of the two companies was about 15% dilutive in retrospect to what the separate companies would have earned if they'd stayed as one. In this instance, you're breaking up into three. What is the potential dilutive effect operationally and potentially from any tax leakage by breaking the entity up into three different businesses? Second question, just for Ian, you indicated in your opening comments that once you had the palbo data and the Prevenar data that, that positioned you at least from a position of strength to be able to go back to AZN. Is your assumption that on palbo that you'll be able to file in '14 and then launch in '15 and are you assuming you're going to get a universal vaccination recommendation on Prevenar going forward, and is that the position of strength that you're coming at this from? Ian Read : Thank you, you know on this whole issue of Abbott and AbbVie, we really can't comment on how they went about restructuring and what expenses they incurred and what dilution they incurred. I do believe though just from memory that, that, I think if you took the value of the two separate companies after they did this and you stripped out general market movement, they still created many billions of dollars of value. So, I think that's a more important issue than the dilution or the small incremental cost of the separate companies. By the way, as I've tried to reemphasize, John, we are not talking about -- if we are -- there's no decision been taken regardless of separating these companies, and certainly, we are not talking about of three or four ways split, we are talking about two major segments, just to emphasize that. On this question of yours on position of strength, I was not trying to assume any action on the part of the FDA or the ACIP panel, I was just talking about the strength of the data and the data is compelling and that one would expect the marketplace to follow the data. So thank you for the question. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Sanford Bernstein. Tim Anderson : Thank you, couple of questions that are both merger related. What things do you think that a merged Pfizer and Astra can do better than Astra alone? In other words, what do you see as potential weaknesses of Astra standalone business either in terms of product mix or R&D abilities or geographic positioning or anything else? Then, I want to go back to a question I asked on the call you guys did last week just to confirm or reconfirm Pfizer's intentions assuming it acquires Astra, is it again most likely that you would take the post-merger entity and eventually split it up completely into separate publically traded companies because it's kind of a different story if the answer to that is no. So, I guess I am just looking for some continued assurances here and not promises but rather what's most likely or is there something about in version and re-domiciling in the U.K. that would make a full split-up like that more difficult? Ian Read : Yes. So I think if you look from our point of view, if you look at AZ and it's my view not their view, so I am talking of my view of their strategy, not their view of their strategy that they have had a strategy of confronted with massive LOEs. They have gone out and they have licensed in and brought in lots of products from other companies. In fact, most of their pipeline is licensed in products with very few developed nationally. But -- so we look at that and we look it to fit with our portfolio, especially immune Oncology area, where they have assets which standalone or probably coming late to the market, but if they were combined with our portfolio, I think it strengthened their portfolio substantially. And then when you look at their products, they fit into our categories. So we believe that with our marketing presence and our ability in those categories, we can make more out of those products that they can standalone. But the power of this deal for us is these three components, it\u2019s the fit on the portfolio; it's a nice fit with the early pipeline, but it's not a pipeline story per se. It's also a removing of overlaps and making the organization more efficient. And I do believe you\u2019re seeing, you will continue to see a trend in the industry towards as governments pressurize on access and pricing, they are really telling the industry you need to get more efficient, you need to bring to market higher value products at a lower cost and there are ways -- different ways of doing that, there\u2019s internal improvements in your efficiencies which Pfizer has done and been very effective at. There is asset swaps as you saw going on between GSK and Novartis, which also gets to -- getting companies to remove overlaps or there is industry consolidation which -- this would be an example of that. And then the third component of value here which is really important for Pfizer is its ability to free the balance sheet up and get our tax rate down, which would enable a lot of different strategies. And so all three of these elements are important, I've been asked would you do it if you didn't have this part or you didn't have that part? I mean the answer is I'm doing it because I have all three parts and it strengthens our strategy right now and creates I believe compelling shareholder value. I would say on your other question that we are interested in preserving optionality that we've set up. We would see the integration of AstraZeneca with Pfizer along the way that we are organized. We would preserve that optionality. We would focus on managing those businesses as efficiently as possible and no decision has been taken about the future as there's been no decision taken about our businesses at this moment in time, but we would conserve that optionality. Chuck Triano : Thank you, Ian. Next question please. Operator : You next question come from Marc Goodman from UBS. Marc Goodman : There\u2019s couple of things. First, you had mentioned last time on the call about palbo that you were going to be meeting with the FDA. I just wanted to know if that meeting actually had taken place, if you have it scheduled yet. I was a little unclear about your comments on palbo there. Second, the meningitis B vaccine, when will we see the data? And then three, on biosimilars can you just remind us of when will we start to see data from the studies there, these pivotal Phase IIIs and filings start to occur? Thanks. Ian Read : Okay. Thank you. On palbo, it is scheduled. It is extremely imminent and once we've had that meeting and once we have any confirmation from the FDA, we will let you know, but we're still in discussions with the FDA. On Mening B, I don't know who's the best here -- Mikael, do you have the data or there\u2019s\u2026? Mikael Dolsten : Yeah. I can just mention that, we are in the process of sharing data at conferences. It includes experiences from our Phase I, Phase II and dosing schedules and also they're recording data, strong data on combining Mening B with vaccines that are used in these age groups, such as GARDASIL or the typical adolescence vaccines, different schedules in Europe and U.S., hence we would present soon at the European Society for Paediatric Infectious Diseases and later in this fall, corresponding U.S. presentation too. Ian Read : Thank you. John, biosimilars? John Young : So, we'll get back to you with some specifics on our plans for presentation of the data. I mean, just to remind you, we have two of our portfolio, which are in Phase III, we have rituxumab, which initiated a Phase III or initiates Phase III in second half of this year. We have trastuzumab where Phase III has already been initiated. So, rituxumab will go into Phase III in second half of the year, trastuzumab is already there. So, it'll be some time before we see the readout of those studies, but we'll get back to you separately in regard to your question about when any plans to present any other of our Phase I data. Ian Read : Yeah. Thank you and I would say internally that Mikael is very satisfied with the profile that we're exhibiting and the ability to say that is biosimilar and we're very pleased with the science we have and the capabilities around this development area. Chuck Triano : Right. We can move to the next question. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen. Steve Scala : Thank you. I have three brief one. First, why is stage R&D such a high percent of the total, 56% of R&D is unallocated to any division, which seems high versus your peers. Second is there still uncertainty around Celebrex U.S. sales from May 30th to the end of the year given the settlements? And then lastly, Ian, are you willing to give any assurances of limited R&D cuts in U.S. like you did in the U.K.? Thank you. Ian Read : Thank you. Could we do, first of all the -- yes, the early stage and the allocation algorithm there and then dub you on through the uncertainty? Frank D\u2019Amelio: So, I think the best way to answer this Steve is the way we manage the organization, which is all of the post-POC R&D spend is in the business units, the new operating segments, the pre-POC R&D spend. So all the discovery, the research up and through inclusive of POC is in Mikael Dolsten\u2019s organization WRD. That\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing in the other column. That\u2019s really what\u2019s driving that. So that\u2019s why you get the split that we currently have. Geno Germano : Yes, so on Celebrex both Mylan and Actavis have sued the FDA having concluded that FDA will give Teva, 180 days exclusivity. They believe that unless the courts overseeing those suits rule in Mylan and Actavis\u2019 favor and change FDA\u2019s ruling that Teva is going to have exclusivity. We previously settled with Teva and as part of that settlement the earlier stage Teva can launch December 2014 their exclusivity would begin then. Ian Read : Frank do you want to add to that? Frank D\u2019Amelio: Just -- and I should have mentioned partner alliance too, regulatory toxicology all those kinds of things Pharm Sci are all in that other column as well. Ian Read : So, on your question about the integration of the two companies, I think we\u2019ve made some commitments to the combined Company\u2019s presence in the U.K. and we clearly will stay with a massive presence in the U.S. as a combined Company. Operator : The next question comes from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Vamil Divan : On the VOC unit, Albert, you mentioned these are really three different businesses kind of blended into one. Can you just talk about that one specifically in terms of the synergies and overlaps you see that may give or probably keep them all as one unit as opposed to being structured maybe differently? And then second just on the consumer side, you\u2019ve highlighted the news around Nexium 24HR always have some displaying news for your singular potential being in OTC product, just given your -- you\u2019ve been generally bullish on the Rx OTC switch opportunity, how important do you see to have consumer business internally to be able to profit from that opportunity as opposed to maybe do alliances with other companies that might have consumer if you didn\u2019t have one yourself? Ian Read : Vamil, thank you for the questions. First question remind me again was on\u2026 Vamil Divan : The three separate\u2026 Ian Read : Well, look, see, these units are independent global units that are run basically separately. I think any type of -- and Albert is a very experienced business leader and has three division heads reporting to him. Any type of synergies between those businesses is more of the nature of managerial talent and leveraging strategies across great leaders and not really address towards synergizing the operational infrastructure those businesses, as all these things, they are global and they have their own culture and their own focus which is part of the reason why we made them global businesses. On the other side, from the point of view of the corporation, consumer business is an important business for us. We see there\u2019s a great store of value. We\u2019ve made acquisitions in that business, and the OTC strategy is a component of the value of that business. But we are not just managing that business only because we have an OTC strategy. We see acquisitions as part of that strategy and switches and organic growth and freshness index in the business and continuing to make sure that business grows. Thank you for the question. Unidentified Company Representative : And we have time for our last question please, operator. Operator : Your final question comes from Alex Arfaei fro BMO Capital Markets. Alex Arfaei : Ian at one point would you consider going directly to the AstraZeneca shareholders. You mentioned a premium that you are offering plus as well as your disappointment by the company\u2019s lack of engagement. Then on the pipeline and approaching AstraZeneca from a position of strength, other than palbo and Prevnar 13 in adults, what are the other key assets that you believe may not be adequately appreciated by the Street? Thank you. Ian Read : We\u2019ve made public our offer to the Board. We remain considering all our options on how we progress these discussions. I think on our -- you are talking about our pipeline, I think you have got PCSK9 which is we will arrive at the market, we expect roughly at the same time as the other major competitors in that with outcomes data. We have palbo, we have all the trials around palbo, Prevnar 13 adult. We have got the mening B. We have got the SGLT2 ertugliflozin with Merck. We have the Xeljanz life extensions around that. Around that continuing growth in Eliquis, continuing growth in Xeljanz, continuing growth in Oncology portfolio and in Inlyta and Xalkori, some very good fast following products in Oncology that could come to market, given we think they are very differentiated. So frankly opportunities abound inside our Company both from the inline portfolio, the emerging markets opportunities, the pipeline recent launches and to be launched and then if you look at the sort of across of vaccines, Oncology and give a very nice portfolio of unique opportunities. So, as I say, we're doing this because we see an opportunity create additional value from this acquisition or combination not because we feel any negativity towards our present strategy which we feel is very strong. Okay, thank you. Chuck Triano : Thank you everybody for your time today. Frank D'Amelio: Thanks everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Pfizer's first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer's 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. Discussion during the call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's current report on Form 8-K dated today. We will now make prepared remarks and then we will move to a question and answer session. With that, I will now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian? Ian Read : Thank you Chuck and thank you all for joining our call this morning. I will begin with some brief comments from the quarter. Overall we saw good performance and strong operational growth in a number of areas including Lyrica in developed markets, Prevnar primarily in the U.S. and in emerging markets and Celebrex worldwide. Our recently launched brands are making solid gains. Eliquis grew sequentially 50% quarter-on-quarter on a global basis while Xeljanz posted sequential growth quarter roughly 30% primarily in the U.S. With the continuation of this momentum these products are on a trajectory to become meaningful contributors to our underlying business in the coming quarters. We also are looking continued uptake with Xalkori and Inlyta globally. Revenues in our consumer business increased 15% operationally primarily due to the recent launch of Nexium 24HR in the U.S. in late May. We also saw strong companywide performance within the emerging markets, revenue increased 11% operationally compared to the year ago quarter driven by growth in China, Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil. Despite to somewhat slower start to the year, each of our businesses is performing well in the face of ongoing product losses of exclusivity for innovative businesses and continued pricing pressures and changing market dynamics effecting our established business. I would also point out the negative impact of LOEs and the revenue loss resulting from the exploration of some co-promoted revenues was 1.7 billion for the first six months. This impact mass the companywide operational revenue growth from all other products during the first half of the year which was 3% overall. In evaluating our performance now that we have been operating in our new commercial model since the beginning of the year, I believe this structure is providing greater transparency into the operations of each business and on a daily basis it enables decision making that better optimizes the performance and portfolio of each of our segments. Furthermore we remain encouraged by key developments that demonstrate our pipeline momentum. Of particular note, we expect to complete the submission of the palbociclib new drug application to the FDA in August. This submission is based on the final result of PALOMA-1, a randomized, Phase 2 trial comparing the combination of palbociclib plus letrozole versus letrozole alone as the first line treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogen positive HER2 negative advanced breast cancer. We will publically communicate once we\u2019ve completed our submission. Also of note, our Phase III palbociclib trials in advanced breast cancer PALOMA-II and PALOMA-III are progressing and both trials have completed recruitment of new patients. In addition, the number of Phase III studies where we are collaborating with leading international breast cancer investigators are open and enrolling patients with both advanced and early breast cancer and we have active exploration underway of multiple Phase I and II studies in non-breast indications. Given the outbreaks of meningitis B disease on several US college campuses in 2013, we work closely with the FDA to submit our biologics license application for accelerated approval of our meningitis B vaccine for the prevention of meningococcal disease and in adolescent to young adults. We look forward to the meeting that adjusted the scheduled to take place on August 13th by the CDC Advisory committee on immunization practices ACIP to discuss and vote on a potentially expanded recommendation for Prevnar 13 use in adults. We had a comprehensive Xeljanz program that is progressing with Phase III studies underway and you see in psoriatic arthritis and Phase II studies in psoriasis for top reviews, Crohn\u2019s disease and ankylosing spondylitis. We continue to enroll patients in Phase III trials of bococizumab for cholesterol lowering and high risk individuals, the total flows into the treatment of diabetes and later this year we expect to begin enrolling patients for the Rapunzel for the treatment of vaso-occlusive crises individuals of sickle cell anemia. As we ended the second half of this year, our strategy, focus and priorities remain unchanged, supported by the steady performance of each of our commercial segments. When it comes to business development, we will continue to evaluate all opportunities regardless of the size through the lens of value creation for our shareholders and enhancing the competitors of our businesses. Our most recent announced acquisitions and collaborations are example to enablers of our strategy. We expect far more meaningfully increase the size of our sterile injectable business through their existing and out licensed portfolios sterile injectables as well as the medium and long-term through the potential of their pipeline. And if we see promising result as we move forward with the selector\u2019s collaboration to develop immune therapies against select [indiscernible] oncology, we believe it has the potential for changing the way cancer is treated. In summary, for the remainder of this year, we will be focused on executing our plans and taking the actions that will further strengthen and globally position us as the market leader in each of our business segments. We remain committed to advancing innovative therapies on behalf of patients we serve, prudently managing deploying capital, to drive the greatest value for our shareholders and creating a culture within the organization where [indiscernible] creatively take prudent risk in operating with an entrepreneurial mindset. I will now turn it over to Frank to take you through the financial details of the quarter. Frank D'Amelio: Thanks Ian and good day everyone. As always the charts we are reviewing today are included in our webcast. As a reminder, because of the focused position of Zoetis on June 23, 2013, the financial results of the animal health business and the gain associated with its fully disposition are reported as a discontinued operation in the consolidated statements of income for the second quarter and first six months of 2013. Now let\u2019s move on to the financials. Second quarter 2014 revenues of approximately 12.8 billion decreased 2% year-over-year, reflecting a 1% negative impact from foreign exchange to an operational decline of approximately 1% driven mainly by the expiration on October the 31, 2013 of the co-promotion terms for Enbrel in U.S. and Canada, the ongoing terminations and expirations of the Spiriva collaboration in certain countries, the loss of exclusivity is subsequent to multi-sourced generic competition for Detrol LA in the U.S. and other product losses of exclusivity in various markets. These were partially offset by the strong operational growth in developed markets of Lyrica, Nexium 24HR in the U.S., Prevnar, Eliquis, Xeljanz, Celebrex, Xalkori and Inlyta and by strong operational growth of 11% in emerging markets. In addition reported revenues included 71 million transitional manufacturing and supply agreements with Zoetis. I want to point out LOEs in declining alliance revenues had a negative impact of approximately $840 million, during the quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.68 increased 4% primarily due to fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding due to ongoing share repurchases and the impact of the Zoetis exchange offer which were partially offset by a 4% aggregate operational increase and adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A, adjusted R&D expenses resulting from an unfavorable shift in product mix and recently initiated Phase III programs for bococizumab, ertugliflozin, palbociclib and the meningitis B vaccine and for the studies of Xeljanz and certain other products and potential new indications. However, adjusted SI&A expenses decreased because of continued benefits from cost reduction productivity initiatives. Reported diluted EPS of $0.45 compared with the $1.98 in the year ago quarter was primarily due to the non-recurrence in the second quarter 2014 of income from discontinued operations in the year ago quarter attributable to the animal health business including the gain associated with its disposition and the income in the year ago quarter from a litigation settlement for patent-infringement damages. And to a lesser extent the LOE from the exploration of the co-promotion term of certain products, all of which were partially offset by lower acquisition related cost, purchase accounting adjustments, and asset impairment charges. A lower effective tax rate due to the resolution in the second quarter of 2014 of certain prior year tax positions with various foreign tax authorities, a favorable change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings and the non-recurrence of the unfavorable impact of the tax rate associated with the aforementioned patent litigation settlement income and finally fewer shares outstanding. Foreign exchange negatively impacted second quarter revenues by 1% or 87 million that had a net positive impact of 18 million on the aggregate of adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses. Consequently, foreign exchange negatively impacted adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.01 compared with a year ago quarter. Now moving onto the financial highlights of our businesses, in second quarter Global Innovative Pharmaceuticals revenues decreased 5% operationally year-over-year due to the previously mentioned exploration of the co-promotion term for Enbrel in the U.S. and Canada and the loss of exclusivity for Lyrica in Canada in February of 2013. And the exploration of the co-promotion term for Enbrel and LOEs of certain products resulted in an operational decline of $459 million; however, all other GEP revenues grew 9% operationally driven by strong growth from Lyrica primarily in the U.S. and Japan as well as the performance of recently launched products including Eliquis globally and Xeljanz primarily in the U.S. Income before taxes declined 12% operationally due to the decrease in revenues, a 5% operational increase in cost of sales or a 1.2 percentage point increase as a percentage of revenues. I want to point out here that the loss of Enbrel alliance revenues in the second quarter 2014 negatively impacted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues by 1.5 percentage points operationally, 13% operational increase in SI&A expenses from an increased investment in new products and in line brands such as Lyrica and Viagra as well as a 41% operational increase in R&D expenses due to recently initiated Phase 3 programs for bococizumab, ertugliflozin, and additional Xeljanz indications. In the second quarter, revenues from our vaccines, oncology and consumer healthcare business grew 15% operationally year-over-year due to the strong operational growth of Prevnar 13 in the U.S. and emerging markets, the launch of Nexium 24HR in the U.S. in late May 2014 and the continued strong uptake of Xalkori and Inlyta globally. Income before taxes increased 10% operationally due to increased revenues, which were partially offset by a 23% operational increase in cost of sales driven by increased sales volumes in unfavorable change in product mix, an 18% operational increase in SI&A expenses associated with the launch of Nexium 24HR and the prelaunch marketing expenses to the meningitis B vaccine palbociclib. And the 16% increase in R&D expenses supporting the acceleration of the meningitis B vaccine at palbociclib development programs. The second quarter Global Established Pharmaceuticals revenues decreased 5% operationally year-over-year due to the loss of exclusivity and subsequent launch of multi-source generic competition for Detrol LA in the U.S. January 2014, Viagra in most European markets in June of 2013, and Aricept in Canada in December of 2013 as well as the ongoing termination of the co-promotion agreement for Spiriva in most countries including the U.S. in April and the ongoing exploration in certain other countries. These were partially offset by the strong operational performance of Celebrex in most major markets, Lyrica in Europe and Lipitor primarily in China. The LOEs of certain products, the loss of alliance revenue for Aricept and Spiriva and Lipitor in developed markets negatively impacted GEP revenues by 395 million operationally; however, all other GEP revenues grew 1% operationally. Income before taxes declined 4% operationally due to the decrease in revenues was partially offset by the aggregate decrease, cost of sales, SI&A and R&D expenses which included increased spending on biosimilar development programs. Now moving onto our 2014 financial guidance, we've updated several components of our adjusted guidance and reaffirmed our 2014 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range. Because of the anticipated negative impact from the expected multi-source generic competition for Celebrex in the U.S. in December 2014 we now expect revenues to be in the range of 48.7 billion to 50.7 billion versus 49.2 billion to 51.2 billion. This range absorbs the negative impact of approximately 3.4 billion due to declining alliance revenues and expected product losses of exclusivity. In addition, we are decreasing our adjusted SI&A expense range due to an expected reduction in promotional spending for Celebrex in second half of 2014 and now expect adjusted SI&A to be in the range of 13.3 billion to 14.3 billion compared with 13.5 billion to 14.5 billion previously. To reflect the planned 80 million upfront payment to Cellectis for our global strategic collaboration and anticipated increased expenses for the acceleration of certain late-stage clinical programs including palbociclib and bococizumab among others, we now expect R&D expenses to be in the range of 6.7 to 7.2 billion versus 6.4 to 6.9 billion previously. We now expect approximately 200 million of other income versus approximately 100 million of other deducts because of lower expecting net interest expense for the remainder of 2014 and gains realized during the first half of 2014 mainly on sales of product rights and investments in equity securities. We expected reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.47 to a $1.62 due to charges related to certain legal matters primarily related to Neurontin incurred during the first quarter 2014. And we are reaffirming our 2014 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $2.20 to $2.30 which absorbs approximately $0.05 per share for anticipated negative impact related to Celebrex and $0.01 related to the planned upfront payment to the Cellectis collaboration. Now moving on to key takeaways, we recorded solid second quarter 2014 results. We reaffirmed our adjusted diluted EPS range which absorbs an approximately $0.05 anticipated negative impact related to Celebrex and $0.01 related to Cellectis. We achieved several key R&D milestones including the initiation for rolling submission in June 2014 of an NDA seeking approval for palbociclib which is expected to complete this August. In June we submitted a Biologics License Application to the FDA for our meningitis B vaccine candidate and we discussed with the ACIP at its June meeting a potential expanded recommendation for Prevnar 13 used with adults. We expect the ACIP\u2019s decision on August 13. We announced several business development opportunities to further strengthen our position in key strategic areas and we continue to create shareholder value through prudent capital allocation. To date 2014, we repurchased 2.9 billion or approximately 95.1 million shares and we continue to expect to repurchase 5 billion of our common stock this year. These repurchases and planned repurchases for the remainder of the year are expected to reduce total shares outstanding year-over-year by a total of approximately 100 million shares by the end of 2014 after considering actual and projected dilution related to employee compensation programs. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2014 and beyond. Now, I will turn it back to Chuck. Chuck Triano : Thank you, Frank. Operator, at this point can we call for questions. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Chris Schott : Great, thanks very much for the questions. Just two here. The first one on assumptions is the first time you've been at this recently but on business development, just how are you thinking about DDA at this point. I guess given the valuation research and pipeline recovery that\u2019s occurred within this space, is it more challenging to find larger deals that both advance the Pfizer story and give your investors (indiscernible) they are looking for? And the second question for the past year or so until the Astra approach that better focus on potential breakup of Pfizer based on your new corporate structure you are creating coupled with your pipeline recovery, can you update us on your thoughts on that potential split of Pfizer over time, has your view of breakup making potential sense making at all? And I guess do you still see merits in the idea of splitting the company over time? Thanks very much. Ian Read : Thank you for questions Chris. On BD, BD is not a strategy, it's an enabler strategy. We continue to aggressively look at all cuts of BD regardless of size that we believe would add value to shareholders. So, that our stance on BD and on this much discussed potential breakup as before, we are managing the business in two segments broadly speaking. One being innovative and the other being established. And in the innovative we have sub businesses like oncology and a consumer and vaccines that are very distinct from other parts of the innovative business. So, we are giving you transparency on those segments and we are collecting both P&L and balance sheet information to give us optionality. What we do eventually will really depend upon how those business perform, how our shareholders value those businesses and we will look at that after an appropriate period of time of both collecting the data we need for optionality and the performance in the marketplace. Thank you. Frank D'Amelio: The only thing I would add Chris to punctuate what Ian said is and I think for the time being and for the near future the most important thing those businesses can do is execute with excellence so that operational performance and that will create all kinds of options and choices for us in the future. Ian Read : And fundamentally I see BD is adding to what I see as a strong hand we have with our core strategies. Operator : Your next question comes from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Vamil Divan : Thanks for taking the question. Couple here. Again, I'm sure you've gotten some of these before as well. But one around the increased rhetoric in Washington around inversions. Would that impact, or is it impacting any way the way you look at doing an inversion-based deal in the future? And then the second one, just on the pipeline around Palbo, I think there's still a lot of questions. You said obviously you're going to file next month, a lot of questions around with what the FDA is going to do and really, why would the FDA approve it on an expedited basis when you'll be getting full Phase III data just a few months later? And so if you can give us any updates there around discussions you've had with the FDA and why the need to, again, just maybe take a little bit more of a risk to get this out just a few months ahead of the full data session. Thanks. Ian Read : In Washington, we remain committed to discussing and advocating for fundamental tax report. And that will play out with the political parties we suspect over the next coming years. And it\u2019s really difficult to comment more than that other than we do believe the tax system is inherently puts the companies at a disadvantage and we would like to see the tax system reformed. On palbo, I think there is some confusion as to when we get the final Phase III data, but I will ask to Albert to comment on the palbo submission. Albert Bourla : As you are aware, our submission is based on the final results for our Phase II trial and this has happened after conversations with FDA. I don\u2019t want to speculate what FDA will request as we go through the review process but I can tell you that until now, they have not placed any conditions on us related to the Phase III trial results. As we learn a little bit the Phase III has completed recruitment and it is expected to come to final completion at the end in December of 2015 and the final report would be available in 2016. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Sanford Bernstein. Tim Anderson : Just going back to M&A and I know you all probably struggle to answer this question, but in your prepared remarks, you said you would continue to evaluate all opportunities regardless of size. My question is whether it\u2019s reasonable to expect that Pfizer could find strategically attractive targets that are big enough such as tax conversion could be one of the benefits, so the operative here for me would be strategically attractive. Because I can think of other theoretical inversion targets but I am not sure I see the strategic value on those, I\u2019d like to get your opinion on that. And then on palbociclib in Europe, do you expect that PALOMA-1 will be adequate first submission or will regulatory authorities likely require at least interim Phase III results before proving kind of like a date with Xalkori? Ian Read : Why don\u2019t you take the palbo question and I will come back to the M&A? Albert Bourla : Look I mean as you can expect we have begun discussions with the European and other regulatory health authorities and those discussions are for palbociclib and those discussions include discussions on the clinical data. Also we have presented to them our development program and we have entered into discussions about the potential regulatory path forward. But it is too early to disclose at this stage, our regulatory strategy for these reasons. Ian Read : Thank you. And Tim on M&A, we look and continue to look at a very wide spectrum of M&A transaction, so we have substantial financial ability and balance sheet and tax inversion is one part of the value equation. I mean we're looking at AZ, we\u2019ve looked at both their pipeline the synergies and the tax inversion. So we will continue to look very broadly at deploying our capital in a way that makes sense for shareholder return. Operator : Your next question is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin : I know we are all kind of dancing around the same issue Ian but just on the assumption that AstraZeneca does not materialize, is there actually a plan B in place? What we have seen since then is a small acquisition InnoPharma and is that the kind of deals that we should anticipate going forward or is there still a plan in place to achieve a lower tax rate to enhance the pipeline? And then I don\u2019t know if Mikael Dolsten is on the call, but just a question on business development in out licensing activity. I mean we have seen recently a couple of high profile licensing deals, tremelimumab to AstraZeneca and neratinib to Puma and regrettably those look like a very unfortunate decisions and just Ian, are you working internally and are you pleased with the team that you have in place who are charged with making these critical decisions? Thanks very much. Ian Read : So on the BD, we looked at both those assets that you mentioned early on in their lifecycle and we looked at the opportunities with inside our portfolio and took decision given that they were lower -- we believe lower value assets to what we knew about those assets at the time to out license them. In the case of the Puma asset they acquired neratinib, we outlicensed this so what we looked at almost 10 companies and most of them major pharmaceutical companies. And the only company that was interested in this development was Puma. And as such, we were pleased with the outlicensing we struck with them and the royalty rate. I have not seen the data, nor has Pfizer seen the data that may or may not indicate that the product has value and we will be in discussions with Puma vis-\u00e0-vis our legal rights as to that data and the consequences of that data. On the tremelimumab, it was a decision to outlicense to AZ and I am not aware of any data that would make me believe that we made a mistake given the fact we had other products that we were developing of higher productivity value. Now with regard to plan B, my comment would be our plan A is a plan to continue to develop our innovative pipeline to restore the vigor in our pipeline. We're making progress with mid-and late-stage pipelines including Prevnar adult, palbociclib, bococizumab, ertugliflozin mening B and Xeljanz follow indications. We're continuing to grow on newly launched brands such as Eliquis, Xeljanz, Inlyta, Lyrica and Embrel. And we\u2019re focusing on the emerging markets, so plan A is to continue with the strategy we\u2019ve always articulated which is to re-vigor our innovative core, make our R&D productive, and make smart and shareholder friendly capital allocation decisions. Any BD that we do will be looked at for the view of accelerating those strategies and improving returns to shareholders and the deal that you are in a pharma and Cellectis are deals that are opportunistic and add on and we can build and help the underlying BUs, but certainly are not representative of the total firepower of corporate strategy of Pfizer. Frank do you want anything to that? Operator : Your next question come is from the John Boris from SunTrust Robinson. John Boris : First question for Frank, in 2013 and for the front half 2014, you returned a significant amount of cash through share repurchases and through dividends in both of those years, can you just remind us what the total amount that you returned and how much cash that you have to bring back offshore to be able to fund your share repurchase and your dividend from offshore? Second question for Ian on large scale versus tuck-in type acquisitions, if you look at your U.S. operation which is traditionally the most profitable operation as a major pharma, it seems with ongoing losses of exclusivity and losses of alliance revenue that that operation seems to be under a fair amount of pressure, you do have some pipeline assets that you\u2019re successfully launching through there, but is the scale of what you\u2019re launching large enough to be able to offset some of those pressures that you have from continued losses of exclusivity losses of alliance revenue? And then on your established products business traditionally you\u2019ve had a lot of success bringing in injectable assets into that business but on a global basis is it of scale where you have the regulatory capabilities needed to be able to successfully launch other types of assets on a global basis through that strategically? Thanks. Ian Read : Thank you, John. Frank, do you want to take the first question? Frank D'Amelio: Sure. So John just in terms of running the numbers, last year we returned 23 billion to our shareholders between share buybacks and dividends. The buyback piece of that was 16.3 billion. This year the buyback piece year-to-date is 2.9 billion. If you look our dividend on an annual basis, we got on average call it 6.4 billion, 6.5 billion shares at above full dividend, and call that 6.5 billion to 7 billion so from midyear piece of that to another 3 billion, 3.5 billion. And then if you look by the way just in terms of numbers, if you look over the last three years \u201911, \u201912, and \u201913, we returned about 53 billion to our shareholders in terms of buybacks and dividends. In terms of major way we have funded that as then through some our unlocking value activities. So we sell Capsugel the cellular nutrition and we exchange for Zoetis. So those are three of the ways we have done that and obviously through very effective and efficient tax plan. Ian Read : Thank you, Frank. On your question about scale of the innovative business, obviously your question goes to the strategic issue we\u2019ve been dealing with as we\u2019re trying take care of the LOEs while trying to minimize revenue decreases while growing our EPS, and I think we've been doing a good job of doing that while we manage the sort of onslaught of LOEs with EPS growth. So, it comes down to with the question of the growth of Lyrica, the growth of Eliquis, the growth of Xeljanz, the adult vaccine, the mening B, the Xeljanz follow ons. What is the extent of growth we can get from that while we continue and of course palbociclib and when it launches that compared to the LOEs plus the growth we can get out of them as you market, so it\u2019s a very good question. We feel that our strategy is the right one. We will continue to be challenged on revenue growth that we see that we can manage through this cycle through those products I just mentioned and behind that we see a wave of very exciting products coming as we get through the LOEs. On EP I would ask John to comment. John Young : Okay so thanks for the question, John its sterile injectable. And I think maybe the first point to make is that we actually have a very strong sterile injectable business globally not only in the U.S. But one of the features of the market overall is actually is pretty concentrated and thereabout five markets globally that probably represent about 80% of the total profit pool and sterile injectable. The US is obviously one of those markets but the other markets would include China, Japan, France and Italy. It was actually more concentrated that you would think and I think the answer to your question as we actually feel very confident about the underlying capabilities that we have particularly in regulatory affairs could be able to bring to market products in that portfolio either products that we're developing organically or hopefully in the future pending completion of the acquisition of InnoPharma products that would come out of the pipeline outside of that company. Ian Read : I would add John, our established products, our international presence is probably the strongest of the American company and certainly on the power of any of the Europeans, they had great strength broadly speaking in emerging markets with a number one multinational in China. I\u2019m very confident we have the talent, the distribution and the know how to fully leverage our products globally. Thank you for the question. Operator : Your next question is from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. David Risinger : Yes, thanks very much. I have two strategic questions and then one cost question. So, on the first two, number one I was just wondering if you could provide feedback that you received on the final offer of 55 for AstraZeneca that you received from major investors? And second, are you considering other major tax redomiciling transactions and then with respect to net cost obviously Pfizer continues to cut costs but also needs to reinvest. So, beyond 2014 Frank, should we think about Pfizer being able to reduce net cost in terms of selling and general administrative and R&D or at the end of this year will you be at the point of essentially looking at flattish cost or rising cost going forward? Thank you. Ian Read : So, now you see, you understand I can\u2019t make any forward looking statements on AZ, I would like to put in context of I believe inflations already been reported. We were faced with the AZ management with an indication that they would not engage with us in a meaningful way unless we had an opening of approximately 59 pound. Faced with that, we made report was a full and final offer of 55 pound that fully valued the company and gave appropriate sharing of synergies to the appropriate shareholders. We have in general received good feedback from our shareholders that we demonstrated appropriate capital discipline. Are we looking at additional or other BD deals? Absolutely. And would the tax inversions because that value, this was with AZ, it will be part of the value that we look at, but we also look for a strengthening parts of our businesses as well as we do that fundamentally what we look for is will any BD create long term value for our shareholders and that\u2019s the lens we look at it through not necessarily through financial strategic but overall is it value creating against our cost of capital. Frank, on a cost -- ? Frank D'Amelio: And so David, just in terms of timing, when we close out the year we are on the end of January or at least February call it 15, we'll close out Q4 and then I will give specific guidance by line item for 2015, so you will get the specific numbers then, but I will comment, I'll answer your question now and maybe macro-context, what I have said this year, last few quarters is I think we\u2019ve entered delayed innings on cost reduction. We have got some pressure on R&D is that we have initiated some late stage and development programs that we have eluded on the call, we've had some pressure on SI&A and due to launch cost cutting products is a good problem to have. That said in terms of managing our cost and expense structure, our expectation is that we will continuously improve as we go forward and there are still opportunities to improve our cost structure and we'll capitalize on those opportunities and we will drop as much of that to the bottom line as we can and that will be a balance between cost benefit analysis and how we deploy our capital. Operator : Your next question is from Colin Bristow from Bank of America. Colin Bristow : Thanks. A few product questions, if I may. On Xeljans, can you just give us a little more color on the performance in the quarter? And then looking forward, where are you in terms of getting the 10-milligram dose approved in RA. Given you intend to follow the 5-milligram and 10-milligram doses in psoriasis, what gives you confidence the FDA will feel comfortable with a 10-milligram dose in this setting? And then on the once-daily formulation, what are the timelines associated with this? And then finally on ertugliflozin, how do you see yourself competing, given it looks like you'll be fourth to market and historically, third or fourth entrants in these types of commoditized markets have struggled to gain meaningful share? Thanks. Geno Germano : Sure. So, let me start out with Xeljanz so we had a good with Xeljanz. We grew by over 30% from the first quarter this year. We think we have really hit an inflexion point with the launch of the structure data that they came after in the first quarter this year. So, we have some momentum and we\u2019re feeling good about the performance in the U.S. With regard to the 10 milligram in RA, we think that that\u2019s going to be -- that\u2019s going to take a while, that\u2019s going to take accumulation of additional safety data to satisfy the FDA. Although we have 10 milligram registrations in other countries, so we will just see how that plays out. With regard to psoriasis, we have a fairly large comprehensive data base over 3,600 patients and four significant trials in psoriasis. The results that we saw across the 5 milligram and 10 milligram doses were consistent in those trials. It is obviously a different a patient population with a different safety and efficacy profile overall. So we are in the process now of assembling our dossier and we will file a dossier and have discussions with the agency on the appropriate benefit risk and the appropriate dosages for that indication. With regard to the once a day, we are continuing to make really make really good progress with the once a day program. As you may know, we are not needing to do any addition clinical work, we are doing some pharmacology and PK work. So we expect to be filing in the first half of 2015. And with regard to ertugliflozin, we have, again a comprehensive program and partnership with Merck developing ertugliflozin as a single entity molecule or product and also in combination with JANUVIA and metformin and we will have an overall strategy that involves both the single entity and combination products to make our way into that marketplace. Ian Read : Thank you, Geno. Of course I should say fourth in, but it depends upon the quality of the clinical trial and the results we get and we believe that it is potentially best in class molecule. Operator : Your next question is from Marc Goodman from UBS. Marc Goodman : Geno, I was wondering if you could also give us an update on Xalkori and Inlyta, how those products are doing in the trends and how much more you think we can get from those. Second question is an update on tanezumab and third, China, maybe you could talk about some of the trends in China. Are we still gaining market share over there? Are we adding sales reps, are we moving into new cities and how the Hisun JV has worked out. Thanks. Geno Germano : So Albert in fact will -- has oncology and his responsibility, he will answer the Xalkori, Inlyta questions and then we will go to Mikael for tanezumab. And then perhaps in general, perhaps John could answer the China question. Albert Bourla : Mark, Inlyta overall very pleased with the performance with Inlyta, that was driven by very strong up take in key new regions. In the quarter we had 101 million of sales that was up 44% operationally from last year. Very seamless sentiments for Xalkori, we reported revenues of 108 million for the quarter that was up 59%. Overall, the growth is driven as a result of we have increased testing for the [indiscernible]. It is 78% remind you that when we launched the product it was 11%, so quite a strong uptake. And second reason is because we\u2019ve extended duration of [indiscernible] so more patients are treated and they are treated for long. So very strong performance for both, we expect to see this growth continue. Mikael Dolsten : Yes, so on tanezumab and thank you for the interest in that asset and as you may remember tanezumab delivered some very strong efficacy signal in the previous studies and represent potentially one of the few classes of new mechanics that are recently proving substantial clinical benefit. And we have been working with FDA in some very good constructive dialogues and what needs to be demonstrated in pre-clinical toxicology in order to submit a new package that could open up at a potential for reinitiating those studies. This has been focused on pre-clinical studies on the peripheral nervous system. And we have done some in depth studies that continue to accumulate data but so far I am encouraged about we have learned about the drug and the mechanics and we have stated that we will plan potentially to resubmit the data if we'll continue to come together in a positive way no later than first part of 2015. Frank D'Amelio: So thanks for the question Marc. So I mean I think we are obviously very pleased with the performance of China this quarter. Overall, the total biopharmaceutical business in China showed operational growth of 27%. The GEP business was in line at 37% in the quarter. And you can see the product performances when you get to the schedules and the earnings release. So pretty much across the Board what we have seen is strong volume growth driven by good operational performance in the marketplace. I think maybe just a comment on overall strategy in China for a business which clearly is very important to us. Overall, our strategy has a number of areas of focus. We are very focused on driving the legacy brands in China, LIPITOR is probably a standout product for us and we see a great fit with the priorities of the Chinese government to really better treat and manage patients with cardiovascular disease on a portfolio of Lipitor and Norvasc is a great fit in that regard. You mentioned Hisun and certainly we\u2019ve had a strategy in China for a number of years and I had to really find ways of participating in the profitable segments of the fast growing generic markets. And our partnership with Hisun is really a great example of that. Overall generic products came for around 70% of the domestic market in China and really our partnership with Hisun places this extremely well to be able to maximize our contribution there with products that are great fit with again the means of the healthcare system. Third clearly we\u2019re looking to bring innovative products to market and the GIP and [warts] businesses in China are looking to maximize the performance of innovative products in the market as well as bring new products to market. And overarching all of that, the last thing I would just say is that we\u2019re clearly looking to find ways of collaborating very constructively with the Chinese government and with their goals for the development of the pharmaceutical industry capability in China. We\u2019ve had domestic manufacturing capacity in China for many years and we are also very engaged with working with the Ministry of Health to partner with them to better screen patients for cardiovascular disease in China as well. So all of those things together really can be hopefully a flavor of what is driving the performance in China this quarter. Ian Read : And then Mark I\u2019ll just run a few of the numbers and then I\u2019ll answer your question about REPS. So John mentioned 27% operational growth for the biopharmaceutical business. Total company for the quarter grew 24% operationally and then John mentioned Lipitor and Norvasc, Lipitor in China grew 55% operationally quarter-over-quarter, Norvasc grew 30% quarter-over-quarter. So just some really-really strong performance. And we have added a significant amount of REPS in China in the first half of the year. Operator : Your next question is from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink. Seamus Fernandez : Thanks very much. I have three questions. The first one on palbociclib, can you update us on the potential interim look in Paloma 2? The second question is really for Frank. Frank, maybe you can confirm for us, as we look at the year-over-year comparisons, we do see the 2013 numbers broken out. But can you just confirm that this is not fully audited information that would include the balance sheet? Basically, my question is, is historically you've said that there won't be a look back at 2013 that would basically facilitate a split occurring sooner. But as I look at that data, if it were fully audited, it would seem like that might be a possibility. And then my last question for Ian, would you ever consider a sale of the innovative businesses, should you be approached by another company/ basically a willingness, if it made sense for shareholders in terms of that value, that might be provided to Pfizer in an eventual split? Thanks so much. Ian Read : Yes there is an interim review built into the design of Phase 3 trial of PALOMA-2 but you know the timing of that review is event driven, so we cannot speculate when that review will exactly take place. As I said before, the primary completion of the study is expected to be end of \u201915, so the final report is expected in \u201916. Again, it\u2019s event driven so the actual data may vary a bit. Frank D'Amelio: So Seamus, the way I think about this is no change from I have said previously which is if it\u2019s a public transaction, if we were to decide to do something from a separation perspective in the future, it would be three years of audited financials. In that with year-one being 2014, so it would be prospectively there years of audited financials. So no change from what I have said previously. Geno Germano : So on your last question, Seamus, I see myself in the management team and I am sure the Board sees themselves as custodians of shareholder value and so we would have to evaluate any proposal under its merit and we believe it produces long-term superior returns of shareholders. Operator : Your next question is from Jeff Holford from Jefferies. Jeff Holford : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I've got three for you. First off on Prevnar 13, would you just like to frame the opportunity for us again, if you were to receive a positive recommendation from the ACIP in August, and is that contained within your guidance for this year? Secondly, could you just comment around your strategic thoughts on your consumer business? Given some of the recent consolidations in that industry, does this asset still make most sense within the Pfizer structure? And then lastly, I wonder if you could just an up to date overview of your biosimilar programs and the potential timelines for any key assets. Thank you. Ian Read : Okay on the consumer business, we see the great store value. We have an active -- we\u2019ve acquired assets in that business. We\u2019ve just launched Nexium 24HR. We have an active RX OTC suite strategy, so we see it as a business that we want to be in. On Prevnar 13 adult, I'll ask Albert to give you some idea of the opportunity. The early approval is included in this year's overall guidance, no major change. Albert Bourla : Yes I will -- this is a great opportunity of course globally not only in U.S. because there is a very large adult target population and there is a significant unmet need over the 300 million adults are greater than 65 years of age in the world and half of that it is in U.S. and Japan. 3.6 to 3.7 million U.S. adults are turning 65 this year and also depending upon a ACIP recommendation. We do believe that there could be even an additional catch up opportunity for adults greater than 65 that have already received the old generation vaccine. So, we expect the Prevnar 13 to be the leading adult vaccination given the strength of our data. John Young : Okay, thanks again for the question Jeff. So, essentially we have five monoclonals in development, all of those products we expect to come to market in the 2017-2018 timeframe after the loss of exclusivity of the basic patterns of those molecules. So just to give you a rundown of the five, we have trastuzumab which is a biosimilar for Herceptin. That is already in Phase III, that Phase III was initiated earlier on this year. We have a biosimilar rituxumab that achieved our proof of concept in the first half of this year and we expect to initiate Phase III in the second half of 2014. We have biosimilar infliximab Phase I that was completed or we expect to complete at the end of this year and the next milestone there would again be initiation of Phase III and the second half of this year we have biosimilar adalimumab Phase I has been initiated and the next milestone would be a proof-of-concept redirect from those Phase I studies and making this year and then we have biosimilar bevacizumab that is in preclinical and the next milestone for that program would be the initiation of Phase I studies again this year. Operator : Your next question is from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets. Alex Arfaei : Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. On palbo, when can we expect updated survival data from Paloma 1? And a higher level R&D question, is there an opportunity for additional cost savings in your R&D structure? We've seen some of your peers simplify their structure and achieve significant savings without seemingly compromising productivity. Is that option for Pfizer? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Yes, on the overall survival data, we had initial assessment but it was done when we had only 37% of the total events. Now, there is a follow up analysis that is scheduled following the accrual of additional events but the time can take really long because the average, the medium overall survival of this population it is unfortunately four years. So, I really think that the final analysis likely will take long. Just a reminder though here that the primary end point of their study was the progress on free survival the overall survival was one of the secondary end point and also historically agents on the market for [indiscernible] metastatic breast cancer have been approved all with PFE\u2019s data as a primary end point. Ian Read : Thank you, Albert. So on R&D question, we feel that post the acquisition of Wyeth we were very prudent in the way we dimensioned our R&D spend, I believe taking the combined spend of sum 11 million down to 6.5, 6.7. So, I really can\u2019t comment on what our competitors have been doing but certainly for a few years now we have accelerated the refining of how much we spend in research, where we spend it, we have really good tools internally to look at the productivity by asset and we invest behind strong signals with lots of quality gates and we had separated out the decision between proof-of-concept and a decision to move forward into Phase III between the research and the commercial business, so we've got strong internal drivers for a return on a capital. Will we continue to look at the best ways to invest in research? Of course we have got a CTi initiative where we have major relationships with some 20 universities in the U.S. and I believe outside of the U.S. at least one where we attempt to look to be efficient the way we discover mechanisms of action and of course this is a major expense which we are constantly monitoring to make sure its efficient. When you have great products like we do and we are bringing them forward in the development and Phase III clearly there is pressure on the development cost of large trial such as within bococizumab or with palbociclib or with the mening B or with the staph aureus vaccine. So, clearly there are pressures on our Phase III spend that we will continue to manage our overall R&D spend within our overall guidance and overall drive to continue to grow EPS. Operator : The next question is from Andrew Baum from Citi. Andrew Baum : Hi. Couple of questions, please. First, we've obviously seen increased pressure by PBMs together with lesser price disciplines from the pharma industry translating into negative pricing dynamics in respiratory and diabetes spaces. I would be interested in your view on the evolution of that into the specialty pharma segment. And then leading on from it, and I appreciate it's a different situation, but GSK recently announced the pricing for their GLP 1 at a 65% discount for the first in class. To what extent do you think aggressive pricing strategies like that may work for products where it is late to market? And I guess I'm thinking partly of Xeljanz. Maybe not now, but at one point does a pricing lever become a potential option for you? And then secondly, building an oncology company around one drug is not easy, particularly if you've never had a strong legacy oncology business, as I think is the case with Pfizer. To what extent do you think you can build an oncology company without the acquisition of external talents and additional products through an M&A structure? Thank you. Ian Read : Well undoubtedly the PBMs are doing what they constructed to do, is to try and aggregate volume and achieve price discounts. This has been going on in the U.S. markets for many years now and I think will continue to occur. It really depends on the value that you bring to the market place. And we are focused on that and I think specialty products, certainly normally if you define them as having close to cures or having dramatic impact on the outcome of disease or with disease modifying have huge value. And so I believe we will continue to see an attention in there but value is rewarded, innovation is rewarded. I really can\u2019t comment on GSK pricing and on how we price Xeljanz? We think it reflects the both the composition of the value to the patient of value in the marketplace. And the most important thing in that market is I think is the efficacy and safety and adoption is normally slow and driven by clinical data rather than pure pricing decision. So I would see pricing as being more for acute conditions or conditions with highly genericized and it\u2019s not so much a sort of long term serious disease. Geno, do you want to comment anything more on that? Geno Germano : All that I would say is that as I am sure you are aware Andrew the pricing reimbursement process is particularly in the United States is very complex, very fragmented and we are dealing with not only prices but discounting, rebating, step edits, tiering of formulary status. And so it\u2019s not as simple as saying the price should be higher or lower, it\u2019s really a strategic approach to the marketplace where you first and foremost have to build value for your product and then operate within the system that exists out there for maximum benefit. So it\u2019s a day in and day out process, we think very strategically about how to price our products, how to discount our products, how to position our products on formularies. And I think we are going to continue to need to do that. Ian Read : Thank you, Geno. On Oncology, I don\u2019t quite understand your comment about building around one product. We have Xalkori in the market, we have Inlyta in the market, Bosulif in the marketplace, we have Sutent in the marketplace. So we see palbo as another product coming to market and we have a very in depth Phase II oncology portfolio. So perhaps Mikael, do you want to just mention a little bit about how you see the oncology portfolio developing? Mikael Dolsten : Thank you, Ian. So one hand there is significant activities on expanding palbociclib into a variety of additional indications and we have a handful of Phase I, Phase II studies exploring various segments of lung cancer including genomic defined with collaborators melanoma and we are also looking into other novel indications. We have a very exciting smoothened EBITDA that we\u2019re broadly expanding into a variety of blood cancer in ongoing Phase II studies, including AML and mild myelodysplastic disease. Our gamma secretase inhibitor shows a very interesting clinical profile distinct from what we have seen previously reported and we\u2019re moving that into triple negative breast cancers. And in immunooncology, as you know, we are collaborating with Merck on combining 41B BB with RPD1 and that study will soon start. And over the next year we plan to bring in to clinical studies on [40] antibody followed by PD1. So during the latter part of 2015, we will have a significant oncoimmunology portfolio. And then of course we have a Phase I ongoing with a full on to cell core that shows a real interesting profile. So this was just a brief overview of some of the more interesting compound building on what Ian said we have breadth and depth in talents and pipeline here. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from ISI group. Mark Schoenebaum : Hi, thanks for fitting me in. Maybe just go back to some questions in the first half of the Q&A, if you would tolerate that. Number one, maybe for Ian. Ian, speaking again about BD, could you perhaps, if possible, kind of prioritize therapeutic areas for us that you're interested in? I know -- I remember as recently as last summer, you had mentioned a few therapeutic areas you're most interested in. I was understanding what your priorities are now. And then within that commentary, perhaps you could comment on strategically whether it would make sense to add, to -- whether it would make sense to add a significant generics component to your current business. And then a two-part question for Mikael, I may. Mikael, could you update us on conversations you may have had with the regulators in the last several months around the PCSK9 class? I know Pfizer had spoken before about how you thought perhaps outcome struggles might be necessary prior to registration. I was just wondering what your current thoughts are. And then also, just summarize your CAR T-cell program that you recently inlicensed and how it differs from the programs that are a little bit ahead. Thanks. Ian Read : Thank you, Mark, and on BD clearly you want to do BD way, you have potential for not only organic growth but synergy, so you\u2019d like look at the BD where you already are strong in therapeutic areas whether it\u2019s pain, oncology or vaccines. Just to mention a few, anything that would you utilize a primary care field force would be of interest to us. And adding a significant generic component, we would look at as you say, we look at all alternatives if it fits it will make sense, if we see we can leverage it in the emerging markets, if we see there is organic growth we could produce from it, we could certainly consider it. I mean we are open to a wide range of business development activities that we believe that we can acquire at a good value for our shareholders. Mikael on the question on PCSK9 and then I think the cart technologies. Mikael Dolsten : So Mark thank you for the interest in R&D program. So first on PCSK9, we have a very large clinical program that of course includes LDL [indiscernible] and a significant severe outcome study involving those patients with less than 100 patients above 100 in cholesterol and includes prime and second prevention. And we think actually it\u2019s the broadest program available which could you know of course bring a real insight to patients efficient and to regulators. We think it\u2019s difficult to speculate if regulators will approve with LDL alone or wait for outcome studies I think it depends how other studies that are reading out. We deliver on the correlation between LDL lowering in a variety of CV patients groups to outcome, but I would underline that it\u2019s our view that what would really matter for the up take in their marketplace, my dialogues with Geno is very much that pays. We look for outcome studies and we think we have a premier outcome program and we think it would deliver timely to competitors. Concerning Cellectis, it\u2019s another Pfizer entry into the different modality of oncology and I am pleased to share with you that the Cellectis is the company that use allogeneic cause which has the upside that it\u2019s not a complex procedure but you could actually in a more industrialized process provide a defined cellular treatment for thousands of patients. Cellectis as a unique tail-end technology that allows them to modify and optimize those cells with a position that made it very attractive for us to make a deal and it\u2019s a significant collaboration including more than 15 targets by Pfizer. And also we are supporting some targets that Cellectis will develop and we have first rights to refusal for those few Cellectis targets. And it includes a number of technologies such as giving the cell the specificity such as introducing signals that allow it illuminate the cells making the cells resistant to certain standard of care that the patient may be receiving as well as enhancing the course by possibly knocking out molecules such as the PD-1 creating super course. So I just gave you a flavor of what I think we and Cellectis will unequally do in the industry and it really combines our in-depth ability in engineering of biological with Cellectis new medicine. Operator : Your final question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen. Steve Scala : Thank you very much. I have three questions. What is your level of confidence around the August 13 ACIP vote on Prevnar 13 in adults? Would you say, for instance, that you're highly confident in the vote? Secondly, regarding the neratinib comment earlier in the call, were you suggesting that you believe you have some legal right to gain greater participation than just the 13% royalty? And then thirdly, I would think you have kept a close eye on developments at AstraZeneca maybe involving evolution of the pipeline, and I'm wondering if you would share any observations. Thank you. Ian Read : Okay on AstraZeneca, I really don\u2019t want make any comments. It\u2019s a very complicated legal situation whether you take a look at and I think it\u2019s thus remain silent so far that Steve but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll understand right. As Doug, you could comment on neratinib. Doug Lankler : Sure, as we indicated before we did not see the data and believe we should \u2013 to that data and we are in the process of reviewing our contractual rights. Ian Read : I think what we\u2019re basically talking about is that we were in negotiations with them and we believe we have contractual rights to see data that we are reviewing our options. And ACIP, Albert? Albert Bourla : I don\u2019t want to speculate what the ACIP decision would be but I\u2019m very optimistic and I think that the policy options that they proposed were both favorable, actually commercially neutral for us because either will be the only or would be the first, a vax inverter will be administered. We think that will be a vote in this meeting and we hope to be positive. Ian Read : Thank you. When you have a chance to meet Albert, he is a very optimistic personality. So, we appreciate that optimism. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude Pfizer\u2019s second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Chuck Triano : Thank you, Operator. Good morning and thanks for joining us today to review Pfizer's third quarter 2014 performance. I am joined today as usual by our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Albert Bourla, President of Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer; Geno Germano, President of Global Innovative Pharma; John Young, President of Established Pharma and Doug Lankler, General Counsel. The slides that will be presented on this call can be viewed at our homepage pfizer.com, by clicking on the link for Pfizer Quarterly Corporate Performance Third Quarter 2014, which is located in the Investor Presentations section which is in the lower right hand corner of this page. Before we start, I\u2019d like to remind you that our discussion during this conference call will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer's 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. Discussions during the call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's current report on Form 8-K dated today October 28, 2014. We will now make prepared remarks and then we will move to a Q&A session. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian? Ian Read : Yes. Thank you, Chuck and thank you all for joining the call this morning. I\u2019ll start with a few comments regarding the quarter and then a few words about our strategy, including some remarks about business development. Starting with the quarter, our performance was well in line with our expectations as the business continues to perform well. In our Innovative business for Global Innovative Pharmaceuticals, the underlying business grew 9% operationally, if you exclude approximately $425 million or a negative 13 percentage point impact due to LOEs and the loss of Enbrel alliance revenue. Operationally the Vaccine business grew 19%, the Oncology business grew 17%, and the Consumer Healthcare grew 4%. For our Established business, GEP revenues for the quarter were down less than 1% if you exclude the approximately 383 million operational or 6 percentage points due to the negative impact of recent LOEs and Lipitor in the U.S. and Japan. We had good operational growth in several of our key products including, Lyrica which grew 16% and the Prevnar franchise which grew 18%, Enbrel remains a solid contributor in markets outside the United States and Canada where we retained marketing exclusivity and there is good momentum of our newest products including Eliquis, Xeljanz, Xalkori, and Inlyta,. Specifically for Eliquis, a key reading indicator referred to as new to brand share of cardiologists continues to improve nicely. Since launch, based on the most recent date Eliquis\u2019 share has increased from 0% to 44%, while our main competitor\u2019s shares declined from the high of 70s to slightly above ours. For Xeljanz, the inclusion of structural data in the Xeljanz label has served as an inflection point with prescribers. We hope to see further steady share gains, aided by the growing attractiveness of positions of using Xeljanz as an effective monotherapy option. Again this quarter we achieved solid companywide performance in emerging markets, revenues increased 9% operationally compared to the year ago quarter, driven by growth in China and Latin America. Overall performance year-to-date positions us to achieve a strong finish even after taking account that we\u2019ve transitioned to a new commercial model internally, while also adapting to ongoing external market forces. Looking ahead, the period of high LOE impact will continue through 2016 making it difficult to generate revenue or growth on a net basis. We expect the size of the impact to be substantially reduced starting in 2017. Our strategy has not changed. It is anchored upon the following pillars; making our R&D more productive so we deliver on our pipeline; continuing to make smart and shareholder-friendly decisions on how we allocate our capital and globally position Pfizer to be a market leader for organic and inorganic growth opportunities. Regarding the pipeline, we recently achieved several regulatory milestones in our late-stage vaccines and oncology pipelines. The FDA accepted the biologics license application for our meningitis B vaccine with priority review and set a PDUFA date of February 14, 2015. The new drug application of palbociclib was accepted with priority review of an April 13, 2013 PDUFA date. We also had discussions with the European regulatory health authorities and intend to file palbociclib in the EU next year. The FDA approved abuse deterrent labeling for embedded-extended release capsules, and our investigational C. difficile vaccine was granted Fast Track designation and advisory committee on immunization practices recommended a routine use of Prevnar 13 amongst adults, 65 years and above in the United States. And looking at our late-stage pipeline, there are multiple indications that Xeljanz is progressing. We have completed all four, three phase studies in psoriasis has Phase 3 study is underway in psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis and there are Phase 2 studies in psoriasis for topical use, Crohn's disease and ankylosing spondylitis. And we\u2019re exploring expansion of palbociclib from advanced to recurrent and subsequently early breast cancer. In addition, we\u2019re working to advance potentially attractive opportunities that could be commercialized in 2017 and beyond, they include ertugliflozin for the treatment of diabetes, bococizumab for cholesterol lowering in high risk individuals, vaccines for hospital acquired infections such as Staph aureus and C. difficile and several biosimilars in oncology and information. Given the pipeline progress being made I believe we have good sight to improve R&D productivity. In terms of capital allocation we have a strong solid track-record of taking expenses out of the business, generating strong operating cash flows and having a sound balance sheet that is a competitive advantage. We have returned significant capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. During the period 2011 through 2013, we returned approximately 53 billion and expect to return nearly 12 billion in 2014. All of this positions us well to pursue business development opportunities. Recently there has been a lot of attention paid to deals involving re-domiciling and the proposed regulations announced by the treasury department which make it more complicated and also potentially limits value that could be created by U.S. companies that re-domicile. The fact that treasury has left open their ability to make further changes without notice is of concern. For Pfizer enhanced financial flexibility from re-domiciling is certainly still one potential source of creating value. As we\u2019ve said previously we will look at any business development opportunities based on strategic-fit including operational, portfolio and financial synergies. We continue to evaluate a broad set of potential options on a case-by-case basis to accelerate value creation to shareholders. Finally a few words regarding the potential split of our businesses, we have two primary businesses. I want to say that again because there seems to be some confusion that I made and verbally created, we have two primary businesses. An Innovative R&D driven portfolio which is managed through our Global Innovative Pharma and Vaccines Oncology and Consumer segments and secondly a Global Established Pharmaceutical business. We have 10 months experience operating in our current commercial model with P&L information. This is proving valuable insights into the strength and challenges of each business. In 2015 we will maintain a significant effort towards setting up the groundwork required to operationalize a potential split. What we do will eventually depend upon how our commercial business is performing in markets? How our shareholders value these businesses? If in some of the parts is greater than the whole. And wherever there are opportunities to enhance their competitive positioning which could be achieved outside of Pfizer. It is a decision, it\u2019s important to underscore that at this point in time we have not yet made a decision. In summary, we have an unrelenting focus on successfully executing on our commitments so that we start 2015 financially and operationally strong. And with a flexibility to take the actions that create value and is best for our shareholders, patients and colleagues. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Frank who\u2019ll take you through the financial details of the quarter. Frank D'Amelio: Thanks Ian and good day everyone. As always the charts we are reviewing are included in our webcast. As a reminder, because of the full disposition of Zoetis on June 24, 2013, the financial results of the animal health business and the gain associated with its full disposition are reported as a discontinued operation in the consolidated statements of income for the first nine months of 2013. Now let\u2019s move on to the financials. Third quarter 2014 revenues of approximately 12.4 billion decreased 2% year-over-year, reflecting an operational decline of approximately 270 million or 2% driven mainly by the expiration on October 31, 2013 of the co-promotion term for Enbrel in the U.S. and Canada, the ongoing termination of the Spiriva collaboration in certain countries, the loss of exclusivity in subsequent multi-sourced generic competition for Detrol LA in the U.S., and other product losses of exclusivity in various markets. In total, LOEs in declining alliance revenues had a negative impact of approximately 750 million in the quarter. These were partially offset by the strong operational growth in developed markets of Lyrica, Prevnar, Eliquis, Xeljanz, Xalkori, Inlyta, as well as Nexium 24HR primarily in the U.S. and by 9% operational growth in emerging markets driven by Prevnar as well as Lipitor primarily in China. Foreign exchange had a negligible impact of 11 million on reported revenues. Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.57 decreased 2% or $0.01 primarily due to lower revenues and a 2% aggregate operational increase in adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A and adjusted R&D expenses resulting from an unfavorable shift in product mix, upfront payments to Cellectis and MedGenesis Therapeutix associated with recently announced agreements, as well as the ongoing Phase 3 programs for bococizumab, ertugliflozin, palbociclib and certain other new drug candidates. Adjusted SI&A expenses however decreased by 1% operationally because of continued benefits from cost reduction and productivity initiatives, partially offset by product launch investments. Adjusted diluted EPS was favorably impacted by fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding which declined by 253 million shares versus the year ago quarter, due to ongoing share repurchases and the lower effective tax rate. We recorded reported diluted EPS of $0.42 compared with $0.39 in the year ago quarter due to the previously mentioned factors and the favorable impact of the non-recurrence of a loss associated with Theo-Dur option. Lower restructuring charges and lower expenses related to cost reduction initiatives, which were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a charge to account for an additional year of the non-tax deductible branded prescription drug fee under the final regulations issued by the IRS during the third quarter 2014. Foreign exchange negatively impacted third quarter revenues by 11 million and had a net unfavorable impact of 10 million on the aggregate of adjusted cost of sales, SI&A and R&D expenses. And consequently, the impact of foreign exchange on adjusted diluted EPS was negligible compared with the year ago quarter. Now moving onto the financial highlights of our business, in the third quarter Global Innovative Pharmaceutical revenues decreased 4% operationally year-over-year due to the previously mentioned expiration of the co-promotion term for Enbrel in the U.S. and Canada, partially offset by strong operational growth from Lyrica, primarily in the U.S. and Japan and Eliquis and Xeljanz globally. Income before taxes declined 8% operationally due to the decrease in revenues, a 12% operational increase in cost of sales or a 1.9 percentage point increase as a percentage of revenues of which 1.5 percentage points was attributable to the loss of Enbrel alliance revenues, a 6% operational increase in SI&A expenses from increased investment in new products such as Eliquis and Xeljanz and in-line brands such as Lyrica and Viagra, as well as a 33% operational increase in R&D expenses due to incremental investment in late-staged pipeline products such as bococizumab, ertugliflozin, and additional Xeljanz indications. In the third quarter, revenues from our Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer Healthcare businesses grew 13% operationally year-over-year, due to the strong operational growth of Prevnar, Xalkori, Inlyta and Nexium 24HR. Income before taxes increased 19% operationally due to increased revenues, which were partially offset by a 12% operational increase in cost of sales driven by increased sales volume. As a percentage of revenue cost of sales decreased by 0.2 percentage points due to a favorable change in product mix, and there was a 13% operational increase in SI&A expenses due to Nexium launch cost and Prevnar Adult investment and prelaunch expenses of palbociclib and our meningitis B vaccine candidate. R&D expenses however decreased 10% operationally due to lower cost for certain oncology programs partially offset by increased investment in the palbociclib and mening B development programs. In the third quarter Global Established Pharmaceutical revenues decreased 6% operationally year-over-year due to the previously mentioned product losses of exclusivity and the loss of alliance revenues and an operational decrease of Lipitor in U.S. and Japan. Income before taxes declined 4% operationally due to the decrease in revenues it was partially offset by the decreases in cost of sales, SI&A and R&D expenses which included increased spending on biosimilar development programs. Now moving on to our 2014 financial guidance, we\u2019re updating certain components of our 2014 financial guidance based on our year-to-date performance, recent changes in the foreign exchange rates and our outlook for the remainder of the year. It's important to note that this guidance does not include an adjustment for the potential devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar or any other currency. We\u2019re narrowing our adjusted revenue range to 48.7 billion to 49.7 billion, from 48.7 billion to 50.7 billion. We are narrowing and lowering our adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of adjusted revenues range to 18.5% to 19% or 19% to 20%. We are narrowing our adjusted SI&A expenses range to 13.5 billion to 14 billion from 13.3 billion to 14.3 billion. We are narrowing our adjusted R&D expense range to 6.9 billion to 7.2 billion from 6.7 billion to 7.2 billion. We now expect other income to be approximately 400 million versus our previous expectation of about 200 million. We continue to expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 27% which does not assume the renewal of the U.S. R&D tax credit if renewed the effect would not be material and we would not anticipate any impact on our 2014 adjusted effective tax rate guidance. We are narrowing our reported diluted EPS range to a $1.50 to $1.59 from a $1.47 to $1.62 and we are narrowing our adjusted diluted EPS range to 2.23 to 2.27 versus 2.20 to 2.30. Now moving onto the key takeaways, we narrowed our guidance ranges for adjusted revenues and adjusted diluted EPS. We recently achieved several key R&D milestones related to palbociclib, our meningitis B vaccine candidate Prevnar 13 and our investigational C/ diff vaccine. We continue to create shareholder value through prudent capital allocation. To-date in 2014, we have returned approximately 5 billion in dividends to shareholders and repurchased 4.2 billion or approximately 140.4 million shares and we continue to expect to repurchase approximately 5 billion of our common stock this year. These repurchases and planned repurchases for the remainder of the year are expected to reduce total shares outstanding year-over-year by a total of approximately 100 million shares by the end of 2014 after considering actual and projected dilution related to employee compensation programs. In total, we expect to return nearly 12 billion of the shares repurchase in dividends to shareholders this year. In addition, last week the Board of Directors authorized a new $11 billion share repurchase program to be used overtime. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2014 and beyond. With that I\u2019ll turn it back to Chuck. Chuck Triano : Thank you, Frank and Ian for your comments. At this point operator can we please pull for questions? Question-and-Answer Session Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Chris Schott - JPMorgan Great, thanks very much for the questions. Just a few here on bis dev, first I just want to make sure I am clear on your comments. Do you still see meaningful value to Pfizer from inversion or should we be thinking about larger deals having to be much more driven by operating synergies and pipeline opportunities, I guess relative to I\u2019ll say six or 12 months ago? The second question is just how does the potential for future treasury action factor into that analysis in terms of -- do you really kind of know what treasury ultimately does and does that effect how you are thinking about this? And then the final one is just a broader one, which is relative to a year ago it seems like Pfizer is much more focused on business development. I guess this question is for, what\u2019s kind of changed over the last year that it seems like you are just kind of seeing, that is just a big value creating event for shareholders that didn\u2019t exist maybe one or two years ago? Thanks very much. Ian Read : Thanks Chris. I appreciate your questions on BD, I just want to make the point that BD is not a strategy it is an enabler of the strategy. So I don\u2019t want to get us, sort of totally focused on BD and not on the strength of our underlying business, the development of our pipeline and I think in our prepared remarks has gone through that, so I won\u2019t repeat it here but I do want to stress that we feel the strategies we have put in place on improving our innovative core and getting capital allocation right are working and working well. So the rules that, the proposed rule changes on inversions have not stopped inversions, if you are between the 80% and 60% I think it's fair to say they have made it more difficult and perhaps changed the timing on realization of the value. But we still believe on a case-by-case basis there is meaningful value that we had from inversions and probably the most significant is the liberation of a substantial proportion of your future cash flows outside of the U.S. tax system into a territorial system. The next question I believe was future treasury actions. I can\u2019t predict what they are going to do, so no one can, it's worrying that we\u2019re putting this, the U.S. businesses are put in this uncertain situation and that U.S. companies are put in such a competitive disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis foreign competitors both from the tax rate and also the uncertainty of the rules. But that\u2019s where we are today and that is what we have to live with. I think what it means is that as you look at inversion, you need to thoroughly understand case-by-case what inversion target is, what your capabilities are and how you intend to realize the values and there should be multiple ways of realizing such value because you can't anticipate the rule changes that treasury may put in place, so all of that would be factored in I think by anybody who intends to do an inversion deal. And then I think from your question about why more focus on Pfizer now on BD. I think if you got to look that in the context of when this team, they took over the company back in late '10 we were really focused on fixing our related core, working with Michael to make sure that our science organization was best-in-class. Advancing our pipeline, getting our capital allocation right, getting our expense base right, getting our culture the way we want it to be and I think through '11, '12 and parts of '13 we got where we wanted to be and we felt very confident about our ability to take on BD over a bolt-on or a large size and ensure we maximize the value of any such BD. So I think that explains the timing. Thank you for the question. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Ian. Operator, next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank. Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Thanks. Ian what have been the key learnings since the decision of separating your businesses internally. I realize you are telling 10 months but I am sure you've learned from some goods and bads? And may be part B of that questions is a hypothetical. If someone were to offer you a price for the EP business and could run it in a more cost and tax efficient manner and Pfizer shares could benefit from that, would it even be possible at this point or soon from an operational standpoint, in other words has enough separation work occurred to enable that type of hypothetical to be a reality? Thanks. Ian Read : Okay, I will deal with the learnings and then I\u2019ll ask Frank to talk about the hypothetical of this more immediate separation. I think the learnings are what we basically expected is the power of focus, it's the power of having a leader on a team focused on Established products, with John Young leading that with crafting strategies that address the specific issues of the EP business, of driving that business in those countries without losing focus on what the strategies are for that business. it is about having John working on growth opportunities, his team looking for growth opportunities, I think it's back to the whole area of give a team an objective, make it clear, make it focused and let them go at it. And if you've got good people, they will come up with extraordinary results. So I think that's the learning on that and we continue to be pleased with the way John\u2019s approaching his, the way Albert is doing it with VOC, and what Geno is doing with GIP. I mean these growth rates in Eliquis and Xeljanz and Lyrica are a result of a great management team working and Albert also will be the growth in the Vaccines, Oncology. So I am very pleased with the focus we are achieving. So with that I\u2019ll handover to you. Frank D'Amelio: Yes. And so Gregg, in terms of the timing, the way I will answer the question relative to, for example our Established Products business. The way to think about this is, is it a public transaction or a private transaction. If it's a public transaction, and by the way I know your example was the private one, I\u2019ll get to it. If it's a public transaction, so a reverse mortgage trust, a partial spin, a complete spin, a partial IPO, a partial IPO followed by a single split and three years of audited financials is required and that would be three years of prospective audited financials. So think about that as 2017. If it's a private transaction, by the way your example was a private transaction. So we sell an entire segment to someone who we would sell a partial element of your segment or a joint venture with a minority interest or a joint venture with a majority interest. Then it is subject to what's called a significance test, and then there is three tests within the significance test, there is an asset test, an income test and an investment test. The asset test is the targets assets as a percentage of the acquirer's assets. The income test is the acquirer's income as a percentage of the acquirer's income. And then the investment test is the acquirer's investment in the target as a percentage of the acquirer's assets. If all three tests are below 20%, no audited financials are required. If anyone test is between 20% and 40%, one year audited financials is required. If anyone test is between 40% and 50%, two years of audited financials are required and if anyone test is greater than 50%, two years of balance sheet, three years of income statement, cash flow, comprehensive income and shareholders\u2019 equity are required. Given the size of our established products business it is very likely one of the tests if not all, would be greater than 50%. Ian Read : Gregg you can see that we've given this some considerable thought and continually working on this and leaving no stone unturned in ways of trying to achieve our objective here. Thank you. Chuck Triano : Thank you, Frank and Ian. Next question please operator. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from ISI Group. Vlad Nikolenko - ISI Group Hi, thank you for taking my question. Actually Vlad Nikolenko sitting in for Mark, again congratulations with a great quarter and I have a couple of questions about the R&D update. So I am wondering if you can provide more color on the level of confidence for the ongoing palbociclib filing which is our understanding is based on Phase 2 data and the plans how to use the Phase 3 data? And also I want to know if you can give more highlights about the ongoing PCSK9 program. And finally just to get more sense about the state of the pipeline. Because currently published pipeline accounts more than 80 programs, at different stages of the development, some of them are label extensions. Just what investors have to focus on besides palbociclib and PCSK9 and Vaccines that you already mentioned? Thank you. Ian Read : Paul thank you very much good questions, which we welcome answering, so I\u2019ll ask Albert to deal with the palbo issue, Geno with the bococizumab and then we\u2019ll ask Mikael to give you a succinct description of the portfolio and what we\u2019re excited about. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Vlad and for palbo as you are aware we have submitted a filling and FDA has accepted the NDA and gave us priority review. And we have a PDUFA date which is on April 13. This filing was based on Phase 2 data. To-date FDA has not placed any conditions related to submission of Phase 3 data results during the NDA review. In fact we do not expect to have any Phase 3 data before the PDUFA date. There is an interim review built into the protocol which is event driven and so I cannot speculate when it will happen but this interim review will not happen before the PDUFA date. So we\u2019re looking forward to continue working with the FDA so we can bring this product to patients as soon as possible. Ian Read : Thank you, Geno? Geno Germano : The palbociclib the PCSK9 program is progressing, we\u2019re in Phase 3. We\u2019ve been enrolling for about a year now. We have a fairly extensive Phase 3 program with five LDL trials and two cardiovascular outcomes trial. This I think differentiates our program from others in the category. So I believe we\u2019re the only one with a cardiovascular outcomes trial in the high risk patients who are unable to get their LDL levels below 100 on maximum doses of statins. And so this is a patient population where we\u2019re likely to show a benefit and in the event that reductions in LDL levels to very low levels don\u2019t show the linearity that we\u2019re looking for. We think this patient population will still show the benefit. We have a second cardiovascular outcomes trial in a broader patient population, testing whether reducing LDL levels below the current recommended levels will confer an additional morbidity or mortality benefits. So it is a robust program we\u2019re moving quickly to enroll patients and we\u2019re on-track. Ian Read : Mikael some comments on the -- do you have products outside of those mid-term. Mikael Dolsten : Absolutely, the way to look upon the pipeline is as you said we have more than 80 projects across Phase 1 to registration. And when you look at the late-stage I would encourage you to see it as four potential blockbuster franchisees, supporting GIP, VOC and GEP and you are aware of palbo for VOC, for GIP boco and Xeljanz\u2019s lifecycle management. As you have heard Xeljanz is really picking up pace in array and there are multiple indications that the following, psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, psoriatic arthritis and a QD foray. And then finally for GEP the biosimilars which are moving to four, soon in Phase 3 and one additional in PUC study. There is also an upside that we haven\u2019t discussed a lot and that is progress that we\u2019re making on tanezumab in pre-clinical safety in the dialog with the agency and we look forward to concluding this data with a potential opportunity to get back on the dialog to restart that program pending of course good date and so on agency dialogs. You already mentioned vaccines and I expect that we\u2019ll see mid of next year that we\u2019ll have six different programs in addition to staph C. diff we also have therapeutic vaccines now coming that includes a gene, nicotine and cancer vaccine and I encourage you to see that as a whole technology platform that we have built. In enology inflammation in addition to the tofacitinib oral program there are now additional opportunity in psoriasis we have recently seen encouraging data for our topical version of tofacitinib in both dermatitis and psoriasis and we\u2019re designing a new generation of JAK inhibitors with psoriasis as well as for IBD. In the cardiovascular and metabolic we have generated encouraging data on novel PD-5 inhibitor for diabetic nephropathy and we\u2019ve another drug CS-25 that is leading out in the next one or two months. Oncology there is very nice mid-staged pipeline with the GSI drug for genetical altered triple-negative breast, a broad program around slow and hematology and we have recently seen encouraging Phase 1 data for our full on drug 392 and as you are all aware we\u2019re building a increasingly robust immuno-oncology second wave program and we\u2019re now for example dosing 41BB on top of PD-1 in a partnership with Merck and recently we moved our fifth antibody drug conjugate into the clinic and addressing multiple solid tumors, so these were just a couple of things that I think will deliver a lot of momentum over the next two years. Ian Read : Thank you, Mikael. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Mikael. Next question please, operator? Operator : Your next question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS. Marc Goodman - UBS Yes, I'm not sure if Geno is on the line, but if he could talk about the oncology business and maybe specifically some of the products. Inlyta, Xalkori, some of these products look that they are slowing down a little bit, so I was curious what's happening there. And then I believe we got into the oncology just at the end there about how you are positioning yourself for the future, but I'm curious how you are thinking about immuno-oncology and the products that you are working on. And then on biosimilars, could you tell us, the four Phase 3s, has anything moved forward? When should we be expecting the Phase 3s to finish? Ian Read : Okay, so I\u2019ll ask Albert who has responsibility for oncology business to make some comments on SUTENT, and Inlyta, and Xalkori, and all basically are in line products and then on the positioning perhaps of the, for immuno-oncology I\u2019d ask Mikael to make a comment on that and then on biosimilars John could make comment. Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thanks a lot for the Inlyta, as you know we said for the quarter 23% growth operational, U.S. was 9%. And in U.S. we have a strong uptake in the academic setting, what we\u2019re working now it is to make sure what we have strong uptake also in the community setting and to have numerous programs that are in place to achieve that. In EU Inlyta, it was quite impressive 32% growth for the quarter. However, the results are driven basically by positive ESMO guidelines, but now are endorsing Inlyta as a standard second line treatment option and also we saw this year improvement in our reimbursement status. Right now we have basically all 16 EU countries reimbursing Inlyta. If I go to Xalkori, in Xalkori, we were very pleased with the performance. We had 55% growth operationally for the quarter. U.S. 33%. It\u2019s driven by clearly an increased testing for the ALK gene mutation right now we\u2019re at 74% testing to remind you we started at the launch at 11% and the year ago was 60%. So it\u2019s a significant improvement. In EU, the growth was even more impressive 74% for the quarter. Although, over there again it is driven by ESMO treatment guidance but also we have positive data from the PROFILE 1014 study, that we released and that is driving a lot of these results in Europe. And finally in Japan Xalkori had 43% growth and is driven by again the new data of PROFILE 1014, but have compared Xalkori to the standard chemotherapy. Ian Read : Thank you very much. So we go to the positioning on immuno-oncology. Mikael Dolsten : Yes, we\u2019re enthusiastic about immuno-oncology rising as a new modality in oncology and as you know that\u2019s been durable, but mainly are partial responses and we see the next level of immuno-oncology to go to deeper and more complete responses and that where we really are focusing our current efforts strongly to be a leader. I mentioned briefly that our 41BB is now dosing on top of PD-1 in a partnership with Merck. We have a partnership to study 41BB on top of CCR4 with KHK. And we\u2019re moving additional checkpoint modulators into human studies export early next year or later next year our own PD-1. In addition to the checkpoint drugs, I think you will see not only I/O plus I/O combos, but I/O plus targeted agents. And we\u2019re working in a partnership with Merck studying PD-1 plus Inlyta and planning to study PD-1 plus Xalkori together. A second modality beyond the I/O checkpoints are cancer vaccines where we\u2019re planning during next year to start our first out of a serious of cancer vaccine clinical studies. We also have our own platform of bi-functional antibodies that will start delivering human agents in 2016. And as you know we did with Cellectis and partnership around CAR T-cell, so we\u2019re playing very broadly with the leading technologies and assets and our goal is to move one to two immuno-oncology agents in the classes as I described every year for the coming period into human studies mainly focusing on combination, which we think will deliver the outmost value of deep more durable responses. Ian Read : Thank you, Mikael, John? John Young : Okay. So thanks for the question Marc. So, just as a reminder in our first wave we have five monoclonals in our biosimilar portfolio primarily in oncology and inflammation indications. So the three biosimilars are already in Phase 3 studies that are ongoing or enrolling our biosimilar for rituximab, our biosimilar for trastuzumab and biosimilar for infliximab. So those Phase 3 studies are ongoing already. As Mikael mentioned earlier on biosimilar bevacizumab has just recently completed, successfully completed Phase 1 study and so the next milestone for that in development would be at the initiation of Phase 3 and we have an adalimumab biosimilar which is currently in Phase 1. So, those studies are progressing well and we anticipate bringing this portfolio to the market in the 2017-2018 timeframe. Chuck Triano : Thanks, John. Moving to the next question please operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen. Steve Scala - Cowen and Company A few questions, you stated, I think, that you would file palbociclib in the EU in 2015. Is that based on the same Phase 2 data that you submitted to the FDA so the filing could be early in 2015? Or is it based on some look at Phase 3 as well, which would probably push the filing to later in the year? And two questions for Ian, and I apologize in advance for both. But why the very deliberate comment on two businesses rather than three when the Company is giving financials on three businesses and has been talking about three businesses for several years? I know you've been talking about two companies or two businesses in recent calls, but why the need to emphasize it now? Secondly, I'm not clear on the benefit to Pfizer of saying an inversion is still possible. Is it, for instance, to prompt further treasury clarification or for some other reason? Thank you. Ian Read : I\u2019ll ask -- on the -- as answering a question about whether we still thought that inversion was a viable strategic component of any deal, we still believe it is I was answering the question, so I think that explains why I answered it that way it was no ulterior motive beyond that of reassuring investors that while the rules have changed, we still believe in the appropriate circumstances that inversions can be part of the value mix of a deal. And although we can do deals and we do see value in deals with that inversions, it still remains part of our overall mix. So I hope it explains that Steve. On the two businesses, the reason I would so, I\u2019ve been talking to investors and I believe there is a confusion out there, we have two businesses, we report one of the businesses in several, in two segments. We have our business which is our Innovative business which relies on our core research and our core capabilities and which I see as an integral business is made up of Oncology, and Vaccines, and Consumer and what I would call traditional Innovative. That is as I see it one business and the fact that we report it separately is really an artifact of the SEC rules on segment reporting and depending on pure management construct and who reports to the CEO. And I think that\u2019s led to some confusion in the investment community that we see the company as made up of more than two business segments. So, I see two business segments one is Innovative, using those resources of Innovative and one that is Established using and those are the ones that John runs. So I just wanted to make that clear and most of the work we\u2019re doing on optionality is around those two businesses, not around more than those two businesses, Palbo in the EU? Albert Bourla : Yes. Thanks a lot Steve. And we have had discussions with the European regulatory health authorities on the clinical data and it is our intention to file an EU and that filing will happen in 2015, I don\u2019t want to be more specific if it's going to be beginning of the end of \u201915 or it is going to be in 2015. Now of the anticipated filing packets will likely look similar to what was submitted in U.S. to the FDA. Chuck Triano : Okay. Thanks Albert. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Colin Bristow from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Colin Bristow - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. Just on BD, the immuno-oncology product seems to continue to grow as potential indications continue to grow, making it arguably more attractive for those who aren't first to market. How are you thinking about this space with regards to your business development priorities? And then just on Xeljanz, there's obviously it a couple of competitor JAKs on the horizon. How do you view the competitive threat and Xeljanz's positioning? And you said on track for a filing in the first half of 2015, for your once daily formulation. Thanks. Ian Read : Alright, so Geno can talk about the Xeljanz situation and then I\u2019ll come back on the BD. Geno Germano : Yes, so I think we\u2019re very pleased with the progress we\u2019re making with Xeljanz we see continued adoption by rheumatology community, we have about a 10% now share of new to brand patients from rheumatology which is a nice leading indicator of where that business is going. Obviously the rheumatology community is getting more and more comfortable with Xeljanz, a majority that uses Xeljanz is used in what I call methotrexate free regiments where patients who have difficulty with methotrexate are finding adequate therapy with Xeljanz which is great. So it's becoming entrenched, it's becoming established and we think that's going to speak well for its competitive position in the future and we are still on-track for our first half filing for the once a day. Ian Read : On our immuno-oncology BD activity, I agree with you that I think the value is in combinations. You've all seen the results of PD-1s, there are some durable responses in monotherapy but our belief is that the true power of the immuno-oncology will be from combinations, perhaps on two or three combinations and so we are focused in developing our second wave in oncology and our vaccines and the CART technology and are clearly open to any type of business development which would give us access earlier to a PD-1 type portfolio that we could more easily integrate and combine with our second wave. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Ian. Next question please operator. Operator : Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. David Risinger - Morgan Stanley Thanks very much. So I have two questions, first, regarding the net cost outlook. Frank, could you just talk about how investors should think about cost trends going forward? And maybe you could weave in some comments about the potential for some increased cost if you are building up two business segments from the one that currently exists globally? And then with respect to palbo, I'm just curious, what should investors focus on in terms of timing of next key palbociclib readouts in case the FDA does not improve palbociclib on the first cycle review next spring? Thank you. Ian Read : Okay. Frank do you want to go into the net cost and then Albert can look at the\u2026 Frank D'Amelio: So, Dave the way I think about cost trends going forward is kind of by starting with where are we, and I think where we are now and I've said this before as we are in the late innings I think on cost reduction that there is always more opportunity to be more efficient in everything that we do, but I think the big ticket items are behind us. We've basically gotten those identified, we've gotten those implemented and we've gotten those executed and they are obviously in our results. So I think going forward, there will be some opportunities but the big ticket opportunities in my perspective are behind us. The one thing I would say though about just kind of managing cost is, I am making every statement based on the hand we currently have. To the extent that we expand that hand through whatever collaborations, partnerships, business development and that gives us opportunities once again to be more efficient on a going forward basis. So I think late innings, we've taken a bunch out still some more we can take out but the big ticket item is primarily behind us. In terms of frankly increased cost going forward, I think the way I will answer that is if you look at this year to last year, so '14 to '13. The one area where you see a fairly sizeable increase is in our R&D spend. If you look at our guidance for the year now, we just tightened it to 6.9 to 7.2. You take midpoint of that range just for analytical purposes compared to last year, our R&D spend year-over-year is up $0.5 billion. So the late-stage assets that we talked about plus the business transactions we did with Cellectis and MedGenesis. So you see some pressure on the R&D spend at least in '14 versus '13. Beyond '14 going into '15, we will obviously give the guidance on every line item when we get on our next earnings call where we close out '14 to provide guidance for 2015. Ian Read : Thanks Frank I think you want to comment on the -- I think the comment was, is there any ongoing expenses of setting up the two businesses\u2026 Frank D'Amelio: Oh, yes. So -- thanks Ian. So in terms of optionality, the short answer is there are and they haven't been material on a year-to-date basis but we are clearly incurring expenses give or take about 50 million this quarter, roughly twice that year-to-date that will ramp-up as we go into 2015 and obviously I will call that out on a go forward basis. Ian Read : Yes, and there were two types of expenses of course one is just the ongoing which I think are very modest structural expenses of running and collecting information for two businesses and the other which is more one-off and one-time as you set up your structures and your tax planning et cetera, et cetera. Chuck Triano : Okay, Albert, on the\u2026 Ian Read : Oh, yes Albert on\u2026 Chuck Triano : Palbociclib. Ian Read : Yes. Albert Bourla : Right now we are focused on getting in U.S. registration based on our Phase 2 submission. FDA has accepted this submission has given us priority review, and a PDUFA date of April 2015, we are looking forward to bring the product to U.S. based on this submission to the U.S. patients as soon as possible. In Europe as we have said we also plan to submit in 2015 with a similar packet. I can tell you that there are several studies that are moving on and we have PALOMA-2 which is a Phase 3 study but it is expected to come to completion at the end of 2016 so the report sometime in the March 2016. This is a replica of our Phase 3 study. We have two additional studies that will give us additional registration indications which are in recurrent and one of them is expected to come to completion again next year. And then we have one registration study, that one Phase 3 study which is in the recurrent advance in early-stage with high risk of recurrence. And this is expected to come into completion sometime in the \u201919 timeframe. So as I said our focus right now it is to bring the first indication which is first line advance metastatic in U.S. based on our submission in -- that happened this August and has a PDUFA date of April 13. Ian Read : I suppose David you know to your question that while we are working with the FDA to get approval in the April timeframe of palbo if they decide not to approve on that then we have the replica which we\u2019ll report out towards the end of the year with interim look at some point in the year if they hit the number of events. But I think the more important thing is that we have already started the trials to expand beyond advance breast cancer and intermediate and early. And that lead is not a lead that will be eroded by the decision on when we get approval for advanced breast cancer. Because the fact that we started those trials now that and our competitors are not in a position to start those trials because they don\u2019t have the data. So if you look at it from a competitive point of view, there is a competition for advanced breast cancer which may become more intense if our approval is delayed until the end of our Phase 3 trial. But I don\u2019t see that having any implications on the competitive position on the intermediate or early breast cancer which is far larger percentage of the market longer term. So I hope that explains how we see the dynamics of that market. Chuck Triano : Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Ian, just I want to go back to capital allocation. I think the market is saying that you need to do something bold and just wondering if you agree with that? And if so, how would you -- what would you define as bold? And what is your timeline? We've been talking about capital allocation and doing something bold now for several quarters. How we thinking, in terms of timing? Thirdly, I think that the AstraZeneca deal was thought of as a potential carve out opportunity. Would you consider -- I think the GEP business as a business that really has limited longer-term growth visibility whereas the innovative business, we see pipeline assets that would drive future growth. Can you describe your options, options available to you in the GEP business? I think you've described incremental options. But is there something you could do in that business that's on the bolder side? Thanks very much. Ian Read : Well your characterization of something bold, going back to the issue, we have a great sense of urgency inside Pfizer to continue to accelerate returns to shareholders. So to the extent that BD will allow us to do that then I am willing to take bold actions. And I believe that the initial approach to AZ was a bold action. One that we went, one that we couldn\u2019t get to the right value equation and so the deal didn\u2019t progress. But certainly I feel a sense of urgency on utilizing our balance sheet and our capital to do deals that are incremental, add incremental value and certainly add revenue growth in the Innovative space. And we\u2019re looking at all alternatives and we\u2019re aggressively looking at all alternatives. Now in the GEP space I think we said that, I think the GEP business is somewhat difficult to analyze, I understand that but it\u2019s made up of what is really a great emerging markets business which today represents about 30% to 35% of the total GEP business and is growing. That business is based on brands and quality and out of pocket and I would model it more like I would model a consumer business frankly. And then the rest of it is around clearly LOEs which are highly profitable and managing a pipeline that\u2019s mature in the developed markets. So we\u2019re looking at ways to add additional growth levers to that business such as biosimilars which we\u2019re investing in and we\u2019re also looking at other types of acquisitions where we can use offshore cash so it\u2019s highly efficient or even where we would do acquisitions that are in specific areas such as sterile injectables but I believe there are lots of opportunities to do BD in that area so is to add growth. So I thank you for your encouragement to be bold, we\u2019re looking at bold ideas, we\u2019re looking aggressively at using BD and we have a sense of urgency. Thank you for the question. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Ian. Next question please operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets. Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Just a follow-up on the biosimilar comments earlier. Just at a higher level, could you comment more specifically at the commercial opportunity? I think it's fair to say that expectations for biosimilars have come down recently. How should we think about the process, the commercial process for your meningitis B vaccine? Thank you. Ian Read : I\u2019ll ask John to talk about biosimilars and then Albert can talk about the mening B. Thank you. John Young : So thanks for the question Alex. So I mean the first thing to say is obviously the biosimilars market is really one that is still evolving. We\u2019re still seeing regulators around the world put into place their guidance around biosimilarity and the development pathway for biosimilars. And so must that is the first comment to make is that marketplace is still an evolution that said it\u2019s estimated by independent analysts as being a market that is around about $100 billion globally. Their biotherapeutics marketplace overall that biotherapeutics marketplace is going to grow to about $250 billion by 2020. And so the market for biosimilars in that context potentially could grow as a market opportunity from around about $1 billion today to about $18 billion by 2020. And those are the sort of general ranges that you actually see from independent analysts about the potential for this marketplace. So I think beyond saying that we see it as being a significant opportunity and saying that we believe we\u2019re well-placed with our first wave of biosimilar assets which is commented already we\u2019re progressing as expeditiously as we can, and we believe we\u2019ll be well-placed in that marketplace. I think the general comment would be that clearly there is much water to flow under that bridge, but we\u2019re continuing to be very actively engaged in both monitoring and also engaging with regulators in this space. Ian Read : Albert? Albert Bourla : Yes, mening B vaccine, mening B disease is as stated is characterized by rapid onset, has very high rates of fatality up to 20% of the people that mening B die from it usually within 24 hours, mainly who have survived will have permanent long-term sequelae. So this introduction it is an important product for the patients to start with and addresses a high unmet medical need. On the commercial front we believe that will give us a modest contribution to our revenue plan given the magnitude of our Vaccines business. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Albert. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Holford from Jefferies. Jeff Holford - Jefferies Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just going back to the capital allocation, timing of business development, for Ian, really, just wondering around what your thoughts are about a potential for tax reform now that this has become such a focus for everybody do you potentially get paid to wait on doing business development? It depends on what your view is around the likelihood of that happening into next year. Just wondering of you could talk about some of that. Thank you. Ian Read : Jeff, I think it\u2019s an interesting question. I mean clearly there is a dynamic going on about what\u2019s you\u2019re willing to pay for inversions vis-\u00e0-vis what you believe is the opportunity for fundamental reform in the U.S. I think we\u2019ll know a little bit more after the midterm elections, but in historically you don\u2019t get tax reform unless the President of the United States puts a lot of his credibility and ways behind it they are just too many fractions and too many ways of dividing the cake and the need the -- you really need the White House to take a lead in that. And so if you were betting man, you would suspect that fundamental tax reform would not occur until post the 16 Presidential elections. But in politics you never know it\u2019s day-to-day, so we\u2019ll look at that after the November 4th and continue to factor in the elements you comment in what we think the value of an inversion is worth. Thank you for the question. Chuck Triano : Thanks Ian. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Vamil Divan - Credit Suisse My first question is on the BD side. You touched on a couple of things like sterile injectables and maybe immuno-oncology. Are there any other areas that you highlight in terms of where you are looking to do more investing in? Do you really have a preference between investing on the innovative side of your business as opposed to the more established side? My second question, just following up on your comments around Xeljanz, earlier, you mentioned as being using more now in methotrexate-free regimens, I believe, so, have these patients actually tried TNFs, or is it before TNFs? And anything you can update on your latest timelines around resubmitting into EU? Thanks. Ian Read : Okay so, on the business development I think in the GEP business there is a wide range of opportunities that stem from local investments using offshore cash to larger type of investments to have capabilities and how to make generics, we just did a small acquisition in that area, on InnoPharma. So there are multitude of opportunities and that\u2019s what John is looking at and going through and trying to isolate what the best opportunities would be from a point of view of do we have a preference between GEP or Innovative, everything is driven by value and portfolio balance and you would expect a larger scale acquisition to potentially cover both businesses it may not do, so those are all the things we factor in. And then there was a question on Xeljanz. Geno Germano : And so on Xeljanz about half the patients on Xeljanz have gone from methotrexate to Xeljanz and about half of them have been on a biologic, one or more biologics, so it's a mix and then in terms of resubmitting in Europe we intend to resubmit late in 2015 to the Europeans. Chuck Triano : Thank you, Geno. In interest of everybody\u2019s time operator if you can take one more question please. Operator : Your final question comes from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink. Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners Thanks for the question. So just wondering if Mikael could talk to us a little bit about the differences in the bococizumab clinical trial design versus competitors and your views on the -- on how that is differentiated from competitors and why you think bococizumab is going to be a competitive offering in that space. Ian Read : Okay. Seamus we -- Geno tried to do it so I\u2019ll give Mikael a chance to make it clearer this right around. And Geno should feel free to add anything, if he thinks Mikael hasn\u2019t covered it. Mikael Dolsten : I\u2019ll build on Geno\u2019s excellent description why we think that the way we are developing bococizumab and importantly the learnings we did in Phase 2b to be that was very extensive that allowed us to design what we think is a very comprehensive broad Phase 3 program, so a couple of key takeaway messages. One, our Phase 3 program includes population for both primary and secondary prevention. We think there will be a growing opportunity for patients that are at high risk in primary prevention such as diabetics with a high risk equivalent for cardiovascular disease and to the best of our knowledge, we had only see outcome trial program that includes primary prevention. Number two restructured it in two different trials one addressing individuals that cannot get down to 100 or below and that allow us to show most likely a substantial risk reduction in cardiovascular disease since this is the segment where we expect a strong correlation between lowering cholesterol and lowering risk for CV events. The second trial really focusing on bringing patients in the 70 to 100 segment with high risk, both primary and secondary prevention patients down really low in cholesterol and we think that will allow us to open up unmet need in that area further by generating data. I should say that the dose regimens that we developed in Phase 2b is really crucial for the study design and we developed the dosing regimen that allow us to start with a high dose and get immediately down patients to low levels. And only if necessary do a dose titration with lower dose of bococizumab. We do think bococizumab is one of the most potent antibodies that showed really pronounced lowering of cholesterol that performs well in every two weeks and we have said earlier that through a partnership with Halozyme we have in our longer life cycle management plan exploration of once a month after first ensuring generating good data in the current regimen. John Young : Yes that Halozyme to us I think the exclusivity on that technology. Mikael Dolsten : Thank you, John. Chuck Triano : Thank you, Mikael and John so thank you and everybody this morning for your time. Ian Read : Thanks for your time everybody. Bye, bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s Pfizer\u2019s third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. This does conclude the call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Chuck Triano : Thank you, Operator. Good morning and thanks for joining us today to review Pfizer's fourth quarter 2014 performance. I am joined today as usual by our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Frank D Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Albert Bourla, President of Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer; Geno Germano, President of Global Innovative Pharma; John Young, President of Established Pharma; and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel. The slides that will be presented on this call can be viewed on our homepage pfizer.com by clicking on the link for Pfizer Quarterly Corporate Performance Fourth Quarter 2014, which is located in the Investor Presentations section in the lower right hand corner of this page. Before we start, I\u2019d like to remind you that our discussion during this call will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer's 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. Discussions during the call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's current report on Form 8-K dated today January 27, 2015. We will now make prepared remarks and then we will move to the Question-and-Answer session. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian? Ian Read : Thank you, Chuck and good morning everyone. We finished 2014 with another quarter of good performance, and met or exceeded every element of our financial guidance for the year. Frank will take you through the numbers, but before he does I want to reemphasize how our four key imperatives have guided the actions we\u2019ve taken, and the decisions we\u2019ve made and will continue to guide us going forward. These imperatives are about the steps we're taking to create a sustainable, high-value pipeline; effectively and in a disciplined way deploy our capital and ways to create shareholder value; create a culture where colleagues take appropriate risks and accept accountability for their actions and own the respect of society. My remarks today will primarily focus on two of these imperatives; the evolution of our pipeline; and how we're creating shareholder value. When we started this journey at the start of 2011, we said improving the performance of our innovative core will be a multi-year endeavor. Over this time we\u2019ve significantly changed the composition of our pipeline to have a clearer focus on the therapeutic areas that have strong commercial and scientific potential. We\u2019ve improved progress in the pipeline. Since undertaking this effort, we\u2019ve received 16 approvals as of the end of last year, 10 of which were new molecular entities. Today we\u2019ve a total of 86 programs in clinical development with 29 programs in late-stage development or registration. We continue to grow in key areas most notably in some of our recently launched new products. Eliquis is winning share amongst cardiologists and moving towards the leading position in the new-to-brand share and several markets including the US and Japan. We grew our Xeljanz market share so that it is now ranks number three in new-to-brand prescription share with rheumatologists and we are seeing good uptake of our Prevnar 13 Adult vaccines following the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on immunization practices recommendation. This is good progress and over the course of the next four years we expect to have more than 20 Phase 2 and Phase 3 registration starts and hope to have more than 15 potential approvals, many of them new molecular entities. These numbers do not include study starts and approvals as a result of our Merck KGaA partnership in immuno-oncology. Many of the new molecular entities have the potential to be first-in-class assets that give us growth platforms. These include the CDK 4/6 platform in oncology with [Ibrance] or the generic name palbociclib. And its potential for indication is being studied in the broad spectrum of breast cancer as well as lung, prostate, head and neck, melanoma, ovarian, renal and brain tumors in young children. We expect to have a competitive immuno-oncology program. We believe we\u2019ve a comprehensive program with all the elements to be an industry leader. Through our partnership with Merck KGaA and their anti-PD-L1 Avelumab, we're able to accelerate our participation in the immuno-oncology space enabling both companies to participate in the first wave of potential single-agent monotherapy treatment regimens of several tumor types, some of which we expect to be first or second to market. Additionally through this partnership, we're positioned to be a potential leader in the next wave of I/O combination therapies. We expect to be amongst the first three companies in certain cancer indications with monotherapy and a leader with combinations of PDL-1 Avelumab with targeted agents. For example Inlyta, Xalkori and second generation ALK; or dual I/O combinations for example for 4-1BB,OX40, ADCs etcetera and in various cancer indications. This year we\u2019ll be collaborating on up to 20 studies with Merck KGaA with registrational intent on up to six of these studies. In addition through the collaboration, we expect to have five different I/O drugs in the clinic this year and up to 10 by 2016. This strategy includes checkpoint inhibitor maps, small molecule immunomodulators, cancer vaccines, bifunctional anti-bodies, CAR-T cell-based therapy and anti-body drug conjugates. Our partner expects to present data from their PDL-1 study at ASCO in June. To the best of our knowledge, it is one of the most comprehensive I/O platforms in development in the pharma industry today. We also have leading research on [indiscernible] biology with potential new indications with Xeljanz in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis with our old product. Atopic dermatitis with a topical formulation, new GA indications and Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease and [ankylosing] spondylitis. We\u2019ve what we believe is a differentiated approach within the PCSK9 area for hyperlipidemia. Our lead asset bococizumab has a differentiated clinical [indiscernible] design which includes high-risk patients and also assesses primary prevention for patients. In addition to this large module approach, we\u2019ve both a small molecule and a vaccine in development nearing first in human. We\u2019ve made progress with anezumab and plan to submit preclinical data to the FDA this quarter in a complete response to potentially lift the clinical hold on that program. In the rare disease area we're seeing good progress with enrolment in cardiomyopathy Phase 3 programs with Tafamidis, and are advancing towards Phase 3 with Rivipansel, pending our discussion with the FDA on the final optimization of the formulation. We\u2019ve just announced a collaboration with OPKO for a long-acting growth hormone product that we believe could also be first in class if we were to expend that market. We\u2019ve a broad biosimilars portfolio of complex monoclonals. Of the current pipeline of five assets, three are ongoing, we're enrolling Phase 3 trials and include potential biosimilars to Herceptin, Rituxan and Remicade. We\u2019ve completed the Phase I trial for Avastin and expect to initiate our Phase 3 study later this year. And we've an ongoing Phase I proof-of-concept for [indiscernible]. We believe, we can become one of the world\u2019s pre-eminent biosimilar companies. We\u2019ve also several potential acceleration opportunities in the pipeline and that includes a next-generation ALK ROS1 inhibitor that holds the potential to significantly extend the lives of the patients who no longer respond to Xalkori. We expect to start a pivotal study this year. As you know our Staph aureus vaccine is currently in Phase 2 clinical trials and was granted Fast Track Designation by U.S. Food and Drug Administration in February 2014. A Phase 2b study that could be registrational is scheduled to start around the middle of this year. I am pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made in a relatively short period of time in terms of the quality of the assets in our pipeline and the potential for delivering breakthrough products starting in late 2017 and 18. Turning next to how the prudent deployment of capital has yielded significant returns to our shareholders. Over the last four years, we\u2019ve maintained our operating margins and have taken approximately $5.5 billion out of our operating expenses. During a period where we lost significant revenue to LOEs and co-promote expiries from several high margin products like Lipitor Enbrel in Canada and US and the loss of Spiriva. This year and for the next couple of years ongoing expense reductions will result from continuous improvement efforts. However given that the largest opportunities have already been realized, the amount of potential reductions is more limited. Also there are certain areas where we\u2019ll continue to invest in such as R&D and new product launches. Further we have returned just over 64 billion to shareholders with share repurchases and dividends over the last four years. And we\u2019ve worked to -- as we have worked to transform Pfizer, business development has been an important enabler of our strategy. We\u2019ve entered into a series of partnerships and license agreements and made some acquisitions that bolstered our vaccines portfolio, enhanced our established products portfolio, strengthened our oncology pipeline, expanded our consumer portfolio, and fortified the set of actions we\u2019ve across our key therapeutic areas. Given the strength of our late and mid-stage pipeline, we\u2019ll evaluate business development opportunities biased towards deals with a potential for creating value in the near term. Beyond business development, here is what you can expect to see from us in terms of additional actions we plan to take in 2015 to create shareholder value. We\u2019ll continue to invest in the launch of new products. We're excited about the potential revenue and continued growth prospects primarily for Eliquis, Xeljanz, Prevnar 13 Adult, Trumenba, Inlyta, Xalkori and Nexium 24HR. We expect these products along with a few others Vyndaqel, [indiscernible] and vaccines acquired from Baxter including pipeline\u2019s pending approval will generate nearly $2 billion in incremental operational revenue growth this year compared to last. So while we expect product launch costs will increase approximately 25% year-over-year, we're seeing good leverage from the investment we are making in these products. In addition to new products, in new launch products the Innovative business will be focused on growing market share in inline brands like Lyrica, Enbrel outside the US, [indiscernible] in the US, Chantix and the Prevnar franchise. In our consumer business we are focused on growing its core brands Advil and Centrum. Growing Nexium OTC market share and continuing to pursue our Rx OTC switch opportunities. For our established business we\u2019ll build on our success in 2014 in providing high-value, high-quality, low-cost treatments in emerging markets. We expect to see operational revenue growth of mid to high-single digits in the emerging markets this year by focusing on opportunities in key growth markets which is China, Brazil, India, Russia and Turkey. In 2015, we will continue our efforts to reach the groundwork required to be in a position to operationalize a potential to the company, and we\u2019ve made good progress on this work. For 2015, we anticipate the efforts that will be required for this work will result from approximately 400 million of one-time cost on a pre-tax basis. Let me remind you at this point in time we\u2019ve not yet made a decision with the company. We\u2019ve said the final decision will depend upon how our businesses perform in their markets, having a high degree of confidence that the businesses will be successful as stand-alone entities. And how our shareholders value these businesses if the sum of the parts is greater and whole. And in 2015, we\u2019ll again be in a position to reduce our adjusted effective tax rate. We expect it will decrease from 26.5% in 14 to approximately 25% this year. We\u2019ll continue to manage our tax line as we do any of our expense line and look to be as efficient as possible. I would note that foreign exchange is one of those items that can either work for us or against us. Most importantly, it is not indicative of how the business is performing in a fundamental manner. As always all of our decisions will be rooted in how best to strike the right balance in terms of capital deployment, dividends, buybacks and business development. One of the reasons I'm confident that we can accomplish all of this is because we\u2019ve an employee body that is motivated and engaged in the successful execution of the initiatives we\u2019ve undertaken to drive results. Over the past four years, we\u2019ve created a culture engrained in a strong ownership environment. In summary, we'll build on a performance of the past four years to create sustainable, high-value pipeline; to have market-leading, strong commercial businesses; to manage our cost structure; and continue to be disciplined in how we deploy our capital. Collectively these elements of our strategy, it will allow us to generate results that continue to create value, shareholder value. And it will enable us to bring the patients innovative medicines that best meet their needs. Now I\u2019ll turn over to Frank for additional details in the quarter, the year and our financial guidance for 2015. Thank you. Frank D Amelio : Thanks Ian, and good day everyone. As always the charts I am reviewing today are included in our webast. I want to remind everybody that as a result on the full disposition of Zoetis on June 24, 2013, the financial results of the animal health business and the gain associated with its full disposition are reported as a discontinued operation in the consolidated statements of income for the twelve months ended December 31st 2013. Fourth quarter 2014 reported revenues of approximately $13.1 billion which reflects a slight operational increase of $9 million year-over-year. It was mainly driven by the strong performance of Lyrica, Prevnar and Eliquis in developed markets, and Xeljanz which grew primarily in the US. And 7% operational growth in emerging markets driven by Lipitor mainly in China as well as Prevnar and Enbrel which were offset mainly by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of approximately $249 million or 3%, the loss of exclusivity for Celebrex in the US, desperation of the co-promotion term, the collaboration agreement for Enbrel in the US and Canada, determination of the Spiriva collaboration in certain countries and other product losses of exclusivity in certain markets. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.54 versus $0.56 in the year-ago quarter. The decrease is primarily due to a $0.01 negative impact in the foreign exchange, a 4% aggregate operational increase of adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses driven by an unfavorable change in product mix and increased R&D expenses due to incremental expenses for the ongoing Phase 3 program of bococizumab, of palbociclib, ertugliflozin and certain other new drug candidates as well as potential new indications for previously approved products especially for Xeljanz. Adjusted SI&A expenses however decreased by 2% operationally because of continued benefits from cost reduction of productivity initiatives partially offset by investment to support several recent product launches and other inline brands. Adjusted diluted EPS is favorably impacted by a lower effective tax rate and few diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which declined by 159 million shares versus the year-ago quarter due to ongoing share purchases. Reported diluted EPS was $0.19 compared with $0.39 in the year-ago quarter due to the previously mentioned factors and the unfavorable impact of the charge for the 850 million upfront payments associated with the Global Strategic Alliance formed with Merck KGaA in November of 2014, and an additional amount of approximately $300 million reflecting the fair value of certain co-promotional rights for Xalkori granted to Merck KGaA. Higher charges related to certain legal matters as well as the higher effective tax rate, all of which were partially offset by lower restructuring charges, and purchase accounting adjustments in the fourth quarter of 14 versus the prior year quarter. Foreign exchange negatively impacted fourth quarter adjusted revenues by $453 million or 3% and positively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses and the aggregate by $351 million or 4%. As a result foreign exchange negatively impacted fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.01 compared with the year-ago quarter. Now moving on to the financial highlights of our business segments. In the fourth quarter, Global Innovative Pharmaceutical revenues increased 6% operationally year-over-year due to the strong operational growth from Lyrica, primarily in the US and Japan; and the performance from recently launched products including Eliquis globally and Xeljanz primarily in the US, all of which was somewhat offset by the previously mentioned expiration of the co-promotion term for Enbrel in the US and Canada. Income before taxes declined 5% operationally due to a 5% operational increase in cost of sales; a 25% operational increase in SI&A expenses due to increased investment in new products such as Eliquis and Xeljanz and certain inline brands; and a 25% operational increase in R&D expenses due to incremental investments in late-stage pipeline products namely bococizumab, ertugliflozin and additional Xeljanz indications. Fourth Quarter VOC revenues increased 14% operationally due primarily to strong performance of Prevnar 13 Adult in the US and Xalkori globally, Inlyta in most markets and [indiscernible] in emerging markets as well as Nexium 24HR in the US. Income before taxes increased 13% operationally mainly due to increased revenues which were partially offset by a 12% operational increase in cost of sales driven by increased sales volumes. As a percentage of revenue, cost of sales decreased by thirty basis points due to a favorable change in product mix. A 13% operational increase in SI&A expenses due to investment in Prevnar Adult as well as launch and pre-launch expenses for Trumenba and Ibrance, and a 17% operational increase in R&D expenses due to increased investment in the Ibrance and Trumenba development programs, and the global alliance with Merck KGaA. In the fourth quarter, Global Established Pharmaceutical revenues decreased 7% operationally year-over-year due to loss of exclusivity of Celebrex in the US, Detrol LA in the US and Aricept in Canada as well as determination of the co-promotion agreement for Spiriva in most countries including the US. All of these were partially offset by a 7% operational growth in the emerging markets and the strong performance of Lyrica in Europe. Income before taxes declined operationally 9% due to the decrease in revenues, a 5% operational increase or a 2.3 percentage point increase as percentage of revenues and cost of sales due to LOEs and unfavorable changes in product mix; and a 5% operational increase in R&D expenses primarily due to our biosimilars development program partially offset by lower clinical trial expenses. All of which were partially offset by a 17% operational decrease in SI&A expenses driven by cost reduction and productivity initiatives. As you can see in 2014 we met or exceeded all components of our annual financial guidance. Now I would like to walk you through the 2015 guidance ranges for reported revenues, reported diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS relative to our 2014 actual results. First, it's important to note that the 2015 reporting revenues incorporate an anticipated 3.5 billion, negative impacts due to continuing product losses of exclusivity and declining Alliance revenues which will be partially offset by expected operational growth in certain other products. In addition we expect foreign exchange to have an additional $2.8 billion negative impact on reported revenues. Consequently, we expect 2015 reported revenues to be in the range of $44.5 billion to $46.5 billion. Before moving on, I want to point out that the actual mid-January 2015 rates used to determine our 2015 guidance do not include the impact of a potential devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar or any other currency. Reported diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS also include the negative impact from product losses of exclusivity, a $0.17 negative impact from foreign-exchange rates, and a negative $0.03 impact from the pending transaction of OPKO. As a result, we expect reported diluted EPS to be in the range of a $1.37 to a $1.52 and adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2 to $2.10. In addition I want to remind everyone that guidance ranges for both reported and adjusted diluted EPS incorporates $6 million of anticipated share repurchases in 2015, including 715 million of our shares repurchased to date. These repurchases were more than offset by the potential dilution related to employee compensation programs. In summary, if you exclude the FX impacts and the impact of the pending OPKO transaction, our fiscal year 2015, adjusted diluted EPS guidance midpoint is in line with full-year 2014 actual results despite the $3.5 billion negative impact from expected product LOEs and declining alliance revenues. Now I\u2019ll review the remaining elements of our 2015 financial guidance. We expect cost of sales and percentage of revenue to be in the range of 18.5% to 19.5%. We expect adjusted SI&A expenses to be in the range of $12.8 billion to $13.8 billion. We expect adjusted R&D expenses to be in the range of $6.9 billion to $7.4 billion which includes a planned upfront payment of $295 million to OPKO expected in the first quarter of 2015 upon completion of the transaction announced in December of 2014. We also expect adjusted income to be approximately $500 million. And we expect our tax rates on adjusted income to be approximately 25%. Moving on to key takeaways, we achieved or exceeded all elements of our full-year 2014 financial in an environment that continues to be challenging. We advanced our strategy through pipeline advancement and business development. The FDA approved Trumenba, our meningitis B vaccine and we announced that we are in labeling discussions with the FDA for Ibrance. And we entered into a collaboration with Merck KGaA which positions us well to potentially compete in the first wave of immuno-oncology therapies and be a leader in the second wave of combination therapies. Our full-year 2015 reported revenue guidance range includes the anticipated negative impact of $3.5 billion with the product losses of exclusivity of $2.8 billion due to adverse changes in foreign exchange, partially offset by nearly $2 billion of anticipated operational revenue growth in certain products. And the adjusted diluted EPS guidance range includes a $0.17 negative impact from foreign exchange and a $0.03 negative impact from the planned upfront payment to OPKO. We continue to create shareholder value through prudent capital allocation. Overall in 2014 we returned nearly 12 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. From 2011 through 2014 we returned more than 64 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In addition in 2015, we anticipate returning approximately $13 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And finally we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2015 and beyond. Now I will turn it back to Chuck. Chuck Triano : Thank you sir. Operator can we please poll for questions. Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin : Thank you very much. Ian, just a question for you sort of high-level. Based on all of the press reports that we are all reading everyday, it sounds like you're intensely focused on landing a large target and these articles are all saying those companies are rebuffing you. I think this is a great opportunity for you to sort of remind us what are your strategic objectives? Do you have to make a large transaction and if so, is it -- I mean it would seem to me that it's the GEP business that would need the biggest growth drivers, or is it the other areas of the business? If you could just sort of prioritize for us, which of the areas of the business make most sense for you for a large transaction if indeed that's what you believe you need? And then just a second question, and may be this is for Frank. On the GEP business is it permissible for you guys to buy a foreign company and use it as a new address when you potentially go to spin out if you decide to do so in your GEP business, is that actually an option? Thanks very much. Ian Read : Thank you Jami for the question. You know rumors are rumors. We don\u2019t comment on rumors or speculation or what they write in the press. I will go back to my comment on BD and neighbors strategy. Our strategy is to deploy our capital the way that is shareholder friendly. We\u2019ve been doing that, we\u2019ve done some buybacks and we have been doing BD. You know I would look at BD as a potential always to accelerate incremental value to shareholders. That's the purpose of deploying that capital, strengthening our businesses and we look at all opportunities to do that. But we do that in a disciplined manner. You know we did not push, we only did what was reasonable to do the AZ deal. I don't feel that we need to do a large deal. I do believe though that we can deploy capital in a way that it can improve return to shareholders. Frank D Amelio : And then Jami on the second question where you were specific to the GEP business and I think the question was buying a foreign company and potentially changing the address. Now my answer is it\u2019s kind of one of those things that's almost impossible to speculate upon. You know it's very situational. It depends on lots of things, valuations, markets and the like, and tax reforms is an ongoing area where I think that's still subject to change. So I don't want to speculate on that, you know it may or may not happen as a result of some hypothetical acquisition I would say. Chuck Triano : Operator, can we move to the next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Chris Schott : Great, thanks very much, just a couple of questions here. It\u2019s first for Ian. I believe you mentioned that your business development is now focused on creating value in the near-term given the way of stage pipeline. I guess if it\u2019s a shift from the prior focus of what we are thinking about in 2014? And then the second question on business development, when you look at valuations resetting kind of across the biopharma space, is that reducing the opportunity set as you look at these targets given the valuation discipline you piloted for Pfizer? Ian Read : Well I think you know if we would have seen -- we would have been concerned about the state of our research and if we hadn\u2019t strengthened our research as we did with the deal with Merck on the immuno-oncology asset, then we may have felt we needed to do more business development in acquiring assets in our research. But I feel our research pipeline middle-stage, late-stage is strong and I would rather take our capital right now and direct it to opportunities to accelerate the EPS growth as I think we\u2019ve got the right balance of capital allocation in the medium to long-term and on the innovative side. So it\u2019s just with your balance of where you are deploying your capital and where you think you\u2019ve areas you want to strengthen. That been said, if there was a piece of intellectual property that added huge value we thought, we could develop it and we would not be shy in acquiring that intellectual property. I do think that the values are high at the moment in many sectors. We're disciplined, but you know when we find an appropriate deal that will meet our strategies of strengthening our businesses and accelerating shareholder value, we feel very comfortable that we\u2019ve the ability to do those deals. Chuck Triano : Operator, next question please. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI. Mark Schoenebaum : Thank you very much for taking the question. First of all congrats to Frank, great P&L management this quarter and also for the guidance. If I may ask some R&D questions on the PCSK-9 program, could you just update us if you would be willing to do so on the timelines and the enrolment status for the outcomes trials on the PCSK-9 program. Number two, I was intrigued by your comments during the prepared remarks on immuno-oncology where you -- I think you mentioned that how you thought you would be among the first three companies to launch in several or a few tumor types. I\u2019ve been wondering if you would be willing to tell us what tumor types you think that could be. And then finally on palbo and I suppose this is more of a commercial question. And just as we all contemplate a near-term launch as a clear possibility, can you help us frame the initial market opportunities. Do you expect this to be a very rapid cancer watch or something with a little bit more tempered since these women have a standard of care today. Thank you. Ian Read : Thank you Mark, good questions. Perhaps Geno can address the PCSK-9 status and then I\u2019ll ask that we -- we\u2019ll then move to answer your questions on palbo and which products that we can give you first or second in from Albert. Geno? Geno Germano : Sure, thanks Mark. Regarding the PCSK-9 program, our outcomes trial, we're in the process of ramping up you know site initiation, enrolment. This is something we monitor frankly on a daily and weekly basis. So we are making good progress there. We expect to be competitive with the other programs from Amgen and Sanofi in terms of timing for a completion of those outcomes trials, you know which we currently see occurring in late 17 or 18 timeframe. Ian Read : Thank you, Geno. Albert? Albert Bourla : Yes on the question on the initial Ibrance launch update, we're very excited about this initial launch for two main reasons. First we have not seen an approval of a new therapy in the first line advanced cancer in more than ten years, so there is a great unmet need. And secondly Ibrance has demonstrated not only a statistical significant improvement, but more importantly a clinically meaningful benefit to patients. Because that would be our first and added 10 months to respond to [indiscernible]. As a result we expect the uptake to be robust. Having said that, as with [indiscernible] there will be some oncology, but it will [indiscernible] adapter. But while others will wait for additional data or more experience in the field. But for this group we already have four Phase 3 trials ongoing, two of which are expected to complete this year. When you say that we're working to build a broad franchise on breast cancer. We're starting with first line metastatic breast cancer. But then we're moving fast to the current breast cancer and then to early breast cancer. And we would like to remind everyone what we're currently running Phase 3 pivotal registration enabling studies for all of these indications. Now to your question on immuno-oncology. As Ian said, the deal is transformational for our immuno-oncology program for two reasons. And the first it is that they enable us to quickly move into the first wave of potential monotherapy treatments. You asked for some examples of that, the examples would be ovarian or gastric for example. And this is where we're going to see to put our emphasis rather than on indications that are more crowded as melanoma for example. But then for the second also benefit which enable us to accelerate our combinations program by more than 2.5 years. This accelerates in conjunction with our broad range of combination assets Xeljanz, Inlyta, Ibrance, our gross inhibitor OX40, 4-1BB would enable us to be the leading player in the second wave where we see also a much greater portion of the bite. Chuck Triano : Operator next question please. Operator : The next question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank. Gregg Gilbert : Thanks good morning and a couple of unrelated questions. Firstly and to slice the M&A question a different way. It's clear you have a sense of urgency to find deals that could be if there is shareholder enhancing. Can you care to comment on the sense of urgency that supplement the innovative versus the established products? You\u2019ve made it clear that you\u2019ve got near-term sort of accretion or value accretion versus long term. But I want to make sure we understand that you are so committed to both or is one taking precedence. Secondly can you comment on Lyrica CR, obviously a large product that gets almost no focus? Are you planning to attempt the filing there to protect some of that franchise longer term. And lastly Albert, can you comment on Prevnar Adult versus pediatric in progress there? And maybe share some color around the split between those two important buckets. Thank you. Ian Read : Okay, Geno do you want to talk about Lyrica first and then Albert can talk about the vaccine and I will come back on our BD preferences or priorities. Geno Germano : Yeah so Gregg on the Lyrica program we continue to advance the CR program for Lyrica. We\u2019ve completed several trials and seen positive outcomes. So we will continue to move towards a registration and we expect to see registration potentially ahead of the expiration of the exclusivity in the United States. Albert Bourla : Yes, Gregg on the adult, although early we're very pleased with the launch. And we believe this is potentially a very large and doable opportunity given current demographics and the aging trends. The adult sales in US were around $250 million which was driven by higher penetration during the high flu season and of course also some inventory stocking with new customers. Our market share down to almost four times to 45% from 12 originally. Growth, moving forward we still expect to be strong throughout the year. Of course keep in mind, but this quarter is influenced by seasonality and some inventory build and that can vary quarter by quarter. On the pediatric that you asked, pediatric in fact was down this quarter due to the timing of the CDC purchase, but last year occurred in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter and the [indiscernible]. Ian Read : Thank you on the urgency to do business development, let me stress. The urgency I\u2019ve is to create shareholder value and if business development can do that, then we will move on business development with urgency. I don't really have a preference between strengthening either of our businesses. I think we can use this development to improve and strengthen both of them and we will look at the deals and if the deals make sense we\u2019ll attempt to execute them. Chuck Triano : Thank you. Operator next question please. Operator : The next question comes from Tim Anderson from Bernstein. Tim Anderson : Hi I am sorry. It\u2019s the same line of questioning but on inversion. So is that in your view pretty much off the table at this point for Pfizer? Is that still something that you think you can pursue and then also on inversion, any visibility on when or whether Treasury might come out with a second round of regulations? And then on the pipeline, apart from palbo if you had to take two compounds that excite you the most, what would those be? Ian Read : Okay so on the inversion, Tim. You know inversions have not been stopped. So what the potential rules of the government have done is delayed the value or potentially delayed the value realization of the inversion. So you know inversions I think are being tempered by the ability to pay the target price given the slow realization of the inversion values. You know I think it's an area that will remain fertile while there is no change in the US tax laws. I think it's -- we are in a very uncompetitive situation with our tax code. And inversions will continue to be important as an instrument increasing shareholder value just depending on the price you need to pay to the inversion. And the exact conditions of the inversion which are very technical depending on how you can manage your subsequent cash flows. So it\u2019s a very -- it's not an easy general answer to what type of inversion you would want to do. And apart from palbo you know I think we\u2019ve a lot of exciting products. I would probably talk about the ability to bring the staph aureus vaccine to market as quickly as possible. I think you know bococizumab clearly has a huge potential. I think we are well placed with the clinical trial design. [indiscernible] is well positioned. Adult vaccine which we\u2019ve just launched has a huge potential. So I find it difficult to really take just two assets. I think we have a lot of assets that we can create value from and especially the total life cycle of palbociclib. So the new Treasury regulations, you know I don't know. I mean I'm not in Washington, I can't comment. They have published a rule, they haven't finalized a rule. And you know clearly there is an intent to do that. There is an intent to make it somewhat more problematic or for people to plan inversions and we will just have to work around that. Thank you. Chuck Triano : Thank you. Operator moving on please. Operator : Your next question comes from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Vamil Divan : Yeah thanks for taking the questions. So I have two, one I guess, the first one is more for Ian. Obviously a lot of discussion around the M&A and what you guys are looking to do. I guess just strategically you know some comments earlier about valuations and people you're approaching and maybe not you know wanting to go ahead with the deal. I think strategically isn\u2019t it tougher for you to consummate a deal when you are being so public talking about the need to do something and the near-term focus that you are mentioning. Now doesn\u2019t that make it tougher to get a deal done and doesn\u2019t it just raise the prices higher. And then second one is more on the pipeline. If you could talk about I/O, I appreciate the comments you gave earlier and thanks for all that. Can you talk a little bit about kind on the biomarker side and if there\u2019s anything you can share but how you are planning to incorporate biomarkers at least into the first wave of study that you\u2019ve outlined for this year? Thanks. Ian Read : Yeah Vamil, I am sort of intrigued by your comments. I don't think I\u2019ve ever said, we\u2019ve to do a deal. I think you are reading the press rather than what I've been saying. If I felt there was a pressure to do the deal, we would have done the deal and we're trying to do it last year. We're very disciplined. We don't feel we need to do a big deal. I do feel we have the ability and we have the balance sheet that we can use if business development can further our basic strategies which is to strengthen either one of our businesses or to acquire in an area like immuno-oncology which we did to strengthen where we see we can create synergy and values. So you know I am a little mystified about this -- your comment about you know that Pfizer sort of needs to do a deal. I think there\u2019s a lot of rumors running around. We as like any management team look at opportunities. We have the capital and the wherewithal to do the deal should we so decide. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a matter of is there a value and if there is value we can get the deal done. So I'm a little you know, I hope that puts in perspective for all of where we fit on business development deals. Good to do, if they create shareholder value, disciplined, if they don't we are not doing them. Yeah, Biomarkers. Geno Germano : Yeah so you know that's a great question on how you bring immuno quality to the next level. And first as you know we\u2019ve considerable experience in selecting and developing biomarkers from Xalkori we\u2019ve obviously linked that to the drug\u2019s efficacy and we\u2019ve also learnt how to drive uptake of that diagnostic to very high rates in the marketplace, specifically for immuno-oncology. So in our partnership on avelumab we certainly are looking at PDL-1 high versus low tumors. And the data we see really correlates as expected with high response in the PDL-1 high. But we also see responses in the PDL low. We had a second wave as you heard from Albert on the 4-1BB and OX40 for combination. We\u2019ve seen that the 4-1BB is unique in amplifying cytotoxic cells, CD8 cells. So we certainly will look for expression of those cells in the tumor. Similarly for OX40 we think it\u2019s more under CD4 side and that will be another marker to monitor. But we also have programs coming on board for T-regulatory cells that may limit the overall immuno-oncology response and tumor suppressing macrophages. And we\u2019ve assets coming within the next year or so on each of those particular subset of immuno-oncology. And of course our ADC portfolio is very much supported by diagnostics. We\u2019ve now two ADC in Phase 1 that show interesting responses and we stocked enriched pile of diagnostic for those. So I hope you get the sense that we go from standard diagnostic to more next-generation diagnostic. And we will also deal with the kind of future diagnostic looking at circulating tumor cells to make it even more easy to integrate in medical practice. So we really see us being a driver of this change and the pioneer in this area. Thank you. Chuck Triano : Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from John Boris from SunTrust. John Boris : Thanks for taking the questions. The first question, just going back to business development as an enabling strategy. Ian, I think you indicated that one of the primary reasons for the AstraZeneca transaction was the tax considerations obviously around the inversion and being able to unleash the value of the cash that you have trapped offshore. If you go back and look at the last transaction, your tax rate around that time was around 22%. You know it's gone as high as 27% not enabling you to bring that cash back. How much consideration is there that when you do a transaction how much impact on the tax rate are you willing to absorb if it is an US asset that you're looking to acquire? The second question is for Frank, you\u2019ve disclosed what the impact of foreign exchange is, can you articulate or quantify what the impact is on volume and price on growth in 2014. And then the last question on R&D and Xeljanz in EU, any update on your ability to file Xeljanz in Europe and then the implications for the Enbrel field force over there? Especially in light of Samsung filing their SB4 and anticipating to be commercializing at least [indiscernible] commercializing Enbrel in the back half and how are you going to be adjusting for that resource if you don't have Xeljanz there? Thanks. Ian Read : John thank you. As always good questions. Why don\u2019t you, Geno deal with the issue of Xeljanz in Europe and Frank can look at the volume question and I\u2019ll come back to your rather complicated question on inversions and tax rates and in that Frank will also help me out there a bit. Geno Germano : Yeah so John regarding Xeljanz and the Enbrel inflammation business in Europe. You know we remain committed to resubmitting for approval an RA for Xeljanz in Europe. We\u2019ve had recent interactions with regulators there and a discussion on our chance for resubmission. We were encouraged by those discussions. We continue to collect additional clinical data to support that resubmission and our expectations are that we will resubmit by the end of the year in 2015. Regarding Enbrel and potential competition, you know we see the introduction of biosimilars into the marketplace in Europe as something that's more evolutionary than transitionary. And we expect to continue to support Enbrel through the near term and realize you know continued support from that franchise. So I don't see a disruption at this point with the timing that we are anticipating and the impact that we see projected for biosimilars. Ian Read : And of course that market in Europe is very under-penetrated given their reluctance. So you know there is a lot of volume there that can be accessed via biosimilars as well as the original. Frank? Frank D Amelio : So John for the quarter and this is companywide, so price is +1% volume was -1%, foreign exchange was -3%, FX drove the -3% for the quarter at. And as I mentioned on my comments, we are actually up operationally by 9 million excluding foreign exchange for the quarter. For the full year price was +2%, volume was -4%, FX was -2%. You put that together and you get the -4% I reported for the year. Ian Read : Thank you and on the BD you know I think my comments on AV have always been that we looked at three components of value. One was the pipeline; two was the amount of operational energies that could be achieved; and third was the financial synergies. And you know we were disciplined in our approach, because the financial synergies were the most risky part of the equation, and in fact were made eventually more difficult to achieve by the proposals. I think the net-net answer to your question about tax rates is it all goes into the value. What is the value of the acquisition we're trying to achieve? What\u2019s the value we create to shareholders? And the tax rate just like the synergies, just like expenses, just like everything else is part of that value equation. If it works, the value works we will do the deal. If the value doesn't work we won't do the deal. But of course undeniably the foreign companies as you seen for most of the acquisitions that have occurred in the last year, foreign companies do have an advantage given their tax rate. And this is something that you know should be of a concern to the US economy. Frank D Amelio : I think the only thing I would add Ian is, John in your question you mentioned before we announced live it was 22% and we took it up to 27%. We actually took it up to 30%. When we announced live we took the tax rate from 22% to 30%. And we\u2019ve been you know, I think in an effective way being able to step it down through a combination of changes and jurisdictional mix and tax planning. We\u2019ve gone from 30 to 29 to 28. This past year, we\u2019ve had said approximately 27, we printed 26.5 on adjusted results. And now we\u2019ve got it for 2015 to approximately 25%. Chuck Triano : Thank you. Next question please operator. Operator : Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. David Risinger : Yes thanks very much. I have two questions. Frank in the context of a potential split up in the future, you have obviously set up the financials but could you please discuss the dissynergies and the risk of pro forma total cost being higher due to step-up cost if a separation were pursued in the future. And then second for Mikael, could you please discuss the top three or four pipeline readouts to watch in 2015 so specifically what clinical trial readouts are most important to focus on? Thank you. Ian Read : Please, Frank. Frank D Amelio : So Dave, the way I think about the split question you asked me is, in my mind there will be basically three key determinants to obviously whether or not we separate the company. One is the performance of the businesses. The second one would be our confidence level and as businesses continue to perform successfully on a standalone basis. And then three would be how the market values of those businesses and quite frankly is there an opportunity to create a tax efficient way of incremental value. So is the sum of the parts creating the whole, is there an ability to unlock that value? That value part of the answer in my mind would factor in the items you raised like the synergies. That's all part of the value of the question that we would have to factor in to get to a net-net positive along with the aforementioned standalone performances. Mikael Dolsten : Yeah and let me mention a couple of readouts. So obviously from [indiscernible] we are you know excited to also get to readout from our recurring study combining with [indiscernible] that Albert spoke about. Avelumab, our partnership with Merck Serono around ASCO will be the first time we start to share and update the data set. And I think there will be opportunity also later to hear about how combinations are progressing. And possibly late in the year that we will also share some date on the 4-1BB, our own trial as we're running in lymphoma. We also have the readouts in ulcerative colitis and mid of the year or so we\u2019ve topline results from induction study with Xeljanz. And please remember in Phase 2 Xeljanz has very strong induction data among the best that has been really presented in the field. And at the JPMorgan I also shared very robust and really interesting data from our MAdCAM antibody in UC. So you could really look upon UC as a space where we\u2019ve multiple interesting data sets. More near term you also have an opportunity to look at Inotuzumab in [ALL] which we\u2019ll have an analysis for complete respond or complete response with the incomplete hemitological recovery. Chuck Triano : Our next question please operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink. Seamus Fernandez : Oh, thanks very much for the questions. You know first off, maybe Frank, can you just walk us through when we\u2019ve an increased spending coming in -- well maybe not increased spending, but you know good cost controls overall. But is there a more to achieve or be taken out of the business from here where you can be opportunistic as we\u2019ve towards you know the potential loss of Lyrica, and some incremental pressures? Are we off an overall growth of trajectory on the business including the expense base as we think about 2015 plus? And then separately as we think the PCSK-9 opportunity, I think there has been a real emphasis on the outcomes from Pfizer. But Pfizer has also demonstrated an ability to succeed in the statin space without outcomes. So just wondering despite being third to market, how you would anticipate completing before perhaps outcomes are available, and could you be as a third to market product -- how would you expect to compete without outcomes, you know versus other competitors who likely won\u2019t have outcomes data, either? Thanks. Ian Read : Okay Frank on spending. Frank D Amelio : So our spending Seamus, I\u2019ve said this before. Clearly we're in the late innings in terms of having cost reduction. There is still opportunities. I think there\u2019s always opportunities. I think there continues to be opportunities and G&A for example continues to be opportunities with our portfolio as the portfolio ebbs and flows. So there\u2019s clearly opportunities related to the portfolio. And that said, it\u2019s hard. You know Ian mentioned in his comments that we\u2019ve taken out 5.5 billion in expenses, in operating expenses over the last four years. There\u2019s not another $5.5 billion for example to take, and so it\u2019s getting harder. And then if you look at our results for 2014, I\u2019ll give you the full-year numbers operationally. COGS was up 2%, SI&A was down 2%, R&D was up 9%. You know clearly that upward pressure in R&D, we printed 7.2 billion in that 2014 as an actual number we got it to $6.9 billion to $7.4 billion for 2015. That includes the 300 million upfront to OPKO. But I think R&D, you know OPKO aside is going to be in the low 7s, kind of you know going forward. So that's good upward pressure in my mind in terms of the late stage portfolio progressing in a good way. So I think I am probably more than you need, but I think the short answer is there is always opportunities. But you know we don\u2019t have the same opportunities we had several years ago, from the base we\u2019ve done a much better job I think in managing the base. Ian Read : I\u2019ll just add to Frank\u2019s comments. You know that -- that what we're looking is sort of transition from dealing with some $26 billion of LOEs from 2010 through 2015. And the need to rationalize our cost base to one of the investing in the future growth which I think is basically the most desirable state to be in as the topline growth. And we're investing in our Phase 3 pipeline and our innovative products. But this management team is very good at managing our P&L and our investment and where we invest. And you know are prepared to do what\u2019s necessary if business circumstances change on our expense base. With that the other question was for Geno on [indiscernible]. Geno Germano : So Seamus, just to respond you know clearly we -- you know Pfizer has a long history and heritage in the cardiovascular space. And I think that you know we can leverage that knowledge and obviously the data from our clinical trials to determine the best approach in the marketplace. Frankly we really expect the PCSK-9 market to you know emerge as a large and attractive market with the occurrence of the outcomes data and we're kind of most focused on that. We\u2019ve obviously put our best thinking forward in our protocol designs. And should we have you know stronger data then the other companies in the cholesterol management and we will leverage that. But at this point, we\u2019ll have to wait and see how the data turns out. And again our focus is mainly on the outcomes, on our trails. Chuck Triano : Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen. Steve Scala : Thank you, I have two questions. First for Frank, is the 400 million in spend for a potential company split in non-GAAP guidance and what happens to this number in 2016? Is it the same, is it higher or is it lower? And then the second question is on pablociclib, has the FDA taken a look or do you expect it to take a look prior to April 13 at the Phase 3 trial which is underway? Thank you. Frank D Amelio : So on the 400 million Steve, it\u2019s in GAAP, it\u2019s not in adjusted. We actually called that out in the release. It\u2019s in the bridge we give you all, that bridge is from adjusted EPS to GAAP EPS. I think the bridge shows, it starts at the top. It shows $2 to $2.10 and then we\u2019ve three takeaways from that. There is purchase accounting adjustments for $0.41. There is restructuring and implementation cost that has a range of $0.13 to $0.18. And then there is a business and legal entity alignment cost which is the $400 million you allude to, which is $0.04. And that's the bridge from $2.10 $to 2.20, the 137 to 152. So in GAAP, not an adjustment. And we give you a bridge that breaks out how we get from point A to point B. In terms of 2016 quite frankly as we get towards the end of the year early next year, we will call that number out to you because a lot of that depends on how we will progress through the year, how the businesses perform. And so that's something that we will call out obviously later in this year or early in 2016. Ian Read : Albert on pablociclib [indiscernible]? Albert Bourla : Yes for Ibrance I don\u2019t want to speak [indiscernible] what the FDA would like to do but from a timing perspective we don't expect to have the results of even if the interim review of Phase 3 before the PDUFA date. And as you know we're already in the late-stage discussions for [indiscernible]. Chuck Triano : Next question please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Holford from Jefferies. Jeff Holford : Hi thanks for taking my question. The first one is for Ian which is really what do you think about business development the way you used the US cash on US targets. There is one inversion just straight M&A type deal as a potential pragmatic way to deal with the tax situation on those overseas cash assets? Do you see potential opportunities to do that and then just a few financial questions. As you want to be able to allow investors to see the value in the two separate pieces what do you think about giving mid-term guidance on the true potential separate pieces for investors to help them reach that decision and how you reach that decision. And do you think it\u2019s reasonable to assume that this is now the flow and in 2015 another flow inside the revenues and EPS going forward? And then lastly are you happy that we just extrapolate this year\u2019s tax rate going forward, are there any of the factors that we should consider? Ian Read : Okay you know I\u2019ll let Frank answer your modeling questions. On the BD in using offshore cash for offshore deals, once again it comes down to value, it comes down to you know the offshore deals often price in the fact that there is offshore cash. So you have to look at the price tag on the deals and see if they make sense. But certainly conceptually you know you have a point that it just comes down to the quality of the asset and the deals you're trying to do. And Frank on the other question? Frank D Amelio : Yeah so let me let me hit the -- Jeff, let me hit the extrapolation of the tax rates first. I think the way I will answer your question is, we step it down this year to approximately 25%. That's down from 26.5% in 14. So a nice decrease and please know that when we reduce the rate, like we do in for 2015, our intention is that that rate is sustainable for the foreseeable future. You know so that, that's how I would answer your question. In terms to trying to provide guidance beyond 2015, for tax rates. Given all the uncertainty in the tax environment, you know I think that wouldn\u2019t be a prudent thing to do. In terms of your question on BUs and providing midterm type of guidance -- I think we are getting more and more transparent I think relative to our business units. This year we started providing a very detailed income state information. Come 2015, we are going to start to provide -- you know so then we\u2019ll start to provide some balance sheet information, so we are providing more and more information. And I think it enables a lot of good extrapolation work. In terms of you know taking our guidance and peeling it down to another level, I just -- I think it's hard enough to provide annual guidance total company. You then start taking and slicing it by sub ledger detail I think. It just really creates a level of complexity that I don't think we are inclined to do. Chuck Triano : Next question please operator. Operator : Next question from Marc Goodman from UBS. Marc Goodman : Good morning. First of all can you give us an update on China? How did it perform in the quarter and how you are expecting it to perform in 2015, you know give us some trends there? Second just update on palbo overseas and what the timing is there. And then on the MAdCAM, you did provide some data. And I was curious if you could comment on the dose response. And on why it would take some while to move into Phase 3? I think you said you're going to move into Phase 3 in 2016. And then I think the Phase 2s are done, so I was curious about that. And then lastly just on Lipitor over-the-counter? I know there was one study that remains before you can go back and talk to FDA. I was curious where we stand on that and when you think you\u2019ll talking to FDA again? Thanks. Ian Read : Okay let's try and put it together. So if Albert can answer the palbo one and the Lipitor questions? Albert Bourla : Yes, we\u2019ve had discussions with European regulatory [indiscernible] on the clinical data. And it is our intention to file in the EU this year. The anticipated filing packets will build off of what was submitted to the FDA, but it\u2019s too early to provide more details on that. Coming to Lipitor, you are right. The actual use trial was completed in December of 2014 and the results are expected in the second quarter. So once we see the results, then we\u2019ll define our next steps in our efforts to being [indiscernible]. Ian Read : Okay, John China. John Young : So thanks for the question, Marc. So we continue to perform strongly in China. I\u2019ll comment on the GEP segment which is the largest segment of our business in China. Overall for the quarter, we had a growth of 13%. Overall for the year we\u2019ve had a growth of roundabout 18%. You know we continue to see as we always do in the American markets quarter to quarter fluctuation and we continue to be very satisfied by our performance in China. The segments that are you know strong for us are particularly our cardiovascular franchise with Lipitor and Norvasc performing strongly. And also a very strong performance our anti-infective business. Ian Read : Thank you, now MAdCAM. Mikael Dolsten : Yeah so thank you for noticing the very interesting dose response that we shared with you. We do think it represents possibly through human biology that at the mid-doses, 22 to 75 milligram. And in that range we possibly inhibit the autoimmune cells causing disease. While at the higher doses you may also start to interfere with -- T-cells that have a protective effect. So it is very important to have done a very thorough dose response that can allow you to select the optimal dose. And we think it may distinguish our opportunity MAdCAM versus other endocrine antibodies that may not have been able to do such a thorough dose response and pick the sweet spot. And that actually if you look at our remission dates, they really perform well versus either other published comparison, although it\u2019s historical comparison. Concerning the timelines, so we certainly see if we can accelerate it, but that relates to production of clinical trial manufacturing for potential registration study. And also to really understand how to design a study where you could best develop a drug that has this really, unique tolerability profile, both for induction and maintenance therapy and how it could play as an anchor drug across many IBD like conditions. And that's why we gave a little bit of a extended time period. And we maybe able to shorten that as we go forward. Chuck Triano : Thank you Mikael, and operator if we could take our last question, please. Operator : Your final question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital. Alex Arfaei : Good morning and I apologize if I ask redundant questions. I got disconnected briefly. Ian, from your perspective could you comment on the M&A landscape in general? Based on your conversations with management teams, are you finding willing sellers out there and is it just a matter of price? The follow up for Frank and just following up on your earlier comments, how should we think about your margins for the next couple of years? You are losing some high margin products. You\u2019ve said most of the cost cutting is done, and you are investing in launches. So is it fair to expect somewhat stable or perhaps slightly declining margins going forward? Thank you. Ian Read : So you know Alex on the price, you know willing sellers. Price always determines whether you\u2019ve a willing seller or not normally. It\u2019s just a matter of what value you want to transfer. And what I would say is I think the starting point of the prices are somewhat buoyant shall we say, given where the market place is. So that does give you some concern when you look at paying the type of prices, there are premiums you need off what we see as high valuations to begin with. So we're being disciplined in how we look at that and then would you like to answer the margin question? Frank D Amelio : Yeah, so Alex I think a very good question in terms of -- I\u2019ll call it the rhythm of the margins. There is some -- I\u2019ll call it some downward pressure on our operating margins. So we\u2019ve got $3.5 billion LOEs next year and some high margin products clearly putting some downward pressure in the operating margins. And we\u2019ve given guidance where you can obviously go through the line items and compute the numbers. That said, all of that\u2019s factored into our EPS guidance. And I want to reiterate what I said before, if you exclude foreign exchange in the outcomes transaction, the midpoint of our guidance for the next year is roughly what we printed in 2014 despite that $3.5 billion in LOEs. So we\u2019ll continue to manage our cost structure, obviously the opportunities aren\u2019t what they used to be. But there is some slight -- [Abrupt End]",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Chuck Triano : Good morning and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer\u2019s first quarter 2015 performance. I am joined here today by our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Frank D\u2019Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Albert Bourla, President of Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer; Geno Germano, President of Global Innovative Pharma; John Young, President of Established Pharma; and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel. The slides that will be presented on this call can be viewed on our homepage, pfizer.com by clicking on the link for Pfizer Quarterly Corporate Performance First Quarter 2015, which is located in the Investor Presentations section in the lower right hand corner of the page. Before we start, I\u2019d like to remind you that our discussions during this call will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer\u2019s 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. Discussions in the call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer\u2019s current report on Form 8-K dated today. We will now make some prepared remarks and then we will move to a Q&A session. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian? Ian Read : Thank you Chuck and good morning everyone. During my remarks this morning, I will briefly recap the highlights from the quarter, provide some thoughts about the pipeline and close with a few comments about actions we\u2019ve taken to strengthen our core businesses. Starting with the quarter, our performance for the quarter was solid with good performance on both top and bottom-line. Overall, revenues grew by 2% operationally even with a negative impact from the loss of exclusivity of Celebrex in U.S. and the end of Spiriva co-promotion agreement also in the U.S. In addition, we saw 12% operational growth in emerging markets, driven by both our GEP and Innovative businesses. While majority of LOEs and co-promote expiries are behind us, we still face some LOEs this year and next, making it difficult to generate revenue growth despite the strong performance of our newest products. That said, we believe the impact from any remaining LOEs will diminish over time as we continue to see a building revenue base resulting from investments we\u2019ve made in key growth areas and recent product launches. I\u2019ll touch upon some noteworthy areas. Prevenar 13 had a very strong quarter, particularly in the U.S. where revenues increased 80% this was primarily due to strong uptake amongst adults 65 years of age and older following the positive recommendation from U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices as well as the timing of government purchases for the pediatric indication compared to the year ago quarter. Revenues for the adult indication were approximately $300 million in the quarter. Physicians\u2019 response to Prevenar 13 continues to build steadily and our strong Q1 sales suggest these physicians are actively vaccinating adults who have never been vaccinated as well as those who were previously vaccinated with PNEUMOVAX from Merck. Each year several million people in the U.S. turn 65 who are eligible to receive Prevenar 13. And of those adults in the U.S. who are already 65, there are many millions eligible that have never been vaccinated or were previously vaccinated. We are increasing awareness amongst adults about the seriousness of pneumococcal pneumonia and the importance of talking to their physicians or pharmacists about vaccination to protect them from its devastating effects. We believe our efforts are increasing the sense of urgency to vaccinate and driving consumers to request the Prevenar vaccine. In December, CMS changed their guidance to cover both pneumococcal vaccines which ensures coverage for senior 65 years and older under Medicare Part D, aligning with a positive ASIP recommendations from August 2014. Eliquis is gaining significant momentum worldwide as it continues to increase share amongst cardiologists who recently -- and recently has become the number one oral anticoagulant that\u2019s NOAC prescribed by cardiologists for new to brand patients in the United States and Japan. In addition, Eliquis is now the number one NOAC prescribed by cardiologists for new to brand patients for the nonvalvular atrial fibrillation indication in the UK and Spain and we\u2019re continuing to see increasing uptake in Germany. We are pleased with the continued progress Xeljanz has made towards becoming a key product based on approvals in 40 countries in rheumatoid arthritis, launches and revenue growth of the RA indication and the initiation of filing for the potential second indication in plaques psoriasis. In the U.S. rheumatologists\u2019 satisfaction with the product continues to be positive, Xeljanz now ranks number three amongst rheumatologists in new to brand prescription share of self administrated rheumatoid arthritis therapies and is on track to become the third new to brand therapy overall in the U.S. We have put significant focus and resources behind building our oncology business. The portfolio was strengthened with some recent advancements. In February, we received accelerated approval from the FDA for Ibrance and have quickly launched in the U.S. While it is still very early, I\u2019m extremely pleased with its performance. Physicians have been embracing the product; the number of new patient starts have been increasing since the FDA approval and we are seeing early success of reimbursement to date. The Ibrance team has done a remarkable job in ensuring we were able to get the product to patients as quickly as possible following approval. We also announced this month a Phase 3 trial of Ibrance for recurrent breast cancer had met its primary endpoint of progression-free survival. We will be presenting detailed efficacy and safety results from PALOMA-3 at the upcoming ASCO. In addition, we have several presentations at ASCO including oral data presentations for our immune-oncology asset 4-1BB and avelumab, the PD-L1 being co-developed for alliance with Merck KGa. Also last week we announced another encouraging development in our oncology pipeline, a Phase 3 trial for inotuzumab met the primary end point of demonstrating a higher complete hematological remission rate in adults who relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia compared to that achieved with standard of care chemotherapy. We\u2019re discussing these data with the FDA and other regulatory agencies. The trial will continue to evaluate overall survival which is a separate primary end point; the data will be submitted for presentation at upcoming medical meetings. I believe our recent accomplishments and news flow in research and development demonstrate that we are in one of the most productive times for our pipeline. We have strong presence in the areas where the science is quickly moving where there is market potential where we believe we have clinical differentiation most importantly where the patients\u2019 needs are the greatest. Today we published a comprehensive update of the pipeline; you will see that we have a rich modality mix across small and large molecules and vaccines, novel mechanisms and potential new indications. This includes the development of bococizumab; the ongoing development of Xeljanz; a CDK 4/6 platform with Ibrance; a comprehensive immune-oncology program with our partner Merck KGa for the first wave of potential single agent mono-therapy treatment regimes with several tumor types and assets to position us for the next wave of potential I/O combination therapies including 4-1BB, OX40 and ADCs. Vaccines for Staph aureus and C difficile, a next generation ALK/ROS1 inhibitor, a world leading kinase capability with unique JAK drugs in development, a strong rare disease portfolio in the areas of hematology, neuroscience inherent to metabolic disorders and pulmonology, our novel neuroscience work in Parkinson\u2019s and our development portfolio of monoclonal biosimilars continues to progress well with full products now in Phase 3 development. In total, we have 88 programs in clinical development with the 30 programs in late stage development or registration as of today. Over the last several years, we have rebuilt the pipeline and transformed our approach to R&D and we believe we\u2019re well positioned to bring forth over the next several years therapies that will significantly improve people\u2019s lives. Now for a few comments on how we continue to take steps to expand our sources of revenue and strengthen our core businesses. As always, we continue to look for business development opportunities that will create value with the bias towards deals with a potential for creating value in the near-term. M&A activity in the pharma space has been very active recently and Pfizer regularly reviews potential opportunities but remains disciplined with our shareholders\u2019 capital to ensure transactions we may pursue generate an appropriate return for our shareholders. That is why this quarter you saw us announce two transactions, one to drive greater sustainability of GEP business over the long-term and one to expand the vaccines portfolio. Hospira is an excellent strategic fit in attractive and growing market segment including sterile injectables and biosimilars and we expect the acquisition to accelerate the growth trajectory to GEP business. We remain on track for a closing in the second half of this year. And our deal for Redvax expands our vaccine development portfolio by giving us access to a promising vaccine in preclinical development of human cytomegalovirus, a virus that can lead to serious disabilities in infants when passed from newly infected mothers to their new borns. We now have a broader marketed vaccine portfolio for preventing serious illnesses, which includes the most widely used conjugate vaccine in the world, Prevenar 13 with more than 750 million doses distributed. Remember recently approved to prevent invasive disease caused by group B meningitis in people age 10 to 25 and vaccines to protect against disease caused by group C meningitis and to help prevent tick-borne encephalitis through acquiring Baxter International\u2019s market in vaccines. As you\u2019ve heard us say on several occasions, business development is not a strategy, it is one lever of several we have available for strengthening our two basic businesses, innovative product business and established products business. This year\u2019s off to a good start with momentum in the pipeline growing, market penetration for our newest in line products and strategic additions to the portfolio. Our focus for the year will continue to be on supporting our recent new product launches, in particular Ibrance and Prevenar 13 adult, accelerating and differentiating key programs in the pipeline to deliver breakthrough products, continuing to look for attractive business development opportunities that strengthen our businesses, and doing all of these things while we deploy our capital in a way that yields the greatest value to shareholders. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Frank. Frank D\u2019Amelio: Thanks Ian, good day everyone. As always, the charts I\u2019m reviewing today are included in our webcast. First quarter 2015 reported revenues were approximately $10.9 billion and reflect operational growth of $250 million or 2% year-over-year, mainly driven by the strong performance of Prevenar 13 and Eliquis in developed markets and Lyrica, Nexium 24HR, Xeljanz and Viagra primarily in the U.S. The launch of Ibrance in the U.S. is February of this year and 12% operational growth in emerging markets which were more than offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of approximately $739 million or 7%, the loss of exclusivity in immediate multi-source generic competition for Celebrex in the U.S. in December of 2014, other product losses of exclusivity and the termination of the Spiriva co-promotion collaboration in certain countries. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.51 versus $0.57 in the year ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to a $0.04 negative impact due to foreign exchange and a $0.03 negative impact due to the 295 million upfront payment to OPKO, during the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted diluted EPS was favorably impacted by a lower effective tax rate and fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding which declined by 148 million shares versus the year ago quarter due to ongoing share repurchases which includes the partial-quarter impact of our $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement effective February 2015. Reported diluted EPS was $0.38 compared with $0.36 in the year ago quarter due to the previously mentioned factors and the favorable impact of lower legal charges which were partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. Foreign exchange negatively impacted first quarter reported revenues by $739 million or $0.07 and positively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses, and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $462 million or 7%. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.04 compared with the year ago quarter. Now moving on to the financial highlights of our business segments, in the first quarter, Global Innovative Pharmaceutical revenues increased 7% operationally year-over-year due to the strong operational growth from Lyrica, primarily in the U.S. and Japan and the performance from recently launched products including Eliquis globally and Xeljanz primarily in the U.S. Although operationally revenues increased 7% and cost of sales decreased 1%, income before taxes declined 9% operationally mainly because of a 59% operational increase in R&D expenses primarily due to the previously mentioned upfront payment to OPKO Health and to a lesser extent, an 11% operational increase in SI&A expenses due to increased investments in new products and certain in-line brands. First quarter VOC revenues increased 29% operationally due to the 51% operational revenue growth from our Global Vaccines business as a result of Prevenar 13 which grew 80% in the U.S. and 15% internationally and the inclusion of Baxter\u2019s market of vaccines in Europe, Nexium 24HR in the U.S., the launch of Ibrance in the U.S. in February and Xalkori and Inlyta globally. Income before taxes increased 41% operationally, mainly due to increased revenues with an associated improvement in gross margin, partially offset by a 19% operational increase in SI&A expenses due to investment in Prevenar 13 adult indication, Nexium 24HR and the Trumenba and Ibrance launches, and the 7% operational increase in R&D expenses due to increased investment in the Ibrance development program and the global immuno-oncology alliance with Merck KGaA and other oncology products. In the first quarter Global Established Pharmaceuticals revenues decreased 10% operationally, mainly due to the loss of exclusivity and immediate multi-source generic competition for Celebrex in the U.S. in December of 2014 and to a lesser extent from the loss of exclusivity of Lyrica in certain developed markets in Europe during the first quarter of 2015 and Zyvox IV in the U.S. in January 2015, continued generic competition for Lipitor in developed markets and determination of the Spiriva co-promotion agreement in most countries including in U.S. in April of 2014. All of these were partially offset by strong operational growth of 10% in emerging markets, driven by Lipitor; Viagra and Norvasc. Income before taxes declined 14% operationally due to the decrease in revenues and 1% operational increase or 2.1 percentage point increase as a percentage of revenues and cost of sales due to an unfavorable change in product mix. Flatter R&D expenses primarily due to increased spending in our biosimilars development programs offset by lower clinical trial expenses, all of which were partially offset by 9% operational decrease in SI&A expenses driven by cost reduction and productivity initiatives. Now, I would like to walk you through the updated full year 2015 guidance ranges for reported revenues, reported diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS relative to our 2014 actual results. I want to point out that there are no unfavorable changes to our operational outlook; we\u2019re only updating the 2015guidance ranges for these elements solely due to the negative impact of recent changes in foreign exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar from mid-January to mid-April, primarily driven by the weakening of the euro. This updated guidance assumes an FX rate for the euro of approximately $1.06. As a result, we are lowering our reported revenue range by $500 million and now expect the range to be $44 billion to $46 billion. It\u2019s important to note that the actual negative impact of foreign exchange in our full year 2015 revenues is actually greater than $500 million. However, the operational strength of our revenues is allowing us to absorb this. In addition, we are lowering our reported and adjusted diluted EPS ranges by $0.05 and now expect reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.32 to $1.47 and adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.95 to $2.05. Before moving, I want to point out that actual rates in mid-April 2015 do not include the impact of a potential devaluation of the Venezuela and Boulevard. We\u2019re reaffirming the remaining elements of our 2015 financial guidance which we issued on January 27, 2015. Moving on to key takeaways, we recorded solid financial performance in the first quarter. While we have no one favorable changes in our operational outlook for the remainder of 2015, we have updated our financial guidance solely to reflect the negative impact of recent changes in foreign exchange rates. We entered into an agreement to acquire Hospira for a total enterprise value of approximately $17 billion. Subject to the appropriate regulatory approvals, we continue to expect to complete transaction in the second half of 2015. We achieved several key R&D milestones so far in 2015 including receiving accelerated approval from the FDA for Ibrance with letrozole for first line advanced breast cancer, our Phase 3 PALOMA-3 study for Ibrance with fulvestrant met its primary efficacy end point, the FDA lifting the partial clinical hold on our tanezumab development program and we\u2019re preparing to resume Phase 3 activities with our partner Eli Lilly and the EC approved an expanded indication for the use of Prevenar 13 adults aged 18 years and older. We continue to create shareholder value through prudent capital allocation; in the first quarter of 2015 we\u2019ve returned $7.8 billion to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases. It\u2019s important to note that after repurchasing $6 billion of our common stock, the first quarter 2015 including our $5 billion accelerated share repurchase, we have already met our 2015 share repurchase target and do not currently expect to repurchase additional shares this year. We continue to expect to return approximately $13 billion to shareholders in 2015 through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2015 and beyond. Now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Chuck. Chuck Triano : Thank you, Ian and Frank. Operator, can we please poll for questions now? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI. Mark Schoenebaum : I will use my question please to ask about use of capital, if I may. I know it\u2019s something you\u2019ve discussed a lot but I think we\u2019re always interested in even subtle changes in how you answer these questions. But Ian, I was just wondering, when you think about use of capital, are you at this point, I think in the past you remarked that if the numbers make sense, you would be open to a large deal similar to the AstraZeneca proposal last year; just wanted to take your temperature on that. And then also would you in theory be interested in buying a company that in adding small molecule and DA capabilities to the established products business or do you feel that the acquisition of Hospira kind of filled the gaps that -- the main gaps that that business may have had? And finally as you look across the landscape in biotech, do you have general thoughts on biotech valuations and opportunities there? Thank you. Ian Read : I think the organization is agnostic to the size of BD; it has to be BD that will move the needle. And I\u2019m not concerned about doing a large transaction if the value was there for shareholders, vis-\u00e0-vis between adding to Innovative or adding to GEP adding to Consumer, we\u2019re driven by value; does it create value for shareholders; we have the capacity to add businesses in any one of those areas. And the last part of the question was I think valuation; I think I said last quarter, I thought that the valuation of biotech was bland; I still believe it remains there. So, it means we\u2019re very careful as we evaluate deals we -- there\u2019s probably no deal that actually occurs that we haven\u2019t looked at and evaluated, but we have a strong focus on creating shareholder value and that\u2019s what guides us. Operator : Your next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin : Thank you very much. Ian, in your prepared remarks you failed to mention tax conversions. I\u2019m just curious to know how much of a priority a tax conversion still is or unlocking the value of your overseas cash flows. And if you were to abide by the current IRS laws today, doesn\u2019t that mean that there are fewer large targets available to you than before; can you confirm that and really just your appetite? And then secondly, you\u2019ve said before that the earliest you can break up the company is in 2017; I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s day one 2017 because we will at that point have three full years of financials. And if that\u2019s correct, are you targeting a decision sometime next year, I would think that once you make the decision, it\u2019s going to take about a year or so before you actually execute on the split or maybe it won\u2019t take quite that long but are you targeting a decision next year and if so what at this point are you waiting for to make that decision? Ian Read : Well, taking the first question -- the last question first, I believe what we said is that we would be in a position to -- if we so took the decision, to effectuate or start the split in \u201817 which probably means we\u2019d have to take a decision in latter part of \u201816. We do need three years of financials; we will get those three years of financials by the end of \u201816. And what are we waiting for, as we said before Jami, I want to see how these two divisions operating inside of Pfizer, are they on their own sustainable businesses. So I\u2019m waiting to see our pipeline develop; I\u2019m waiting to add as we have done with Hospira, more attractive assets into established products and then I\u2019m also looking to see how does the street value the Pfizer as it is today does and what -- and we\u2019ve given you a lot of information on our segments; so is the sum of the parts different from the whole and we will make that decision around that latter part of \u201816. So I think that answers that question. We are as always focused in our decision making on creating shareholder value. And I think those three elements I laid out to you would describe how we would judge whether any such action will create shareholder value. On the issue of lowering our tax rate or re-domiciling, tax is one of our largest expenses. We, as any management should be, are focused on trying to prudently manage our expenses. The new proposed rule change does make it more difficult to immediately realize any benefits from being re-domiciled but it really depends upon the target, very complex issues of where the assets and where the cash and the tax position of the target. And so really it\u2019s very, very different for say what the universe of possible targets are but rest assured then when we look at those type of BD deals, we\u2019re looking at the creation of value. Operator : Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. David Risinger : So, with respect to the potential separation of the businesses, I\u2019m guessing that you\u2019re not willing to disclose the relative cash flow of the two segments. But my assumption is that the cash flow of the Innovative business is an even smaller percentage of the total company cash flow than the earnings that you disclosed from the Innovative business would suggest. So anyway Frank, I was just hoping that you could speak to that and help us understand whether that\u2019s accurate and whether the lack of cash flow in the innovative business is something that could potentially constrain your ability to separate or monetize that business. Frank D\u2019Amelio: So, a couple of comments, David. Let me just start by saying, reminding everyone this quarter when we file our 10-Q, we\u2019ll be including balance sheet information for this segment but we won\u2019t have debt or cash for example by segment; we\u2019ll have on the asset side accounts receivable, inventory, tax assets and other assets and then on liability side we\u2019ll have on accounts payable accrued compensation and other liability. So, we\u2019ll start providing balance sheet information but we won\u2019t be providing debt or cash by various segments, since those are really enterprise assets, enterprise liabilities at this point. What I would say is this that I don\u2019t see capital structure. So, I\u2019m going to raise it up a little bit. You asked about cash but I\u2019ll answer the question by saying, I don\u2019t see capital structure and somehow impeding our decision making. So, let\u2019s hit to whether or not to execute a split of the company. We believe, I believe we can clearly manage our way through capital structure, so that\u2019s not in any way, shape or form some sort of impeding factor relative to our decision. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Chris Schott : Just a few here, first on Ibrance; can you just discuss a little bit more about the launch and commercial plans from here for the asset? And as part of that, can you just give us a little bit of color on the importance of PALOMA-3 for the market opportunity and the ramp of the product; and how big of an opportunity does this open up for Pfizer? My second question was coming back to GEP. Do you have the capacity to pursuing the large deal here or are you primarily focused on Hospira integration at this point, not so much financial capacity but just you have -- but personnel in place of another big deal where available could you pursue it? Ian Read : So, let me just talk about the deal. We\u2019ve done several large integrations. We\u2019re working well with Hospira. We expected to close in the second half of this year. Should value be there, this organization has a capability of undertaking our deals independent of size, if it was important for our shareholder. So, I\u2019m not concerned about that. I would pass it over to Albert to talk about Ibrance. Albert Bourla : Overall, we are very pleased with the results. And so far Ibrance is being well received by oncologists. We have over 800 healthcare practitioners prescribing it. We have over 2000 patients in one quarter and we have approximately 3000 total scripts written so far. First line market share is already approaching 10% that\u2019s way ahead of previous analogues. And also we see strong reinvestment so far. Now expectation is that Ibrance will gradually grow to become a new standard of care, a first line treatment of this group of patients. But over time momentum in breast cancer will build beyond first line as other studies read out positive. For example, you mentioned the results of PALOMA-3 which will be presented at ASCO but we plan to work with the FDA to expand the label to other lines of therapy based on these results. And also as a reminder, there are several other breast cancer studies running in early and recurrence settings. And needless to say but also we have many non-breast tumor studies including head and neck, lung, melanoma et cetera. Now for your particular importance of PALOMA-3, as I said, so far there is limited medical use in second and third line given that the label is in first line. So as I said, we will work with FDA to expand the label to other lines of therapy. But beyond label amendment, I think we should see the PALOMA-3 in the way that adds to the level of confidence in the mechanics of action and of course is also confirmation of an additional effective Ibrance combination, but this time with Faslodex, before we had with flat fulvestrant. [Ph] Ian Read : And we are at Pfizer and very focused on speed and maximizing the opportunity of Ibrance and getting this great product to patients as fast as possible. And I believe we will be filing in the EU in the second half of this year. Is that right? Albert Bourla : This is correct, Ian. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Bernstein. Tim Anderson : Enbrel was down 8% operationally in Europe; I am wondering how much of this reflects the impact of biosimilar Remicade and if you can talk about expectations for that product going forward in Europe, both in terms of volume growth and pricing. And then going back to this topic of splitting up, looking to see if you could give us odds of the possibility that Pfizer chooses not to split up, you consistently leave that open as a possibility for the last several years that we\u2019ve talked about this topic. And as I am sure you\u2019re aware, most investors want you to do something beyond just buying more targets and getting bigger. So it would be helpful to know with odds of that hope not being delivered on our -- is it less than 10%, less than 20%, less than 50% or what exactly? Ian Read : Let me try and deal with split before we ask Geno to deal with Enbrel. What I would say Tim is that I think this management team has established a reputation of focusing its actions on shareholder value. So, I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s useful to give odds; what I think is useful is to say we will do what\u2019s best for shareholders in creating value for them. And some of our transactions, when we were looking at previous once last year, at times we talked about getting bigger to get smaller. Because by getting bigger, we could add and strengthen the independent businesses and then get smaller if it made sense. Frankly, we\u2019re focused on creating value for shareholders. And if a split or getting bigger and then splitting make sense, we will execute that because the prime driver of this management team is to create shareholder value. With that I\u2019ll pass it over to Geno to talk about Enbrel in Europe. Geno Germano : Tim, the situation in Europe with Enbrel was that we implanted a new distribution model in the UK. We started at the end of last year where we moved away from the retail channel into just the hospital channel and directed patients. So, we saw in the first quarter this year was some inventory work down in the first quarter and that affected our sales in the UK. We had good strong sales in Italy and France and Spain. So, we really didn\u2019t see anything more widespread than the distribution change. In terms of effective biosimilar Remicade on the Enbrel business, we really haven\u2019t seen an impact there either. So, we\u2019re expecting to see continued modest growth to very large base of business; it\u2019s a very well accepted product throughout Europe and the rest of the world. And we anticipate continuation of modest growth for the brand outside the U.S. Operator : Your next question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank. Gregg Gilbert : First Frank, just mechanistically, how would a very large transaction if you did one affect the timing of a potential split? Clearly the Hospira deal did not affect your timeline but I imagine certain deals could. And secondly for John; it\u2019s good to see another strong quarter from Hospira. Is it fair to say that the addition of Hospira in your mind takes gap from flat to declining in sales in the out years to pretty squarely into growth territory? Thanks. Frank D\u2019Amelio: Just to reiterate what I said before and then I\u2019ll answer the question specifically. We\u2019re doing all the things we need to do, in particular the three years of prospective audited financials, so that we\u2019d be in a position to exercise our option in 2017, if we chose to do so. And as I said before, the Hospira acquisition does not impact that timeline. But then Gregg, specific to your question, if we were to do a large transaction, and as Ian said before, we\u2019re agnostic to size, it\u2019s really all about we believe we create shareholder value for our shareholders, it could, it clearly could impact our timeline. If we were to do a transaction and if it were to impact our timeline, please know we\u2019ll proactively tell you all that as soon as we know. John Young : So, first of all, just to reiterate, as you know, we obviously don\u2019t provide guidance by individual business. But obviously we\u2019re very pleased to see the continued positive strong momentum for the Hospira business this quarter. The GEP business has been subject to some LOEs which I think Ian mentioned in his script and as we\u2019ve -- it applies. We knew that in the short-term that will therefore impact the revenue trajectory of the base GEP business over the next year or two. But overall, the transaction certainly represents an immediate incremental source of revenue growth with products that can be expanded into additional markets, given Pfizer\u2019s global reach. And I think the excitement that I think we\u2019ve seen in the financial community that certainly we share really is around the transaction bringing together two excellent businesses that will deliver not only near-term profitable revenue growth but also provide a platform for future growth that can be enhanced through Pfizer\u2019s global reach and infrastructure. So, we remain very positive about the combination of the two businesses. Operator : Your next question comes from John Boris from SunTrust. John Boris : First one just has to do with the Hospira transaction. Can you give any clarity on when you might anticipate HSR clearance? Most notably one thing that we noticed was that on medium and broad spectrum, antibiotics and beta-lactams that there\u2019s some overlap and then certainly the overlap in the biosimilars, so any kind of commentary on product divestitures would be helpful. And then second question on your oncology business, if you look at Xalkori, you have number one, number two competitors in oncology launching all positive compounds globally; Inlyta, in light of I/O data that potentially is becoming available, can you maybe discuss the OS benefit Inlyta has potentially to being able to compete with I/O? And then on Ibrance just potentially competitive threat since competitors are indicating that could have data in the \u201816 to Ibrance, just your thoughts on your competitive positioning of that franchise going forward here. Ian Read : Okay John, thank you, some very optimistic questions there. Why don\u2019t we deal first of all with Hospira; Doug can you do that? Doug Lankler : Sure. So, we\u2019re looking at all the aspects relative, beyond obviously biosimilars as well, we\u2019re working closely with regulators and we\u2019re pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making. We continue to expect to close the transaction during the second half of 2015. Ian Read : And on the oncology issues, would you like to comment upon what we expect the competition launching and then our second generation or third generation ALK/ROS and then perhaps Mikael may want to comment on some of the competitive dynamics. Geno Germano : Absolutely and thanks John for the question. In Ibrance, I spoke a little bit before; and right now we are really the only company that has randomized data out there, so we can make any comparison. We have the most advanced and the most broad program in CDK 4/6. I say more advanced because we are the only one, so that we have registration to start with and we have already announced positive results of a second study in a different population and of course we are having already initiated, right now we have in this year running already four Phase 3 studies on the breast cancer. And we\u2019re running beyond breast cancer over 30 studies in multiple tumor indications. So I have a lot of respect for competitors but I think in that one really we are way ahead. Ian Read : I think one competitor just demand that they may be finishing their Phase 3 in \u201817, is that right? Geno Germano : In \u201816, second half of \u201816, yes. What we expect -- we have already registrations and for the same type, we expect the confirmatory study to come to completion at last the quarter this year in August. And as Ian said before also, we have discussions with EU authorities and we plan to file for Ibrance in the second half of this year as well. Ian Read : Mikael, any comments? Mikael Dolsten : Yes, I want to just briefly comment on your discussion about our ALK franchise. I think we should look up on it as an ALK franchise, where Xalkori is most experienced drug with a very much recognized stable profile. We shared at recent conferences including presentation at AACR our third generation ALK inhibitor with 3922 number name. And it\u2019s really unique compound that hits all known ALK mutations including the G1202R. And to the best of my knowledge, it\u2019s still only compound so far that have shown strong effect across all mutation independent whether the patient has experienced several of the currently available ALK inhibitors. Moreover, several responses also against brain metastases have been reported for this drug. So, I think the combined ALK franchise from place that will over time be very strong. Inlyta can nicely also be combined with a immune-oncology product as per our strategy. So, we shouldn\u2019t see Inlyta as alone facing other entrants but we and Merck Serono are exploring immune-oncology avelumab, Inlyta and other agents. So, I think you will see us building a strong position in renal cell carcinoma. Ian Read : And John, I sort of see the competition coming in and extending the survival time of patients with the ALK mutation s very positive for our third generation when it comes to market. As you\u2019ll have of all patients that have gone through our first line as Xalkori increases second line on products of competitors and creating a more substantial patient base for our third generation ALK. So thanks for the questions. Operator : Next question comes from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Vamil Divan : I got two quick ones on the product side and one of the expense side. So just on to products, just if you can kind of give us a sense of your optimism on tanezumab at this point. I know you\u2019re talking about the Phase 3 now. But just given the kind of safety issues that have been before, do you see that\u2019s potentially a blockbuster to products or is it more of a niche product just given some of the safety questions. Lipitor, quick question on the real world study there, I know it\u2019s completed, has been completed over some time; any update on when we might see the data there? And then just on the last on the expense side, if I read the release correctly, you had quite a bit of expenses allocated to the other bucket as opposed to being allocated to one of the three specific business units? In other words are five quarters in to the company operating as three separate units; how should we think about in terms of your ability to actually split into two entities if we want to without having significant amount of dis-synergies as given there is some -- there will be a lot of overlap in how the expenses are being expected? Ian Read : Geno, tanezumab? Geno Germano : Tanezumab, look, we see this as a real innovation; one of the first real breakthroughs in pain management in many, many years and a significant unmet need over use of opioids being a big problem and a substantial number of patients with the conditions that we\u2019re pursuing osteoarthritis, chronic low back pain and cancer pain. So we see that this drug has significant potential. We know a lot about this medicine; we\u2019ve completed quite a number of studies and we\u2019re anxious to see it advance through this next phase of development and enter the market. Ian Read : Albert, real world, real life study Lipitor? Albert Bourla : The actual use trial was completed in December. So the results are expected this quarter. The results of study will inform next steps and timelines for potential NDA filing. And we will continue to update you as we have more news on that. Ian Read : And Frank on expenses? Frank D\u2019Amelio: The major items in that other bucket are WRD. So, Mikael\u2019s organization and I\u2019ll call it corporate. We think about corporate as what we call the enabling function. So, it\u2019s IT; finance; legal; HR; facilities; public relations, all those functions basically are what are in our corporate bucket there. Last year in the Q, we gave you all percentages on how to allocate those various items to the segments. The key there is in terms of the basis of what\u2019s underpinning those percentages that we gave you. There is really three buckets of allocations there; I\u2019ll call it specific assignments, regional allocations and general allocations. The specific assignments are about 40%; the regional allocations are about 20%; the general allocations are about 40%. So, we provide all that details, so that you can basically drive it to segment. And what that tells you is much of it, the specific assignment and the regional allocation is very specific to an individual segment. Operator : Your next question comes from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink. Seamus Fernandez : Just a few quick questions, couple on the pipeline and then one for Ian. On the pipeline, maybe just to start off, maybe we could talk a little bit about when we might see data with your 4-1BB and what combinations we may see. Interestingly, we\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on AstraZeneca\u2019s deal with Celgene and their comments on the challenges of getting into hem tumors. The second question, just given the broad success of Opdivo in second line lung cancer, when and how do you see your recently announced study recruiting in the U.S. or perhaps even in Europe over the next 12 months as approvals are likely received? And then lastly for Ian, when you say that you are agnostic to the creation of shareholder value, I think everybody has asked the question of the possibility that you go out and buy more assets. However, I do think that there certainly is the possibility of lowering your tax rates with the willingness to perhaps merge with an overseas entity with that entity being the controlling entity. How agnostic are you truly to that kind of an outcome? Ian Read : I\u2019ll ask Mikael to comment on the 4-1BB. I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s appropriate first to comment on AZ strategy and how they go about financing their pipeline. And then on lung cancer perhaps Mikael or Albert can deal with that. Then I\u2019ll come back to on how agnostic I feel. Mikael Dolsten : As you know, we believe that the field of I/O combinations is going to increasingly be prominent. And we have invested in a broad number of I/O combinations; we\u2019ll have up to five I/O drugs in the clinic this year and expect every year probably, two new entering. Specifically for 4-1BB, we will share additional data at ASCO. We have growing experience with 4-1BB in lymphoma on rituximab background that said yes the stable activity and good volatility profile. And I think suggest that this class of combining check point activators with check point inhibitors may be the route to go as we have learned combining multiple check point inhibitors as CTLA-4 and PD-1, mainly to decreasing therapeutic window while 4-1BB we\u2019re very encouraged that the therapeutic window will be large and the drug is an interesting part of this new I/O combination. I also wanted to make a pitch that we actually are now entering the clinic with our OX40 antibody that also will be planned to explode as mono-therapy and later in combination with avelumab. Briefly just on second line lung cancer, as we announced avelumab into several solid tumor indications, we expect over the years of \u201817, \u201818, \u201819 and \u201820 to see multiple pivotal trials readout and opportunities for drug registrations across several of the solid tumors including lung cancer. Ian Read : Thank you Mikael. Now Seamus, I think you mentioned; I think you perhaps misquoted me there. I\u2019m not agnostic on value; I\u2019m agnostic on size and I\u2019m totally focused on value. And I think it\u2019s sort of alluding your questions about the -- whether you\u2019re 80-20 or 60-40 to maximize your benefits. And once again I\u2019m open to any sort of combinations that when we look at it, produces clear value for our shareholders. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen. Steve Scala : I have a couple. First for Frank, isn\u2019t the full year share count guidance 6.2 billion shares versus Q1\u2019s nearly 6.3 billion; that difference is 3.2 billion in share repurchase? And related to that, I\u2019m surprised the share count was not much lower in Q1 versus Q4, given the 150 million share repurchase. I guess the answer might be that you weren\u2019t expecting the stock to be so strong but maybe you can clarify. And then secondly how much of the 300 million in Prevenar sales in adults in Q1 would you consider catch up versus the cohort of people that just turned 65 and are receptive to vaccination? Frank D\u2019Amelio: So on the share repurchase Steve, our projection for the end of the year is a little bit higher than the number you quoted and we obviously factored that into our guidance. And then in terms of the shares from Q4 to Q1, remember on that accelerated share repurchase, we got a partial quarter benefit for that in the number, because we didn\u2019t put that in place until February, so kind of think about it as a mid quarter impact. But if you go to the full year, we\u2019re a little bit higher than the 6.2 and what\u2019s really been driving that and it\u2019s a good issue is, stock price is higher than we thought it was going to be. From a share repurchase assumption perspective, in terms of what we assumed in our planning, it\u2019s higher than what we had planned for, but net-net it\u2019s all factored into our guidance. Ian Read : Al, if you\u2019d like to sort of try and dissect it, interesting market for adult vaccines in the U.S. and potentially internationally. Albert Bourla : I don\u2019t have specific data yet as to how much is catch up or not but it\u2019s an indication of, the 300 is an indication of the significant potential of this market. Let me run some numbers for you. Every year 4 million adults in U.S. alone are turning 65. There are 27 million adults that have been previously vaccinated with PPV 23 and additional 20 million adults that have never been vaccinated, that\u2019s a pool of 47 million adults in U.S. Both of these cohorts are now recommended and reimbursed to receive Prevenar 13. And the same comes with Europe. In Europe, we have already received the label, the prevention of pneumonia for adults 18 and older. We are working country by country to ensure recommendations and after that reimbursement which will take some time but typically it\u2019s happening. And in general, we are very pleased with the first quarter, the results. They were driven of course by the broad recommendation. We had the severe flu season that also played a role and also our commercial efforts were very successful. Going forward in the spring months, we expect the revenues to moderate given the seasonality of the business but we expect strong revenue growth will resume in the fall. And overall we expect very strong growth for the year. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi. Andrew Baum : A question on your immune-oncology portfolio; do you have any evidence to date to conclude that the ADC enabled properties of your PDL-1 are positively significantly differentiated versus the other non-factor enabled PDL 1s that aren\u2019t clinically approved. Second, is it still the case that you haven\u2019t shared any solid tumor responses with your anti-CD-137 or is that changed? And then lastly, perhaps you could comment on the strategic outlook of your consumer health business, given it\u2019s a very active market out there with numerous potential buyers who I\u2019m sure would be interested in your assets? Ian Read : Mikael, could you take us through the immune-oncology questions? Mikael Dolsten : I think you asked briefly about ADCs and then mainly around differentiation for our immune-oncology assets. Maybe I\u2019d just say a few words on ADCs. We have built up seven ADCs in the clinic. You\u2019 heard recently about our clindamycin ADC, inotuzumab showing positive and good data for the first of two primary end points, hematological remissions. We have next wave in Phase 1/2 studies; I can particular mention one that you think you should keep an eye on that we will also believe will continue to established ADC as an important modality. And we are indeed quite encouraged by the idea of combining the selectivity of ADCs with immune-oncology. So I think your question was really good by asking about those modalities. Our PDL-1, as you know, our view is that data available to-date suggests that it will have a similar profile to that on other advance PD-1 and PDL-1 antibodies that are presented data in unselected patient. And as you continue to explore enrichment of patients such as increase level of PDL-1, it\u2019s expected that response rate will further increase as well as with a drug combination. There\u2019s been some suggestion as from a reported ASR that avelumab may also on the positive end pick up some ADCs to rank itself; it remains to be proven what tumor types this could potentially be a differentiation. But so far we have said that avelumab has a competitive profile similar to the PD-1, PDL-1 and we are very excited to advance the molecule and we\u2019ll share an update at ASCO. Ian Read : And on the Consumer business, it actually had a very quarter, very good growth. And so it\u2019s a business that we like to be in. I think it\u2019s a strategically important business for us. And we will continue to develop it and if we have opportunities to do acquisitions to grow, we\u2019ll also look at those. So it\u2019s a good business to be in. Operator : Your next question comes from Colin Bristow from Bank of America. Colin Bristow : Couple of quick questions, on the biosimilar Avastin; what\u2019s your view with regards to what agencies were required for approval? Do you think response rates will be sufficient, would you anticipate meeting survival data? And also do you see any issues with recruitment here, given there is question of more incentives to trial the biosimilar versus the innovator? And then last question on Xeljanz; I see you\u2019re filing based on 5 and 10 milligrams data in plaque psoriasis; is that potential for this data set to assist any approval of the 10 milligram data in RA? Ian Read : Biosimilar, Avastin, Mikael comments on that? Mikael Dolsten : I would say that for each of the biosimilars, we negotiate end point with the regulatory agencies. And we expect that data that indicate you have equivalence analytical on the drug pharmacokinetics and clinical profile in general will lead to registration across multiple indications. I can\u2019t specifically speculate on what would be required for Avastin but I will in general be optimistic that readout such as response rates or PFS will be likely confirm by equivalence if you do have also strong robust data on the other aspect by equivalence. We have now five antibodies working closely with GEP in the pipeline and we are very pleased so far with all of those; four are in Phase 3 studies. Geno Germano : On the 10 milligram data in psoriasis; as you know the psoriasis patient population is a much different patient population then RA. However, as we accumulate more and more data on the 10 milligram in both in RA post marketing surveillance studies in the additional indications including psoriasis and ulcerative colitis and other indications, the data base continues to grow. And that will serve as our support for continuing to evaluate the 10 milligram across all of the indications as time goes by. Operator : Your final question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets. Alex Arfaei : A follow-up on biosimilars on your outlook; could you comment on some of the intellectual property barriers that you might face in bringing biosimilars to the market and specifically I am wondering about the Humira biosimilars that you have in development. What\u2019s your expected time line for that product given some of the IP that AbbVie [ph] keeps referring to? John Young : I think what we\u2019d say is obviously we\u2019re looking at full range of considerations when we develop our portfolio of biosimilars. As Mikael just said and answered to the previous question, we engage very strongly with the regulators to make sure that have an appropriate clinical program and clearly we\u2019re very mindful of the IP landscape which frankly varies by asset, is very complex ranging from base patents to a range of other patents. So we work very closely with our legal team to assess the likely time of entry to the marketplace for all of our biosimilars and we take that into full consideration when we\u2019re constructing our development program and making our forecast for the long range. Chuck Triano : Thanks John. And thank you everybody for your attention this morning. Ian Read : Thank you. Have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today\u2019s Pfizer\u2019s first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to Pfizer's second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, operator. Good morning and thanks for joining us today to review Pfizer's second quarter 2015 performance. As usual, I'm joined by : our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide R&D Albert Bourla, President of Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer; Geno Germano, President of Global Innovative Pharma; John Young, President of Established Pharma; and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel. The slides that will be presented on this call can be viewed on our home page, Pfizer.com, by clicking on the link for Pfizer Quarterly Corporate Performance Second Quarter 2015, which is located in the Investor Presentation section in the lower right-hand corner of this page. Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected in these statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. Discussions during the call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our current report on Form 8-K dated today. We'll now make some prepared remarks and then we'll move to a Q&A session. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian? Ian C. Read: Thank you, Chuck, and thank you for joining our call this morning. During my remarks this morning, I will briefly recap the highlights from the quarter, provide some comments on key areas of focus in the pipeline, and close with a few words about business development and the pending Hospira acquisition. Starting with the quarter, it was another quarter of strong operational performance. For the third consecutive quarter, we saw operational revenue growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange and despite LOE headwinds. We continue to see solid revenue growth from our newer products as a result of the investments we are making R&D and our commercial operations. Specifically in the second quarter as compared to same period last year, ELIQUIS alliance revenues nearly tripled on a global basis, and XELJANZ revenues nearly doubled. PREVNAR 13 revenue in the U.S. increased 87%, primarily due to continued strong uptake in PREVNAR 13 in adults, with most of the growth in the overall PREVNAR 13 franchise coming from the adult indication in this quarter. We have done an excellent job for the first half of this year of getting to patients and capturing the potential of PREVNAR 13 in adults in the U.S., as evidenced by the outstanding year-to-date performance which has been primarily driven by the catch-up opportunity. Over the next few years, we believe this catch-up opportunity in the U.S. will be robust. However, we will likely need to expend more effort to reach these individuals, and the opportunity will moderate over time as the catch-up opportunity becomes fully realized. Given current demographics and aging trends, approximately 4 million Americans will turn 65 each year, and a part of these adults will be part of our immunization effort. As we move through the catch-up population and get to a more normalized adult immunization rate domestically, we will be expanding our efforts to capture expected new growth outside the U.S. Given the Asian demographic trends, we expect to obtain several pneumonia recommendations and reimbursements between 2016 and 2018 in many international markets. IBRANCE continues to be well received by oncologists treating post-menopausal women with ER-positive HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. There are approximately 3,000 healthcare practitioners already prescribing IBRANCE. This is up from 800 at the end of the first quarter. Our current first-line market share in this patient population was approximately 22% during the quarter, up from 10% during the first quarter. We look forward to filing for approval in the EU later this year, and are working to add the data from the PALOMA-3 study to our U.S. label for women with HR-positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer whose disease has progressed during and after endocrine therapy. I would note that all of these products I just mentioned are now meaningful contributors to our business. We also saw quarter-over-quarter operational growth from several of our inline key products, including LYRICA, SUTENT, XALKORI, and INLYTA. In our Consumer business, we saw quarter-over-quarter operational growth from several brands, including CENTRUM, ADVIL, ROBITUSSIN, and EMERGEN-C. We are seeing strong performance from NEXIUM OTC despite a decline this quarter due to the non-recurrence of initial retailer stocking associated with the launch last May. Since its launch, NEXIUM has generated revenues of approximately $300 million, making it one of the largest and most successful Rx-to-OTC switches. Regarding other Rx-to-OTC opportunities, we received the top line results from the LIPITOR actual-use trial that was completed last December. Results show that co-primary endpoints were not achieved. Based on our analysis of the data and recent feedback from the FDA on the overall program, we have decided to terminate the program. That said, we continue to evaluate other products for potential Rx-to-OTC switches. Moving to emerging markets, revenues increased 6% operationally compared to the year-ago quarter, driven by operational growth in PREVNAR, LYRICA, and LIPITOR. This quarter was a further example of our track record of solid operating performance. Given our strong execution across the businesses during the first half of the year coupled with an improved operational outlook for the remainder of this year, we are raising the midpoints of our 2015 financial guidance for reported revenue by $500 million and for reported diluted EPS by $0.03 per share and adjusted EPS by $0.04. As we enter the second half of this year, our strategy, focus, and priorities remain unchanged. Top line growth remains a priority. Over the last three quarters we have seen top line operational growth on a total company basis. Recent product launches in key inline products are performing well, while the impact from the remaining LOEs has diminished. For example, the impact from the CELEBREX LOE will be annualized after another two quarters and ZYVOX shortly after that. Once this happens, we will have put the most significant LOEs behind us and expect to return to a more measured cycle of product loss of exclusivity. We remain steadfast in our efforts to deliver the next wave of potential new innovative therapies over the coming years. The areas where we see the largest potential to benefit patients and where we are focusing our resources include building a strong immuno-oncology portfolio. Per our agreement with Merck KGaA, we believe we have one of the most comprehensive bio platforms in development in the pharma industry today. We expect to have five different IO drugs in the clinic this year and up to 10 different drugs by 2016. The key targets include avelumab, the anti-PD-L1, OX40, 4-1BB, our vaccine-based immuno-therapy regime, CCR2, IDO1, and several bi-functional antibodies. We believe that these combinations are the key to better patient outcomes in IO. And given the breadth of our assets, we think we are well positioned to win here. We'll be collaborating on up to 20 studies with Merck KGaA, and we plan to have up to six immunology Phase 3 trials ongoing by the end of the year across several tumor types, including non-small-cell lung cancer, ovarian, renal, bladder, and gastric. Our second-line non-small-cell lung cancer registration study is currently recruiting. And where possible, we will be looking to accelerate these studies. For example, we are planning to move quickly into a registration study with avelumab in combination with INLYTA in kidney cancer later this year. We also continue to build our palbo [palbociclib] franchise, moving our R&D efforts into early stages of the treatment paradigm as well as in non-breast cancer indications. In cardiovascular, we have a comprehensive Phase 3 trial program for bococizumab, our investigational PCSK9 inhibitor, for its potential to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and improve cardiovascular outcomes. We anticipate our LIPITOR low-end trials will complete in 2016, and we estimate that our CV outcomes data will be available in the first half of 2018. The outcomes studies are timed to event trials, so it is difficult to predict exact dates, but we anticipate that this will be consistent with the timing of other industry outcome studies expected by our peers. Our ertugliflozin Phase 3 program is well underway. And given JANUVIA's recent positive CV outcomes in clinical trial results, we remain enthusiastic about the demand potential for the ertugliflozin-JANUVIA combination in an area of significant patient need. In vaccines, we recently started a Phase 2b study for our staph-aureus vaccine. And depending on final results, it could serve as a registrational study. Also this month, we initiated a Phase 2 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of our investigational C.difficile vaccine. Both of these vaccines could be key to stemming the spread of the leading causes of serious healthcare associated infections. In immunology, the FDA accepted review for a supplementary new drug application for XELJANZ once-a-day modified release tablets. Our PDUFA date is February of next year. If approved, it would bring us one step closer to offering the first and only once-a-day oral JAK kinase inhibitor treatment for those living with moderate to severe RA who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate. We believe this will be an important product modification. In rare diseases, we enrolled the first patients in Phase 3 clinical trials assessing the efficacy and safety of rivipansel for the treatment of vaso-occlusive crisis in hospitalized individuals with sickle cell disease who are six years of age or older. And additional clinical studies are underway for prevention of sickle cell crisis disease. We believe this will build on our strength in researching and bringing to market therapies for hematological rare diseases based on our deep history in hemophilia. In biosimilars, we started a Phase 3 clinical trial of our potential biosimilar to bevacizumab, making a total of five monoclonal biosimilars now in Phase 3 development. In sterile injectables, we're excited about the opportunity to combine Pfizer's branded portfolio and global commercial organization with HOSPIRA's demonstrated R&D capability and manufacturing capacity of sterile injectable products, and this will occur upon the close of the acquisition. Overall, as a result of the work we have done to focus our R&D efforts in the areas we believe offer the greatest potential for therapeutic benefit and chance of commercial success, we are building a stronger portfolio on behalf of our patients that we believe will create value for our shareholders. Turning now to a few words on business development, it remains an enabler of our strategies and, as I said before, is not a strategy on its own. While we have seen strong performance from our recent product launches, over the next few years we are looking at business development as a way to invest in generating sustained near-term and future growth, knowing that the next wave of our potential major registrations or launches won't happen until 2017. In the interim, we have the financial capacity to actually seek out the right deals at the right price that will create value for our shareholders. We are optimistic that we can find these deals as we go through the period to 2017. In keeping with this philosophy, we have proactively evaluated virtually all of the deals announced this year and have chosen to pursue only those that efficiently use capital to strengthen the business, drive growth, and accelerate value. For example, we have entered into several agreements year to date that have bolstered our scientific and technical capabilities and provided us with the potential for new growth opportunities. Of particular note are the two most significant transactions with Merck KGaA in immuno-oncology and the pending acquisition of HOSPIRA. Regarding HOSPIRA, we are proceeding on track and are awaiting regulatory approval from several jurisdictions. We continue to expect the transaction to close in the second half of the year. In closing, I am pleased with our strong financial position, new and inline product performance, pipeline advancements, and recent business development activity. We are performing well. And for the remainder of this year, we will focus on further strengthening both our innovative and established businesses to best position them for their long-term success. I will now turn it over to Frank to take you through the financial details of the quarter. Frank A. D'Amelio: Thanks, Ian, good day, everyone. As always, the charts I am reviewing today are included in our webcast. In the second quarter of 2015, reported revenues were approximately $11.9 billion and reflect year-over-year operational growth of $125 million or 1%, mainly driven by : the strong performance of PREVNAR 13 adult, ELIQUIS, IBRANCE, and XELJANZ, all of which are early in their life cycles; the addition of vaccines acquired from Baxter in 2014; and operational growth of 6% in emerging markets, mainly due to LIPITOR and PREVNAR 13. Reported revenues were unfavorably impacted by the loss of exclusivity of CELEBREX and ZYVOX in the U.S. and LYRICA in certain developed European markets. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.56 versus $0.58 in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to the $0.06 negative impact of foreign exchange and partially offset by a lower effective tax rate and fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which declined by 201 million shares versus the year-ago quarter due to our share repurchase program, which includes the impact of our $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in February 2015 and completed in July. I want to point out that excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, adjusted diluted EPS would have increased by approximately 6%. Reported diluted EPS was $0.42 compared with $0.45 in the year-ago quarter due to the previously mentioned factors and the unfavorable impact of higher legal charges and acquisition-related costs associated with pending acquisition of HOSPIRA versus the year-ago quarter, as well as charges incurred during the second quarter of 2015 for legal entity alignment activities, partially offset by lower restructuring and other charges associated with cost reduction and productivity initiatives, lower purchase accounting adjustments and a lower effective tax rate versus the year-ago quarter. Foreign exchange negatively impacted second quarter reported revenues by approximately $1 billion or 8% and positively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $518 million or 7%. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted second quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.06 compared with the year-ago quarter. Now moving on to the financial highlights of our business segments. In the second quarter, Global Innovative Pharmaceutical revenues increased 8% operationally year-over-year due to the strong performance of recently launched products, including ELIQUIS globally and XELJANZ in the U.S., and the continued strong performance of VIAGRA in the U.S. and LYRICA in the U.S. and Japan, which were partially offset by declines of RAPAMUNE and BenefiX in the U.S. Income before taxes increased 9% operationally due to the operational increase in revenues and a 2% operational decrease in cost of sales, partially offset by a 6% operational increase in SI&A expenses primarily due to additional promotional investment in certain in-line and recently launched products and a 21% operational increase in R&D, reflecting incremental investments in our late-stage pipeline, primarily for bococizumab. Second quarter VOC revenues increased 29% operationally due to the 52% operational revenue growth from our Global Vaccines business as a result of PREVNAR 13 which grew 87% in the U.S. due to continued strong uptake in adults and 10% internationally, and the inclusion of Baxter's marketed vaccines in Europe. A 36% operational increase in oncology revenues, driven by the launch of IBRANCE in the U.S. in February, and to a lesser extent by SUTENT, INLYTA, and XALKORI. Income before taxes increased 51% operationally, mainly due to increased revenues and the associated improvement in gross margin, and a 16% operational decrease in R&D expenses as a result of lower clinical spend for TRUMENBA, PREVNAR 13 Adult and certain oncology products, which were partially offset by a 15% operational increase in SI&A expenses due to increased investment in both the PREVNAR 13 and IBRANCE launches. In the second quarter, Global Established Products revenues decreased 14% operationally, mainly due to the loss of exclusivity and immediate multi-sourced generic competition for CELEBREX in the U.S. in December of 2014, generic competition for ZYVOX in the U.S. and LYRICA in certain developed markets in Europe beginning in the first half of 2015 and, to a lesser extent, from continued generic competition for LIPITOR in developed markets and the termination of the SPIRIVA co-promotion agreement in most countries, including the U.S. in April of 2014. All of these were partially offset by operational growth of 2% in emerging markets, primarily driven by LIPITOR. Income before taxes declined 17% operationally due to the decrease in revenues, a 1.5 percentage point operational increase in cost of sales as a percentage of revenues due to unfavorable change in product mix, a 3% operational increase in R&D expenses reflecting increased spending in our biosimilars and sterile injectables development programs, largely offset by lower post-marketing clinical trial expenses, all of which were partially offset by an 11% operational decrease in SI&A expenses driven by cost reduction and productivity initiatives. Because of our strong operational performance and improved operational outlook for the remainder of the year, we are raising the midpoint of our 2015 guidance ranges for reported revenues by $500 million and the midpoint of our adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.04. We now expect reported revenues to be in the range of $45 billion to $46 billion and adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.01 to $2.07. We also now expect reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.47. In addition, based on our year-to-date results we now expect cost of sales as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 18% to 18.5% versus our previous expectation of 18.5% to 19.5%. To reflect incremental expenses for ongoing Phase 3 programs, we now expect our R&D expenses to be in the range of $7.3 billion to $7.6 billion versus $6.9 billion to $7.4 billion previously. It's important to note that any changes in foreign exchange rates since mid-April which exclude the impact of potential devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar did not materially impact our latest guidance. I also want to point out that we are continuing to absorb an estimated $3.4 billion negative impact due to continuing product losses of exclusivity and declining alliance revenues, and an estimated $3.3 billion negative impact of unfavorable changes in essentially all foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar compared to foreign exchange rates in 2014. Moving on to key takeaways. We achieved another quarter of solid financial performance, primarily driven by products that are in the early stages of their life cycles : PREVNAR 13 Adult, ELIQUIS, IBRANCE, and XELJANZ. Also I want to point out that this is the third consecutive quarter of operational revenue growth. We raised the midpoints of our 2015 reported revenue and EPS guidance ranges to reflect our strong operational performance and improved operational outlook for the remainder of 2015. We achieved several key R&D milestones since our first quarter update, including FDA acceptance of our NDA for XELJANZ once-daily, the anticipated PDUFA date of February of 2016 and the presentation of data from our immuno-oncology portfolio at ASCO, which included 10 abstracts on avelumab with our partner Merck KGaA, as well as results from a Phase 1 study of our anti-4-1BB antibody. We continue to create shareholder value through prudent capital allocation. To-date in 2015, we've returned $9.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and we continue to expect to return approximately $13 billion to shareholders in 2015 through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2015 and beyond. Now I'll turn it back to Chuck. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Frank and Ian, for the summary. With that, operator, can we please poll for questions? Operator : Your first question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank. Gregg Gilbert : Good morning, guys. First on the immuno-oncology franchise. While you're somewhat behind, Ian, can you comment on some of the aspects of your strategy in IO that might not be fully appreciated by the investment community? And my second question, perhaps for either of you on the subject of what you call business and legal entity alignment activities. Those costs are growing strongly. Can you offer any color as to when those activities might wrap up, or at least what some key mile markers are along the way on that process? Thanks. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Gregg. We believe that we will be first in some tumor types with the PD-L1 from Merck, but we also feel it's very important to understand that we're just at the beginning of this immuno-oncology wave. And we have, as I commented previously, a substantial number of assets that can be combined and added, both with immuno-oncology assets and with the backbone targeted therapies or chemotherapy or with INLYTA or with XALKORI, with IBRANCE potentially. So we feel that, as this market develops, what's going to be really important is the ability to have combination products and the ability to have a more full control of the total value of the total pricing of those combination products to the payers. So we believe that Pfizer will be very well positioned with multiple combinations of immuno-oncology assets and combinations of its own inline assets to be very, very effective in those combinations. Frank, do you want to talk about the... Frank A. D'Amelio: Sure. So on the business and legal entity alignment, let me run the numbers first and then I'll answer the question, which is for the quarter we spent $63 million, year to date $164 million in business and legal entity alignment cost. I said previously we forecasted a spend of approximately $400 million for the year. We'll be give or take in that range of approximately $400 million. The spend will continue obviously for the rest of 2015 through 2016. We've talked about a decision on alignment in the fourth quarter of 2016, by no later than the fourth quarter of 2016, suspending obviously we've continue through then, at which point we make a determination going forward based on the decision that we make. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Frank. Next question, please, operator? Operator : Your next question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS. Marc Goodman : First question is can you give us your latest thoughts on what's going on in China as well as just the broader emerging markets? Second, in the press release it talked about for PREVNAR the Gavi shipments and emerging markets had some special programs. Can you just give us a sense of how much of that was one-timers versus what we should expect ongoing? And then I think you mentioned how much FX hit your expenses. But can you carve out the gross margin specifically and how much that had an impact? Thanks. Ian C. Read: Okay, look. We remain, as we've said, optimistic about the long term in China and the emerging markets. We continue to see a secular movement to the middle class and wealth creation. I would ask John Young, who manages the majority of our business in the emerging markets, to make some comments specifically on China, and perhaps his view of the opportunities more broadly in emerging markets. John Young : Okay, thanks for the question, Marc. So I think Ian hit on our view in summary form. It's obviously a significant population, 1.3 billion people. We continue to see strong economic growth, albeit moderating economic growth, but we envision that the economic growth will continue. And I think as Ian has already flagged, we see a continued commitment from the Chinese government to expand access to healthcare, to quality healthcare to its citizens. We don't see that trend halting in the short to medium, even the longer term. And so we believe that actually for manufacturers such as ourselves who are positioned well in China with a strong existing base, a strong network of joint ventures, and a portfolio frankly that is well suited to the needs of Chinese patients, ranging from our innovative portfolio with oncology medicines and vaccines in the future as well as today's portfolio such as LIPITOR, which is obviously a leading treatment to help to manage cardiovascular disease, which is a growing concern for Chinese patients. So when you sum all of that up, we know that we will continue to see some pressures on our business in China and pricing. We've factored that into our forward-looking views, and we will continue to see China being a significant opportunity for future growth. Ian C. Read: Okay. And similar stories played out in most of the emerging markets, too, and in differing forms. Albert, do you want to talk about the Gavi shipments and those items that were raised? Albert Bourla : Yes, I wouldn't call them one-time. What is happening with the Gavi businesses is there is volatility. Volatility depends on when the CDC places an order or when Gavi will place an order or where or when an IP will occur. So this volatility will continue. This is the normal course of the vaccines business. But in general, pediatric is doing very well this quarter with 5% overall growth. Ian C. Read: Thank you. Frank, on the FX? Frank A. D'Amelio: Sure. So, Marc, lots of moving parts, obviously, that impact gross margin. Favorable items would be things like our oncology and alliance revenue growth. An unfavorable item would be our U.S. LOEs. But maybe the easiest way to do this macro level with the numbers, Q2 last year our cost of sales as a percentage of revenue 18.9%, this quarter 17.9%. If we remove foreign exchange from this quarter, which reduced cost of sales by $255 million, that 17.9% becomes 18.4%, so roughly flat year over year. If you go year to date, last year, year to date 17.9%; this year, year to date 17.3%. If we remove foreign exchange, that's 17.3% becomes 18.2%, once again, relatively flat year over year with a lot of moving parts impacting the number. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Frank. Operator, next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Bernstein. Timothy M. Anderson: Thanks. If I could go back to the topic of M&A, and, Ian, I know you made some comments earlier. Watching the big pharma industry for almost 20 years, it seems like big pharma companies have very often not participated in biotech M&A because there has been this longstanding sense that the valuations are too high. And if I listen to what several companies say now at the current point in time, several big pharma companies again \u2013 and I raise that concern if I look at what Pfizer has bought over years, it's generally been either big pharma companies or other types of targets like Hospira. So my question to you is how do you currently view valuations in the biotech space? And have you loosened up at all in your valuation framework such that you think you can find value in the biotech landscape at the current levels of valuation? And then second question is on ENBREL and whether you expect to see any pressure caused by biosimilar REMICADE now being available in Europe, or do you expect pressure in year 2016 or 2017 or maybe even in the current year? Ian C. Read: Okay. I'll make some comments on M&A, and then I'll ask Geno to comment on ENBREL in Europe. Tim, I believe that the marketplace is extremely efficient and that the valuations in biotech are in many ways price perfection. But all the deals that have been done, we have looked at them. The deals work for some companies because of their portfolio, because of their ability to achieve synergies in ways that perhaps we couldn't. We do remain disciplined on our cost of capital. We think long term that's important, that people who invest in Pfizer expect a risk-adjusted return on the cost of capital. That means that we don't expect to find value in the marketplace. There are always opportunities. We stand ready. We have the cash. We have the capability. We have the management team. We are continually looking for those opportunities. As I say, I'm optimistic that we'll be able to deploy our capital in a way that will increment value to shareholders. I would say further that if you look at the Established Products business and the Innovative business, if there were two projects and both of them were risk-adjusted equal, our inclination would be to do, for portfolio reasons, something in the Innovative space rather than the Established space, given that we've done the Hospira acquisition for Established. So once again, I'm very well aware that there is an active market for business development. We think we've done the ones that are prudent. We evaluate all opportunities, and we're optimistic that we're going to find and have sufficient courage to find those opportunities that come into the marketplace. So with that, I'll pass it over to Geno to look at ENBREL. Geno J. Germano: Sure, Tim. ENBREL continues to do well. We had good 2% operational growth this quarter outside the United States on a very large base, so the business continues to deliver for us. With regard to REMICADE biosimilars, we're not seeing a significant impact on the ENBREL business. Given the different administration routes, REMICADE being an infusion and ENBREL and HUMIRA and others being self-injected therapies, we don't see a lot of overlap there. There's a lot of experimentation going on country by country, so there's always the possibility that we'll see some new things happening. But overall, we're not seeing or expecting a major shift in the ENBREL business related to the REMICADE biosimilar. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Geno. Operator, can we move to the next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin : Ian, in your prepared remarks, you signaled M&A activity focused on top line growth bridging the gap to 2017 filings, so I have two questions related to that. Are you backing off from breaking up the company, a strategy you outlined or certainly outlined the optionality for a couple years ago? Where are you on that? And number two, how big would you consider going? Can you throw out some parameters there in terms of size? Is it all about top line growth? Is synergies a big consideration? And just also you had talked before about tax inversions being an important part of that equation too. So if you can, put that in perspective. And then my last question relates to Lipitor OTC. Now that that product doesn't appear to be going forward, would you consider putting your Consumer business up for sale? Thanks. Ian C. Read: Okay, Jami, as always, pretty big questions. Okay, on the breakup, we have not changed our views on wanting to have the optionality of the breakup. We continue to spend considerable amounts of money preparing and putting ourselves in a place to trigger that optionality if we take that decision. And as I said, we've laid out the criteria for that, which includes are the businesses doing well, do we think they could do well on their own, is there trapped value, and is there after-tax value that could be achieved? And we will make that decision by the latest the fourth quarter of 2016 on whether to trigger that optionality. On your question about big, small growth opportunities, we look at it from the point of view of, as a pharmaceutical company, we want to buy \u2013 the ideal of course is to buy a pipeline and also products that are growing. These products and opportunities, you have to have a belief in the future \u2013 often the future potential of the products you're buying. There's a lot involved in an acquisition this large. It's a combination of what you think the portfolio will do, what you believe the synergies that will come through on the operational side, and of course tax and tax planning plays a role in that. So to a certain extent, the discussions that are going on in Washington right now about potential international tax reform does affect the way we look at the different opportunities we have in the marketplace. You would expect us to be looking at that very carefully. Certainly, any acquisition we do make will have a bias on the near-term revenue opportunities and on accretion. OTC, look, the Consumer business is a tremendous business, a tremendous store of value. We took NEXIUM OTC and it has been an incredible success. We continue to invest in the Consumer business. We always look at our businesses, all of them, on a regular basis and our strategic plan vis-\u00e0-vis what part they play in the total value to Pfizer shareholders. We're always reviewing that. At this moment, I think the Consumer business is a very valuable and growing asset for Pfizer. Thank you. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Ian, our next question, please, operator? Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI. Mark J. Schoenebaum: Hey, guys. Thank you for a very clear opening statement from all of you. It's always very helpful. I want to go back and build on some of the questions that have already been asked. But the first one is just, Ian, I know you get asked this every quarter, and I'm sure Chuck tells you you're going to asked this every quarter, but this quarter I think it's become a little bit more of a focus for investors. There are widespread Wall Street rumors that you might be interested in something like an Allergan. I understand you wouldn't comment on that. But can you just comment in general on your interest in inverting at this point? What kind of thresholds would need to be versus what the official thresholds right now to make you comfortable that such an inversion could be completed? Is inversion still a priority I guess for Pfizer? The second question was for Frank. Maybe you've disclosed this. I'm not sure, so shame on me if you have. But I've heard from little birdies that money that you've already spent preparing for separation, this might have been embedded into an earlier answer, it wasn't clear to me. But the money that you've already spent preparing for a separation of Pfizer is on the order of $1 billion. I'd just like to know if that number is \u2013 if you're willing publicly to talk about whether or not that number is realistic. And then the final question, and this is a tougher one. I don't know if you'll be able to answer it. But some of us have been now thinking about if and when Pfizer splits, perhaps instead of floating one or more of these companies, they might be a strategic acquirer for one or more of these companies. I think we're all trying to get a sense of what the cost basis is for these companies so that we could understand if it's realistic that someone could buy them, or would the tax burden on such a transaction be prohibitive? I don't know if there's any kind of even finger in the wind, words of wisdom you can give us, Frank. Thank you. Ian C. Read: So, Mark, on the inversion question, the reason you do any deal is, as we said before, and it sounds like mother putting up a pie, but it's that we believe it's going to create value for shareholders long term. And so we can remain interested in the potential of an inversion because it would facilitate and enable wealth creation for shareholders. It would certainly also position Pfizer on the current tax laws to be \u2013 it would liberate our balance sheet and would position us to be far more active in the M&A space and competitive, which is why there's always a push to have tax reform because at the moment the American companies are not as competitive as the European companies given the different tax rate. So the inversion is attractive both because it creates immediate value and enables you to meet the premiums to acquire the company. And it's attractive because it will liberate your balance sheet for future activity and spending and cash flow. And that, in its turn, informs you as to what level of inversion you find acceptable, whether you want an inversion that is between 60% and 80% or below 60%. So it's a complex issue. And we're not focused totally on inversions. It's only a component of the business development strategy and only comes in when you believe you need that value that's created by the inversion to get to the premium to buy the company. But inversion is not our one-track business development strategy. With that, I will pass it over to Frank, who will answer the other two difficult questions. Frank A. D'Amelio: The little birdie question. Ian C. Read: The little birdie question. Frank A. D'Amelio: So, Mark, year to date, cumulatively to date, because that's what you're asking, not year to date, cumulatively to date we've spent give or take approximately $300 million. And I include the $164 million year to date this year. The thing to remember about these kinds of optionality projects, think about carve-outs, as I said. There's a massive amount of work that needs to be done. And when you're looking at I'll call it the total cost structure, these kinds of projects, they do run into the low billions of dollars. That's the nature of what they do. But here's what you've got to remember. In that number, there's tax leakage. Now you do everything you can to minimize tax leakage, but you've got to create multiple legal entities. Anytime you're creating multiple legal entities or more than one in a country, you create tax exposure, tax leakage. There's potential leakage regarding debt and the decision making you make around whether or not you're going to repurchase debt. And then there's all that I call blocking and tackling that needs to be done in areas like systems, legal entity and tax planning, regulatory work, supply chain. It's a massive amount of work. And think about the visual. This is a company that's been restructuring for a decade, integrating, putting things together. And now you want to do something where you're taking a major piece of the company and you're going to carve it out, in a sense undo much of the work that you've done previously. It requires a lot of effort. It costs a bunch of money. But year-to-date, which is what you asked me, cumulatively to-date, it's been about $300 million. Ian C. Read: That being said, we do see the logic because there are two different businesses and we do feel that the amounts we will need to spend to put ourselves in a position to complete optionality as being money well spent for shareholders given the potential upside of what optionality could produce. Frank A. D'Amelio: Essentially, the cost of having the option is really what it translates to, Mark. It's really the cost of having the option. And then the last piece about tax basis, obviously it's premature to get into tax basis of the businesses. But what I would say is to just punctuate what Ian said, the fourth criteria is being able to unlock that trapped value assuming there is some, in a tax efficient way. So obviously, anything we would do with that extensive tax planning would maximize the after-tax return to our shareholders. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Ian and Frank. Next question, please, operator? Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citigroup. Andrew S. Baum: Hi. Three questions, please. Firstly, just revisiting the tax question. Could you give us some sense over the next three years to five years where your effective tax rate is going as the business currently stands given the change in mix of the business, particularly the increasing U.S. contribution? And second on the tax, how do you feel the ongoing debate in Washington, what the probability you feel of any meaningful change may improve the effective tax rate that you pay? Second, could you comment how the recent Teva-Allergan deal impacts the M&A landscape from a Pfizer perspective? And then finally, you obviously reported a very strong quarter for PREVNAR 13. To what extent should we expect an inventory destock in the following quarter, i.e., how much of this is industry stocking, given I imagine that most of the vaccinations are going to happen (44:10)? But please correct me if I'm wrong. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Andrew. On the tax question, we don't project our tax rate. There are just too many variables in there, including business development, including where we make our earnings, including potential changes in U.S. tax law, and we give guidance on a yearly basis on our tax rate. Frank, do you want to add anything to that? Frank A. D'Amelio: Just that year-to-date, our tax rate is 25%. Our guidance for the year is 25%. So for 2015, we're running pretty much right according to our guidance. And then just to punctuate what Ian said, there's just too many moving parts to try to project out tax rates beyond the current year. But we'll obviously include the 2016 rate when we provide our 2016 guidance. Ian C. Read: Thank you. On DC, look, it's too difficult to speculate on what would happen on tax legislation. I do think I am heartened by the conversations that are occurring and the acknowledgment in Washington that something has to be done to allow global U.S. corporations to become competitive, given the nature of the U.S. tax system. And hopefully they will take action earlier rather than later to allow us to be competitive. And I think we will see that unfold in the next five months as to whether Washington will take any action on that or not. On the Teva-Allergan, does it change the landscape for us? I don't think it changes the landscape for Pfizer in any material way. We continue to have our own strategies and pursue our own BD objectives and this doesn't impinge upon that. Frank, do you want to talk about anything else? Oh, yeah, and then it's Albert on the PREVNAR 13. Albert Bourla : Yes, Andrew. I'm monitoring the inventories and there was no significant inventory build in the quarter. So inventories didn't materially affect the Adult performance also. Ian C. Read: So I think, Andrew, what we need to do on PREVNAR 13 Adult is, you have three influences or four influences going on. One, you have the underlying rate of U.S. citizens becoming 65, which is about 4 million a year. You have then in the U.S. the bolus of catch-up, which is significant and we believe will last certainly this year and next and maybe into the third year. And then you have the progress in the G6 countries as we get and have had per our registration and labeling changes to enable adult vaccine to be sold to the 65 and above. And there, of course, you have a huge cohort of probably substantially larger than the U.S., probably twice the size of the U.S. And that's going to take market development. We're going to have to work on that country by country. But we see there also the movement of the population to over 65 plus the catch-up opportunity. So overall when you look at those waves of opportunities, we feel that the adult vaccine is an interesting ongoing large franchise for Pfizer. Charles E. Triano: Thank you. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Colin Bristow from Bank of America. Colin N. Bristow: A couple of quick ones. On your AVASTIN biosimilar, you started the Phase 3 trial with a primary endpoint of objective response rate. Can you talk about the discussions you've had with regulators and whether you anticipate objective response will be an approvable endpoint? And then just two, on the IO pipeline, can you walk us through the key readouts we should be paying attention to over the next 12 months? Thanks. Ian C. Read: Okay. Technical question there, Colin, on that. I don't know if, Mikael, you want to address that question? Mikael Dolsten : All of our Pfizer biosimilars have been evolved in their development strategies in close consultations with the major regulatory agencies, in particular the FDA. So they all reflect input and robustness in trial design and what should be predicted the best choice of endpoint for approval opportunity. Ian C. Read: So I think we feel satisfied that we have an agreement with the major agencies and the endpoints will be the ones necessary to get approval. IO pipeline. Mikael, do you want to run through that or tell them what you think are the significant things coming forward and when we're likely to be issuing results? Mikael Dolsten : So I am really excited about our IO pipeline. And starting with anchor drug, avelumab, we have now more than 1,000 patients that have been on avelumab. And we feel that we see a consistent good response rate, substantial clinical durability in responses and a robust safety profile. And we reported some studies at ASCO and now we have positive readouts in lung, gastric, ovarian and bladder. You're aware and Ian alluded to that we've started a second-line lung cancer trial. We expect in the relatively near term opportunity to move to first-line in that setting. Our experience across the various indications will lead this year to numerous announcements of Phase 3, up to six pivotal studies that include several in lung, gastric, ovarian, bladder and renal. We also at ASCO communicated favorable data on 4-1BB already seen in the Phase 1 in follicle lymphoma showing good tolerability and together with rituximab favorable responses. We are expanding that study. 4-1BB, which is a unique molecule, one of the few I think in this industry this advanced, is also in studies with katuda (50:41) as well as soon to be in an extensive program with avelumab. We also have recently entered clinical studies with OX40 as another positive event for our immuno-oncology pipeline. And we have communicated favorable data with our CCR2 in pancreatic cancer. And later this year we expect a vaccine to start dosing for prostate cancer, and we have numerous compounds, NMEs, that will also enter next year. So you see really us evolving a very comprehensive monotherapy and a combination therapy. We will over time share more data. There is an ESMO conference that we'll give you an update on avelumab and will include particular lung cancer, ovarian, and also some bladder we expect, and we'll continue to inform you about the progress of 4-1BB. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Mikael. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Great, thanks so much for taking my questions, so two if I could, one building a little bit on what you talked about earlier around the amount of cost around planning for a potential split. Do you have a sense of what the dyssynergies would be to actually execute a split of the company at this point if you're trying to split it into two parts? I just think you may have some sense of that by now. And as more of us view Pfizer as a sum of the parts basis, it would be helpful to have a sense of how you think the dyssynergies would be. And then the second question I had was just on the vaccine side with the VOC business, a lot of focus on oncology obviously. But can you talk a little more generally about your strategy in vaccines? You're obviously making good progress with PREVNAR in adults. Staph is moving along and that obviously looks promising, but maybe a little more broadly where you see other potential areas for value there. You've obviously made some deals. You have maternal vaccines. You talk about C.diff. What do you think people might be underappreciating with your vaccines business as opposed to how you see it internally right now? Thanks. Ian C. Read: Okay, on the cost of dyssynergies, Frank, do you want to make a comment on that? Frank A. D'Amelio: From my perspective, we've obviously been looking at this. We've been analyzing it in detail. I think I'd summarize it by saying we don't see it as being a material dyssynergy relative to optionality based on all our current analysis. Ian C. Read: So your question the vaccines, I'll try and do a summarized answer, and then I'll ask Albert if he wants to add anything to it. I think you're seeing us continue to drive and maximize the PREVNAR 13 opportunity both in infants and adults. We believe that the opportunity in adults is broad and deep and durable, so we're confident in that. We continue to work on PREVNAR, on the PREVNAR family to look at further enhancements. We believe there's a real opportunity to accelerate as long as the Phase 2 trial on the back surgery performs as we expect, we think there's an opportunity to accelerate the staph-aureus vaccine. We're in Phase 2 with what we believe is a very good vaccine with C.difficile. And then we've made acquisitions of other vaccines like the Baxter (54:08) acquisition to add some critical mass to what our field force carries. We have TRUMENBA, which we think will develop over time as an important vaccine. And then we've done acquisitions and licensing of vaccines for infants. So do you want to add some more detail to that, Albert? Albert Bourla : Very few things to add, Ian. I think in vaccines we have substantial scientific capabilities and significant substrate, research substrate, that allows us to see optimistically into the future, and we've had a very good track record of delivery. With staph, we have already initiated, as Ian said, the Phase 2b study, and that's in 2,600 patients. If the Phase 2b data show considerable efficacy, we will consider requesting an accelerated approval from this product, and the study that we are running now could potentially serve to support registration. Ian C. Read: And have breakthrough status, right? Albert Bourla : And have breakthrough status. And the same as it was for C.difficile. That has breakthrough status, but also as you recall we had outed recruitment and vaccinations in a previously initiated Phase 2b study as a result of some cases of redness that we observed at the injection site. Now we have already recently received approval from the FDA to initiate a new Phase 2 program with a different formulation. So we are moving full speed in materializing that as well. Ian C. Read: Okay, thank you. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Christopher Thomas Schott : Great, thanks for the questions. The first one was just a little bit more color on PREVNAR 13 adult. I appreciate the earlier comments, but can you just give us little more color? When you think about the U.S. catch-up bolus, how large is that bolus and how far through are you at this point? Do you have any numbers on that front? It would be pretty helpful. Second on your PD-L1, you highlighted in the past the high disease control rate that we've seen with some of the studies. I guess when can we see more survival data that could help us assess that disease control rate versus maybe some higher overall response rates we're seeing from other products as we just think about this as a combinable agent longer term? And the final one was just coming back to business development. It does seems like we're just seeing a significant consolidation in the industry at the same time we're seeing an uptick in innovation. I know Pfizer has priorities in terms of what it needs to do given its product cycle. But could you just elaborate a little bit more just how this rapidly changing environment is impacting your business development priorities, either in terms of further sense of urgency, willingness to broaden the scope of what you're looking at? I'm just trying to understand how the backdrop of the sector affects how you're pursuing deals. Thanks very much. Ian C. Read: Thank you. PREVNAR 13, Albert, why don't you give us \u2013 yeah. Albert Bourla : Again, I will express my excitement about the success that they're having so far with PREVNAR in the U.S. And basically, we're able to make pneumonia vaccination for adults an age-based event, so people would get vaccinated when they come to age of 65 rather than a seasonal event. But of course, we were very successful in catching up a lot of previously vaccinated. To give you a sense of the numbers in the U.S., as Ian said, approximately 4 million people are turning 65 every year. In 2014, when we started with PREVNAR, there was a large cohort of approximately 27 million people that that were previously vaccinated with an old technology vaccine. And there was also another cohort of 18 million people that had never received a vaccine; so in total 45 million people. Usually there are 2.6 million deaths also that are happening per year in that cohort. So main, we don't have exact split of how much is catch-up and how much is normal business in the U.S. But given the massive number of vaccinations that are occurring, a big part is coming from catch-up, and this is large, as we said. That's why we said that this year we'll continue growing and will be very big. Next year also will be substantial, very big, might not grow versus 2015, but will be very big. And then we move internationally. Internationally, the age and demographics are more compelling than the U.S. because the percentage of people that are living above 65 is much higher. Countries like Japan, for example, is almost double than in the U.S. in terms of percentage, 14% approximately in the U.S. to 26%, 27%, 28% in Japan. And this is where we expect in the G7 to start getting a wave of recommendations now that we've got approval in Europe for pneumonia. But as long as we get recommendation, then reinvestment comes and then we start commercially penetrating very aggressively, as we did in the U.S. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Albert. I believe the cohort in the G6 countries are around 94 million. Albert Bourla : That's correct. It's double the U.S. Ian C. Read: Double the U.S., okay. PD-L1 data, yeah, that we are in partnership with Merck KGaA... Mikael Dolsten : So at a more higher level we can say when we carefully go through data from lung, ovarian, gastric, and bladder, where we have extensive number of patients for six months or more, we see response rates that are very comparable to other PD-1, PD-L1 agents. Of course, it depends on how you cut your data. We have generally looked at response rate including all patients and not solely PD-L1-positive, and that's part of our long-term strategy that it seems that patients that even have low expression of PD-L1 will benefit, particularly when you later develop combination therapies. So we accumulate experiences across all PD-L1 spectrum, but will of course in various endpoints look at PD-L1-positive. That was the strategy in our second-line lung cancer, which is all-inclusive for lung cancer patients in second-line, but the primary endpoint is on PD-L1-positive. Disease control rates are very high in our studies, in general, 50% or higher across several indications. And when we again compare to others, where do we look at disease control rate, six months progression-free survival, et cetera, we are very pleased with avelumab both for efficacy and tolerability, and you will get further data update at the ESMO oncology conference. Ian C. Read: Thank you. Going back to BD, look, we look at BD probably in two large ways in Pfizer. One is when we're looking at individual needs of the business units, which can be like a smaller tuck-in or can be an acquisition of an individual product. When we look at individual products, it tends to have normally \u2013 because very often you're buying the product at the beginning of it, either before it's approved or after it's approved, but you're looking at opportunities to expand indications. And so we look at the risk-adjusted return and we make a decision whether to participate in that franchise. And that can be influenced by the ability to combine it with our existing therapeutic areas if we can get also additional synergies through operational savings. So that's one way we're looking at BD which is more opportunistic, product related. Second type of BD is trying to buy technology, like perhaps gene therapy or selectors when we're going to CAR-T technology. Those tend to be longer-term investments. And the third type of BD is what you would say is a more traditional BD, where we look at total companies. And there the driver of value often is existing pipeline, existing products, potential pipeline product opportunities, synergies, and potentially tax savings and future liberation of the balance sheet because you are no longer are constrained by the U.S. tax situation. So I think what you've been seeing in the marketplace is foreign companies with significant tax advantages taking advantage of acquisitions in the U.S. and building up their organization. You've seen a refocusing by some companies, and you've seen with the Allergan-Teva transaction where one company needs to strengthen its portfolio and focus by acquiring the generic of the other company. So look, we are actively monitoring this process. I don't think we've lost out to any opportunities that would have made sense for our shareholders. We're determined if an opportunity is there we will not lose out. We have the world. We have the capability. We have the capital. We have the management team. So I feel that, frankly, our BD strategy and philosophy and approach is appropriate for this point of time in the value cycles. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Ian. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets. Alex Arfaei : Thanks, gents, and congratulations on a strong quarter. First on biosimilars, you have five antibodies in development. You're obviously making a significant investment there. Can you update us on your updated views on the potential of Pfizer in the biosimilar market in light of what we're seeing in Europe and how we should think about the opportunity for Pfizer? To follow up on that, given these investments, how should we think about some of the overlapping assets that you're getting from Hospira? And then finally, could you comment on the recent PCSK9 approval and potential implications for your bococizumab? Thank you very much. John Young : Thanks for the question, Alex. So first of all in terms of your question about the size of the market, we continue see around about $100 billion of currently patented biologic medicines that will lose patent protection over the next five to ten years. That's a significant market opportunity for companies that have the technology platform capability and current biosimilar portfolio to be able to capitalize on that opportunity. So we continue to think that we are very well placed. And in relation to your question about Hospira, we continue to see that our portfolio and Hospira's are highly complementary and we're very excited about the opportunity that that presents post-close. Ian C. Read: On the PCSK9 approval by in Europe from Amgen in the U.S., by Sanofi Regeneron, I think we expected on LDL lowering. I don't see substantial \u2013 I see modest use of these products until the outcomes data comes through. We don't think we would be that far behind on outcomes data. I think the size of the market is difficult to predict at this time. It really depends on how the CETP development comes through. If the CETPs which are oral come through, I could see a market that is segmented three ways; i.e., statin use that sees you get to goals, statin plus a CETP, or a CETP alone if you're statin intolerant; and then potentially PCSK9 being held in reserve if the CETP can't get you to the goals of the statin. So it's very, very difficult to predict how this market will shake out in value. And I think it's interesting to see what will happen in 2016 if the CETPs are approved and what type of label, what type of pricing they come into the market with and what type of pricing we see develop on the PCSK9s as negotiations occur with managed care. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Ian. Next question, please, operator? Operator : Your next question comes from John Boris from SunTrust. John T. Boris: Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the quarter. Just back to PREVNAR 13, can you quantify the shipments that you made into Gavi and the vaccine alliance and also provide some additional color on which national immunization programs included PREVNAR 13 into their program? And then secondly, on your XELJANZ filing in the EU, can you remind us what led to the rejection and what remedies that you've made to the filing? I believe you mentioned you're on track to file before the end of the year in the EU. That would help enhance the ability to secure approval on XELJANZ in Europe. Thanks. Ian C. Read: Thank you. Geno can deal with the XELJANZ question and then I'll see if Albert has any data at hand that's pretty specific on your question, John, or we'll just have to answer in generalities right now. But let's get to Geno first. Geno J. Germano: Thanks, John. I think the questions from the CHMP revolved a lot around the immune system effects of XELJANZ, understanding the safety profile primarily. So we have done some additional pharmacology studies, we've done a study with the herpes zoster vaccine to demonstrate a lack of interference with the immunogenicity of the vaccine and of course collected longer-term follow-up data from our long-term extension trials and our post-marketing surveillance trial. So it will be a combination of these data points that will comprise the resubmission that we're planning on for later this year. Ian C. Read: Okay. Albert Bourla : John, I don't have handy the numbers, so I will have to come back to you. But in general in emerging markets, the growth was 18% for pediatric approximately for the quarter. And this volatility will continue to exist. Ian C. Read: Yeah, because it depends on the timing of NIP, the timing of Gavi. Albert Bourla : Correct. Ian C. Read: And it's not something that we are particularly focused on. We have a full-year forecast which takes into account all these fluctuations and we've built that into the change in our guidance. Frank A. D'Amelio: That's all part of our revenue guidance. Albert Bourla : Yes, right. Okay. Charles E. Triano: Okay, thank you. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Holford from Jefferies. Jeffrey Holford : Hi. Thanks very much for taking my questions. So the first one is just around business development. If you can follow on here, so do you have a bias towards OUS-domiciled companies when you're looking at opportunities to help grow the GIP business, given where your cash is held? Second, because of your focus on doing BD in the next two years to bridge to 2017, does that mean we should expect much less cash to be diverted towards share repurchases? And then lastly just on the BD, given your want or desire to help boost the business prior to 2017, doesn't that mean given time for antitrust review or any other reviews of a transaction that we should be expecting you to announce additional deals during the second half of this year for them to come into that timeframe? And then last question just on a separate area. Can you maybe outline for us just a couple of the biggest OTC switch opportunities that you see for the business potentially in the next two years to three years? Thank you. Ian C. Read: Okay, on the OTC switch, I don't want to get into that because it's confidential and helps competitors prepare along with us in the marketplace. So I think you can look at our portfolio and make assumptions on your own as to which products are more likely to be switched or not. On the BD, I have no bias towards a U.S. or a foreign company. I have a bias to value creation. I have a bias on our portfolio, if valuations are equal and opportunities are equal, I'd prefer to do a BD deal that strengthens our Innovative business as I think we've done quite a bit to strengthen the Established business. On less cash depending on an acquisition, I think it depends on the type of acquisition and how it's structured and I think it's too early to say. But of course any deal we do we'll be looking at total shareholder returns and we would factor that in to the type of deal we're structuring. I think that's the most you would say at this time, frankly, about that. And then on timing, when I talk about 2017, I'm talking about \u2013 frankly, I use that as a marker given conversations I had with our owners about the fact that you've got great inline momentum, you've got these new products, you've got ELIQUIS and you've got IBRANCE an adult vaccine and all the other inlines that are moving well. I'm just looking at ways of increasing our revenues as we develop our pipeline and we start to see that pipeline come to fruition in 2017 and launch in 2018, and we'll see those launches 2017 through 2018 through 2019. So I think it's important to get any BD we do right and I don't feel pressurized to get it right by 2017. What's important is to get it right to create value for our shareholders. And I don't think, frankly, there's a timing pressure on us to do BD. We're going to look at it. We want to do BD. We're going to be opportunistic, but we're also going to make sure that we make the right decisions for Pfizer shareholders. Charles E. Triano: Great. Thank you, Ian. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. David R. Risinger: Thanks very much. I have two questions. First, could you just remind us about the ex-U.S. ENBREL exclusivity loss timing and expectations for timing of biosimilar competitor launches? And then with respect to IBRANCE, could you please discuss potential indications outside of breast cancer and what key trials we should be watching on that front? Thank you. Ian C. Read: Okay, thank you. Geno, could you do the ENBREL? Geno J. Germano: ENBREL exclusivity expires at the end of this year and so we expect to see biosimilar penetration beginning next year in Europe. Ian C. Read: Okay. IBRANCE indications outside of breast cancer? Mikael Dolsten : We are very excited about the potential of IBRANCE. And I think we have real unique proprietary knowledge in understanding how to use science around IBRANCE combination new indications. So we have an extensive collaborative research clinical programs that you may be aware of. But in addition to that, I'm pleased to say that we are starting a number of Pfizer-sponsored new studies. And very soon we'll start one study in head and neck cancer HPV-negative patients that are recurrent metastatic, combining IBRANCE with ERBITUX. We have prior experience of that combination in a collaborative study and are launching a Pfizer-sponsored which could have a very interesting path forward if data is strong. In addition to that, we have generated very compelling pre-clinical data on human tumors for pancreatic cancer, where particularly the combination of IBRANCE with nab-paclitaxel or ABRAXANE was very promising. And we are soon starting a Phase 2 study preceded by a safety lead-in with IBRANCE and ABRAXANE in pancreatic advanced cancer. We also have significant effort in understanding patients that progress on IBRANCE after having had long significant benefit in breast cancer. And you will learn more about Pfizer's program in double and triple combination that also can further expand our stronghold and leadership in IBRANCE. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Mikael. If we could take our last question, please, operator? Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Seamus C. Fernandez: Frank, maybe could you remind us the threshold for completing an inversion? And I ask the question particularly since some smaller deals appear to have gotten as low as 20% after the treasury update. So it would just be helpful to know what your thoughts are on the threshold for inversion because I think previously you had said it was really 40%. And then separately, as part of your optionality calculus with the split, do you also consider Pfizer as a potential target in that calculus since this would appear to be a value-add option for shareholders? Thanks. Ian C. Read: Are you saying Pfizer or the split of Pfizer? Seamus can't reply. Okay, look, it's probably the split. We think that in the optionality, both companies will be robust and strong and would have the ability to be successful companies on their own. And we really cannot comment on whether it would be BD activity to try and buy those companies. They would be companies that would be independent and continue to try and progress their own business strategies. On the inversion? Frank A. D'Amelio: Prior to the \u2013 I'll call it the September 22 proposed rule changes by the IRS, the hurdle was less than 80%. So our shareholders had to own less than 80% of the newly formed company that we acquired to get the full benefits of an inversion. That hurdle was lowered to less than 60%, which means we'd have to do a larger acquisition to get the full benefits. So it went from less than 80% to less than 60%. Ian C. Read: The issue with this, Seamus, is that the full benefit or non-full benefit is very idiosyncratic depending upon the company you're doing the inversion on and the complexity of the tax rules. So it may be that if you're in below 80% but not below 60%, you still have substantial benefits from an inversion. And therefore, despite the proposal changes or maybe on different targets, you need to be below the 60% threshold. So the universe is not constricted or reduced to only 60 :40. It's very dependent upon the type of assets, debt structure, where the cash is, et cetera, et cetera. Frank A. D'Amelio: Very company specific. Ian C. Read: Very company specific. Thank you very much. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, and thank you all for your attention today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Pfizer's second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to Pfizer's Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer's third quarter 2015 performance. I'm joined today by as usual by : our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Albert Bourla, President of Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer [VOC]; Geno Germano, President of Global Innovative Pharma; John Young, President of Established Pharma [GEP]; and Doug Lankler, General Counsel. The slides that will be presented on the call can be viewed at our home page, Pfizer.com, by clicking on the link for Pfizer Quarterly Corporate Performance \u2013 Third Quarter 2015, which is located in the Investor Presentation section on the lower right-hand corner of this page. Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussion during this conference call will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projected. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer's 2014 Annual Report as well as on Forms 10-K and in our reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. Discussions during the call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our Current Report on Form 8-K dated today, October 27, 2015. We will now make prepared remarks, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian? Ian C. Read: Thank you, Chuck, and thank you for joining our call this morning. During my remarks, I will briefly recap highlights from the quarter, provide a brief update on the pipeline, and close with a few thoughts on the issue of drug pricing. To begin, I would note that we have had another quarter of strong operational performance, and we have grown revenues operationally every quarter this year. This top line growth resulted from several factors, including: the strong performance of in-line brands such as LYRICA in the U.S., ENBREL, and CHANTIX; the uptake from our new products that are early in their life cycle, including PREVNAR 13 adult, IBRANCE, and ELIQUIS; and growth in emerging markets. We remain focused on continuing to generate this type of performance, where a greater proportion of our EPS growth is generated from top line revenue growth. Just a brief word regarding PREVNAR 13, we continue to see a very attractive worldwide opportunity for the adult indication. In the U.S., we have done an excellent job finding and protecting 25% to 30% of the eligible population older than 65, and we did this more quickly than anticipated. As a reminder, on our last quarter's earnings call, we said we expect to continue to focus on the remaining population over 65 in the U.S., although this will require sustained effort as this group is more difficult to reach. Also of note, during the quarter, we closed the Hospira acquisition. And I'm pleased to report that the integration is progressing smoothly, and we're beginning to see the expected value contribution to our GEP business. In terms of revenue, we are now the leading global player in the fast growing sterile injectable business, and we're the number two biosimilars company in the world. Through the acquisition, we now have three marketed products and more than seven years of in-market experience with one of these products. Our biosimilars pipeline is now one of the largest pipelines globally, with seven additional molecules in our portfolio under development. We recently received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA for Retacrit, a biosimilar epoetin. We are working closely with the FDA to address the concerns of the letter and, at this time, we do not believe any further clinical trials are needed. We are confident that the additional evidence we provide will support approval and remain committed to bringing this important medicine to patients in the U.S. as quickly as possible. A few comments about the pipeline, I see our pipeline momentum continuing to build and remain particularly encouraged by our growing strength and presence in immuno-oncology. Regarding the anti-PD-L1, avelumab, partnered with Merck KGaA, the FDA recently granted Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations for the treatment of metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma, a rare and aggressive type of skin cancer. If successful, the first potential commercial launch of avelumab is anticipated in 2017, and our goal is to have at least one or more additional launches each year through 2022. Beyond avelumab, we have a broad immuno-oncology portfolio across numerous mechanisms, including 4-1BB, OX40, a vaccine-based immuno-oncology regime, and CCR2. All of these assets are already in the clinic, 4-1BB, OX40, CCR2, and avelumab. And we expect to have up to 10 different I-O drugs in the clinic by 2016. We continue to see combination therapy as having the greatest potential within immuno-oncology. And our broad portfolio of I-O, small molecule, and ADC oncology assets will afford us the opportunity to test a wide range of combination regimes on our own and with our partner, Merck KGaA. We continue to grow our footprint in I-O through other collaborations such as CAR-T with Cellectis and in IDO with iTeos. And we entered into a collaboration with Kirin to combine our 4-1BB with their anti-CCR4 antibody and started a Phase 1 study in May. We believe this portfolio along with our skilled scientists should enable Pfizer to be a formidable player in this high opportunity area. Turning to vaccines. In early July, we announced the first patient was enrolled in a Phase 2 clinical trial of our investigational Staphylococcus aureus vaccine. We anticipate this study will complete in late 2017, with an interim analysis planned for late in 2016. Also in clinic (6:51) with the FDA, we restarted the Phase 2 trial for our Clostridium difficile vaccine, which has previously received Fast Track designation in August 2014. Enrollment in this program is now complete, and we expect to review data from it by the end of the year. In chronic pain there remains a significant unmet need, with nearly one in five adults affected. To address that opportunity, Pfizer and Lilly have resumed the Phase 3 chronic pain program for tanezumab. This program consists of six studies in approximately 7,000 patients across osteoarthritis, chronic lower back pain, and cancer pain. The study results projected to begin reporting out in 2017 and 2018. Of note, in the prior clinical studies of more than 11,000 patients, tanezumab demonstrated clinically meaningful efficacy versus placebo and other commonly used pain medicines. In inflammation and immunology, we are focusing our future investments in development programs on indications for XELJANZ in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ulcerative colitis, while deprioritizing further development in Crohn's disease and ankylosing spondylitis. Additionally, we received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA on psoriasis. While we have yet to meet with the agency to discuss their concerns, we recognize that overcoming the issues raised may be difficult, especially in light of the evolving marketplace. We will reconsider our investment in the psoriasis indication for XELJANZ following this discussion with the FDA. I would note that a new generation of potential therapies, including oral selected JAK inhibitors and IRAK4 are planned to enter Phase 2 studies in 2016 for inflammatory bowel disease, atopic dermatitis, and rheumatic diseases. We have a once-daily filing for XELJANZ under review at the FDA with a PDUFA date in February for the treatment of moderate to severe RA in patients who have had inadequate response or intolerance of methotrexate. And if approved, we believe once-daily dosing will add to its competitive profile. In addition, we intend to resubmit a Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency by the first quarter of 2016 for the treatment of moderate to severe RA. In assessing the current profile of our pipeline, I believe we have a competitive mix of compounds and modalities across the therapeutic areas I just spoke about in addition to cardiovascular diseases, rare diseases, and neuroscience where our expertise matches the potential we see. I'm pleased with our rate of progress. Before turning the call over to Frank, I would like to offer a few thoughts regarding drug pricing. There has been a lot of attention on the issue of drug pricing. And given the upcoming U.S. elections, it will continue to be discussed and debated. Ultimately, I believe good public policy will prevail, ensuring the best outcome for patients while preserving a market-based system that enables the industry to continue developing new treatments and cures. However, that policy discussion must take into account the role of medicines and the value they deliver to the overall healthcare system. Medicines are among the most effective and efficient use of private and public healthcare dollars. They represent around 10% of total healthcare costs and are expected to remain the same percentage over the next several years. This is because the price of medicines drop significantly once the patent expires. Today about nine out of 10 prescriptions in the U.S. offer generic drugs, which lead to significantly reduced costs in the healthcare system. For example, 12 million people take atorvastatin, and the cost has declined around 90% since 2005. So given the high use of generics, many patients have access to medicines with low copays. What's difficult is when individuals cannot afford the increases in their copays when their treatment is on a specialty tier. No individual should have to bear the full cost of their treatment when they become sick. The increase in copay stems from healthcare policies that have a short-term focus with limited incentives to pay for treatments or cures. Having an efficient and an affordable healthcare system requires incentives where insurance plans can be successful when they invest in long-term outcomes and provide for that success by ensuring wellness and prevention rather than treating the sickness. And to sustain the most vibrant, innovative biopharma community in the world, we must preserve the market-based system in the U.S. that enables us to continue to develop breakthrough treatments and cures for the benefit of patients. In summary, we had another quarter of solid execution on all fronts, product launches, cost and expense management, and the continued successful integration of Hospira into our business. We are on track to have a solid finish to the year. We remain focused on creating value for our shareholders and continuing to research and develop new treatments to help patients live longer, healthier lives. Now I will turn it over to Frank, who will take you through the numbers for the quarter. Frank A. D'Amelio: Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast. As you know, on September 3, 2015 we completed the acquisition of Hospira. Consequently and in accordance with our U.S. and international reporting periods, our results for third quarter 2015 and nine months ended September 27, 2015 include approximately one month of legacy Hospira U.S. operations but do not include any financial results from legacy Hospira international operations. Third quarter 2015 reported revenues were approximately $12.1 billion and reflect year-over-year operational growth of $795 million or 6%, mainly driven by : the strong performance in developed markets of PREVNAR 13 adult, IBRANCE, and ELIQUIS, all of which are early in their life cycles; LYRICA, primarily in the U.S.; one month of legacy Hospira operations in the U.S.; and 5% operational growth in emerging markets, mainly from Innovative Products. Reported revenues continued to be unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of $1.1 billion or 9% and the loss of exclusivity of CELEBREX and ZYVOX in the U.S. and LYRICA in certain developed European markets. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.60 versus $0.57 in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to revenue growth of certain new in-line and acquired products, a lower effective tax rate, and fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which declined by 160 million shares versus the year-ago quarter due to our share repurchase program, which includes the impact of our $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in February 2015 and completed in July. Adjusted diluted EPS was unfavorably impacted by $0.06 due to foreign exchange and the continued product losses of exclusivity in certain geographies. Reported diluted EPS was $0.34 compared with $0.42 in the year-ago quarter due to the previously mentioned factors and the non-recurrence of a one-time charge associated with the Healthcare Reform Fee versus the year-ago quarter as well as the unfavorable impact of increased purchase accounting adjustments, restructuring charges, and acquisition-related costs associated with the acquisition of Hospira, and higher asset impairment charges. Foreign exchange negatively impacted third quarter reported revenues by approximately $1.1 billion or 9% and positively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses, and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $601 million or 8%. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted third quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.06 compared with the year-ago quarter. Now moving on to the financial highlights of our business segments, in the third quarter Global Innovative Pharmaceutical revenues increased 10% operationally year over year due to the strong performance of recently launched products, including ELIQUIS globally and XELJANZ in the U.S. and the strong performance of VIAGRA and LYRICA in the U.S. and ENBREL in most international markets, which were partially offset by continued generic competition for RAPAMUNE in the U.S. Income before taxes increased 14% operationally due to the operational increase in revenues and a 7% operational decrease in cost of sales, partially offset by a 6% operational increase in SI&A expenses, primarily due to additional investment and recently launched products and certain in-line products, and a 7% operational increase in R&D, reflecting increased investments in our late-stage pipeline, primarily for bococizumab, tanezumab, partially offset by lower post-marketing trial expenses. Third quarter VOC revenues increased 37% operationally due to the 50% operational revenue growth from our Global Vaccines business as a result of PREVNAR 13, which grew 77% in the U.S. and 10% internationally; a 54% operational increase on oncology revenues, driven by IBRANCE in the U.S. and to lesser extent by SUTENT, XALKORI, and INLYTA in most markets; and a 7% operational increase in Consumer Healthcare revenues due to NEXIUM 24HR in the U.S. Income before taxes increased 52% operationally, mainly due to increased revenues with an associated improvement in gross margin, which were partially offset by a 26% operational increase in SI&A expenses due to higher promotional expenses for PREVNAR 13 adult and IBRANCE, and an 18% operational increase in R&D expenses due to increased costs associated with our oncology programs, primarily our alliance with Merck KGaA, partially offset by lower clinical trial expenses for certain vaccine programs. In the third quarter, Global Established Pharmaceutical revenues decreased 8% operationally, mainly due to the loss of exclusivity and immediate multi-source generic competition for CELEBREX in the U.S. in December of 2014 and generic competition for ZYVOX in the U.S. beginning in first half of 2015 and LYRICA in certain developed markets in Europe beginning in the first quarter 2015, which were partially offset by the $330 million contribution from one month of legacy Hospira operations in the U.S. and 1% operational growth in emerging markets. Income before taxes declined 11% operationally due to the decrease in revenues and a 3.2 percentage point operational increase in cost of sales as a percentage of revenues due to unfavorable change in product mix, an 8% operational increase in R&D expenses reflecting the increased spending in biosimilars and legacy Hospira development programs, partially offset by lower post-marketing clinical trial expenses, all of which were partially offset by an 11% operational decrease in SI&A expenses, driven by lower expenses for products that have recently lost exclusivity and cost reduction productivity initiatives. I want to remind everyone that on September 30 we updated our 2015 financial guidance ranges for reported revenues and reported and adjusted diluted EPS solely to reflect the anticipated impact of legacy Hospira operations on Pfizer's financial results from September 3, 2015 through fiscal year end 2015. Today we are updating the ranges for certain components of our 2015 financial guidance to reflect the following factors : standalone Pfizer strong performance to date coupled with an improved operational business outlook for the remainder of the year; the anticipated impact of legacy Hospira operations from September 3, 2015 through fiscal year end 2015 on components other than reported revenues and adjusted diluted EPS; and the minimal favorable impact from foreign exchange rates since mid-July. Consequently, we now expect reported revenues to be in the range of $47.5 billion to $48.5 billion, mainly driven by performance of PREVNAR 13 adult and IBRANCE in the U.S. as well as ELIQUIS globally. I want to point out that this range continues to absorb an anticipated $3.3 billion negative impact from product loss of exclusivity and losses of alliance revenue this year and a $3.1 billion negative impact from foreign exchange versus 2014. We also anticipate adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 18.7% to 19.2%, adjusted SI&A to be in the range of $13.6 billion to $14.1 billion, and adjusted R&D expenses to be in the range of $7.5 billion to $7.8 billion. Finally, we expect reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.37 to $1.43 and adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.16 to $2.20. Now I'd like to walk you through the 2015 guidance ranges for reported revenues, reported diluted EPS, and adjusted diluted EPS. Specifically what I'm pointing out on the chart is impact of standalone Pfizer's operations on these three guidance ranges. With respect to reported revenues, we're raising the midpoint of the previous guidance range provided on September 30 by $1 billion, and we're increasing the midpoint of our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range by $0.11. With respect to reported diluted EPS as a result of Pfizer's standalone operations, we've increased the midpoint of the range by $0.09. This increase includes a $0.02 negative impact from restructuring charges associated with the Hospira acquisition that are incremental to our previous guidance provided on September 30. Moving on to key takeaways, we achieved another quarter of strong financial performance despite product LOEs. I want to point out that this is the fourth consecutive quarter that standalone Pfizer achieved operational revenue growth which are driven by products early in life cycles, including PREVNAR 13 results, IBRANCE, and ELIQUIS. We raised the midpoints of our 2015 reported revenue and adjusted diluted EPS guidance ranges by $1 billion and $0.11 respectively to reflect both our year-to-date strong operational performance as well as our improved operational outlook for the remainder of the year. We closed our Hospira acquisition on September 3, which was immediately accretive to adjusted diluted EPS upon closing and expect it to be accretive by $0.10 to $0.12 in first full year after the close, with additional accretion anticipated thereafter. And we continue to expect the transaction to deliver $800 million in cost savings by 2018. We continue to create shareholder value through prudent capital allocation. To date in 2015, we've returned $11.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And we continue to expect to return approximately $13 billion to shareholders in 2015 through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2015 and beyond. Now I'll turn it back to Chuck. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Frank and Ian, for the commentary. Operator, can we please poll for questions? Operator : Your first question comes from David Risinger of Morgan Stanley. David R. Risinger: I have two questions. The first is on IBRANCE. Ian, could you just talk about the first-mover advantage for IBRANCE and how you see that playing out in the marketplace? And also, if you could, comment on expectations for breast cancer survival data, and then any comments on the timing of readouts in other cancers. And then separately with respect to your pursuit of M&A in Innovative Pharma, maybe both you, Ian and Frank, can comment on your current focus and how you want to set expectations for investors. And also, Frank, if you could, just talk through the difference between the benefits of a 60 :40 inversion versus an 80 :20 inversion, and just characterize how the economics would differ in those two different scenarios. Thank you very much. Ian C. Read: Thank you. Albert, could you answer the IBRANCE questions please? Albert Bourla : Yes, certainly. Let me start with the competitive environment and the first-mover advantage. I believe, speaking about our program, we have the most advanced and a much broader program than any other competitor so far. And I say the most advanced because we are the first one and the only one that have registration right now in the U.S., a product that has been prescribed with over 4,000 physicians and has been received by more than 15,000 patients so far. And we have also filed in Europe, and our file has been validated by the European authorities. Also, I say that we have a much broader program because we do have right now already two studies in first-line. We have two studies in recurrent metastatic breast cancer, and we have three studies clinical running in earlier phases of breast cancer. And in addition, beyond breast cancer, we have already 30 studies that are \u2013 excuse me \u2013 22 studies that are running in other indications of solid tumors. So we have a clear \u2013 not first-mover advantage, but we have a much broader program, as we see palbociclib as a major franchise going forward. In terms of timing on readouts, that depends on the studies. The two studies we have already reading out, the PALOMA-2 study, which is a confirmatory study, will read out next year. We have the early breast cancer studies. That pilot will read around 2017 or will come in completion in 2017. And the other two, PENELOPE-B and PALLAS, will come around 2020. And as regards to the survival data, we don't have any news on survival data, which is expected because the median survival in this type of population is approximately four years. So it will take some time until all these events will be accumulated. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Albert. On Innovative Pharma and BD, I think I'll limit my comments to something similar to the previous quarter, where we looked at BD as a way of accelerating value to shareholders. We feel that if all things are equal on returns, strengthening the Innovative part of the company will give a more balanced business between both Established and Innovative, especially in a potential split scenario if we were to split the company. And we continue to be active looking at BD and looking at sources of value, which are both pipeline which are operational synergies and potential financial synergies. And certainly I'll ask Frank to expand upon and talk about the 60 :40 or 80 :20 space and about how potentially wide the targets are for this type of innovation. Frank A. D'Amelio: And so, Dave, the way to think about this is less than 60% full inversion, less than 80% but call it greater than 60% kind of an in-betweener, a tweener inversion. The way we think about this is there's four buckets of cash in a hypothetical transaction like this. So there's our existing overseas cash and then there's our going-forward operating cash flow. And then there's the targets existing overseas cash and then their going-forward operating cash flow. The targets existing overseas cash and going-forward operating cash flow would be unencumbered. Our existing overseas cash and going-forward operating cash flow would be encumbered. And then the question becomes in a tweener situation how much of our encumbered existing overseas cash and how much of our encumbered going-forward operating cash can become unencumbered, and that's based on tax planning and those kinds of actions. And that is really, I'll call it, on a case-by-case, situation-by-situation, company-by-company basis. But we think of it in those four buckets. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Frank. So when you look at doing BD, you have to trade off what's the price, what's the value, what's the pipeline, and what's the risks you see in a case-by-case basis of sitting in the 80 :20 space or the 60 :40 space, so thank you. Charles E. Triano: Thank you. Operator, can we move to next question, please? Operator : Yes, your next question is from Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin : Can you hear me all right? Charles E. Triano: Yes, loud and clear, Jami. Jami Rubin : All right, great. Ian, just to follow up on that question on M&A, the last time we met, you had highlighted the attractiveness of a tax inversion deal. In fact, you signaled a preference for a tax inversion deal over an outright, say, U.S.-based acquisition. And now with Congress looking less and less likely to act on tax reform and your stock holding up exceedingly well in this volatile healthcare space, particularly given how much specialty pharma has pulled back, where are you in your quest to deploy capital? Can you give us a sense of timeline? It just seems to me like a phenomenal time to use your stock. Thanks. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Jami. I'd have to check the transcripts. I'm not quite sure that I expressed a preference either way. I think I expressed a preference for an Innovative deal, and I think I expressed a preference for any deal that creates greater shareholder value, which would have to be a combination of, as I said, pipeline, operational synergies, and financial synergies. I do think there has been an adjustment in the price of some of the specialty companies. There has been an adjustment in their price. I'm not so sure there has been an adjustment in their expectations of what they want to sell the company. But I do agree with you that BD is \u2013 we do have the ability to do BD. It can be an important way of adding value. This management team is not afraid of taking bold steps, and we're looking at opportunities. And when we make our decision as to what is the best way of enhancing value, we will move. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Ian. Can we move on to the next question, please, operator? Operator : Your next question is from Gregg Gilbert of Deutsche Bank. Charles E. Triano: Good morning, Gregg. Gregg Gilbert : Good morning. I've heard the two CEOs use the word bold in the last couple of months, so we'll see how telling that is, but a quick three-parter. First is the PREVNAR franchise. How big could that become and how durable do you think that could be? Secondly, Merck seems pretty excited about the SGLT2 program they licensed from you, especially in light of Lilly's outcomes benefits. So can you remind us what the economics are there and anything you said about the profile of that product? And lastly on Retacrit, on that CRL, Ian, are there any signs that the FDA is grappling with policy or legal or precedent issues there, or is it simply just about the application and some data they want, non-clinical data? Thanks. Ian C. Read: I'll ask Albert to talk about PREVNAR, and then Frank will give you an idea of the contractual relationship on SGLT2, which I think is an underappreciated asset and a huge opportunity for us and Merck in that marketplace. And then perhaps John could talk about what we're experiencing with the FDA on the biosimilars approval. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Ian. Gregg, thanks for the question. We are obviously very pleased with the results so far, and we continue to be excited with the opportunity. In the U.S., let me start. Two things stand out. The first is that we were able to make pneumonia vaccinations innate-based rather than a seasonal event that used to be until now. And the second, of course, is that we were very successful catching up adults previously vaccinated with the old technology product. For 2016, we continue to believe that the catch-up opportunity will still be robust, although it may not grow versus 2015. To give you some greater context, there were 45 million eligible adults when the recommendation was issued. We estimate that we have penetrated approximately 25% to 30% of this population so far, and that were mostly previously vaccinated with the other product, with PNEUMOVAX. Why there are still many adults remaining, this cohort, as Ian said, is much harder to capture and will take more work to reach. But we do have programs to reach them and also have programs to reach the population below 65 that is immuno-compromised and that can benefit from PREVNAR 13. Now in Europe, we received approval for pneumonia, and we continue to work with technical committees country by country to obtain recommendations and reimbursement. These will be phased over the next two-year period, depending on the country. But in general, I expect Europe to demonstrate strong growth. Ian C. Read: Thank you. So in summary, we think it's a durable franchise, and we're very, very enthusiastic by continuing to invest in it and develop that marketplace. Frank, would you like to talk about the economics of the SGLT2 contract with Merck? Frank A. D'Amelio: Yes, so I think just a summary is think about it as a 60 :40 split on profit. We get the 40% of the profit. Ian C. Read: Okay. And then on the biosimilars? John Young : Retacrit, thanks for your question, Gregg. Just as you heard in Ian's opening comments, we received a Complete Response Letter for the epoetin Hospira BLA from the FDA on October 16 of this year. I think importantly, our initial assessment indicates no additional clinical studies are required at this point. So obviously, we come to your wider question comment on what the FDA or the position they're taking with other companies' biosimilars. We don't have any insight into that. What we can say is that we are currently reviewing our CRL, preparing our responses. We expect submission of our response sometime during the first half of 2016, with an expected six-month review under the BsUFA, Biosimilars User Fee Act. Ian C. Read: Thank you, John. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, John. Can we move on to the next question, please? Operator : Your next question is from Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI. Ian C. Read: Good morning, Mark. Operator, we seem to be getting a lag on the questions coming in. Mark Schoenebaum : Is this better? This is Mark. Ian C. Read: Yes, I can hear you now, Mark. Mark Schoenebaum : Okay, I'm sorry about that. First of all, congratulations on all the great share performance and fantastic shareholder communication over the last year. So a lot of my questions have been answered, but I thought I'd ask for a couple clarifications. Number one, Ian, I think \u2013 and again, please correct me if I'm wrong. I think you've said before that if you were to do \u2013 if you were to find a value enhancing deal that wasn't an inversion that you would like that deal to close before the end of 2016 because after the end of 2016, risks of policy changes, legal statutory changes increase. I'd just like to know if you still feel that way. And then on the R&D side, I heard a remarkable number and I wanted to make sure I understood the number. The number was 16. What was that number? I heard it as you will have 16 immuno-oncology drugs in the clinic next year. Or is it something else? And if that's really true... Ian C. Read: We'll have 10 novel drugs in the clinic next year, Mark, that are different, and we can ask Mikael to run through those in a moment. There are just too many for me to remember now. And on the comment on taxes, given the proposed rule by the Treasury, which has not yet been implemented but has a retroactive date, clearly anything around this area, you need to be \u2013 one needs to be very careful on legislative changes. So if there was a deal to be done, I'd prefer it to be done under the present Congress, and then you're at a risk for the new Congress coming in and making changes in the rules. And of course, you don't know what the conformation of the new Congress will be, so you'd rather do it in a Congress what you do know who are setting the rules and what the rules are. So if we could go to the 10 products, Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : Yes. So, Mark, we have said that we'll have up to 10 by next year, and they include already in the clinic avelumab, 4-1BB, OX40, CCR2. We're just now starting to enroll for our first triplet based on the vaccine, VBIR-1. We are moving swiftly with an additional PD-1. We have started to file an IND that we'll be dosing next year for our first bi-functional against P-keratinin (37:50), another small molecule immunomodulator IDO-1. We have an M-CSF antibody, which brings it to nine. And then we have a couple of programs that are running towards likely end of 2016 or early 2017, which include platforms such as additional bi-functional CAR-T additional vaccines and further checkpoint inhibitors. So I think you've got the sense it's very robust. It touches multiple modalities and gives us unprecedented opportunity for combinations. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Mikael. Charles E. Triano: Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question is from Marc Goodman of UBS. Marc Goodman : I guess on IBRANCE, I think I heard the metric that there are 50,000 patients on the drug. Can you just confirm that and tell us how that's changed over the past quarter? Second maybe, Frank, you can talk about the gross margin and just some of the underlying dynamics and movements in the gross margin, so we can understand how to think about it going forward. What's sustainable and what's one-time? And then third, maybe some of the pipeline Phase 2 assets that you haven't talked about before but something that we should be keeping an eye on as we move into 2016. Thanks. Ian C. Read: Okay. I'll ask Albert to clarify the number of patients on IBRANCE. Albert Bourla : Yes, the number that I mentioned was 15,000, one-five, not 50,000. And compared to the previous number in Q2, we've had 9,000. So it's 15,000, up from 9,000 in Q2. And also to give you another statistic, it is 4,000 healthcare practitioners, up from 3,000 at the end of Q2. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Albert. Frank? Frank A. D'Amelio: On the gross margins, so the way I'll answer it is just I'll do cost of goods sold, just the reciprocal. So last year Q3, 18.3%; this year Q3, 17.4%, so down 90 bps. What really drove that was operational improvement. There's a lot going on there, Marc. So think about foreign exchange in terms of cost of goods sold as a percentage is a good guy, it lowers the cost of goods sold. Our LOEs, particularly Celebrex, are a bad guy, so it hurts our cost of goods sold in terms of it will be increasing it. Those mitigate each other. And then for quarter, operational improvements really drove the number. Our guidance for the year, 18.7% to 19.2%, so what's really going on there if you compare that to the year-to-date number, the 17.3% year-to-date cost of goods sold, is foreign exchange. If you adjust for foreign exchange, that 17.3% becomes almost 18.5%, which is close to the guidance range. And then when you add in Hospira, some of our projected sales for the remainder of the year, you get a little bit of a lift in the number, which gets you to the 18.7% to 19.2%. Ian C. Read: Okay. So I'd ask Mikael if he'd run through some of our near-term opportunities and then take that and extend it a bit to the third of our Phase 2 opportunities. Mikael Dolsten : Thank you very much. So nearer term, maybe a way to look upon it is we have really a few really exciting oncology platforms. You're well aware and we discussed IBRANCE in breast but also moving into head and neck and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The second platform, oncology, obviously avelumab with I-O combination, 4-1BB, OX40, and we'll actually soon share date on 4-1BB in various combinations, and also INLYTA that's used in I-O combination. In this case we have Merck KEYTRUDA. We have two breakthrough drug designations that are moving towards registration planning, elotuzumab for ALL, and XALKORI for ROS-positive lung cancer, an indication where you have long duration of treatment. Now these were four oncology platforms. In non-oncology in near term are ertugliflozins that we briefly touched upon today, tanezumab in pain, bococizumab PCSK9 in cardiovascular, and XELJANZ in UC psoriatic arthritis. Coming towards the earlier pipeline, we have \u2013 let's touch upon we have a real exciting rare disease pipeline starting to emerge with recently Phase 3 for rivipansel in sickle cell disease. We have another PD-9 inhibitor for prevention of sickle cell disease. And we have studies ongoing in Duchenne's and Huntington's with drugs that are touching these orphan diseases. And if these stay very strong, there are potential to consider path for accelerated approval. We heard from Ian mentioning that our C. difficile Phase 2 study is now completely enrolled. We're really looking forward to see that data come next year. And then coming back to oncology, we have a new ADC PTK-7 that showed interesting data in Phase 1 going towards Phase 1b/2. We have the (42:50) rights to XALKORI 392 (42:52) that have shown real robust (42:58) in this part of the pipeline. And we're starting next year multiple Phase 2 for our emerging immuno-kinase platform with IRAK-4, where we think we may be industry-leading, highly selective JAK-3, dual-acting JAK-1 to JAK-2, and also JAK-1 inhibitor. It will touch carefully selected indications where we think each profile has a unique purpose and fit to feel for the needs of patients. I hope that gave you a little bit of flavor of an exciting both near and midterm pipeline. Ian C. Read: Thank you for that. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Mikael; next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question is from Tim Anderson of Bernstein. Timothy M. Anderson: Thank you, a pipeline question, a non-market question, and then a strategy question. Earlier in the year when we talked to you, you mentioned you have an oral PCSK9 in development. And if I remember right, you said we might see data in 2016, human data. I'm wondering if that's still the plan. Second question goes back to PREVNAR in adults. When we've I think looked in the past at benchmarks, healthy penetration into the adult population might be something like 60%. I'm wondering if you can say what you think realistic penetration of PREVNAR in adults is likely to be in U.S. and Europe. And then last question is on potentially splitting up. Investors are obviously assuming that you'll do this at some point in 2017 or maybe later. But looking at it from the other end, what would be the counter-arguments to splitting up? In other words, why might it make sense that Pfizer would not want to go down the route of splitting up? What are some of the biggest hurdles to overcome? Ian C. Read: On the split, as we've said before, we haven't made a decision. We said we'll make a decision. The latest we'll make it is in the fourth quarter of 2016. And the four criteria we've set up is are the businesses doing well inside Pfizer? Are they likely to be successful outside of Pfizer? Is there trapped value, and do we believe we can realize that trapped value? From the other end of not doing a split, if we were to do a major acquisition in the intervening time period, then it would certainly change the timelines of a split. It wouldn't necessarily change the logic of it to the extent that that logic proves out. It would certainly \u2013 it may even strengthen the logic for it. But that would be a decision that would be taken post any type of acquisition and post understanding the timelines that involves. Frank A. D'Amelio: And the answer to all four of the questions that Ian summarized needs to be yes. In terms of if we were to go down a split path, the answer to all four questions needs to be yes. Ian C. Read: So on the pipeline question, Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : So thank you for remembering our exciting small molecule program against the PCSK9 target. And obviously, we are increasingly excited about that space as we have seen some of the struggle around the CETP drugs. And we are on track for dosing patients end of this year, and we have collected our IND documents, so it's perfectly on track. And I should say it's a novel mechanism that we have identified in our discovery work to intervene with the PCSK9 function, and we're very excited to get it into humans and see its impact. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Mikael. And, Albert, on the PREVNAR 13 adult penetration question? Albert Bourla : Yes, it's a very interesting question. Let me say that it seems that previous benchmarks or analogs of adult penetration have become somehow irrelevant after the very successful introduction of PREVNAR adult. And this was \u2013 I will give you just some data to support my statement. But right now we have achieved a market share of 87%. That's extremely high, as you can understand. In pharmacies right now we are having a market share of 90%. And keep in mind that pharmacies also, their overall share of participating in vaccinating and catching up patients has increased dramatically. I would say that we have disrupted this channel with our introductions. Also, our consumer activation and information campaigns have become very successful, and our commercials have run very, very high. As a result, the awareness among healthcare practitioners, for example in the U.S., has exceeded 90% according to market research that we have run, which of course is exceptionally high. So I cannot predict what eventually will be the overall penetration of adults in this country. But I would say that we are very optimistic with the success of this first year as to how much we can achieve for the benefit of the patients in the U.S. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Albert. Charles E. Triano: Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question is from Seamus Fernandez of Leerink. Seamus Fernandez : Thanks very much for the question, so just a couple quick ones. Historically you guys have provided some numbers around your thoughts on the size of the biosimilars market. Where do you see that? Can you just update us on your thoughts on the size of the overall biosimilars market and where and when you really see the acceleration in that market occurring? And then the second question, can you just give us a sense again of the level of penetration that we're at with 15,000 patients? What does the IBRANCE label currently approach? And then ultimately with the adjuvant setting in breast cancer, can you remind us again how much of the market that would open up? Thanks. Ian C. Read: Thank you. Size of the biosimilars opportunity, John, would you like to comment on that, please? John Young : Yes, sure, so thanks for the question, Seamus. Obviously, as you know, the biosimilars market is still in the process of forming in different regions of the world. We're very excited to be playing a leading role in the formation of that market with the portfolio that we now have, both of our own legacy Pfizer pipeline of biosimilars but also the in-market portfolio of products from Hospira. Overall, the market opportunity that we see is around about $100 billion worth of revenues from currently patented branded biologics that will lose patent protection over the next five years. The global market for biosimilars, looking at many analysts, is expected to grow from around about $1 billion today to somewhere on the order of $17 billion to $20 billion by 2020. Clearly, there are a number of factors that will drive and influence the evolution of that marketplace such as substitutions, such as the labels that \u2013 extrapolation of labels that products that come to market will have. Overall, I would just say that we believe that we're really well placed to draw on the heritage as a really strong biologics company in R&D and in manufacturing, which we believe will leave us to be very well placed in that market as it forms around the world. Ian C. Read: Okay. So, Albert, perhaps you can take us through a little bit the layers of opportunities we see in number of patients, or potential patients, probably talking about the U.S. for IBRANCE. Albert Bourla : Yeah, and I will also speak a little bit more generally. Let me start by saying how excited we are, of course, with this opportunity. Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. There's 1.7 million diagnosed every year with breast cancer. And approximately 60% of them, which means approximately 1 million, are ER-positive HER2-negative, an area that IBRANCE has demonstrated efficacy so far. Now with IBRANCE, we are working to build a broad franchise, and this is how you succeed around breast cancer and beyond. Speaking about breast cancer, we are starting with the first-line, and then we move to recurrent and then to early breast cancer. In the U.S., we expect to expand, first of all, as the opportunity goes, our market share in the first-line. Right now we have a market share of approximately 27%. And moving to next quarter, next year, we expect to expand that even further. We also expect to have an accepted filing by FDA of our PALOMA-3 data this year. We expect it will give us registration for later lines of therapy in the metastatic setting. In Europe, we have filed and our filing was validated. The filing in Europe was based on both PALOMA-1 and PALOMA-3 data, which means that covers the entire metastatic population, not only the first-line, as was our submission and current label in the U.S. We are also working to expand our label to earlier phases of breast cancer, as I have indicated earlier, with currently three major Phase 3 studies running. That includes basically thousands of patients. The PENELOPE-B is a study that includes more than 1,000 patients. With the PALLAS, it is a study that will include almost 5,000 patients, 4,600 patients. And the pilot (52:36) study, which is the first one that was introduced in that setting, is expected to come into primary completion around 2017. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Albert. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Albert. We'll move on to the next question, please. Operator : The next question is from Chris Schott of JPMorgan. Christopher T. Schott: Great, thanks for the questions. I just had two here. The first, if we think about business development, potentially addressing three broad areas of your business. It seems like you're talking about improving top line growth, driving operating synergies, and/or improving your tax rate or financial synergies. I know these are all important. But how would you rank order those three in terms of importance? Are some of those must-haves and some of those nice-to-haves? I'm trying to understand as you're looking at the landscape of what you can go after, how you're weighting those three broad categories. My second question was on inversion, which has been talked about a lot. But just in the current political environment where there's a lot of negative headlines around pharma already out there, how do you think about political risk of inversion just in this election season and with a lot of noise around the drug industry already out there? Thanks so much. Ian C. Read: So I think, Chris, the best way to think about this is that we want to target the maximum return on investment. And this is a mix-and-match combination of, as you said, financial, pipeline, growth, financial synergies, cost synergies. And the puzzle is to find the target company whose price and those three combinations allows us the highest rate of return on the disposition of precious capital. So I won't \u2013 and then on the negative issues of pharma, I'm a little \u2013 I'd like to hear a few words about that. I think there has been some negative press on particular pharmaceutical companies. I don't see that society is saying they don't want innovation and society is not looking for cures for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and cancer. And so I think our industry continues to remain firmly in good stead in the sense that we remain a low percentage of the healthcare cost. We are, I believe, the most efficient way of dealing with costs in the healthcare system. And so I think public policy is squarely behind having an innovative industry. Certainly I think we can make the case that this industry risk-adjusted is appropriately profitable. Its P/E and its return on capital and return on investments are I think appropriate inside the averages of the stock market. So I think the returns of pharmaceutical companies are reasonable in that context. So I do believe that we have a lot of positive arguments to make when having this dialogue with society. So around the political ramifications, the shareholders of Pfizer expect us to maximize their return, and the employees of Pfizer want to have a robust successful company in the future. Their jobs and their careers depend upon it. So part of the leadership of this is to ensure this company can be successful in the future. To be successful in the future, we need to have a competitive tax rate. So that is why it's an important issue for us. Thank you. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Ian. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Colin Bristow of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Colin N. Bristow: ...questions. I think a lot's been covered, but a couple more on the SGLT2. How should we think about your positioning here given you'll be fourth to market and you won't have any CV data until the 2019 \u2013 2020 timeframe? The feedback we've been getting is it's largely a JARDIANCE-specific benefit until proven otherwise. And so to what extent do you rely on a competitor showing CV outcomes data to confer class effect given you'll potentially be the last to have a CV readout? And then just second question, last quarter you stated that you see biotech valuations as priced to perfection in many ways. Clearly there has been a significant adjustment since then. In light of this, it would be great to get your current thoughts on valuations. And how is this changing how you're thinking about your strategy with regards to M&A and the potential geography of targets? Thank you. Ian C. Read: Colin, on the biotech, I think there has been a readjustment in pricing. As I said, I think it's been a readjustment in the stock price. I'm not sure yet there's been a readjustment in what investors and the leaders of these companies believe their company may be worth in a transactional situation. So I think we'd have to wait a little while to see if the new stock valuations settle in, in the reality of management's belief in the value of the companies. And then the second question was on... Geno J. Germano: SGLT2. Ian C. Read: SGLT2. So I think Geno can take us through some of the logic on that. Geno J. Germano: Sure. Colin, we're very pleased about the SGLT program and the recent findings from the BI-Lilly program on cardiovascular outcomes. We have a cardiovascular outcome trial underway. In fact, it's fully enrolled already with our SGLT partnership with Merck & Co. In light of the new findings from BI and Lilly, we are considering additional work that we may do to further augment the package that we're pursuing with our program. We have, in addition to the single entity development program, a fixed-dose combination with JANUVIA and with metformin. And of course, with the market position of JANUVIA in the diabetes market, we think that we'll be very competitive with our data package, and we look forward to entering that market. Ian C. Read: I'd like to say I'm extremely pleased that Pfizer is doing a partnership with Merck & Co., two great companies with great heritage in this space, and we look forward to being very successful with this combination product. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Ian and Geno; next question, please. Operator : Your next question is from Steve Scala of Cowen. Steve M. Scala: Thank you, I have three. The JAVELIN trial of avelumab in second-line non-small-cell lung cancer has a primary completion of 2021. So I imagine there are interim looks between now and then. Maybe you could tell us when those interim looks are or when the first one is perhaps. Secondly on the CDK-4/6 inhibitor landscape, I think the general view is that the Novartis agent is not differentiated, but the Lilly drug does look quite unique and potentially a threat to palbociclib. I think the recent Breakthrough designation was notable. I would like your view. And then lastly, thoughts on the recent baricitinib versus HUMIRA study and its potential impact on XELJANZ. Why isn't this a risk to XELJANZ? Thank you very much. Ian C. Read: Okay. Perhaps we'll ask Mikael to talk a little bit about the CDK-4/6 competitive space and what we know and don't know. Mikael Dolsten : Yes, thank you. So I think I will start and a little bit punctuate what Albert said that palbociclib IBRANCE is the only CDK-4/6 inhibitor studied in multiple randomized control studies and has such a profound program for advanced recurrent early breast and multiple indications also beyond breast. It's a highly selective drug for CDK-4 and CDK-6. We do think hitting both CDK-4 and CDK-6 is preferable. And it's very tolerable, which is important for a drug that is playing in patients from first-line up to early breast cancer. What we have seen from the edema type of (01:00:58) drug is data from an analog (1:01:00) in very advanced patients to multiple chemo, almost a salvage line. And that's obviously positive for patients being at that very difficult advanced stage. We know that it's a drug that is much broader than the CDK-4 and CDK-6 that characterizes, as you're right, fully said palbociclib and rebociclib. So for me it's a different drug class, broader, less specific, and may play very well in this more advanced setting where the data has been currently. And obviously, there have been some tolerability issues reported which may reflect this broader profile. It's very difficult to comment on competitor drugs. So like always, we say let's have data over the next few years and experience from patients guide us. But I thought that maybe gave you an opportunity for us to summarize the status today. Ian C. Read: I think one of the competitive positions we're taking is to accelerate a very broad in-depth clinical trial program behind IBRANCE to ensure that physicians have a broad experience with multiple indications and get in early and establish the standard of care there. So I think that's our answer to if there is a competitive threat, that's how we are dealing with it. Would you, Geno, talk about XELJANZ? Geno J. Germano: Sure. So, Steve, the baricitinib data that was recently released showed superiority on ACR20 and the DAS28 endpoints. In our own program, as you know, we had a trial including HUMIRA where we showed strong numerical separation not only on ACR20 but on ACR50 and ACR70, more difficult endpoints to demonstrate a difference. Now that trial was not designed as a superiority trial. It's more of a comparative trial. But that led us to initiate a head-to-head superiority study with XELJANZ in RA compared to HUMIRA, where we're testing both monotherapy and XELJANZ with methotrexate against HUMIRA with methotrexate. So it's a robust study. We'll be reading out in the first quarter of 2017. We think that that will help shed more light on the performance of this drug in this setting, this clinical setting. The endpoint for our head-to-head is ACR50. As you know, Ian mentioned before we have the once-a-day dossier filed with the FDA now, with a PDUFA date of February 2016. And then we have our post-marketing safety study that also has arms with ENBREL and HUMIRA in. So we'll have really good comparative data over the short and medium term to put these drugs into perspective. Frankly, I think that the JAK pathway is a powerful pathway that offers the potential for strong efficacy, and we think that that will play out with both baricitinib and XELJANZ in the long run. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Geno. We like our position of having the opportunity to look at it with and without methotrexate as well, which if any of you have ever had to take methotrexate, they'll understand why people don't like to take it. Albert, would you like to discuss the JAVELIN question? Albert Bourla : Yes, I do not have handy the date of when the interim analysis will happen in this study. And anyway, as you know, these are event-driven, so you never know what eventually will happen. What also I can tell you, this is as you know, a second-line lung cancer study. We are planning to initiate a first-line study this year hopefully. That will have an expected readout much earlier, so around 2017. Ian C. Read: Thank you very much. Charles E. Triano: Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question is from Vamil Divan of Credit Suisse. Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Great, thanks so much for taking my questions. I just had a couple, one building on what you were just talking about with the JAK inhibitors and XELJANZ. Can you just give a little more detail on the decision you made to focus your priorities? You said you're stopping development in Crohn's, ankylosing spondylitis, focusing on other indications. Was that something specific to the product? Was it safety or efficacy of the product in those indications, or was it more of a view of the commercial competitive dynamics in those other indications? And then second, just one if I could on ELIQUIS. I just wondered if you can give a little more color on what you've been seeing there. We haven't really touched on that on this call yet. And I'm wondering if you expect any negative impact given the approval of PRAXBIND, the reversal agent for PRADAXA, recently. I'm just wondering. Do you think that might impact physician-prescribed here over the next year or so prior to having an antidote for ELIQUIS in the Factor Xa available? Thanks. Ian C. Read: Geno, first two questions, please. Geno J. Germano: Sure, so let me start with XELJANZ. As we continue to see the studies read out, obviously we become more informed about how this agent is working in these various patient populations and various disease states. Our decisions on prioritization are made on the basis of the data that we're seeing, the emerging profile of the drug, again, across different patient populations, and also the timing of and the amount of work that's required to continue these programs. So it's a number of factors that has led to the decisions that we've made. We are very excited about continuing in the RA and the psoriatic arthritis and the ulcerative colitis areas. We're very encouraged with what we've seen so far. And these are very large, robust market opportunities. So we're looking forward to a bright future for XELJANZ. With regard to ELIQUIS, frankly, we're continuing to see ELIQUIS take share in the NOAC market around the world. We're a leading product now in a number of countries. We're a leader with cardiologists in many more countries. We established our foothold in the stroke prevention market and now in the thrombo-embolism market. We're continuing to make inroads in primary care. So that engine just keeps rolling. With regard to the antidote, the feedback that we've gotten from the physicians in the marketplace is that it's a nice-to-have and they welcome it. We don't expect it to have a major disruptive effect on the marketplace. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Geno. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Geno, next question, operator. Operator : Your next question is from Andrew Baum of CRTI (sic) [Citi]. Andrew S. Baum: It's Andrew Baum from Citi actually, three questions, short ones. First, Mikael, do you have a SERD anywhere near the clinic? Second, with regard to biosimilars, I'm interested in Pfizer's view on interchangeability. Is it economically desirable within the U.S. landscape given the much likely rapid erosion of revenue as a consequence? And then finally for Ian in relation to inversion, I note that Medtronic after inverting inside Covidien seemingly have had to import $10 billion worth of offshore cash with only a $500 million tax bill. Given this did not fall at the 60% level, does this mean that there's still a surprising amount you can do despite being higher than that threshold? Ian C. Read: Let's answer the questions in the order they were taken. Mikael Dolsten : So I assume you're considering what else in our pipeline could combine with IBRANCE. And we do have, as you know, the PALOMA-3 with a SERD, fulvestrant. We have some internal activities on porel SERD (1:09:04), but nothing that allow me to give you a date when it could or could not get to the clinic. I wanted though to say that we have exploration in the clinic with a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor that we have ourselves that have a unique tolerability profile because it's given intermittently. So we do explore with internal and potential partner drugs how you could combine. But I would probably be more keen to go beyond the estrogen receptor blockade and look for a mechanist that could be more much additive, synergistic when we develop the CDK-4/6 franchise further. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Mikael. John, could you discuss the interchangeability issue? John Young : Thank you. So first of all, let's just say that we view biosimilars as playing a key role in the future of healthcare, and they can address the evolving needs of patients, physicians, and payers. On the interchangeability question specifically, I think our view as a company is that interchangeability should be based on science and under physician supervision. Since biosimilars are not the same as the reference products, the traditional paradigms that you might see in a small molecule of interchangeability and automatic substitution just don't apply. So we believe that regulators and also payers should and will look at the data specific to each individual biologic molecule. That's why we have comprehensive development programs for our biosimilars so that we can actually help physicians and patients to be able to make informed decisions about how to appropriately use those molecules. And so our key point here is that there really is a need for more scientific progress to make interchangeability feasible and for that to really be driven by the data for individual molecules. Ian C. Read: Thank you. Frank, on the various flavors of inversion? Frank A. D'Amelio: I think the best way I'll answer this, Andrew, is your question I think is actually a good example of what I said before, which is it's really target-to-target specific in terms of how much of the benefit you can preserve of an inversion if you're an in-betweener in terms of less than 80%, then greater than 60%. And the example you gave is I think a good example of where benefit is being preserved. But it just punctuates my point before about it's really target-by-target, company-by-company specific. Ian C. Read: And I'd like to point out that these rules are proposed rules. They have not been triggered. Charles E. Triano: Operator, if we could, take our last question, please. Operator : Yes, your final question comes from Alex Arfaei of BMO Capital Markets. Alex Arfaei : Good morning and thank you for taking the questions and congratulations on the strong quarter. Ian, just building up on your earlier comments on trapped value and the split decision, is it fair to say that the ongoing strong performance of your Innovative business strengthens the split argument since there does appear to be significant trapped value there? So in terms of a go/no-go decision, I guess is it fair to say that the split argument is strengthened from your perspective? And then on immuno-oncology, given your focus on combinations, how are you thinking about pricing in the current environment given how the first-generation products are priced? Thank you. Ian C. Read: So I think on the split, to the extent that both businesses are doing well and can command premium P/E ratios, if those P/E ratios aren't being seen in the combined stock, then it would be an argument to say that this tracked value could be released via split. So I think we'll look at that and look at how the market is pricing the Pfizer Inc. stock compared to what the individual stock should trade at if their P/Es were unfettered, so to speak, by being on their own. And then I do think you're right that I believe that one of the competitive advantages will be if a company owns the sequence of treatments and the combination products. So I really see in oncology, it's becoming a chronic disease where you move from one combination to the next, to the next, to the next. And so the ability to both price those combinations individually and price if you have enough in your portfolio while also price a longer period of different treatments is going be extremely important as a competitive ability. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Ian, and thank you, everybody, for your attention on the call. Operator : This concludes today's third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. You may all disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Chuck Triano : Good morning, and thanks for joining us today to review Pfizer's fourth quarter and full year 2015 performance, as well as 2016 financial guidance. I am joined here today as usual by our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Albert Bourla, President of Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer; Geno Germano, President of Global Innovative Pharma; John Young, President of Established Pharma; and Doug Lankler, General Counsel. The slides that will be presented on this call can be viewed on our homepage, pfizer.com by clicking on the link for Pfizer Quarterly Corporate Performance Fourth Quarter 2015, which is located in the For Investors Section in the lower right hand corner of the page. Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussion during the call will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projected in the statements. Factor that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as on our reports in Forms 10-Q and 8-K. Discussions during the call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's current report on Form 8-K dated today. Also, today's call is not intended to, and does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to subscribe for, or buy securities of Pfizer or Allergan. We will now make prepared remarks and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian? Ian Read : Thank you Chuck, and good morning everyone. We finished 2015 with strong financial and operational performance. For the full year, we exceeded our 2015 revenue guidance and met the top-end of our adjusted diluted EPS guidance. Excuse me; and we achieved our first year of operational revenue growth in five years. Frank will take you through the numbers. Before he does, I have a few brief comments about what is driving our performance, some thoughts regarding where we expect to see pipeline advancements during the year, and I will close with a few comments about Allergan. Throughout the year and especially in the fourth quarter, our business executed flawlessly despite a challenging operational environment. We ended 2015 with solid momentum in both developed and emerging markets. Specifically in developed markets, during the year we gained incremental market penetration driven by continued success of products that are early in their life cycles, including Prevnar 13 adults, Ibrance, Eliquis, Xeljanz, and we still saw steady growth from key inline products in 2015, specifically Lyrica in markets where it remains patent protected. And during the year in emerging markets we saw operational revenue growth primarily due to the performance of Prevnar, Lipitor, and Enbrel, as well as from the addition of legacy Hospira products. The integration of the Hospira business into Pfizer Global Established pharma businesses is on track, and we look forward to this business being an attractive potential growth driver. This acquisition is indeed proving to be an excellent strategic fit, and we are seeing the expected value contribution to our GAAP business that we anticipated. Frank will speak to our 2016 guidance in a moment. We expect to deliver operational revenue growth in 2016. Our key growth drivers will continue to be Ibrance, Eliquis, and Xeljanz. And we believe that Prevnar adult global revenues will be comparable to the strong results we achieved in 2015. Additionally, we believe our near-term pipeline will help accelerate this ongoing growth forward. In looking at the year ahead, we expect our businesses will continue to execute well. They are competitively positioned to win their markets and are performing strongly against their competitors' set. Regarding the pipeline, we anticipate advancing many of our Phase III programs during the year. For Bococizumab, we reported today that the first of our six Phase III efficacy studies achieved its primary endpoint, and we expect readouts of the remaining five Bococizumab lipid-lowering studies [technical difficulty] during 2016. For [indiscernible], this year, we and our partners Merck will begin to deliver results from our comprehensive Phase III clinical program. In 2016, the alliance expects to submit applications to regulatory approval in the U.S. for both monotherapy and two fixed dose combination tablets using data from eight clinical trials. For Dacomitinib, we expect results in the second half of the year for a Phase III study in first-line EGFR mutant non-small-cell lung cancer, and we'll discuss our regulatory strategy with the FDA. So Xeljanz in the first half of this year we expect top line results for our Phase III program in psoriatic arthritis. We believe Xeljanz can potentially fill a significant unmet need in the psoriatic arthritis when non-biologic DMARDS do not have proven success, and where there are currently few alternatives for patients who have inadequate responses to anti-TNF therapy. In addition, in the first half of the year we anticipate the decisions from the FDA for a once-a-day daily Xeljanz formulation for rheumatoid arthritis, and we remain on track to re-file our application for RA in the EU. For Ibrance, we expect to see the top line PALOMA-2 study results in first-line advanced breast cancer in combination with letrozole, and we have an April PDUFA date for second and third-line treatment for advanced breast cancer based on the PALOMA-3 data. We could also see a regulatory decision for Ibrance in the E.U. by year end. Additionally, in the oncology business, we have a PDUFA date this year in the U.S. with Xalkori in ROS 1 non-small-cell lung cancer, and we expect to file for approval of Inotuzumab for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the U.S. And in immuno-oncology we now have a broad portfolio of compounds that we believe has the potential to support the development of a strong, deep competitive market position. We now have five immuno-oncology assets in the clinic, and expect to have up to 10 in the clinic by the end of 2016. As a result of our partnership with Merck KGaA, as of the end of 2015, we had 28 ongoing clinical development programs for Avelumab, with seven of them being pivotal registrational studies. We anticipate some of these studies will give us potential registrations in areas like Merkel cell, ovarian, bladder, gastric, and lung cancer. Of these seven studies, we expect to present data in Merkel cell this year, and to see data from the other tumor types in the following two years. And we continue to believe that the winners in this space will be those that have a breadth of portfolio assets to support rational combinations. We have a range of assets to combine with Avelumab when compared to other companies' assets, and we have already initiated six combination studies with Avelumab. In 2016, we expect to see data from 4-1BB in combination with Keytruda and in combination with Avelumab in various tumors, 4-1BB in combination with Rituximab in lymphoma, a combination of Lorlatinib, our next generation ALK inhibitor with Avelumab and ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer, and data from [indiscernible] with Avelumab in renal cell carcinoma. Finally, we may see data from OX40 as a single agent this year. Taking of all of this into account, we believe we are well on our way to being a leading player in this space. And now a few comments about our proposed combination with Allergan. We're excited about bringing two great companies together that have a strong strategic fit. The transaction is about acceleration growth potential in our innovative businesses and strengthening our established business, and more efficiently allocating our capital around the world. We are confident that we are taking appropriate steps so that we can achieve the key milestones needed to complete the transaction and continue to expect close in the second half of 2016. Since the announcement, we have been working closely with Brent Saunders and his team at Allergan, and have been delighted by the engagement and rapport that is occurring. We see a number of potential opportunities after closing as we continue to learn more about each other's portfolio. For example, we see complementarity in information in gastroenterology, and we have a -- when we will have a broader presence in cardiovascular disease with Eliquis and Bystolic. In neuroscience, Allergan's work in Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, and major depressive orders will be highly complementary to Pfizer's promising early work in such areas as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. When you look at over the next few years we expect both companies will continue -- contribute, sorry, several potential new drugs to launch. We'll also continue to be excited about the international potential. And by coming together, we are enhancing category leadership throughout our complementary inline portfolio, and a combined pipeline with great late-stage and mid-stage assets across each of our key therapeutic areas. Both companies bring a great deal of scientific and product expertise to the provost combination and a shared philosophy in our approach to research and development. Upon the close of the transaction, the combined company will be an influential player in the industry with a competitive product portfolio with several leadership positions, robust pipeline, compelling capital structure, and financial position, and aligned cultures that are based on ownership and entrepreneurial spirit creating shareholder value and meeting patients' needs. This combination is about investing in our business. It's about accelerating our existing strategy, while preserving our options as putting the company into an innovative business and an established business. If we determine that is the best way to unlock the most value for our shareholders. By the end of the current quarter our integration teams will be fully engaged, and we anticipate announcing post-closing leadership positions. Throughout the year we will continue to keep you updated on our progress. In summary, we're looking at a year ahead we have a sound strategy, and a strong business. Our outlook and financial guidance for the year takes into the account the benefit of anticipated positive organic growth from key products, as well as the impact from foreign exchange. We have a solid portfolio of market-leading inline products, a healthy pipeline. We expect to further strengthen the growth potential of the business with the pending addition of Allergan. We will continue to have the means by which we can create value for our shareholders and bring innovative medicines to patients by producing expected top line growth, progressing key pipeline assets, pursuing strategic business development, and returning capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Now I'll turn it over to Frank for additional details on the quarter and our 2016 financial guidance. Frank D'Amelio: Thanks, Ian. Good day everyone. As always, the charts that we're viewing today are included in our webcast. As a reminder, because we completed the acquisition of Hospira on September 3, 2015, Pfizer's full year financial results for the year ended December 31, 2015 include four months of legacy Hospira U.S. operations and three months of legacy Hospira international operations. Financial results for the fourth quarter 2015 include three months of legacy Hospira Global operations. By comparison, financial results for full year and fourth quarter 2014 do not include any contribution from legacy Hospira operations. Now, moving on to the financials; fourth quarter 2015 reported revenues were approximately $14 billion, and reflect year-over-year operational growth of 1.9 billion or 14%, mainly driven by the addition of legacy Hospira operations. The continued strong performance of products that are early in their lifecycles such as Prevnar 13 adult, Ibrance, Eliquis, and Xeljanz, Lyrica primarily in the U.S. and 5% operational growth in emerging markets, mainly from legacy Hospira operations, Prevnar 13, and certain other products. Reported revenues continued to be unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of 934 million or 7%. Excluding the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations of 1.2 billion, the negative impact of foreign exchange and to a much lesser extent the inclusion of 35 million of revenues associated with vaccines acquired from Baxter, Pfizer-standalone achieved operational growth of 646 million or 5% while at the same time absorbing a 720 million negative operational impact from product losses of exclusivity. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $0.53 versus $0.54 in the year ago quarter. The decrease is primarily due to an aggregate operational increase and adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses, and adjusted R&D expenses or 1.8 billion or 21%, $0.07 due to foreign exchange and the continued product losses of exclusivity in certain geographies. These were partially offset by revenue growth of certain new, in-line, and acquired products, lower effective tax rate, and few diluted weighted average shares outstanding which declined by 125 million shares versus the year ago quarter due to our share repurchase program which includes the impact of $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in February 2015 and completed in July. Reported diluted EPS was $0.10 compared with $0.19 in the year ago quarter due to the previously mentioned factors and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency losses related to Venezuela, increased purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition related cost, restructuring charges, and asset impairment charges versus the prior year quarter, and non-recurring charges related to pension settlements, which were partially offset by the non-recurrence of a charge associated with the global strategic alliance formed with Merck KGaA in November 2014 to jointly develop and commercialize Avelumab, lower charges for certain legal matters, and a lower effective tax rate. Foreign exchange negatively impacted fourth quarter reported revenues by approximately $934 million or 7% and positively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $435 million or 5%. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.07 compared with the year ago quarter. Now, moving on to the financial highlights of our business segments; in the fourth quarter, Global Innovative Pharmaceutical revenues increased 10% operational year-over-year due to the strong performance of recently launched products including Eliquis globally and Xeljanz in the U.S. and the strong performance of Lyrica in the U.S. and Japan. Income before taxes increased 17% operationally due to the increase of revenues and a 5% operational decrease in cost of sales. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue decreased 1.7 percentage points operationally because of low royalty expenses and increased alliance revenues with no associated cost of sales. IBT was unfavorably impacted by a 4% operational increase and SI&A expenses as a result of additional investment in Eliquis, Xeljanz, and Chantix, and 11% operational increase in R&D reflecting investments in our late-stage pipeline primarily for Bococizumab and Tanezumab. Fourth quarter VOC revenues increased 38% operationally, reflecting operational revenue growth in each business. Global vaccine revenues grew 53% operationally driven by 102% increase of Prevnar 13 U.S. revenues to the strong uptake among adults. Global oncology revenues grew 61% operationally driven by Ibrance in the U.S. and to a lesser extent by Sutent and Xalkori globally. And consumer healthcare revenues grew 4% operationally due to Nexium 24HR in the U.S. Income before taxes increased 33% operationally, mainly due to increased revenues and associated improvement in gross margin, which were partially offset by a 66% operational increase and SI&A expenses as a result of higher promotional expenses in the U.S. for newly launched consumer healthcare products, Ibrance, and Prevnar 13 adult. And the 46% operational increase in R&D expenses due to increased cost associated with oncology oncology programs, primarily our alliance with Merck KGaA and Ibrance. Fourth quarter, Global Established Pharmaceutical revenues increased 5% operationally, mainly due to the previously mentioned inclusion of legacy Hospira revenues contributing $1.2 billion, which was partially offset by loss of exclusivity and generic competition for Celebrex in the U.S. and certain other developed markets, Lyrica in most developed markets in Europe and Zyvox in the U.S. Emerging market revenues were flat operationally, which reflected the positive impact of the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations and continued strong growth in China offset by declines in certain markets in the Middle East. Income before taxes declined 12% operationally reflecting the unfavorable impact of a 4.7 percentage point operational increase in cost of sales as a percentage of revenues due to the inclusion of Hospira operations and the impact of losses of exclusivity, a 24% operational increase in SI&A expenses driven in part by the addition of Hospira operations and the 53% operational increase in R&D expenses due to increased legacy Hospira development programs. We exceeded the top of our guidance range of expectations for 2015 reported revenues by approximately $400 million. Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was 18.5% versus 18.7% at the low-end of our guidance range due to increased Alliance revenues and sales volumes, and we exceeded our expectation for our effective tax rate on adjusted income as a result of the favorable change in our jurisdictional mix of earnings. We met our expectations for adjusted R&D expenses and achieved the top-end of our adjusted diluted EPS. Adjusted SI&A expenses are $14.3 billion, or higher than our guidance range due to increased expenses for recently launched products such as Prevnar 13 adult and Ibrance, other inline products, and certain Consumer Healthcare brands. We recorded adjusted other income of $409 million versus our expectation of approximately $500 million. Finally, reported diluted EPS was a $1.24 versus our expected range of a $1.37 to a $1.43, mainly as a result of increased purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and restructuring charges primarily related to the acquisition of Hospira, the negative impact of foreign currency losses related to Venezuela, and non-recurring charges related to pension settlements. Now I'd like to walk you through the 2016 guidance ranges for reported revenues, reported diluted EPS, and adjusted diluted EPS relative to our 2015 actual results. First, it's important to note that our 2016 financial guidance excludes the impact of our pending combination with Allergan. Our 2016 reported revenue guidance range reflects anticipated strong growth of certain new inline and acquired product that is partially offset by an anticipated $2.3 billion negative impact due to continuing product losses of exclusivity. I want to point out that that would be in this range and consistent with our previous comments we expect full year Prevnar 13 adult global revenues to be comparable with its full year 2015 global revenue level. We expect adverse changes in foreign exchange based on mid-January 2016 rates relative to the U.S. dollar compared with actual foreign exchange rates in 2015 to have an additional $2.3 billion negative impact on the reported revenues, including an estimated $800 million negative currency impact related to Venezuela. Consequently, we expect 2016 reported revenues to be in the range of $49 billion to $51 billion. Reported diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS guidance also include the negative impact from product losses of exclusivity, as well as an expected $0.09 negative impact from foreign exchange rates and the $0.07 negative currency impact related to Venezuela. As a result, we expect reported diluted EPS to be in the range of a $1.54 to a $1.67, and adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range $2.20 to $2.30. In addition, I want to remind everyone that guidance ranges for both reported and adjusted diluted EPS incorporate $5 billion of anticipated share repurchases in 2016, which consists of our previously announced intention to execute a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program in the first half of 2016. These repurchases are expected to more than offset the potential dilution related to employee compensation programs. In summary, to exclude anticipated foreign exchange impacts, including the negative currency impact related to Venezuela, full year 2016 revenue and adjusted EPS guidance midpoints are 7% and 10% greater than actual full year 2015 levels respectively. The remaining elements of our 2016 financial guidance are set forth on this chart. Now moving on to key takeaways, we had a very strong financial performance in 2015 and we achieved operational revenue growth every quarter, including 14% operational growth in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2015, we achieved 6% operational revenue growth that was mainly driven by new products that are early in their lifecycles and we achieved this growth despite a 3.2 billion negative impact from product losses of exclusivity. Our full year 2016 reported revenue guidance range of 49 billion to 51 billion absorbs a 4.6 billion combined negative impact of product losses of exclusivity, adverse changes in foreign exchange rates, and the negative currency impact related to Venezuela. And the adjusted diluted EPS guidance range includes an anticipated $0.16 negative impact from foreign exchange, including Venezuela. We announced our proposed combination with Allergan, and continue to expect the transaction to close the second half of 2016. And we continue to create shareholder value through prudent capital allocation. In 2015, we returned $13.1 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And we expect to execute a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program in the first half of 2016. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2016, and beyond. Now I'll turn it back to Chuck. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Ian and Frank. Operator, can we please poll for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Colin Bristow from Bank of America. Colin Bristow : Good morning, and congrats on the solid finish for the year. So a couple of product-specific questions if I may, on the Prevnar franchise, you've posted strong 4Q numbers. Could you just talk about your expectations for the trajectory going forward? On Ibrance there's been a lot of discussion around [indiscernible], and the potential there for a threat to Ibrance. What's your view here? And then just lastly on Biosimilars, can you update us on the status of your Biosimilar candidates, and when we should expect any data readouts? Thanks. Ian Read : Thank you, Colin. I'll ask Albert to manage the Prevnar and Ibrance, and then pass it over to John for Biosimilars. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much for the question, Colin. Let me provide some insight to help you understand the situation moving forward. In the U.S., obviously we have done an excellent job with the catch-up opportunity. We have achieved 86% markets there, 92% at retailers. We have 90% awareness of the recommendation at healthcare practitioner. And as a result, over the 45 million adults eligible at the time of recommendation for vaccination, we have already captured about a third [ph] of them. Now while many adults remain, this cohort is more difficult to capture, as the low-hanging fruit is gone. It will require more innovative strategies that we all have in place, but even if we assume a similar or higher penetration rate this year, it will be on a much smaller pool of adults. However, we expect this will be mitigated by Europe, which has a very different growth profile. Even with prices lower than U.S., the demographics are very favorable, with much larger eligible population, and who have already received pneumonia in our label in 2015, and we are working to obtain broad recommendations, and following that reimbursement from the authorities. Now this will be phased likely over a two-years window period, because in Europe this is done country-by-country, and sometimes region-by-region within the same country. But all in all, we expect very strong growth in Europe next year. Now let me move on Ibrance, and your question about competition or particularly [indiscernible] drug. Look, [indiscernible] drug, while in the same class, is for any [ph] indication. The refractory patient population, what we have received breakthrough designation, is a very small population with few options available. In fact the average refractory patient undergoes seven lines of treatment. So it's -- they are in high-mid. Now speaking generally on competition, there is only limited clinical data on the public domain, and we need to see more efficacy and safety data to make comparisons. What I can tell you is about our strategic position. We are the only company with a registered product in U.S., and six other countries, and an accepted filing in Europe, where we may obtain registration as early as next year. We have very good clinical experience with the product. Ibrance has been prescribed by 5,000 physicians in more than 20,000 patients. And so far feedback is very positive, particularly on patients' quality of life. We are having a very heavy clinical program. We have two pivotal studies in first-line metastatic breast cancer, two studies in recurrent metastatic breast cancer, and three in early breast cancer, PENELOPE-B, PALLAS, and PEARL [ph]. Ibrance is part of 88 investigational initiated trials, approximately 50 in breast cancer and 38 in other tumor types. So as you can see, we are investing heavily to stay ahead of the competition. Ian Read : Thank you, Albert. I think just on Ibrance, you mentioned next year for Europe, you meant this year, late this year we may be able to get registration\u2026 Albert Bourla : Correct in '16, I mean. Sorry. I apologize. Ian Read : Yes, thank you. Go ahead. John Young : Okay. So thanks for the question on Biosimilars, Colin. So I think we're obviously very excited to being able to bring together the combination of Hospira's current inline biosimiliars which are already in the market. So we have three assets, as you know, which are already in the market in Europe, Nivestim, Retacrit, and Inflectra. And to bring that together along with the legacy Pfizer monoclonal antibody pipeline, plus some additional assets that Hospira have. So in total, when you look at the pipeline, we have nine distinct biosimilar molecules in different stages of development. Infliximab, outside of the E.U., Adalimumab, Trastuzumab, Bevacizumab, Rituximab, Pegfilgrastim, Ranibizumab, Denosumab, and Ustekinumab. So overall we have a very strong pipeline. A number of those assets are in Phase III, late-phase development. And the first dataset there you'd be seeing from our Phase III studies would come from the legacy Pfizer Infliximab program where we would expect to produce data from our Phase III towards the end of this year. Ian Read : Thank you, John. Frank D'Amelio: Thanks, John. Chuck Triano : Operator, can we please move to the next question. Operator : Your next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Chuck Triano : Jami? Okay, Jami. We may come back to Jami if she's -- if we can correct the technical issues. If not, let's go to Alex. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets. Alex Arfaei : Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. Frank, your gross margin for 2016 is better than we expected, considering you're integrating a lower margin business in Hospira and losing exclusivity on some high-margin products. Can you help us understand what's driving that, and how we should think about -- and should we expect traditional margin expansion going forward, given that your Innovative business is growing at a faster rate? And then on Hospira's contribution this quarter, it doesn't seem to reflect much revenue synergies. Obviously it's too early, but how should we think about Hospira's contribution next year and possible revenue synergies going forward? Thank you. Frank D'Amelio: So Alex, on the gross margin, let me run the numbers and then I'll answer the question. So we ended the full year at 18.5% in terms of cost of sale. So I'll do the cost of sale. The reciprocal obviously is gross margin. We got it for next year across the sales number of 21% to 22%. So if you take the midpoint of that 21 to 22, just to make the math easy, that's 21.5% from our 18.5%. That's a 3%, 300 basis point increase in our cost of sales as a percentage of revenues. By the way, that's being driven by a few factors, but one of which clearly is Hospira. In terms of -- I think your question, which was why wasn't even more, I think the answer is our ongoing productivity and cost reduction initiatives. When you think about our factories, our manufacturing capabilities, we really manage that from a cost perspective. First of all, we focus that on quality, service, and cost. If you think about that as a triangle, quality is at the top of the triangle. But there's four major buckets, right? There's the number of facilities, there's the numerous quality initiatives we have within each facility. There's the purchasing that we can get from a leverage perspective, and then finally, there's the center cost that resides outside of the factories. We manage all four of those very aggressively to basically -- to manage our cost structure in manufacturing, but that gives you a feel for what the numbers were, and why they are what they are. Ian Read : Please, John. John Young : So thanks, Alex. So obviously, again, we are very excited by the opportunities afforded us by the combination of our two businesses. And I think I've talked about biosimilars already, and the opportunities we see in that marketplace. So let me just touch briefly on sterile injectables. Obviously it's a very -- it's a large, it's a growing market. It's somewhere between $50 billion to $70 billion currently globally, and one of the sort of features of that market is it's very concentrated, particularly in the U.S., but also in a few ex-U.S. markets, such as Western Europe, and particularly China. So, one of the things that we are very focused on is going to be revenue synergy. We obviously have a strong commercial presence in China, and also in the hospital segment in developed Europe and emerging Europe. So essentially the lag time since September when we closed this transaction we've been focused really on making sure that we have our blocking and tackling in place to be very systematic with our highest value molecules that really sort of meet market needs most appropriately. To be very focused on registering and brining those molecules to market. So in the biggest opportunity that we have in China, that is going to take time, as you are very well aware. Drug lag in China is a significant issue, but we're very encouraged by the progress that the CFDA are making to accelerate access to important new medicines in China. But that will take time. But we do see opportunities both in the short-term, as well as medium and long-term to deliver significant growth ex-U.S. through the sterile injectable business and the combination of Hospira's portfolio into our commercial footprint. Chuck Triano : Thanks, John. And operator, see if we can get Jami Rubin back. Operator : The next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin : Thank you. Sorry about that. Don't really know what happened on my end, but anyway, just a few questions. Frank, can you tell us what the Venezuela revenues are? I guess we are in consensus, we're surprised by the size of the hit; can you all hear me? Frank D'Amelio: Yes, we can hear you. You're a little static, but we can hear you. Jami Rubin : Okay, sorry about that. Anyway, so Frank, if you could just provide more color on Venezuela? And why such a big hit? And then Ian, just a couple of questions for you, just back on this whole breakup thesis and the timing, I think investors initially were disappointed by the timing that you laid out at the time that you were announcing Allergan deal. I think you said you would make a decision by the end of 2018. I just want to put out there that the stock has pulled back quite a bit since you announced the Allergan deal, and I would think despite clearly the market is excited about this, but I would think that that would -- that the difference in -- even growing gap in valuation between where your stock is in an SOTP should help you to accelerate your decision to move in that direction, and if you could just comment on that please. And then just, thirdly, on revenue growth. I mean, clearly there have been tons of pushes and pulls in your numbers, mostly currency, and patent expirations. Can you remind us when you expect, and this excludes the acquisition from Allergan, but when you expect your reported revenue growth -- or just talk about operationally revenue growth, when we should start to see a positive inflection point, because it has, when I look at my models, revenues have been in decline for many years and some of that's divestitures, and spins, but really since 2013, we've had revenues sort of flat to down. When is that going to change, and what's going to drive that change, just talking from Pfizer's standpoint? Thanks very much. Frank D'Amelio: Let me just do the revenue growth first. Well, you know, as I said, '15 was the first year when we saw revenue growth; '16, we expect it to be around operationally narrow. We expect it to be Hospira and Allergan, we expect it to be flat and that's because we had a huge growth from adult vaccine in '15, and we'll hold that franchise. We won't grow it again. We'll have good growth from our inline products and our newly launched products, but we'll still deal with a couple of billion of LOEs. So I think you can begin to see, as we launch -- as we begin to get more traction with more clinical trial in Ibrance as we begin to see the launch, as we begin to see our next wave of products get approved, you'll see us returning to a very robust growth. But obviously, Jami, one of the reasons for doing the Allergan deal was in fact to ensure that we had robust growth in our innovative business. So we're aware of that issue. Now this is the breakup timing. Number one, I point out that while the stock is down, I don't think it's specifically down more than a DRG. In fact I think it's roughly the same as a DRG, and in fact, given the our pressure that one would expect in a stock, I'm actually -- well, never like to see the stock go down. It certainly was expected to come under pressure from the odd community. Now the breakup timing is an issue of -- we are focused on integrating this company and the two companies together, and we have laid out the full questions that we need to answer. And I think shareholder would want those questions answered. So, can we run the businesses successfully insider Pfizer? And we bought Hospira. You are seeing the sterile injectables. You have got the Biosimilars. You're beginning to see if you strip out the LOEs and stabilization of the core business, which we expect to return to growth, but that being said, we can run it well inside Pfizer. Can it be run better outside Pfizer? Is there trade value and can we unlock trade value in tax efficient manner? And these are the very serious questions. These are very large companies. And I think that by innovating we will be well positioned to make that decision in the best interest of our shareholders. And frankly, don't particularly see a way of short-circuiting that just because of the amount of work that has to be done and integration and getting the transaction of Allergan right. I do understand your wish for more speedy decision, but I think we are taking the right approach for shareholder value here. Ian Read : Venezuela? Frank D'Amelio: Yes. Ian Read : So, Jami, the Venezuela revenues for -- I'll call it initially projected for 2016 were about $800 million, roughly the same size as 2015. If you look at the adjustments, we took -- we changed the exchange rate from 6.3 Bolivar to a dollar to 200 Bolivar to dollar. We went to the SIMADI rate for Venezuela. That change in the translation is what causes the adjustment that we made for 2016, and we thought that the timing of that adjustment was appropriate, given oil prices, given what's going on in Venezuela economically, given the dollars that are coming out of Venezuela, we thought the timing for this was appropriate. But it's really the 6.3 to 200 to the dollar conversion that's really causing the adjustment to 2016. Frank D'Amelio: Now, Jami, ongoing, when Venezuela passes through this crisis and they re-establish a normal economy, we would expect Venezuela to grow back to be in the -- between 200 and 400 million a year. So the actual delta medium-term is for the 400 million between what was an overvalued currency. Jami Rubin : Thank you. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Ian and Frank. Can we move to the next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi. Andrew Baum : Hi. Three questions please, two of them of very short. Firstly, perhaps you could just outline sequential growth for China, say, [technical difficulty] last quarter? Second, do you anticipate extra notice from Treasury on conversion, and obviously [technical difficulty] how restricted do you see any measures to impact the Allergan transaction? And then finally, just returning to [indiscernible], the patients in the ongoing Phase 2 trial, which accelerates approval that have not seen Palbociclib in early line of therapy, is that an approval possessing given the design of that trial, given the fact you are approved for indication or does that include any regulatory approval for the drug? Thank you. Ian Read : Okay. I am going to do the notice first. We at the moment understand that the Treasury are working on formalizing and regulating the first two notices they issued, which are not in many ways applicable to our transaction as we're at the below 50% ownership. I really can't speculate if there is going to be a third notice or not. We feel confident the transaction is fully within the U.S. law and fully within accepted interpretation of that law and expect the transaction to close in the second half of next year. With that, I'll go to growth to Frank, and I would ask Mikael to talk about Palbociclib. Andrew Baum : And with China. Frank D'Amelio: On China, for the quarter, China grew 10%. Full year, China grew about 10%. Nice numbers. Somewhat moderated from 2014. In 2014, China grew to about 15%. So, we saw some moderation in the growth in China. That said, Andrew, we remain very bullish on China. Has an increasing population, increasing personal wealth, government is committed to healthcare. We see increased spending in the government and the GDP rate is still very healthy. Not as high as it has been the past, but still quite healthy. So, we remain very bullish on the China market on going forward basis. Ian Read : Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : Yes. Thank you, Andrew, for a good question here. Two things; first, I want to just to point out that Abemaciclib is somewhat different from Palbo and Novartis drug in that it seems to be less selective and has a different resident profile likely due to hitting multiple CDKs particularly been reported significant GI issues. So it's a different profile, and we, as Albert very well pointed out, have been extremely pleased with the favorable profile that allow patients to benefit from Ibrance with very good reliability. Now you asked about this late stage population studies Abema [ph], and how that population in the future will evolve. We anticipate as Ibrance is having a very nice uptake in the marketplace in first line metastatic and some also more advanced lines, and hopefully with Prevnar 3 approval, Ibrance is likely to be used in multiple lines. Hence, monotherapy with another CDK will of course have the potential to face patient population that have seen CDK inhibitor, and that's why we are developing a strategy for how we can see patients benefit from drug like Ibrance at various stages with different anti-hormonals. And we are also now studying Ibrance in triple therapy. So I think you can see that multiple drugs is likely to be the preferred as patients become more advanced. Andrew Baum : Thank you, Mikael. Chuck Triano : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Vamil Divan : Great. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. So\u2026 Ian Read : Good morning. Vamil Divan : Hi, good morning. Just again on Biosimilars front, I know there has been a couple of questions, but just a couple of more if I could. One is specifically on Enbrel, and if you can discuss in terms of 2016 how you are viewing the impact of Biosimiliars to your performance for that product? And then second, now that Hospira has closed, I am just wondering, I guess this is a question for John or whoever wants to jump in, in terms of the value having a Biosimilar business under the same broad umbrella as your innovative business so you can leverage that commercial infrastructure areas like oncology and autoimmune disorders. Is there any way sort of maybe make more sense than to keep Pfizer as a single entity as opposed to splitting up and then needing to rebuild the commercial infrastructure for your Biosimilars in those similar areas where you do have innovative products? Thanks. Ian Read : Vamil, I'll ask Geno to talk about Enbrel and the impact of Biosimilars in Europe. Geno Germano : Sure. So, the first Biosimilar for Etanercept has been approved in Europe. And we've watching the situation very closely and evaluating adoption of Biosimilars across each of the countries throughout Europe for awhile now. Our overall expectation is that there will be somewhat modest impact in 2016. The Biosimilar landscape is clearly still developing. There are different approaches taken by different countries. And we have a very clear detailed roadmap for how to address each of the dynamics that exist in these different countries. So we are fairly confident that we are going to continue to have a strong Enbrel business throughout Europe. We think that the new patients would be probably most at risk of being exposed to the Biosimilars and hope that the availability of lower cost biologics will expand the market. So overall, we see this as again a modest impact to our business in the initial period of time. Ian Read : And Vamil, maybe a very interesting question on the connectivity between the Biosimilars and the other space. I would say that that would be taken into account if there was any such linkage that was positive in our TSAs, the setup the separate companies to ensure that that as overall we maximize value of that between both companies in the contracts we would sign if we decided to split. Thank you. Vamil Divan : Thanks, Ian. Chuck Triano : Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen. Steve Scala : Couple of questions. First, apologizes if I missed the explanation, but the 2016 guidance includes roughly an incremental 4 billion in revenue and $0.08 in earnings from Hospira implying down to significantly down underlying sales for the legacy Pfizer and flattish to down EPS, and it seems that generic exposure in currency cannot be the explanation because the predicted 4.6 billion hurdle in 2016 from these factors is well less than the 6 billion plus predicted in 2015 at this time last year. So actually the comparison on generic exposure in currency is improving and more than offsets the year-over-year increase in Prevnar. So, any thoughts on that would be appreciated. And one more, how should we think about the long-term outlook for Sutent particularly given the competition from immuno-oncology agent. You think Sutent will soon become a defining asset or do you see growth in the future? Thanks. Ian Read : I'll ask Albert to talk about Sutent and its possible combinations and the other studies we have already had on Sutent. And then, I'll ask Frank to come back on your questions about growth rates. Albert Bourla : We remain very confident in our position in the RCC space and that includes both, Sutent and Inlyta, because they are very well known by physicians and other stakeholders. The recent approval in RCC for immunotherapy but this does not affect Sutent. It is in the second line. Sutent is used primarily in first line. And s we have previously disclosed we are studying Inlyta, and Inlyta plus other PD-1 inhibitors pretty aggressively so that we can achieve better result in monotherapy in RCC second line. Ian Read : Frank? Frank D'Amelio: Yes. Let's see if I can answer the question. Just first, we don't give a specific number for Hospira revenues for 2016. But that said, I believe I could still answer the question. So, the way I think about this is if you enter the midpoint of the guidance prior to foreign exchange in Venezuela, which is part of the basis of your question, the midpoint for guidance would be 52.3 just to use midpoint. We take 50.3 compare that to the 48.9 that we printed in 2015 are all now at the same foreign exchange, so, clearly operational. That's an increase of about $3.5 billion. We said -- Ian said when he answered Jami's question that revenue excluding Hospira on a year-over-year basis was essentially flat operationally while absorbing 2.3 billion in LOEs for 2016. The other data point I think to help you answer the question is, remember, we did 1.5 billion in Hospira sales this year. So, when we say that the bulk of the growth is from Hospira, you understand it's incremental growth on top of the 1.5 billion that we printed in 2015. So that's how I think -- that's how you get to numbers we said and why we said operationally the numbers were essentially flat if you left Hospira out of the equation. Steve Scala : Thank you, Frank. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Frank. Next question please. Operator : Your next question is from Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI. Mark Schoenebaum : Hey, guys. How are you doing? Thanks for being so clear on the communications in the quarter. I have one question that's been danced around but maybe let me just ask you it again and hope so I won't annoy you, but I'll try again. So first is do you believe that there is anything, Ian, under the current U.S. statute that would allow treasury to block and/or materially delay the closing of the AGN deal? So I am asking you if there will be third proposed notice. I am asking you under the current law, are you very -- do you remain I guess very comfortable there is nothing that treasury legally could do to block the deal or to materially delay it like in the 2017 when there will be a new a congress and a new president. And then I would also just for Frank perhaps just like you talked a little about your leverage ratio, if my math is right, the leverage ratio of the combined company the NewCo should closer to be around 1? By my math, you could take that to maybe 3 without affecting credit ratings in a big way, I would like to hear -- that's my math and I am not very good at math, so I would love to hear your general thoughts around leverage ratio of the NewCo where you might be willing to take that should the deal close. Thank you. Ian Read : Thank you, Mark. And thank you for the compliment on the clarity to communications. We strive to make them clear. So on your question which I don't think on the current law, I do not believe there is any reason why this deal will not close; full stop. Frank D'Amelio: Mark, let me run some numbers. So on leverage let me run the Pfizer numbers based on third quarter. We haven't issued a balance sheet yet for the fourth quarter. We will do that when we file the K. We had about 37 billion of cash in investments. We had about 39 billion of debt, short and long term debt. So to your point call that one to one essentially, and what we said when we announced the Allergan deal, what I said was we could take the leverage ratio at yield point up to about 2.5 to 3. And then, obviously, once took it there, we would want to see what kind of rhythm that created relative to the company, the operation supporting the company in that we take it there, but that we still want access to commercial paper. We would be willing take a one notch downgrade but we would still want to have access to commercial paper. But in terms of your math and your calculation 2.5 to 3, that's right. That's basically what I talked about when we announced the Allergan deal. So, your math was good. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Frank. Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS. Marc Goodman : Yes, few things. One is can you tell us what the key products are in Venezuela, if there are any massive ones that we need to be hitting the model on? Second, Frank, maybe you can go through some of the push-pulls on SG&A and how you are thinking about the spending this year? And then, third, can you just give us an update on the IL-6? Thanks. Ian Read : So key products, I don't think there's any outstanding product, but the Enbrel is the biggest product that contributes. John, would you want to add anything to that? John Young : Yes, I think the Enbrel is the biggest product. I think in addition to that we have a portfolio of matured established product, Lipitor and Norvasc would be other key products for us in Venezuela. So really just think about the basket of established products and the fit in that marketplace. Ian Read : Okay. The SG&A? Yes. Frank D'Amelio: So, Marc, on SG&A, let me just talk to the quarter and then I'll talk to the rhythm of the numbers. So if you look at the quarter, we had a big spend in SG&A. It's 4.6 billion all in. Three major factors there, right, one, obviously the inclusion of Hospira, which added a couple of hundred million. Two, sequentially, if you think about the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, we had a lot more selling days in the quarter. So, internationally, we had six more selling days. Domestically, we had two more selling days. So, sequentially, Q3 of '15 to Q4 of '15, we had more selling days. So obviously it helps revenue, but also increases the spend on our line items. And then, we had obviously I alluded to in my comments increased promotional spend in many areas of the business. Now, if you take that 4.6 and you annualize it, times 2 is what? 9.2 times 2 is 18.4. If you look at the guidance we gave for next year on SI&A, it's 13.2 to 14.2 billion. So you can't take that Q4 number and annualize it. You get to a number that's nothing close to what our guidance is for 2016, which is a combination of Hospira numbers, the selling days, and then the increased spend in the quarter. But we look at it for next year, we get a number that our annual basis is significantly lower than what that annualized number would be. Ian Read : And, Mikael, do you want to discuss IL-6? Mikael Dolsten : Yes. Thank you for your question. So we tested IL-6 antibody in Lupus and [indiscernible], and while antibody did show some activity, we found that overall profile did not compete as well as many other real interesting immunology agents and other opportunities we have in our very rich pipeline of 90 clinical programs. So this is part of prudent portfolio prioritization within Pfizer. Marc Goodman : Thank you, Mikael. Chuck Triano : Can we move to the next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from John Boris from SunTrust. John Boris : Thanks for taking the questions and for all the clarity that you've given on the '16 guidance. Ian, first question on the timing around the breakup, I think you've indicated that integration of Allergan is very important. You've also indicated that you had time to look even deeper into the Allergan portfolio. As you think about integration, can you give us some more commentary around how you are thinking about mapping out integration? Some look at Wyeth and look at the massive amount of synergies that you are able to extract out of Wyeth transaction and are somewhat puzzled as to why you can't do that here. So, any commentary around that? Two additional questions; one on CDK 4/6, this one is for Mikael. Mikael, when you look at preclinical models, is there any argument or hypothesis around a drug that has to be given intermittently that it might have less efficacy than one that's given on a continuous dosing? And is that supported by any preclinical models? And then, the last question just has to do with Xeljanz. Obviously, a very important asset for you not only in the U.S. but on the EU timing for filing, I think you indicated you wanted to have that filed before the end of the year. Just any update on what Europe is looking for within that filing to secure approval in Europe? And then, on psoriasis in the U.S., any developments there on the modified release from a regulatory standpoint and then obviously with Enbrel seeing generic competition what have you done with your infrastructure in Europe to still keep some infrastructure in place to support Xeljanz if and when it gets approved? Ian Read : Okay. So let me just -- quickly the last one first, we still have very strong expectations from Enbrel in Europe as Geno was discussing. We are not removing our support from Enbrel. So we expect to have full support for Xeljanz when it launches in Europe. There was a somewhat of a slippage from -- as you say, the end of the year to the beginning of this year on the Xeljanz application in Europe. We wanted to get it right and make sure that it was in the best shape we could, and these things happened. So there was a slight slippage on time on that. Mikael, do you want to deal with this hypothetical on CDK 4/6? Mikael Dolsten : Yes, thank you for the questions. Of course, always we would caution you can speculate on things that haven't been studied in humans in comparative aspects, but you know, we think it's important to hit CDK 4/6 hard for breast cancer, and when you do that with high doses you will get efficacy on the tumor, but also see some neutropenia and that's we why chose the intermittent schedules. Particularly it seems very effective for combination therapy with multiple agents such as [indiscernible] in breast cancer. For other tumor types, we may explore various schedules for various combination of drugs, but for breast cancer we think to show some schedule with the combinations we have studied is very effective and works well. Ian Read : Thank you. Geno, you want to deal with the other questions that John asked on Xeljanz? Geno Germano : Yes. John, I think the question -- as Ian had already alluded to, we are now expecting our filing to be in the first quarter of this year. We're actually meeting with [indiscernible] at this point. We did generate additional data on immune function as a result of the discussions that we had with the regulators in the first submission. So we feel that we have a strong package that we have responded to the information requests that they had, and we're just tidying up the kind of last few details and expect to put that filing in imminently. Ian Read : And psoriasis and -- so, question on psoriasis? In the U.S\u2026 Geno Germano : So psoriasis -- well, as you probably know we have a -- we received a complete response letter from the FDA on psoriasis. We have provided a backgrounder to the FDA, and we expect to meet with them also this quarter to follow-up on the components of the complete response letter, and once we know in more detail what their issues and concerns are, then we'll determine best way forward from there. Ian Read : Thank you. Frank, do you want to deal with the\u2026 Frank D'Amelio: Synergy number? Ian Read : Yes. Frank D'Amelio: Yes. So we have certainly announced the deal more than $2 billion. We gave you the timing in terms of when we would get that. A couple of comments, John, to your question, I think first why more than $2 billion, why not a higher number? I think these are two companies that have done a lot on the cost reduction front; significant reductions at both companies, I think efficiently run companies. Two, not a lot of therapeutic area overlap, which is always seeing a kind of a trigger for synergy opportunities. Third, if you look at the Allergan cost of goods sold, two-thirds of that from my perspective, from a synergy perspective was unaddressable. It's their end of business and then royalties. So really not a lot we could do there, but all that said and done, we're working now with the Allergan teams with Brent, with Bob Steward, with Tessa. Ian and myself, our leadership team here at Pfizer, we've already launched a couple of operational teams, and we're starting to dig into this in much more detail. If there is more there, please know we're going to get it, and we'll tell you about it. So I think on a synergy front just more to come. Ian Read : Yes. And you know, John, the process from this deal was not huge cost synergies, it was about driving revenue growth in the innovative business, driving reasonably young portfolios, taking the products internationally, and then getting excellent capital allocation over the world. So we will get the synergies we can get, but our focus is on growth, and a lot of the questions on the call have been about growth. So this is part of the solution to that, and also really a good capital allocation. Frank D'Amelio: Thank you for the questions. John Boris : Thanks, Ian. Chuck Triano : Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Bernstein. Tim Anderson : Thank you. If I could go back to the revenue guidance, the midpoint is about $2.5 billion below consensus, you flagged FX was a major headwind. I know that we spend a lot of time trying to incorporate FX, and I imagine consensus does too, yet that's still a very big delta. So my question on this is when you look at analyst models, are there particular revenue line items for products or divisions where you think consensus is too high unrelated to foreign exchange? Second question, you mentioned the 4-1BB with Merck, and I'm showing foundation data with Keytruda. That's Phase I data, so as such I'm blinded -- I'm wondering if you can give us a preview of the tumor types here you think are most promising and also any preliminary safety findings? And then last pipeline question, last year you mentioned having an oral PCSK9 approaching human development, and I'm wondering if that is now in the clinic when I look at your pipeline chart I see a new compound has been advanced on the Phase I? Ian Read : Okay. Frank, if you could deal with the first question, and Mikael will have remaining two. Frank D'Amelio: Sure. So Tim, let me run the numbers in, then I'll answer the questions. So your numbers are right. So consensus numbers give or take on revenue for 2016 about 52.4 billion the midpoint of all guidance $50 billion, the net there is roughly 2.5 billion that you alluded to, just to kind of nail the numbers. I think two major pieces in terms of the GAAP; one is, clearly the Venezuela adjustment we made in 2016 wouldn't have been at the 52.4. So that's an $800 million adjustment. That would take a 52.4 to 51.6, and then I think when you look at the line items, I think the big difference [technical difficulty] if you ask me to point out one single place, it's Prevnar 13. Significant results, and the growth expectations in Prevnar 13 -- '16 versus our modeling for '16 where I said in my comments, and Albert punctuated in some of his detailed remarks about we're expecting that to be essentially comparable to 2015 levels. Those are the two things that I would point out that will make up the majority big piece of the difference in terms of your 2.5 billion. Ian Read : Thank you. Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : So thank you for asking about 4-1BB, and as you know, we believe that the combination therapy moved immuno-oncology feel to the next level. We are very pleased with the 4-1BB, one of tumor antibody that we have. We have started eating combination with Rituximab in lymphoma and with PD-1 Keytruda in a small study across various tumor types, and have also initiated combination study with Avelumab. The 4-1BB antibody, the Pfizer antibody shows very good tolerability when combined with other biological agents, and it's clinical performance suggest also very interesting favorable clinical activity on top of other biologicals, such as Rituximab and PD-1 Keytruda. We will share the date from this first cohort this year likely at ASCO. We are quite excited about 4-1BB and also OX40 that's in our pipeline, and you will see 4-1BB Avelumab data likely late this year as well OX40 monodata, and early next year several doublets and triplets, which makes me very enthusiastic as I look forward how we advanced the strategy of combinations therapy. We have an oral PCSK9 in Phase I. It's too early to have any definitive interpretation of that data, and we also have a PCSK9 vaccine in late preclinical development. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Mikael. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Richard Purkiss from Piper Jaffray. Richard Purkiss : Oh, thanks. I have a couple of questions for Mikael, just on Ibrance, can you flag any upcoming data for tumor types outside of breast cancer that we should look out for? Also, can you update on how well the Adjuvant breast cancer studies are enrolling? Thanks. Ian Read : Mikae, would you like to\u2026 Mikeal Dolsten : Yes. I could say a few words, so as Albert alluded to, there is a large number of Ibrance study, the great majority by investing in initiative research. So we will have to see as these studies result report emerging. I can say that we also have sponsor-led studies outside breasts, that includes pancreatic cancer, and head and neck, and we're also looking at triple therapy in breast cancer. I remain optimistic and excited about Ibrance performance, and think we will see interesting datasets coming from several of these new tumor types. Ian Read : Enrollment? It's going well? Albert Bourla : Yes, actually I can only add here. But likely the Mantel cell lymphoma, and the neck we may see data even this year. And then many of the areas that Mikael discussed, including small-cell-lung, we may see next year. Chuck Triano : Okay, thanks Albert and Mikael. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Geoff Meacham : Good morning guys. And thanks for taking my question, just a couple of quick ones. On Bevacizumab, given Pfizer's experience in cardiovascular I was just curious what your thoughts on the demand trends were, looking peripherally at the PCSK9 class today. I know a lot looking forward depends on outcomes data, but just curious about whether there's a tipping point, and the position adoption. And then just on Biosimilars in the U.S., just wanted to get you guys to view on where you think the FDA is with respect to extrapolation when we're looking at the upcoming senior panel next week. Thanks. Ian Read : Geno, any comments on that? Geno Germano : Yes, I mean I think I would just reinforce the comment that you made. I mean, it's been our contention all along that this class becomes a real class in managing these patients with the cardiovascular outcome data, that we'll be seeing either late this year or starting next year. Our program is advancing nicely. We have, as you know, two cardiovascular trials. And the SPIRE-2 trial, which is in the high-risk patient population, we've now reached the point where we've discontinued screening. We're almost completely enrolled. And that trial is moving along very rapidly. And the SPIRE-1 trial will be completely enrolled by the end of this year or early next year. So we're looking forward to these data, and the impact that we think they're going to have on the marketplace. John Young : So, on the Inflectra AdCom, as you know it's scheduled for February 9, next week. I think it would probably be premature to speculate on the view that the FDA will take. We certainly think that this will be extremely informative as to the FDA's views and perspectives on extrapolation. I think obviously their product is being filed by Xeljanz. So specific questions about the AdCom really should be directed to Xeljanz, but I would say is that while we obviously await the resolution of the advisory committee and certain other factors. We're certainly moving ahead with the preparation for launch plans in 2016. Chuck Triano : Thanks Geno, and John. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. David Risinger : Yes, thanks very much. I have three questions. First, Ian, besides the likelihood of closing, what do think investors most under-appreciate about the Allergan merger? Second, I guess these are two financial questions. One is with respect to Enbrel ex-U.S. Could you just give us a sense for the percentage of revenue that is in countries where Biosimilars are launching in 2016, so that we have a sense for the percentage of Enbrel revenue that's exposed to Biosimilar threat? And then finally, Frank, if you could just run through the cash flow outlook for 2016, the operating cash flow, and then the planned use of funds. Thank you. Ian Read : David, again on your question on Allergan, our interactions with the shareholders, both sell side and buy side have been very positive. I don't think in reality there's anything underappreciated, other than the Street's perception of risk around the close. I would direct you back of course to the excitement I have about the products that Allergan have that they just launched, about their phase III products, both in depression, and in diabetic gastroparesis. And they just got breakthrough status, so -- and the combination of our information knowledge and RTAs with Xeljanz around their area. Our jacks around their expertise net area. I think perhaps the Street is just -- is right now hung up on this close issue. So bio, John? John Young : Yes, David on the question regarding percentage of Enbrel business potentially exposed to Biosimilar competition, I don't have a figure on the top of my head. I would say more than 50% of the ex-U.S. business would be in the European Union, where we expect to see biosimilars. We won't -- we're not expecting to see it in Japan, Australia, and several of the Latin American countries. But I would say it's more than 50% of the business. Frank D'Amelio: And then the last question was on '16 operating cash flow. The way I'll answer this David, is if you look at our operating cash flow through three quarters, it was about $10 billion. We expect the fourth quarter to be healthy in terms of the operating cash flow for the year. And then obviously 2016, we expect -- we want to obviously continue to grow that operating cash flow number. And then in terms of the uses, from my perspective, the uses of how we deploy our capital haven't changed, obviously investing in our business, returning capital to shareholders. I mentioned in my remarks we returned 13.1 billion to our shareholders in 2015 through a combination of dividends and share buybacks, and obviously looking at some bolt-on acquisitions if those make sense. So -- but no change. It would be how I'd answer the question on capital allocation. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Frank. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank. Gregg Gilbert : Thanks, also a three-parter. First Frank, what level of detail should we expect in the proxy in terms of your long-term projections, similar to the Pfizer Wyeth documents or any difference and any caveats you'd like to order to let us know about before folks start slapping accretion percentages on those numbers? Secondly, going back to something you said earlier. Taking your leverage to two-and-a-half to three times for Newco, and if you were to apply that capital to buybacks that would create EPS accretion that's far beyond what you've suggested. So just would like your thoughts on what you'd be doing with that leverage or is that just kind of a hypothetical. And third, for John, do you still see the benefit of the Hospira device business alongside the drug business as you originally thought? Thank you. Ian Read : Okay, John, could you deal with Hospira first please? John Young : Yes, sure. I think we would say that in the Hospira infusion systems business, which comprises pumps, consumables, large volume solutions. We believe we acquired a very valuable asset. It provides novel capabilities in an adjacent area. And that adds significant value to customers, and their patients. And we are committed to ensuring its success in the short, medium, and longer term. Ian Read : Okay, Frank, on the leverage and then the loan level of detail. Frank D'Amelio: Level of detail, and the proxy. Ian Read : Yes. Frank D'Amelio: So I think on level of detail, we'll be providing revenue details, EPS details. It would be directed out, I believe, it's several years, five years. So there'll be information out there relative to projections on the company; on the leverage number, the 2.5 to 3, in my mind that's what's possible. In terms of what we did on buybacks, we tried to provide information when we announced the deal to give you all the data you needed. So that when you connected the dots you could model what at buyback numbers would be, right. So we started out with the accretion dilution. We said neutral in year one, modestly accretive in year one, more than 10% in year three, and then high teens in year four. We gave what the beginning share count number of the combined company would be. It was 10.6 billion shares. We said we'd have 5.5 billion, and Allergan would have 4.7 billion. And then we gave the tax rate, which was 17% to 18%. So with those data points, we felt we provided the information that you needed in order to model what the buybacks would be. And then just to the two-and-a-half to three, now clearly there could be some extra juice if we took the leverage ratio up to that level. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Frank. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Chris Schott : Great, thanks, just two quick ones here. First, just more broadly on emerging markets, can you talk about the growth outlook here maybe beyond China, just given the current economic environment we're seeing? Has there been any change in your growth expectations there? And then the second question for Ian. I know you've obviously had a very large deal pending right now. But how are you thinking of business development given the recent volatility and kind of valuation reset we see in the market. I guess what's the size and scope of assets that you could be interested at this point, given the upcoming Allergan transaction. And maybe how quickly post the Allergan transaction could this company start considering larger deals if there was an attractive opportunity in the market. Ian Read : Thank you. John, you want to talk about China? John Young : Yes, sure. So I mean, I think as we always say, Chris, on the emerging markets. We're always going to see courses and course of volatility. But at the same time we continue to expect to see growth numbers in the mid-single digit mid to high single-digit range. Frank's already talked about China. We continue to be very positive about the prospects in the short, medium, and longer term in China. It's obviously not just the world's largest country, with 1.3, 1.4 billion population, but we continue to see a strong government commitment to expanding access to to quality healthcare. We are very encouraged by steps that we see the government taking in the regulatory environment to really enhance quality standards in the marketplace. And whilst there are few headwinds, GDP growth is slowly but still positive, still mid single-digit percentage. We are seeing some pressure on pricing. But overall when you put all of those factors together, we can continue to see China being a very positive growth driver. Ian Read : Thank you, John. On BD, Chris, we see we would be more focused to smaller deals than larger deals right now. But once we close, we'll look at the opportunities. And we know we still have substantial flexibility and of course it will be measured against the alternative usage of that cash which right now are scheduled for buybacks and the accretion equation. So we'll make the decisions that we believe are best for shareholders and we will take it into account the -- what the asset priced at the time when we close. Frank D'Amelio: And Chris, the only thing I would add is we, Pfizer-standalone today generate a lot of operating cash flow. The combine new company we said by 2018 would be generating in excess of $25 billion a year in operating cash flow. So, new company will generate significant amounts of operating cash flow. Thank you. Chris Schott : All right. Chuck Triano : And can we take our last question please, operator? Operator : Your final question comes from Manoj Garg from HealthCo. Manoj Garg : Hi, it's Manoj. Thanks for taking the question. A couple on the pending Allergan transaction and one on next Tuesday, on Allergan, one, I guess if maybe just if you can highlight, what are some of the levers that would dictate whether the deal would close in early second half of '16 versus later in the second half? Two is, for Frank, on the $2 billion synergy number if you can just quantify as we fine-tune our pro forma model, if that's a gross number or an net number? Ian Read : Okay. On the lever, Doug Lankler, would you indicate what you see the levers are for the close? Doug Lankler : Sure. So, Manoj, we're working closely with regulators. We are pleased with the profits that we are making. We like the standpoint from the complementary nature of the businesses. And as a result, we continue to expect to close the transaction during the second half. Manoj Garg : Thank you. Doug Lankler : It's a net number. Manoj Garg : Synergy number is a net number? Doug Lankler : Right. Yes, you asked whether it was gross or net. And the answer is it's a net number. Manoj Garg : Okay. Ian Read : That should do it. Chuck Triano : That should do it. Thank you very much for your questions. Ian Read : Thanks for your time everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to Pfizer's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Charles E. Triano: Thank you. Good morning and thanks for joining us today to review Pfizer's first quarter 2016 performance and 2016 financial guidance. I'm joined today by : our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide R&D Albert Bourla, President of Pfizer Innovative Pharma [GIP]; John Young, President of Established Pharma [GEP]; and Doug Lankler, General Counsel. The slides that will be presented on the call can be viewed at our home page, Pfizer.com, by clicking on the link for Pfizer Quarterly Corporate Performance \u2013 First Quarter 2016, which is located in the For Investors section in the lower right-hand corner of this page. Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussion during the call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information regarding these factors is discussed under the Disclosure Notice section in the earnings release we issued this morning as well as in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, including in Part 1, Item 1A, Risk Factors, that is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available at their website, SEC.gov, and our website, Pfizer.com. The forward-looking statements during this conference call speak only as of the original date of this call, and we undertake to obligation to update or revise any of the statements. Discussions during the call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's Current Report on Form 8-K dated today, May 3, 2016. You may obtain a copy of the Form 8-K on our website, Pfizer.com/investors. Also, any non-GAAP measures presented are not and should not be viewed as substitutes for financial measures required by U.S. GAAP, have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP, and may not be comparable to the calculations of similar measures at other companies. We will now make prepared remarks, and then we'll move to a Q&A session. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian? Ian C. Read: Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. During my remarks this morning, I will briefly recap the highlights from the quarter and comment on our strategies, including: the expected pipeline development this year; our approach to business development in light of our decision not to move forward with Allergan; and the steps we expect to take to effect a potential split of the company. 2016 is off to a good start, with solid performance across both the Innovative and Established businesses. Notably, Prevnar 13, Ibrance, Eliquis, and Chantix are performing better than we initially projected. As we referenced in our earnings release, a portion of the growth in the quarter was attributable to additional selling days compared to the year-ago quarter, which will be offset in the fourth quarter from a growth perspective. We nonetheless had a strong quarter financially even without that impact, exceeding our internal projections, and incorporated the strong operational performance as well as the recent weakening of the dollar into our updated financial guidance for the year. And compared to the first quarter, we expect that our LOE [Loss of Exclusivity] impact from Lyrica, Rebif, and Enbrel will be more pronounced in the remaining quarters of the year. Additionally, new product launch expenses and R&D investments are also phased higher for the remainder of the year. Frank will provide more details in a few minutes. Overall, looking at the quarter on a revenue basis, Pfizer's standalone business excluding Hospira grew 15% operationally and 26% operationally with the inclusion of Hospira. Our Innovative business generated impressive operational revenue growth of 28%, driven by the performance of Eliquis globally and Ibrance, Prevnar 13, Lyrica, Xeljanz, Chantix, and Nexium 24-Hour, principally in the U.S. Of particular note, Ibrance has already earned broad patient and physician acceptance. Since launching in the U.S. last year, about 6,800 prescribers have treated approximately 28,000 women with HR-positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. And the feedback continues to be very encouraging, particularly around the efficacy and tolerability profile and impact on the overall quality of life. Recently we announced that the confirmatory Phase 3 PALOMA-2 trial for Ibrance in first-line metastatic breast cancer met its primary endpoints of improving progression-free survival. Detailed results will be presented at ASCO [American Society of Clinical Oncology] in early June. We're also seeing continued strong operational growth from Eliquis, which is yielding increased market penetration and market share gains in the U.S. and Japan. The contribution of Eliquis to our alliance revenue line more than doubled year over year. For the Prevnar 13 Adult indication, while there was year-over-year growth as expected, we saw a sequential quarterly decline in revenues given the rapid penetration we achieved in the U.S. market during 2015. The pediatric indication remained strong, and we anticipate that global revenues for the Prevnar 13 franchise in full-year 2016 will be comparable to 2015. And we were pleased that the results of the EAGLES study, the largest global clinical trial of smoking cessation medicines, were published in The Lancet. The study was designed to compare the neuropsychiatric safety of Chantix and bupropion with placebo and nicotine patch in adult smokers with and without a history of psychiatric disorders. The authors concluded that the study did not show a significant increase in serious neuropsychiatric events with Chantix or bupropion relative to placebo or nicotine patch. The study also found that smokers treated with Chantix had significantly higher quit rates than those treated with bupropion, nicotine patch, or placebo. Turning now to our Established business, it grew 24% operationally, primarily due to the addition of revenues from legacy Hospira products. Without Hospira and the impact of foreign exchange, the business grew 1%. In particular, we saw strong performance from the sterile injectables portfolio. The addition of the Hospira's leading generic injectables portfolio with Pfizer's legacy branded injectables establishes Pfizer as the number one sterile injectables company globally. We now have one of the broadest and most diverse offerings of difficult to manufacture sterile injectable medicines, which are critically important for patients around the world. This leading market position combined with our expanded biosimilars offering and the continued growth of Pfizer's legacy branded portfolio in emerging markets will help us to move the Established Pharmaceuticals business from a period of loss of exclusivity-driven decline to potential growth. The Hospira acquisition was a clear growth driver, and the integration continues to proceed well. We have addressed the specific issues related to legacy Hospira's manufacturing and have developed a plan to implement Pfizer quality standards at the sites. And we have dedicated resources to support the sites as they complete their transition to the Pfizer network. Based on Hospira's excellent strategic fit with our Established business and our intense focus on integration of Hospira, we expect to exceed our original synergy target of $800 million in annual cost savings by 2018 and now expect to achieve approximately $1 billion in cost savings. As you are aware, in early April we decided not to move forward with the Allergan transaction due to the actions of the U.S. Treasury Department. Given these actions and the current political climate, we do not see any potential for a transaction involving inversions in the near term. While the outcome was disappointing, we always viewed the potential Allergan transaction not as a new strategy but rather as a way to accelerate our existing strategy, which remains unchanged. Our strategy is anchored by several elements, namely, improving the company's revenue growth profile so that a greater proportion of our earnings per share growth is driven by incremental revenue opportunities. Our latest product launches, including Eliquis, Xalkori, Xeljanz, Ibrance, and Prevnar 13 Adult have now become meaningful revenue contributors. In addition, the FDA's decision to approve Celltrion's biosimilar infliximab across all eligible indications marks a critical and positive step forward in helping to create a pathway for biosimilars in the U.S. We hold the exclusive commercialization rights of this product in the U.S. While launch timing of Inflectra will ultimately depend upon a number of factors, such as marketplace dynamics and intellectual property considerations, we are continuing with the preparations of our launch plans for 2016. Our current biosimilars portfolio includes three commercialized products available in select markets outside the U.S., Inflectra, Nivestim, and Retacrit. We believe that biosimilars represent an attractive revenue growth opportunity and for expanding patient access in important treatments. We also see continued opportunities for our Established Pharma business in emerging markets, with a robust portfolio positioned to compete in these markets. GEP revenues in emerging markets increased 10% operationally this quarter, and companywide revenues in emerging markets increased 14% operationally. Emerging markets revenues represented nearly 20% of our total company's revenue base. We also continue to make significant progress in securing potential future growth drivers across the advancement of our pipeline. Specific examples include : a planned submission for ulcerative colitis for Xeljanz, which is on track to occur in the first half of 2017; the acceptance for review of the Xeljanz EU filing for rheumatoid arthritis. We have completed enrollment of the bococizumab SPIRE-2 outcomes trial. While it can be hard to predict duration of a time-to-events trial, we currently anticipate a potential completion of this outcomes study in the second half of 2017. Presentation of the ertugliflozin Phase 3 data at the American Diabetes Association meeting in June and a potential registry filing in the U.S. The tanezumab Phase 3 program, where we are now conducting trials for osteoarthritis, chronic lower back pain, and cancer pain indications. A potential regulatory decision in the EU for Ibrance in combination with endocrine therapy for the treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced metastatic breast cancer; and for inotuzumab for adult patients with relapsed or refractory CD22-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We are in discussions with the FDA on next steps to bring this important medicine to patients. Behind these assets is a strong and early mid-stage pipeline, most notably a broad portfolio of I-O compounds which continue to advance. Our avelumab PD-L1 program with Merck KGaA has ramped up rapidly and now has 30 programs ongoing, both as monotherapy and in combination with other portfolio assets, eight of which are potentially registration-enabling. We continue to expect that the key advances in I-O will come from novel combinations, both double and triple combination regimes, and technologies that may have the potential to treat more patients with immunotherapy and ultimately transform the cancer treatment paradigm. We have several combination studies that are already in the clinic, with our key combination assets being 4-1BB and OX-40. We also have a range of immuno-oncology assets moving into the clinic, including our allogeneic CAR-T program in collaboration with Cellectis and Servier and a small molecule immunotherapy asset, IDO-1, in collaboration with iTeos, and our bispecific antibody, P-cadherin. Recently, we presented Phase 2 data at the AACR [American Association for Cancer Research] annual meeting showing that Ibrance was effective in slowing the multiplication of cancer cells in patients diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer who received no prior therapy. And we also expect our proof-of-concept readout with our next-generation ALK inhibitor, lorlatinib, in ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer patients towards the end of the year. Lorlatinib is our investigational follow-on drug to Xalkori. In neuroscience, we began a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study this quarter for our novel dopamine modulation asset for Parkinson's disease. If successful, this may have the potential to replace the standard of care in Parkinson's. In addition, through a collaboration with MedGenesis Therapeutix, we have a second compound being investigated in Parkinson's, and expect to have a proof-of-concept study readout in the second half of the year. The compound is a GDNF [Glial cell Derived Neurotrophic Factor] protein and may have the potential to provide the first disease-modifying treatment that slows the progressive decline in Parkinson's patients. In vaccines, we expect to have a C. difficile proof-of-concept readout towards the end of the year. C. difficile is a growing hard to treat infection in the hospital and long-term care setting. Currently, there are no vaccines available to prevent the disease, and the infection control practices are challenging to implement. Overall, we are anticipating a steady stream of pipeline updates throughout 2016. Our strategy will also capitalize on the opportunities and specific expertise resulting from our distinct competitive and growing businesses, namely our Innovative and Established business. Each is led by strong leaders with the experience and knowhow to effectively direct and grow these organizations. In addition to capitalizing on the strength of our pipeline, our strategy includes allocating our capital to shareholder-friendly initiatives, with an eye towards sustainable value creation. This includes continuing to look for ways other than inversions to improve our tax rate. It also includes pursuing business development opportunities that use our capital efficiently in ways that create meaningful shareholder value; that have the potential for near-term solid value creation; that strengthen our individual businesses with capabilities in key assets; and enhance our leadership position in the most attractive core areas. As you know, we're also considering a potential separation. Our decision framework has not changed. It continues to be based on these four questions. Are the businesses performing well within Pfizer? Could the businesses perform well as standalone entities? Is there trapped value in the combined entity, and can the trapped value be unlocked efficiently? Throughout the year, we will be assessing our performance against each of these factors. In summary, the business is performing well, driven by FAN (16:43) strategy. The outlook for the year is strong based on our demonstrated ability to be innovative in the Established businesses to execute against this goal. We have a healthy pipeline with strong candidates at every stage of the pipeline. And we have the financial flexibility and several options for creating short-term and long-term value for shareholders. I will now turn it over to Frank, and thank you. Frank A. D'Amelio: Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast. As a reminder, because we completed the acquisition of Hospira on September 3, 2015, Pfizer's first quarter 2016 financial results include three months of legacy Hospira global operations compared with first quarter 2015 results, which do not include any legacy Hospira operations. Now moving on to the financials, we had a good quarter. First quarter 2016 reported revenues were approximately $13 billion and reflect year-over-year operational growth of $2.9 billion or 26%, of which $1.2 billion or 11% is attributable to the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations, and approximately $900 million or 8% is attributable to five additional selling days in the U.S. and four additional selling days in international markets in the first quarter of 2016 versus the year-ago quarter. Excluding legacy Hospira operations and these additional selling days, reported revenues grew $800 million or 7% operationally, which reflects continued strong performance of Ibrance, Prevnar 13, Eliquis, Xeljanz, Lyrica, and Chantix, and the 14% operational growth in emerging markets, which were partially offset by the absorption of an approximately $300 million negative operational impact due to product losses of exclusivity. With respect to selling days, I want to point out that because of our accounting calendar, there was a greater variability of selling days during the quarters in 2015 than there will be in 2016, but this will not impact total number of selling days or our revenue for 2016. To illustrate, there were five more U.S. and four more international selling days in the first quarter of 2016 compared with the year-ago quarter, and there are four fewer U.S. and three fewer international selling days in the fourth quarter of 2016 versus the fourth quarter of 2015. So the imbalance in selling days we saw in the first quarter will be offset in fourth quarter 2016, and there will be essentially the same number of selling days in full-year 2016 as in full-year 2015. Consequently, the only impact will be to the quarterly year-over-year comparisons, notably for the first and fourth quarters. Reported revenues continued to be unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of $729 million or 7%, including losses related to the Venezuelan bolivar. First quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $0.67 versus $0.51 in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to increased revenues, the inclusion of Hospira operations, a lower effective tax rate, and fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which declined by 78 million shares versus the year-ago quarter due to our share repurchase program, which includes the impact of our $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in February of 2015 and completed in July of 2015, and by another 136 million shares associated with a partial quarter benefit from an accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in March of 2016; which were partially offset by an aggregate operational increase in adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses, and adjusted R&D expenses of $1.1 billion, or 16%; $0.07 negative impact due to foreign exchange and continuing product losses of exclusivity. Reported diluted EPS was $0.49 compared with $0.38 in the year-ago quarter due to the previously mentioned factors and the favorable impact of lower charges for business and legal entity alignment activities incurred during the first quarter, which were partially offset by higher acquisition-related costs, legal charges, purchase accounting adjustments, and higher asset impairment charges. Foreign exchange negatively impacted first quarter reported revenues by approximately $729 million or 7%, and positively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses, and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $197 million or 3%. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted first quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.07 compared with the year-ago quarter. The results for the GIP, VOC [Vaccines, Oncology & Consumer Healthcare], and GEP businesses are available and can be found at the end of the presentation that is posted on our website. Moving on to our 2016 financial guidance, we are updating our 2016 reported revenues and adjusted diluted EPS ranges due to our strong performance to date and improved business outlook for 2016 as well as the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates since mid-January 2016. Consequently, we raised the midpoint of our 2016 revenue guidance by $2 billion and the midpoint of our 2016 diluted adjusted EPS guidance range by $0.18. We now expect 2016 reported revenues to be in the range of $51 billion to $53 billion versus our previous expectation of $49 billion to $51 billion. And we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.38 to $2.48 versus our previous expectation of $2.20 to $2.30. I want to punctuate what Ian said previously. Operational factors such as our strong performance to date in 2016 in addition to our improved business outlook for 2016 favorably impacted the midpoint of the reported revenue guidance range by approximately $1 billion and the adjusted diluted EPS guidance range by $0.12. Favorable changes in foreign exchange rates since mid-January 2016 also favorably impacted the midpoint of the reported revenue guidance range by approximately $1 billion and the adjusted diluted EPS guidance range by $0.06. Finally, given our first quarter results and the benefit of continued support of recently launched products as well as foreign exchange, we are raising the midpoint of our adjusted SI&A guidance range by $500 million. Consequently, we now expect adjusted SI&A expenses to be in the range of $13.7 billion to $14.7 billion. Moving on to key takeaways, this quarter marks our sixth consecutive quarter of Pfizer standalone operational revenue growth, which was primarily driven by new products that are early in their life cycles, such as Ibrance, Prevnar 13, Eliquis, Xeljanz, and Lyrica, and additional selling days during the first quarter. As I just mentioned, we raised the midpoint of our 2016 reported revenues and adjusted diluted EPS guidance ranges to reflect strong operational performance to date, favorable changes in foreign exchange rates, and improved business outlook for 2016. We accomplished several key R&D milestones during the first quarter. We continued to deliver significant value to shareholders in the form of $1.9 billion in first quarter 2016 dividends and a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in March 2016. And finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2016 and beyond. With that, I'll turn it back to Chuck. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Ian and Frank, for the prepared comments. Operator, can we please move to the question-and-answer session? Operator : Thank you. Your first question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank. Gregg Gilbert : Thanks. I have a clarification and a two-part question, first the clarification. Frank, I just want to confirm that the guidance increase for the full year has nothing to do with selling days. And then my two-part question, for John, when is the earliest biosimilar Remicade could be launched when you consider the legal and regulatory framework that exists today? And then for Ian, I'm curious to hear your thoughts on how the recent Treasury moves and your subsequent actions affect the decision to split or not to split. If you don't see obvious trapped value today based on your current structure and domicile, does your separation assessment consider the domicile and tax structure of other companies that could potentially maximize value for Pfizer shareholders? Thanks. Frank A. D'Amelio: So on the guidance, the guidance increase has nothing to do with the selling days. Think about it this way. Selling days in 2016 haven't changed since we issued our initial 2016 guidance on the last earnings call. So short answer is absolutely nothing to do with our improved guidance. It's really about the operational performance, the strong operational performance, and to a lesser extent foreign exchange. Ian C. Read: Please, John. John Young : Okay, thanks for the question, Gregg. So in regard to Inflectra, launch timing will ultimately depend on a number of factors, including marketplace conditions, payer dynamics, expected timing for entry of other products, and intellectual property-related considerations, among others. Pursuant to a stipulation entered in a recent court conference related to ongoing litigation between Hospira, Celltrion, and Janssen, Hospira agreed not to sell Inflectra in the U.S. prior to the June 29, 2016 expiration of the Crohn's patent. We are moving ahead with the preparation of our launch plans for 2016, as you heard in Ian's comments, and we can't comment further beyond those points. Ian C. Read: So, Gregg, the delay caused by \u2013 or the potential split caused by Allergan was just the structural work needed to be done to incorporate them in. That going away, it put us back on our original timeline, as we've continued to work on that as a standalone company. Now there are many factors we'll take into account in whether we want to split or not. And one of them is, of course, the tax structure of the two companies if they are split. And I think the Treasury action and the government's willingness to act in this area will make us think deeply about what are the alternatives to let part of this company, if possible, have a different tax jurisdiction. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, all. Can we move to the next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS. Marc Goodman : Good morning. Just to continue on that process, do you feel like you need to strengthen the Innovative business before you would break this company up, or are you pretty satisfied with the way it is right now? And if you do split up, can you give us your best estimate of what the dis-synergies would be? And then just secondly, you mentioned on Prevnar there were government purchases. Can you quantify how much that helped in the quarter? Thanks. Ian C. Read: So, Marc, the dis-synergies, can we do that first? Frank A. D'Amelio: I can do dis-synergies. So, Marc, on dis-synergies, once again, assuming we were to exercise our option, and no decision has been made to date, it would be immaterial relative to overall earnings. Current estimates are a couple cents a share on an annualized basis. Obviously, we'll fine tune that as we go forward, but current estimates are a couple cents a share. Ian C. Read: Prevnar, Albert? Albert Bourla : Yes. On the Prevnar, there were some U.S. ordering partners this quarter. It's to the range of $40 million approximately. Ian C. Read: Okay. And the businesses I think are strong enough to be standalone businesses without ever any further BD. But either as separate companies or as one company, we'll always continue to look at doing BD when it's appropriate and when it can add value. And that would be an ongoing process either pre or post-split, I would imagine, from both companies' perspectives, but always with a focus of \u2013 strong focus on value on our part. Charles E. Triano: Great, thank you. Can we move to the next question, please, operator? Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen. Ian C. Read: Good morning, Steve. Steve Scala : Good morning, thank you. I have two questions. First, Ian, I have a follow-up on an earlier question. And I apologize for being picky, but the fourth criteria for a split appears to have changed a bit. So previously, it was can the split be done in a tax-efficient way. And today, I believe you said can a split be done in an efficient way. So the word tax may have been deleted. Is this an accurate observation? The interpretation of it... Ian C. Read: We're probably just simplifying the semantics. Efficient means efficient both operationally and from a tax perspective. Steve Scala : Okay. The second question for Dr. Dolsten, it would appear that Pfizer is in the first wave of I-O combos. Now considering that Pfizer once studied tremelimumab, how big a disadvantage is it to Pfizer that you don't have access to a CTLA-4? Do you view CTLA-4 as here to stay, or will Pfizer's other targets make CTLA-4 obsolete, in your opinion? Thank you. Mikael Dolsten : Thank you for the comment. I think CTLA-4 was the first of the immuno-oncology products. But as you know, its utility has been somewhat limited for both melanoma and combos because of its systemic immune activation, which can be quite demanding for oncologists to manage, although I'm sure that there will be growing knowledge of how to use the product. We are much more excited about the new checkpoint augmenting compounds like 4-1BB and OX-40 that seems to offer an ability to augment different parts of the immune system on top of likely PD-1 and PD-L1, but with retaining really promising tolerability. So we think that's the path to go, compounds that augment PD-1/PD-L1 but retain the favorable tolerability. And that's really our focus and there are really no regrets. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Mikael. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Jay Olson : Hi, it's Jay Olson on for Jami Rubin. Thanks for taking the question. Just with regard to the GEP business and the four criteria that you gave to determine whether or not to separate the GEP business in particular, can you give us an idea of what sort of metrics you plan to use to measure the performance of GEP within Pfizer and the potential performance outside of Pfizer? And then similarly, what kind of metrics will you use to determine how much trapped value there is within GEP and how efficiently that could be untrapped? Thank you. Ian C. Read: Thank you. The metrics from inside Pfizer will be of course their growth in their operations against our budgets. Outside of Pfizer, we'll try and establish similar-like companies. It would be easier for the Innovative business. It's not as easy for the Established because really the Established business is a unique business, including strong sterile injectables, strong biosimilar capabilities, and big emerging markets. And it's not really a generic business, so it's very hard to find a comparison there, but I'm sure we'll be able to find some composite. On whether we can unleash where there's trapped value, we'll obviously use outside advisors. But one of the classic methods would simply be to look at the sum of the parts as much as we can establish it by disaggregating our business the same ways we give you information to do. So we can take those businesses and compare them to standalone businesses and see what a potential valuation will be with the parts and compare it to the sum. That is one way of looking at their trapped value. Another is to look historically at what has happened to companies where they're spun or where they have been spun in an unforced manner; i.e., because of management's decision and not because of activist pressure, and see what has happened to the shares of those companies subsequently. And of course, we'll also have to look at what are the tax implications, which really circles back to standalone abilities if companies are disadvantaged in a more specific way because of their tax situation compared to their competitors. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Ian. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Bernstein. Timothy Minton Anderson : Thank you. I have a couple of questions, please. My understanding is that right before the Allergan deal was terminated, maybe a week before or something like that, Pfizer went through a round of layoffs of various folks at that mid-management level in anticipation of the merger. And obviously earlier in the year, Geno Germano left. So now with the deal off, I'm wondering what the plan is from here in terms of filling these types of positions. Are you, for example, calling out folks that were going to leave and asking them to stay on for now, or what? I'm trying to understand what sort of disruption this might have caused unexpectedly. And second question on splitting up, how much of a drag internally is there to do this? My understanding is that because of different reasons, there is an internal desire by a lot of Pfizer folks at that mid-manager level to separate the organization. I'm not sure if you have town hall meetings or that sort of thing. But what's the feedback internally at the rank-and-file level on the company splitting up? Ian C. Read: Tim, so I'm really not aware of any layoffs or major changes prior to the Allergan deal. I think there were certain specific positions that may have been reorganized. But to answer your question succinctly, there is no disorganization or disruption. I think the results of the first quarter show that, so I'm not at all worried about that. And as to the internal conversations, I would say they're very robust. We have a great enterprise-wide view on the company that stems from John's leadership in Established and his team. And the internal decisions or internal motivations are totally directed to what we believe would be best for shareholder value, and it's a very transparent process. So I don't think there are in any way factions within the company trying to push one way or the other. We're all focused as a management team on what the best decision for Pfizer shareholders would be. Thank you. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Ian. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Christopher Schott : Great, thanks for the question. I just had two on business development. I guess the first one is can you just elaborate on your priorities and appetite at this point? I guess as part of that, do you have a bias when it comes to bolstering Innovative versus Established? And is there a focus on in-market or near-to-market products versus pipeline? The second question was about the competitive environment for business development. I know you've been very financially disciplined in the past, but it appears that we've got a pretty competitive environment out there, and some of your peers may be less focused on ROI than you are. How do you balance that opportunity to acquire attractive assets with maximizing long-term shareholder value in this environment? Thanks very much. Ian C. Read: Thank you. Our BD approach has always been one of BD is not a strategy. It complements our ongoing strategies. So I think our BD post-Allergan remains on that same course. We'll look for assets that we think can add value to shareholders that are appropriately priced and meet our returns. We've always been very disciplined on that, although not concerned about pulling the trigger when we see those opportunities. So I think there is \u2013 after all the work we've done on the Established side, there would be a tendency towards a bias to the Innovative side. And we would be biased I think more towards products that are near-market or in-market that we believe we could generate incremental growth and value by owning them rather than looking at very early products because we think we have a very full and complete pipeline in that area. On the competitive stance, I'd ask Frank to make a few comments on that. Frank A. D'Amelio: Sure. So I think, Chris, the way to think about this, at least the way we think about this, is clearly there has been some changes in valuation in sectors within the industry. So biotech, for example, clearly has had a change in valuation, a decrease in valuations. Without speaking for those management teams or those boards, I think at a macro level, if you were to ask do they believe that their current valuations represent the valuations of the company, I'd say I'm not sure. I think that they're probably in transition, that they really haven't decided that that most of the latest valuations are indeed the valuations that are real valuations. What I always believe is what really will determine this are when those individual companies have to go out and have a capital market event. The capital market event will be very informing in terms of what the valuations of those companies are. And so I think over time we'll see some of that thinking take place. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Frank. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from John Boris from SunTrust. John T. Boris: Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the results. So first question, just on Chantix, on the EAGLES results that you got, is that going to help to relax the need to mention neuropsychiatric side effects on direct-to-consumer advertising ads? And we're already seeing a nice uptick, but if you're able to relax that, one would think that you might be able to see a faster uptick. Second question on GEP, you've indicated that you're going to be divesting the pumps business. Where are you in the process on identifying a financial or strategic buyer for the pumps business? And one of your competitors announced this morning that they're going to spinning their hemophilia business. Any thoughts within the Innovation core to possibly considering staying and/or divesting businesses that aren't receiving enough R&D attention that could be better as standalone businesses out of that Innovation core? Thanks. Ian C. Read: Okay. Albert, if you could, talk about Chantix, please. Albert Bourla : Yes, obviously, I'm very pleased with the positive results of EAGLES. In this monumental study, the authors concluded, as Ian said, that the trial did not see a significant increase of first year's neuropsychiatric adverse events with Chantix or bupropion compared to placebo and nicotine patch. We are submitting this data to various regulatory bodies, proposing revisions to the product labeling, including a request for the removal of a boxed warning. We believe that the available scientific evidence does not support the boxed warning, and to look forward to discussing this data with FDA, EMA and other global regulatory parties. Ian C. Read: Thank you. I would just add that also having it published in The Lancet is clearly a good medical communication and education and will allow an appropriate dialogue. John? John Young : Okay. So thanks for the question, John. So maybe I just wanted to correct any misunderstanding that may be out there because we've made no announcement regarding any intention to do anything in regard to our pump or Infusion Systems business. We're obviously aware of market speculation, which we don't comment on. Across all of our businesses, we regularly review our business portfolio from the perspective of maximizing value creation. If there are any developments with our business, we would certainly communicate that publicly. But I think as we've said previously, we believe that in the Hospira acquisition we acquired what is a scarce asset that is performing well. The management team have taken the right steps to turn the business around, and we are extremely positive about the opportunity to continue to help the Infusion Systems business to perform well and to return to growth. Ian C. Read: Thank you. And, Frank, if you could, talk about the... Frank A. D'Amelio: Hemophilia? Ian C. Read: Hemophilia, I think it was hemophilia. Frank A. D'Amelio: Yes, so obviously, John, we're aware of the announcement this morning on the hemophilia business of one of our competitors. The way I think about this is we've done similar things in the past. If you think about our sale of Capsugel, the sale of Nutri [Nutrition], the creation of Zoetis, and I think our compass on all those transactions has been creating shareholder value. Our compass going forward will continue to be creating shareholder value. If we think there's an opportunity to do that through any action, including something like a spin, we would clearly consider it. Hopefully, our actions in the past have demonstrated that we have more than a willingness to do that. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Frank. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink. Seamus Fernandez : Hello, thanks very much for the question, so I just had a couple here. First off, can you talk a little bit about the expectations for biosimilar product launches outside the U.S. and how you see them evolving relative to Inflectra's launch, which seems to have been ahead of expectations? The second question is relative to international Enbrel. Is Inflectra uptake and Remicade pricing a good comparison for Enbrel's performance as biosimilars hit the market in the next call it eight to 12 months? And then the last question is on consumer. On the recent GlaxoSmithKline conference call, when asked about interest in additional consumer assets and the possibility of interest in Pfizer's consumer business, the current CEO suggested that they continue to evaluate all options and would welcome opportunities to participate in these larger assets. I guess my question is how creative are you willing to get with the consumer business in order \u2013 and would a ViiV-like deal be ever a consideration for the consumer business at Pfizer? Thanks. Ian C. Read: So thank you, Seamus. I'll deal with the consumer one first. Look, the consumer asset in Pfizer's portfolio is a very valuable asset. It's growing well. We're continuing to add to that business. We have a great management team. That being said, all of Pfizer is aware internally that we continually look at all of our different assets, and we're always focused on creating shareholder value. To this date or to this moment, I think the best way of creating shareholder value is the plan we have with consumer growing inside Pfizer. But as facts change, we're always willing to look at those facts. If you could, deal with the biosimilars, John, please. John Young : Yes, so thanks for the question, Seamus. So clearly, biosimilars are a very important part of the GEP growth strategy. The portfolio consists of both Pfizer, legacy Pfizer and legacy Hospira assets as well as some assets from external partnerships. Per your question, we remain very bullish about the opportunity. There's something on the order of $100 billion of currently patented branded biologics expected to lose patent protection in the next five to 10 years. And the global market for biosimilars is expected to grow from around $1 billion annually in 2013 to somewhere on the order of $17 billion to $20 billion in 2020. In regard to our plans for our portfolio, we have overall around nine distinct biosimilar molecules in different stages of development and approval. We're going to look to optimize the launch of that portfolio on a global basis over the coming years. Ian C. Read: Albert, could you discuss the impact on Enbrel? Albert Bourla : Yes, first of all on the pricing, let me say that I don't think we can draw conclusions from one biosimilar to the other. Every one has its own dynamic. From the limited pricing for Enbrel biosimilar so far, the discount levels are in line with our expectations, and we expect Enbrel's pricing to be competitive. Now in a general comment on the performance of biosimilars, so far Enbrel had a strong quarter of 8% up, so basically no impact to date from biosimilars, but of course it's very early. We do expect a modest uptake of biosimilars. But due to their limited long-term safety and efficacy data, at launch we anticipate their use will be primarily in new patients. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Albert. Charles E. Triano: Our next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI. Mark J. Schoenebaum: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Hey, Ian, I appreciate your comments regarding you'll make a decision on a potential split-up by the end of 2016. Can you confirm or not confirm that that decision would be a yes or no that you would split by the end of 2017, or should we be extending our timeline for the actual timing of a split? And then number two, I know you've given this before, Frank. But can you just comment roughly speaking on what you see the go-forward growth rates for both the growth business and the Established Products business mean? I think you've given us a ballpark figure for that. I know there's no official guidance out there. But just a ballpark figure, it would be nice to get those ballparks refreshed. And then finally, you had made some commentary, Frank, around \u2013 I think you had made some commentary around the leverage ratio that the Allergan Pfizer NewCo, you'd be willing to take the Allergan Pfizer NewCo to. I was just wondering. Now that obviously Allergan isn't going to be part of the future, what kind of leverage ratio you guys would go to, to maximum and whether or not you would be willing to take out debt in order to do a large share repurchase? Thanks a lot. Ian C. Read: So on the timing of the split, if we made a decision to split in the fourth quarter, we believe that the transaction could be completed by the end of 2017. Obviously, those timelines are subject to change if we encounter things that we don't expect in the process. But right now, the planning assumption would be with a fourth quarter decision, we would be able to complete the transaction by the end of 2017. Frank, do you want to handle the other question? Frank A. D'Amelio: Sure. So on the going-forward growth rates, I haven't provided going-forward growth rates other than our 2016 guidance for revenue, which we just increased by $2 billion, $1 billion of which was operational. On the leverage ratio, what I've said previously, Mark, on that is I'd be willing to take it to 2.5 to three times. We mentioned that as part of when we've gone through some of the Allergan meetings. So by the way, if I was willing to do it for that, I'd be willing to do it for the right transaction on a going-forward basis. In terms of leveraging the balance sheet for buybacks, the way I think about this is if you go back to 2010, and if you include the $5 billion accelerated share repurchase that we added this past March, $50.7 billion of share buybacks, $50.7 billion, 1.9 billion shares excluding the 405 million shares as a result of the Zoetis exchange. So we've done actually a massive buyback without having to borrow or leverage the balance sheet, which allows us to keep our powder dry if we wanted to do a different kind of transaction. So hopefully that answers your question. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Frank. Operator, can we move on to the next question? Operator : Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. David R. Risinger: Thanks very much. With respect to considerations for Established Products, could you just comment on how you're considering potentially shifting Viagra and Lyrica from the Innovative segment to Established Products? Second, could you just discuss your plans to launch a biosimilar Remicade in the U.S. this fall and your level of conviction there? And then third, could you help us understand how we should think about Prevnar comps going into next winter? Obviously, Prevnar has been extremely strong, but that may present tough comps a year from now. So any color on your thinking there would be helpful. Thank you. Ian C. Read: Yes, so we would expect that we will continue with our policy to move products like Viagra and Lyrica as they get close to be peri-LOEs from one business to the other. The exact timing we would decide. But in general, you clearly want to have an Innovative company that is focused on growth and not focused on managing the end cycles of products like Lyrica and Viagra. On the biosimilar Remicade, I really think John has made comments on that, and we really can't add any more than that. I wouldn't say that we are preparing for a 2016 launch, and it's dependent upon the factors that John has already mentioned. And, Albert, on the Prevnar comps. Albert Bourla : Yes, let's start at the top. In the U.S., we said we had operational growth of 28%. So apparently, we continue to do an excellent job with a catch-up opportunity. But to put it into context, as of the end of the quarter, from the 49 million adults eligible for vaccination, we have already covered 37% of them. In fact, the vast majority previously vaccinated was new ones (51:45). As we have said before, while many adults remain, this cohort is much more difficult to capture. And going forward, we expect the U.S. adult revenues to decline compared to last year. These will be partially offset by Europe and the rest of the world, which achieved 63% operational growth this quarter and will continue growing strongly. And also, as both Ian and Frank said in the beginning, the adopting pediatric will have a strong performance. So as a whole, the Prevnar franchise will have very comparable revenues this year compared to last year. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Albert. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Hi, good morning. Thank so much for taking my questions. So two on the immuno-oncology side, so one just on avelumab. I believe Merkel cell you mentioned as the lead registrational indication there. I'm wondering if you have that data in-house now. And are you still confident in getting that filed an accelerated manner? And if you could just clarify, between yourselves and Merck KGaA, how the registration process works, who's in charge of that, or is it done jointly? And then second on the combination side, you mentioned 4-1BB and OX-40 being two of the key agents as you think about combinations. Can you just talk a little bit about how you prioritize those two, given it seems like several companies have OX-40s in early development, while 4-1BB it appears it's just you and maybe one or two other competitors? I'm trying to get a sense of how important having something that is unique or differentiated to offer physicians and payers for combinations could be going forward when you think about how to prioritize resources behind the two different agents. Thank you. Ian C. Read: Okay. I'll ask Albert to talk about the Merkel cell and the registration split of responsibilities. And then Mikael can deal with the choices we make between our unique 4-1BB and our OX-40. Albert Bourla : Yes, with regards to Merkel cell, first of all we are going to have some data presented at ASCO this year. It will be an oral presentation. We have already received Breakthrough designation, and we plan to file this year. The work between us and Merck KGaA is split in a very collaborative way. They are doing parts of the work and we are doing other parts, and we have very good collaboration. So we are very confident on executing on that. Ian C. Read: Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : Yes, so both our 4-1BB and OX-40 have unique design versus major competitors. And as you know, our 4-1BB has performed very well when it comes to tolerability. And we already reported last ASCO of augmenting effect when combined with rituximab, and we'll start reporting early signs when combined with PD-1 and PD-L1 this year. So we do think that 4-1BB will be a key molecule as the performance we start to see. We are the only company that can put a 4-1BB/OX-40/PD-L1 in place, and we're moving swiftly to have that as an option, and expect late this year or early next year to have that triple combo. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Mikael. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, and can we move to the next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Colin Bristow from Bank of America. Colin N. Bristow: Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. On potential competition to Ibrance, there's increasing optimism on the Street around Lilly's CDK-4/6, and I guess we'll see data on that at ASCO. Could you just discuss how you view Lilly's and Novartis's CDK-4/6 in terms of their level of threat to Ibrance going forward? Second, on the Xeljanz filing in the EU, what's your level of confidence that this will get through, and what you feel you satisfied in this submission that previously had been lacking? And then lastly, just in your earlier-stage pipeline, any assets you would highlight that you're particularly excited about that we should be paying closer attention to? Thanks. Ian C. Read: Okay. I think why don't we ask Mikael to deal with the early assets that we're excited about and perhaps also comment on the Xeljanz submission, and then Albert may want to add something. And then Albert will deal with the Ibrance competitive situation. Mikael Dolsten : Yes, thank you. So we have a very comprehensive pipeline. As you heard, Ian alluded to that in his prepared remarks. We have 85 projects spread across Phase 1 to Phase 3 registration. And let me just mention a couple that we think will be really unique and differentiating. We already touched base on 4-1BB, on OX-40, and the triple I-O combo. Lorlatinib in the ALK and ROS space is generating very interesting data that we will start to share. We have a novel ADC called PTK-7 that we'll also see some real interesting response rates. In the immuno- inflammation field, in addition to Xeljanz, we now have four different immuno-kinases going into Phase 2, with several highly specific JAKs going to inflammatory bowel disease, dermatological inflammation, and lupus. So we will share more data around those, but I think that will really move the entire JAK field over time into new areas and with the new profiles. Vaccines, it's always CDs and stuff (57:40) obviously that we are really excited about. And Ian mentioned in his introduction that we have built some interesting assets in Parkinson's with a completely novel dopamine modulator, and also have an interesting GDNF study together with MedGenesis. And finally, in rare disease, I'll exemplify that we have a growing sickle cell franchise with rivipansel and a plan to start PD-9 as a way to prevent occurrence of difficult-to-treat rare disease episodes. So you can see our opportunity spans multiple therapeutic areas. Xeljanz in Europe I think is based on a very comprehensive file. We have six complete clinical trials with two open-label extensions. And all our program contains more than 19,000 patients here, more than 6,000 patients in long-term extension up to eight years. And please, I want to just to remind everyone that Xeljanz has been used by more than 6,500 physicians and more 50,000 patients in the U.S. with a very favorable profile. So you can see it's a completely different profile we have now with the European regulatory agencies. And we also have some specific sub-studies that we're interested on that we have executed on. So we view the dialogue with them as very constructive at this moment. Ian C. Read: Thank you. Albert Bourla : I have nothing to add in Xeljanz, just maybe that it is already approved in more than 45 countries. And let me move to Ibrance and competition. I cannot really speak much about competition, but it includes Lilly and Novartis because there is limited clinical data in the public domain on the efficacy and safety. What I can do is I can speak about our product, and I can tell you we have the most advanced and broad program in the industry. Firstly, we are the only company with a registered product in the U.S. and eight other countries and an accepted filing in Europe where we may obtain registration this year. In just over a year in the market, Ibrance has been prescribed by almost 7,000 physicians and is up to more than 28,000 patients. This rapid uptake is a testament to its efficacy and outstanding safety profile with a very low rate of global three and four GI effects such as fatigue and diarrhea. Ibrance has delivered positive results across three randomized pivotal trials. It's been studied in an additional five pivotal studies in early, advanced, and recurrent breast cancer as well as 62 ongoing investigator-initiated research, 38 of which are in breast cancer and 28 are in non-breast cancer. So this is what I call a clear lead. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Albert. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Albert. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi. Andrew S. Baum: Three questions, please. First, Ian, you touched upon triple combinations, or it may have been Mikael. There's obviously a significant cost burden attached with that. Could you talk to the idea of where you feel specialist care pricing is going in the U.S. and how quickly is biosimilars' cost effectiveness arguments in a gridlocked House sufficient to maintain the status quo, or how do you anticipate and how quickly do you anticipate change? Second on PBMs, again to Ian, some of your peers have identified PBMs as bad actors in the whole healthcare value chain given their disproportionate rebate capture. Do you believe that PBMs or rather pricing transparency is a good or a bad thing from an industry perspective? And then finally for Mikael, I saw some data recently on Selzentry, your CCR5 antagonist, in an immuno-oncology setting. Do you have any plans to develop that drug within that setting, or is the IP an issue? Thank you. Ian C. Read: So on the pricing oncology assets, clearly products are sold on their value and the value of the patients and those of society, but there is also an element of total affordability. So I think the ability of companies to have the complete regime like with Pfizer's case the PD-L1, the OX-40, the 4-1BB, or a small molecule will enable offerings to payers that I think society will find acceptable from a cost/benefit return as distinct from looking at the complications of acquiring all those elements separately in the marketplace. On pricing itself, I agree with you. There is a large amount of rhetoric given the election year. And there is concern from individuals about accessing pharmaceuticals. This is extremely complex. It's in great part due to the pressure on plans that have been transformed away from having the ability to really be an insurance company and become somewhat more of benefit administrators than insurers. It has to do with the quality of insurance and also to do with the value of these specialty products. So I expect a robust discussion. But I expect that in the end, the United States will continue to support innovation and find ways to make sure that innovation is supported and products get to patients. And that will obviously be a robust policy discussion, but I do think in the end that's where the United States will end up in that discussion. On PBMs, in a market-based system, PBMs provide value by aggregating volumes and negotiating discounts. To the extent those discounts are passed on to the end user or the end payer or an appropriate amount is passed on and they're serving a valid market function, as the market changes, they may have a larger or smaller role. But I think what I would emphasize is I like to see a marketplace work. I like to see incentives in the marketplace to ensure it works, and I like to see the appropriate amount of transparency. So that's really all I can really comment on that. Thank you. Charles E. Triano: Mikael is supposed to talk about Selzentry. Ian C. Read: Mikael, yes. Mikael Dolsten : I think you were likely referring to our CCR2 small molecule antagonist. And we have together with an academic collaborator really observed some interesting effects on suppressive immune cells in pancreatic cancer and some early encouraging clinical signals. So we do continue with a second study in pancreatic cancer with the CCR2. And in total, we currently have eight different new medical entities in the immuno-oncology field in the clinic, and expect by the end of this year to have 10 different immuno-oncology compounds in the clinic. Ian C. Read: Thank you. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Mikael. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Geoffrey Meacham : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question, just a couple. Ian, can you continue the strategy discussion? I want to get a sense as to what at this point you'd characterize as the top one or two priorities post-Allergan and when you look at things like tax rate, cash flow, expected multiples, or growth rates. And then just on the pipeline front, a few for Ibrance, the adjuvant trials really aren't until much later, say 2020. But how do you see the role of CDK-4/6 in this, and does your long-term thinking assume success here? And then for boco [bococizumab] in PCSK9, clearly, outcomes data are going to dictate the share. But much of a role do you think that imaging plays through IVUS [intravascular ultrasound] in product differentiation? Thanks. Ian C. Read: Thank you. The priorities post-Allergan continue to be our four strategies, which is to continue to show excellence in our Innovative core and bring forward Innovative products. I think you've seen us do that. Continue to drive the growth rates of our inline and newly launched products, which you can see are happening. Eliquis is performing extremely well, with an LOE in the United States out I think in 2019 \u2013 sorry, Lyrica that is. Eliquis is doing very well. Xeljanz is doing well. So I think the priorities are : continue to ensure that our science comes to market; grow our inline products, which I think we're doing well; execute on capital discipline, which we continue to do; and in our Established Products businesses is to roll out successfully the biosimilar strategy, to continue to utilize and maximize the value of our sterile injectables around the world. So frankly, I think there is lots to do in that area. We'll continue to look at our tax situation. We have a very good tax group, and Frank and his team are very good at looking at how to improve that. It continues to be an area of focus. Vis-\u00e0-vis Ibrance, I agree with you that the trials are on the timelines you talk about, but that's the nature of the trials in oncology. And the reality is we have already started those trials and are well ahead of any of our competition. So it's a matter of a lead established in the marketplace. So I'm very optimistic about the long-term growth rates of Ibrance, both in the indications it has now and the indications to come as we go earlier in the breast cancer. And also outside of breast cancer I think we have a lot of work going on. And then you asked \u2013 the last question was? Charles E. Triano: Boco, PCSK9. Ian C. Read: Boco, I've always thought, and we discussed this, that boco, or these products should only have been launched when you have outcomes data. I've always felt, and I think if you go back in our transcripts, we've always said that on LDL alone, it will be difficult to convince society to pay what's necessary, and you really need to include along with LDL in the outcomes. So clearly outcomes is important. Imaging has been used previously with lipid agents. It doesn't really move the needle. What moves the needle is the large prospective trials which show that outcomes are changed. And an image just doesn't do the same as that data. So I look forward to that class expanding when we have the outcomes data and we have the right value equation for society. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Ian. Next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from Manoj Garg from Healthco. Manoj K. Garg: Hi, thanks for taking the questions, one for Albert on Ibrance and then just one for Frank on financials. When would you expect submitting the PALOMA-2 data to FDA? And then maybe you can just talk about what that would do to the intent-to-treat population. And then just to follow up there, what is the general timing in Europe on approval? And then for Frank, on the $500 million increase in SI&A, is that driven largely by FX, or is there some additional investment there? Ian C. Read: Go ahead, Albert, please. Albert Bourla : Thank you. As you know, we announced positive top line results from PALOMA-2. We will present details at ASCO with an oral presentation. It will be a late-breaker. Now this trial provides additional confirmatory evidence on the benefits of Ibrance for breast cancer patients. So this will add to the momentum, obviously. Also, it will be used for regulatory filings. It is a requirement from FDA so that we can convert the accelerated approval to a permanent approval, and we plan to file. We are in discussions now with the FDA. In EU we have already filed. We have an accepted filing based on PALOMA-1 and PALOMA-3. But also we have submitted already PALOMA-2 over there as additional supporting data. And as we said before, we expect to receive Ibrance approval in the U.S. as early as this year if eventually... Ian C. Read: Europe. Albert Bourla : Excuse me, in Europe as early as this year if we have a positive opinion from European authorities. Ian C. Read: Thank you. Frank? Frank A. D'Amelio: And on the SI&A and the impact of FX, so we took it up $500 million. The midpoint went up $500 million. Approximately half of that is due to foreign exchange. Approximately half of it is due to operations, including increased investment in new and certain inline products. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Frank. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Richard Purkiss from Piper Jaffray. Richard J. Purkiss: Thanks, guys. I've got three questions. Firstly for Albert, can you update us on your thoughts on how Prevnar penetration into the adult indication is likely to play out over the next 12 months in Europe? Secondly, also for Albert, can you give us an update on how well the adjuvant breast cancer studies are enrolling? And then thirdly, perhaps for Mikael, also on Ibrance, whether you see it largely restricted to the ER-positive HER2-negative breast cancer setting, or whether its mechanism ultimately gets used for other metastatic tumors too? Thanks. Ian C. Read: Okay, Albert. Albert Bourla : Yes, let me start with Europe. As I said, in Europe we have 63% operational growth, and this will continue. We will have strong growing in Europe. The demographics are very favorable over there. We have a larger eligible population. But the price per dose is less than in the U.S. And also another factor is that we need to obtain a recommendation. And this is a process that in Europe can take \u2013 recommendation and reinvestment \u2013 can be phased over two years because it's happening country by country. In some cases, within the same country it's happening district by district. So we are working very, very intensively on that because we see the opportunity as a major one. But moving to how we are doing with our expansion into other breast cancer segments and particularly into the adjuvant setting actually, we have two studies in the adjuvant setting. That's PENELOPE-B. This is for high-risk early breast cancer, and we have PALLAS for intermediate-risk early breast cancer. And they are recruiting very nicely right now. I need to also emphasize that we have another one which is in pilot. It is a collaborative study, but it is in the neo-adjuvant setting with collaboration with the Washington University. Ian C. Read: Thank you. Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : So we are increasingly excited as we have learned more about Ibrance how significant we can see opportunity to expand utility or potential of that drug. So we have studies ongoing, and we will likely see some data this year or next year in head and neck cancer in combination with Erbitux Pfizer-sponsored and collaborative studies, in Mantle cell lymphoma with ibrutinib, and in pancreatic cancer in combination with abraxane in 2017. And more recently, we're also studying EGFR mutant lung cancer combining Ibrance with our own PF7775 EGFR inhibitor. Also within breast cancer, we see opportunities and have initiated triple therapy based on Ibrance, as well as we're looking at the novel segment of breast cancer that may go from ER into double-positive segments. So substantial opportunities and of course our antigen (1:14:25) is growing as we see how well Ibrance is performing. The patient experience is so good and our confirmatory studies deliver real encouraging data. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Mikael. Charles E. Triano: Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets. Alex Arfaei : Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the quarter, three questions, if I may. Ian, on business development, all things being equal, would you prefer ex-U.S. assets so that you can deploy your capital more efficiently? Second, apologies if I missed this, but can you tell us what Prevnar Adult sales were in the quarter by U.S., ex-U.S. if possible? And then finally on the Hospira business, it was a little bit lower than we expected despite the higher selling days. Could you comment on that, and is it because your own sterile injectable business is doing better? Thank you. Ian C. Read: Thank you. On the question of U.S. or non-U.S., as I said, we're value investors, so it comes down to what is the return on assets and what's the NPV. And of course, in that would be included the different costs of doing either an onshore or offshore deal. So we would make that decision based on that. Next, I think it's Mikael. Sorry, Albert? Albert Bourla : Yes, Prevnar Adult global sales were $439 million, so that was 31% of that. But most of that was in the U.S., $390 million were in U.S. and $47 million were internationally. International, as I said, grew 63%. Ian C. Read: Thank you. And the last question John Young : Was global Hospira sales? Ian C. Read: Yes. John Young : So overall we're very positive about the performance of the Hospira business. We saw positive performance across all of our segments this quarter with sterile injectables, biosimilars, and the infusion system. This business continues to return to growth overall. In addition, with the ongoing efforts to integrate the two companies that are ongoing but proceeding very well and in line with our plans, we remain very positive about the performance that we're seeing from the legacy Hospira business. Frank A. D'Amelio: And we increased our synergy target from $800 million to $1 billion. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Frank, for the add. Charles E. Triano: Thanks. And, operator, can we take our last question, please? Operator : Your final question comes from Jeff Holford from Jefferies. Jeffrey Holford : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just first off, can you help us think about the potential investor positioning for GEP to help us think about valuations? You say there aren't good comps out there, but I would tend to think of this as perhaps a slower growing part of the business but perhaps one that could sustain a greater dividend than the rest of the business over time. So just help us think. Is that the investor positioning of that business? Secondly, on Ibrance, I wonder if you could just on the basis for the U.S. what's the duration of therapy that you're seeing and what's the market share in the unlabeled population? And then just last question, have you prioritized any specific tumor types or indications yet for either 4-1BB or OX-40 in terms of pivotal planning? Thank you. Ian C. Read: Okay. On GEP, I've always used the analogy that it's like the pharmaceutical business that really given it's in sterile injectables to sell on quality and barriers to entry; and given its biosimilars which also will be eventually sold on the quality of the manufacturer and the data we have. And then the emerging markets, which is sold on brands and quality that it looks like a consumer business with just a touch more risk than a normal consumer business, so perhaps some nice comparables. The P/Es really ought to be the consumer-like business. Now you may or may not agree with that, but it's slower growing, growing with GDP just like consumer businesses do, being sold on brands, and then a little more affected because it does have pricing risks and some development risks. That's how I would look at it. Ibrance? Albert Bourla : Yes, the first-line market there is now 38%. That's number one. We have achieve leadership and we have surpassed AI monotherapy. The second and third-line markets there are 26% and 14% respectively. But when it comes to duration of treatment, it's too early to assess because as you know, the product has been launched a year approximately ago, and PFS duration from the data it is around 20 months since PALOMA-2. So still we need some time to assess what would be the actual progression-free. Ian C. Read: Thank you. Mikael Dolsten : Yes. So on one hand with 4-1BB, we presented last year at ASCO and we will provide update during this year, 4-1BB with rituximab being lymphoma that had very promising response rate in refractory with rituximab patients about 35%. We have expanded that study. It looks certainly very promising. So that could be one opportunity for moving 4-1BB fast forward. 4-1BB and OX-40 are expressed in many tumors in the immune infiltrating cells. So we will have a broad ambitious program where we see opportunity for these across many different solid tumors and some blood related cancers. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Mikael. Albert Bourla : Let me make a correction. I think I said 20 months in PALOMA-2. It is 20 months in PALOMA-1. We haven't disclosed the duration treatment of PALOMA-2. We'll do that at ASCO. Charles E. Triano: Right. Thank you, Albert, and thank you, everybody, for your attention today. Frank A. D'Amelio: So long, everybody. Ian C. Read: Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude Pfizer's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to Pfizer's second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today to review Pfizer's second quarter 2016 performance. As usual, I'm joined today by our Chairman and CEO Ian Read; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research & Development; Albert Bourla, President of Pfizer Innovative Health; John Young, President of Pfizer Essential Health; and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel. The slides that will be presented on the call can be viewed on our home page at Pfizer.com by clicking on the link for Pfizer Quarterly Corporate Performance \u2013 Second Quarter 2016, and this is located in the For Investors section, which is in the lower right-hand corner of the page. Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussion during this call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Additional information regarding these factors is discussed under the Disclosure Notice section in the earnings press release we issued this morning, as well as in Pfizer's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, included in Part One, Item 1A, Risk Factors. And this is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission available at SEC.gov and at the Pfizer website, Pfizer.com. Forward-looking statements during this conference call speak only as of the original date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements. In addition, discussions during the call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's current report on Form 8-K dated today, August 2, 2016. Any non-GAAP measures presented are not and should not be viewed as substitutes for financial measures required by U.S. GAAP. They have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to the calculations of similar measures at other companies. We'll now make prepared remarks; then we'll move to a Q&A session. With that I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian? Ian C. Read: Thank you, Chuck, and thank you for joining our call this morning. During my remarks, I will briefly talk about the performance of the business and provide some thoughts regarding each of our businesses and our pipeline. Our financial performance year to date is strong. Even stripping out the impact of the legacy Hospira business, we reported another quarter of operational revenue growth that is driving our solid EPS performance. We achieved this through continued strong performance of new products, in addition to patent-protected products that are later in their lifecycle, as well as operational growth in emerging markets. This was accomplished despite some continued headwinds from products' loss of exclusivity. As you know, to ensure the appropriate level of focus and autonomy, we have evolved our operating model into two distinct business : an innovative business we now call Pfizer Innovative Health, and an established products business we now call Pfizer Essential Health. Through the first six months of the year, the business are executing well against their strategies, as demonstrated by each unit's results. A few words about each. For Pfizer Innovative Health, we continue to see strength in our core brands, including Ibrance, Eliquis, Xeljanz, Lyrica, and Chantix. More specifically, Xeljanz has been prescribed to more than 50,000 patients worldwide. Revenues for the quarter were $217 million, which represents 70% operational growth versus quarter two of 2015. Eliquis's utilization adoption continues to rapidly increase. More than 3.5 million patients already have been prescribed Eliquis. It is now the number one prescribed oral anticoagulant amongst cardiologists in the U.S., Japan and several European countries. As our partner Bristol-Myers reported, revenues in the second quarter were strong, representing 75% operational year-over-year growth and 9% year-to-date operational growth. Regarding Ibrance, approximately 35,000 patients have now been treated by 7,600 prescribers since its launch in February last year, and it's now been approved in 14 countries in addition to the U.S. We anticipate receiving a decision from EU regulators around the end of the year. In Q2, we achieved revenues of $514 million and for the first six months of the year totaled $942 million. Our Prevnar 13 franchise continues to be a significant contributor. With the success of our adult launch in the U.S., approximately 40% of the adult 65-and-plus population had been vaccinated as of the end of June. Achieving year-over-year growth is now more difficult because of the reduction in the number of U.S. adults over 65 who have not received their Prevnar 13 shot. We do, however, expect overall global Prevnar franchise sales for the full year will be comparable to slightly below 2015 levels. During the quarter, we closed the Anacor acquisition, which was a nice complement to our inflammation/immunology portfolio within the Innovative business. The Anacor acquisition is a great example of the type of opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions that enhance our portfolio with a pipeline product that is potentially close to market launch. In terms of the pipeline, we believe there are significant late-stage opportunities in the Innovative business in key areas such as immuno-oncology, CV/metabolic, vaccines, I&I, rare diseases, neuroscience, and pain. In immuno-oncology, we have started Phase 3 studies for avelumab in bladder and ovarian cancer, adding to the numerous existing studies already underway for the compound. Together with our partner Merck KGaA, we plan to file avelumab for the treatment of metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma at the end of quarter three 2016 in the U.S. and by the end of 2016 in the EU. In CAR-T, we're working with Servier on a joint clinical development program for UCART19, a product developed by Cellectis. We have exclusive rights from Servier to develop and commercialize UCART19 in the United States. And, in June, Cellectis announced the first patient was treated in a Phase 1 pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia trial, marking the first clinical trial of UCART19. And last week we expanded our immuno-oncology portfolio with our entry into a development collaboration license and option agreement with Western Oncolytics. We will collaborate with them on the preclinical and clinical development of a novel oncolytic vaccinia virus, WO-12, through Phase 1 trials. Following the completion of the Phase 1 trial, we have an exclusive option to acquire WO-12. Moving to our oncology portfolio, we completed our Phase 3 study for inotuzumab in adult patients with relapsed or refractory CD22-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Based on the study's results, we are planning to pursue regulatory submissions. And, if approved, inotuzumab could be a valuable new addition to current available treatment options for these patients. Currently, adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia have a five-year survival rate of less than 10%, making these patients particularly difficult to treat. We also continue to see success with Xalkori. It is now the first and only FDA-approved biomarker-driven therapy for the treatment of the ROS1-positive metastatic non-small cell cancer. In a clinical trial of 50 patients, two-thirds responded to the treatment, and the median duration response exceeded 1.5 years. While the patient population is limited, it is an important advance for patients who previously had limited treatment options. In July, CHMP adopted a positive opinion recommending extension of the current indication for Xalkori to also include treatment of adults with ROS-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer. This recommendation will now be reviewed by the European Commission. In vaccines, we have two preventative vaccines, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile, in Phase 2 clinical development. We expect to have C. difficile Phase 2 data towards the end of this year. In inflammation and immunology, the Anacor acquisition has brought us crisaborole. It is an important potential first-line treatment option for the 18 million to 25 million children and adults in the U.S. who have mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. If approved, this would be a meaningful advancement for these patients, who have not seen new treatment options for their condition in the last 15 years. Last month, the detailed results from the pivotal Phase 3 study were published in a peer-reviewed journal, and the new drug application is currently under review by the U.S. FDA with an expected action date in January 2017. For Xeljanz, we have recently announced positive top line results from the third Phase 3 trial of Xeljanz for patients with moderately to severe active ulcerative colitis. The combined findings from the Phase 3 pivotal trial are encouraging and provide evidence that Xeljanz has the potential to be an effective new treatment option that both induces and maintains remission in UC. We also announced results from two pivotal trials in Xeljanz for use in patients with psoriatic arthritis. The two psoriatic arthritis studies, along with a long-term extension study, are expected to form the potential submission package for possible future regulatory applications. In pain, we've begun enrollment in all the Phase 3 tanezumab studies. This program consists of six studies and approximately 7,000 patients in three chronic pain conditions : three in osteoarthritis, two in chronic low back pain, and one in cancer pain. The study results are projected to being reporting out in 2018. We also are strengthening our gene therapy capabilities. Yesterday we announced the acquisition of Bamboo, a privately held company biotech company based in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, focused on developing gene therapies for the treatment of patients with rare diseases. The acquisition complements our growing rare disease portfolio with preclinical assets including potential therapies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Friedreich's ataxia. In addition, we are making good progress in hematological, including a Phase 3 study in sickle cell disease. With our partner, Spark, we recently presented data to the World Federation of Hemophilia Congress and have received breakthrough designation for SPK-9001, which is currently being investigated in an ongoing Phase 1/2 trial as a potential one-time treatment for hemophilia B. Turning now to Pfizer's Essential Health. The business continues to move close to stabilizing its revenue base. Excluding the impact of Hospira, the legacy Essential Health business was nearly flat on an operational revenue basis for the first half of the year as compared to a year ago. We continue to expect that this business has the potential to move to operational growth through a combination of expanded biosimilars (12:32) portfolios. Much of this is aided by the Hospira acquisition, along with continued growth in emerging markets, which grew by 4% operationally in the second quarter without Hospira and other core areas where the business (12:48). Of note, we are now the worldwide leader in biosimilars, according to (12:55). And expect to compete in the first wave of biosimilar launches in the U.S. And recently we announced our investment to develop a state-of-the-art global biotechnology center in Hangzhou Economic Development Area in China. This innovative facility will ensure we develop and manufacture the high-quality, affordable biosimilar medicines that have the potential to benefit patients both in China and throughout the world. And to potentially further enhance the revenue growth of this business, we will continue to actively manage and reshape our portfolio. Our overreaching objective for Pfizer Essential Health has not changed : to generate a modest but sustainable rate of revenue growth. I believe the business is on a good trajectory, and we are taking the actions that will help enable us to achieve this goal. Turning now to a few comments regarding a potential split of the company. As we have previously said, we are assessing the merits of separation and expect to arrive at a decision no later than end of this year. Let me add, this is not a make-or-break decision for the company. As I have just shared with you, each of our businesses is performing well, and we'll continue to pursue the strategies including opportunistic business development where appropriate to accelerate our strategy, and a strategy that will best position them for long-term success. As a reminder, our decision criteria for a split of the business has not changed. We continue to be based on four questions : Are the businesses performing well within Pfizer? Could the businesses perform well as stand-alone entities? Is there trapped value in a combined entity? And can the trapped values be unlocked efficiently? We will be thoughtful in evaluating the virtues of split over the coming months. Our key and primary motivation here is shareholder value and return to shareholders. I don't view there being a wrong answer here. The decision will be taken in the straightforward context of the best path forward for shareholder value. In summary, we ended the second half of the year with positive momentum that is positioning us to deliver solid performance for the remainder of the year. Now I'll turn it over to Frank, who will go into greater detail on the results of the quarter. Thank you. Frank A. D'Amelio: Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I am reviewing today are included in our webcast. As a reminder, because we completed the acquisition of Hospira on September 3rd, 2015, Pfizer's second quarter and first half 2016 financial results include Hospira global operations, while the comparable prior-year periods do not include any legacy Hospira operations. Now moving on to the financials. Second quarter revenues were approximately $13.1 billion and reflect year-over-year operational growth of $1.6 billion or 13%, which was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $302 million or 3%. Legacy Hospira operations contributed $1.1 billion to revenues. If you exclude foreign exchange and the contribution from legacy Hospira operations, Pfizer's standalone revenues grew operationally by $458 million or 4%. In developed markets, operational revenue growth of $1.5 billion or 17% was driven by legacy Hospira operations and the continued strong performance of Ibrance, Eliquis, Xeljanz, and Lyrica, which were partially offset by expected lower revenues in Prevnar 13 Adult in the U.S. due to the high initial capture rate after its launch in the fourth quarter of 2014, resulting in a smaller catch-up opportunity versus the year-ago quarter, product losses of exclusivity, and the expiration of a collaboration agreement co-promote Rebif in the U.S. In emerging markets, operational revenue growth of $116 million or 4% was driven by legacy Hospira operations and certain Essential Health products, primarily in China, which were partially offset by lower revenues of Prevnar 13 due to the timing of purchases from Gavi and the Vaccine Alliance and in certain other emerging markets. Second quarter reported diluted EPS was $0.33 compared with $0.42 in the year-ago quarter due to higher asset impairment charges, product losses of exclusivity, foreign exchange, higher charges for legal matters, and the Allergan termination fee, which were partially offset by increased revenues from certain new, in-line, and acquired products, as well as a lower effective tax rate. Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $0.64 versus $0.56 in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to increased revenues, a lower effective tax rate, and fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which declined by 106 million shares versus the year-ago quarter, due to our share repurchase program, which were partially offset by an aggregate operational increase in adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses, and adjusted R&D expenses of $913 million or 13%, which includes the addition of Hospira operations in 2016, a $0.06 negative impact due to foreign exchange, and continuing product losses of exclusivity. I want to point out that second quarter adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased year over year from 17.9% to 23.3%, primarily due to foreign exchange and the addition of legacy Hospira operations. Also, because foreign exchange increased cost of sales while decreasing revenues at the same time, which is atypical, there was an exaggerated increase of our adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues in the second quarter. Excluding the foreign exchange impact, adjusted second quarter cost of sales as a percentage of revenue would have been 21.3%. We believe that this is an anomaly rather than a trend, and we have maintained our 2016 adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue guidance. Foreign exchange negatively impacted second quarter revenues by approximately $302 million or 3% and negatively impacted the net of adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses, and adjusted R&D expenses by $106 million or 1%. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted second quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.06 compared with the year-ago quarter. As you can see on the chart, we are reaffirming revenues and adjusted components of our 2016 financial guidance based on our strong performance to date and continued confidence in the business going forward. Moving on to key takeaways, we achieved another quarter of operational revenue growth, driven by the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations; new products that are early in their life cycles, such as Ibrance, Eliquis, and Xeljanz; as well as the solid performance for Lyrica. We reaffirmed 2016 revenue and adjusted diluted EPS financial guidance. We announced and completed the acquisition of Anacor Pharmaceuticals and accomplished several key product pipeline milestones, and we returned $8.7 billion to shareholders in the first half of 2016 through dividends and share repurchases, including a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholders returns in 2016 and beyond. Now I'll turn it back to Chuck. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Ian and Frank, for the review. And, operator, if you can please poll for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI. Mark J. Schoenebaum: Oh, hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Ian, I hope you're well. Frank, hope you're well. Ian C. Read: Thanks, Mark. Mark J. Schoenebaum: Ian, on the topic of the split, I think at Tim's conference a month or so you made some remarks that the Street interpreted as you backing away from a split. And that's sort of the widely held consensus view now. So I'd just like to hear you explain what did you actually mean to communicate at that particular broker conference? And then, if I may, maybe be for Dolsten, could we get an update on the oral PCSK9 and timelines for the injectable CVOT trials and whether there's any possibility you'd file before they're out? Thank you. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Mark. First of all, I want to stress that no decision has been made, and ultimately our decision will be based on what we believe is the best interests of the shareholders. And going back to my prepared remarks, we are looking at these four criteria of, are the businesses performing well? Do we believe the businesses could continue to perform well? Do we believe there's trapped value? And can we extract it on an after-tax basis? So I don't know what the Street perceived I signaled or didn't signal in that meeting. I indicated I do believe that the trapped value question has become more complicated, with both the increase in our share value and the decrease in the P/Es of the comparables. We continue to have very robust dialogue in the company, preparing for this decision. Certainly, stress-testing with our two management teams on issues of what initiatives inside their strategies could only be done if they were separate? And this is, I think, a key point to look at. Is there some material obstacle inside the company for implementation of strategies of either of these divisions if they remain inside Pfizer, or can all material strategies be efficiently implemented if we were part of Pfizer? So no decision has been taken, and will make that call by the end of the year. And I look forward to giving a decision on that. What I would like to stress is that I don't think that optionality necessarily has an expiration date. Like any business we have in Pfizer, whether it's any part of our business, we continually look at our capital allocation. We continue to look at what's in the best interests of Pfizer. Which businesses prosper best in Pfizer? And so what I would say on optionality is that we will have set up the infrastructure and to be able to look at this question at any point in the future if the decision was at the end of the year to remain as we are with both divisions inside Pfizer. If we could go to oral PCSK9. Mikael Dolsten : Oral PCSK9. Yeah, we don't think that the oral PCSK9 profile would be competitive with the (24:30) with PCSK9 antibodies observed in many Phase 3 trials. In the (24:38) area, we actually have moved other interesting products forward, and we have two NMEs coming into the exciting field of NASH. Albert, do you want to share a comment on the regulatory strategy for \u2013 ? Albert Bourla : And the progress of our program with the injectable, yes. We recently confirmed that both studies met their primary endpoints. The remaining two ongoing SPIRE lipid-lowering studies are anticipated to complete later in 2016. Patient enrollment in the SPIRE-2 cardiovascular outcome was completed in April of 2016. And based on our current estimate, the primarily completion of the SPIRE-2 study is expected to occur in the second half of 2017. Charles E. Triano: Great. Thank you, Albert. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank. Gregg Gilbert : Thank you. Ian, would you say it's fair to say that maximizing your tax structure and access to balance sheet, things you care deeply about, are things that cannot be addressed anytime soon without a separation of some kind? And then a second question, if I could ask for your latest intentions on launching Inflectra. And are there any key legal milestones that we should be aware of here in the coming months? Thanks. Ian C. Read: Okay. You know, a separation doesn't, under the current tax laws, facilitate a speedy ability to change the domicile for either of the companies. Under the separation rules now, both companies would be held to the standard of the combined company for three years post the separation. So under present tax laws, I don't see a separation as being a quick route to improving the tax situation. However, I am and remain optimistic that this tax issue will be dealt with by Washington, hopefully in the near future. And I think there is a general consensus that we do need to have tax reform to enable U.S. multinationals to be competitive. On the launch of infliximab, I'll ask John to answer that. John Young : Okay. Thanks for the question, Gregg. So in terms of just one initial comment commercially, I would just reconfirm that we're moving ahead with launch preparations, and launch timing will be impacted by the upcoming court decision. I'll ask Doug Lankler, our General Counsel, to make a couple of comments there. Douglas M. Lankler: Just to review the dates. So Inflectra was improved on April 5, and we give our notice to Janssen immediately. That notice period expires on October 2, and we've agreed not to launch before October 3. Earlier this year we filed a Motion for Summary Judgment for Janssen's 471 antibody patent (27:40). Starting on August 16, the federal court in Massachusetts will hear arguments on this motion and some other issues. If the court rules in our favor, there would be no legal restriction on our ability to launch. If the court doesn't rule in our favor, we still have the trial, and we'll review our options at that time. John Young : Yes, so if I could confirm. If the court were to rule in our favor, we expect that we would launch Inflectra sometime after October 2, which is after the expiry of the 180-day notice period. Ian C. Read: And if they don't rule in our favor, we would need to look at the different scenarios of when we launch, what's the value of launching on our own? What's the risk we're taking, taking that launch risk? What is the loss of value if other competitors come in with us? And we'll make that decision once we know the results of the court case. Gregg Gilbert : Thank you. Ian C. Read: Frank would like to add some - Frank A. D'Amelio: Yeah, just \u2013 Gregg, real quick, to punctuate what Ian said relative to the tax rate, just \u2013 it's the third set of proposed regs that Treasury issued in April, where basically, the split companies, if you were to split, each of the split companies would be valued at the pre-split Pfizer valuation for a three-year period. That's just a little bit more detail. Gregg Gilbert : Thank you. Charles E. Triano: Next question, please, operator Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks very much. Just two questions here. I guess first a question for John on essential medicines. I guess we're roughly a year post-Hospira. Could you just maybe elaborate a little bit on the key growth drivers for your franchise going forward and how you think about a longer-term sustainable growth rate for this business as we move past the remaining LOEs? And a second question coming back to the question of split. I think we've seen past pharma spin-offs do very well and uncover additional strategies to drive shareholder value that may not have been considered when they were part of a larger organization. I guess \u2013 I mean, look at Zoetis, for example; I think that surprised the Street on how much margin leverage they've had. Is that a relevant thing to think about with these much larger businesses you're considering to be splitting here? And how does that factor into a decision to split the company? Thanks so much. Ian C. Read: Okay. Thank you. I'll ask John to do the post-Hospira; then I'll talk about the split and also ask Frank to add some comments too. John Young : Okay. So thanks for the question, Chris. So, yeah, first of all, let me just say that we're actually very pleased with the performance in second quarter and so far this year across all of the segments of our business, both legacy portfolio, the peri-LOE brands, which are performing above market benchmarks, the emerging market business, and then the growth drivers, biosimilars and our sterile injectable portfolio. So biosimilars clearly is a very attractive market opportunity. Pfizer's the leader in total sales with biosimilars commercialized across all three classes. So we are aiming with our development pipeline to really add to our leadership position in the market. Sterile injectables is another attractive segment, and clearly that was a primary driver of our acquisition with Hospira. We're the leader in that segment as well, and we continue to be very positive about the opportunities for continued growth in the sterile injectable business. And then the performance of our core brands in emerging markets continues to be strong. Our business performed well again in the second quarter, primarily driven by some of the \u2013 incorporation of Hospira operations. But actually even excluding the impact of Hospira, we saw strong performance in the second quarter as well. And in addition to those core franchises, we also see the anti-infectives portfolio and women's health continuing to be strong therapeutic areas for us where we have a leadership position. So when we put all those drivers together, even in the face of the impact of LOEs that we are managing on behalf of the corporation, our aspiration in the medium term is to take the Essential Health business to a growth rate in the low to mid-single digit range. And, as a consequence, we believe we can add significant shareholder value through delivering that performance on a sustainable basis. Ian C. Read: Thank you, John. I would add that part of the investment case with Hospira was the launch of some of their portfolio in the international markets. This does not occur immediately. It depends upon the state of their different registrations. And, frankly, we expect that to occur over a two-year period post the integration. So some of that growth internationally will come once registrations are complete. And we continue to look at the total portfolio of the Essential Health business and look for ways to restructure in that. So that's part of the strategy of the team. With regard to the split, yeah. It's a good question when you look at some of the splits in the pharma area and what was perceived as increase in value. Part of that is I think due to the fact that if you look at perhaps the \u2013 you said our own Animal Health split or Abbott or Baxter or the others. You have to question, number one, were the separate parts all being invested in equally? I don't think they were. Were they getting the same amount of management attention? I don't think they were. In our particular case, we are investing in both segments heavily, and there's a big difference between a division that you're spinning being 8% of your revenue and its management attention compared to a division that has 45% of your total revenues. So I think those are things we're looking at. But I do acknowledge that there is this general assumption out there that split companies will improve their performance because there's more management focus, which we are trying to deal with by having very distinct leaderships, and also we've looked some of that resource. Perhaps, Frank, we'll have you comment on that. Frank A. D'Amelio: Sure. So we looked at the S&P 500 index and we compared it to the Guggenheim split company index. And it's interesting. If you look for one year, the S&P outperforms the split company index. Five years, it's about a push, roughly a push. 10 years, the split company index outperforms the S&P 500, but on a compounded growth rate basis 1% and change. So there's no real material difference. At least if you look at the returns on a one-side and 10-year period, the S&P versus the index. Ian C. Read: Yeah, so the key question I think (34:20) questions, is what can be done differently if the divisions are split versus what can be done if they're inside Pfizer? Part of which brings in of course balance sheet, brings in the whole capital structures and also appetite for risk. Thank you. Charles E. Triano: Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Good morning, everyone. So my first one I guess would be for Albert and just around Prevnar. You did obviously give the guidance for this year and how to think about the impact of the catch-up dosing last year. Can you just talk a little bit more longer term? So how do you see this franchise as you think about 2017, 2018, both U.S. ex U.S.? And then also if you could just remind us on \u2013 it's been a couple years now since the ACIP recommendation for use in adults. What's the timing and the process for them to sort of reassess that? I think it was five years after that initial vote, but if you can just remind us. And then my second one I think is for John, just on the EH business. You talked about the top line. Maybe if you could give a little bit more just understanding, I was surprised by the margins that we saw this quarter. They were quite a bit below last quarter. Is there something specific to this quarter? Or how should we think about the operating margin progression for this business going forward? Thanks. Ian C. Read: Okay. I'm going to let Albert answer the questions you asked. And I think on the margins, Frank has some interesting analysis that he'll comment on. Albert. Albert Bourla : Speaking of the remaining of this year. Overall we expect total for revenue franchise to be comparable or slightly down compared to 2015, as Ian said. Moving forward, in the U.S. we are focused on capturing the remaining cohort and expanding uses to a greater age range, given the expanded label. However, to realize the full potential of this, we need the ACIP recommendation. We will also continue developing fully in the other markets. As we always do, we will incorporate our expectations into our 2017 guidance that we will provide in January. But just to make some comments. Prevnar will continue to be a significant problem. Generally speaking, in the U.S., we will continue to see a decline as we exhaust the catch-up opportunity, and then we will stabilize. In international markets, we'll continue growing as we gain more reimbursement and recommendations. And of course we are working to develop a next-generation pneumococcal conjugate vaccine with additional serotypes. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Albert. Frank. Frank A. D'Amelio: And then on the Essential Health business and the margins, from a gross margin perspective it's really a combination of the impact of Hospira, which has lower gross margins relative to the overall business, and then the impact of product LOEs. Those are the two things really driving the gross margin impact. If you go down to operating margin, then once again, it's really a combination of the incremental Hospira SI&A spend and the incremental Hospira R&D spend, which weren't in the prior-year numbers. Those two on expenses, give or take, about $170 million combined. You drop all that, and that's also what impacting the operating margin. Ian C. Read: But we're not seeing anything that is outside of our expectations other than in this timing in the second quarter of the exchange whammy, which is in the cost of goods due to phasing and in the revenue, and our full-year forecasts take that into account. Frank A. D'Amelio: Yeah, in fact, we gave guidance for the year. We reaffirmed our cost of sale guidance, 21% to 22%, which takes all of that \u2013 Essential Health, Innovative Health, all the FX \u2013 we take all that into account. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Ian and Frank. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Bernstein. Timothy Minton Anderson : Oh, thank you. A couple of questions. Ian, when you and I spoke about a split-up in early June, one of the metrics you said you were considering was how cash flows would be impacted as a split company versus a combined company. And you brought that up a couple times, almost seeming to signal that there was a cash flow problem of some sort if you were to split. I'm wondering if you could just elaborate on what potential problems might be from a cash flow perspective and balance sheet perspective? And second question, also in early June, when we talked about M&A, you mentioned all options were on the table when talking about deal sizes. And I'm wondering how much weight to give language like that. Does it really mean it's reasonably possible that we could see Pfizer spend, let's say, $100 billion on an acquisition target? And maybe this is a dumb question, but with your I-O platform you're building, are you willing to rule out some of the obvious big I-O take-out targets like a Bristol or an Astra that would obviously be duplicative in certain ways? Ian C. Read: Okay. I don't think there's \u2013 what I indicated to you was that we're looking at the capital structures of the two businesses and how you deploy the cash flows. And clearly if you're in two distinct divisions, you don't have the same opportunities of deployment of cash, if you're in two companies as you do if you're one. You have less choices as to in which areas you put it. When you're one company, you can take those cash flows, return them to shareholders, continue to invest in the area of business, pay your dividend, or do business development in the essential business. Once you split, you've permanently divided those cash flows and of course you lose flexibility. I think that was basically my comment there, which is understandable. Your question on M&A is \u2013 we constantly survey the M&A space. We have the ability to do acquisitions. I don't think we're necessarily limited in size. If the transaction is attractive and creates shareholder value, we have the wherewithal to do the transactions we need to do. And I really wouldn't speculate and never have speculated on specific targets or specific opportunities. Thank you. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Ian. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen. Steve Scala : Thank you. I have two questions. The first is a more near-term question on Prevnar. I believe the last update on the U.S. adult penetration was that about one-third of the market had been penetrated, and today it was stated to be 40%. So it appears that there has been some additional penetration, but sales are still down versus Q1 and down versus Q4. So the question is why are sales declining when penetration still appears to be on the uptick? And the second question is for Dr. Dolsten. Pfizer had some provocative early data on a differentiated gamma-secretase inhibitor for Alzheimer's disease at the recent AAIC meeting. Is Pfizer moving ahead with this agent despite multiple failures from other companies in gamma-secretase? Thank you. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Steve. Could you, Albert, explain the dynamics of the adult market in the U.S.? Albert Bourla : Steve, the reason why this is happening is because this is a one-time event in the lifetime of the individual adult. So individuals are vaccinated, they don't have an opportunity to repeat the vaccination in the next year, and that counts against you when you move into the next year. Ian C. Read: So the increased penetration just indicates you've now got less of a pool to get 100% of the pool vaccinated. We now think 40% have been vaccinated. There's a remaining 60%, but those 60% are harder to get at because most of them haven't been vaccinated by (42:42) and so they're more difficult targets to access. Albert Bourla : All that were vaccinated last year, they don't repeat the vaccination this year. Ian C. Read: No. Albert Bourla : So the growth is declining. Ian C. Read: Declining. Okay, Mikael. Gamma-secretase. Mikael Dolsten : Yeah, thank for interest and great that you picked up some of the things we have communicated. We have been quite nice the full year in the Alzheimer's space with a gamma-secretase modulator and a very selective BACE-1 inhibitor. Our gamma-secretase modulator was based on extensive work to develop a unique profile in the sense that it modulates rather than inhibits the cleavage of the gamma-secretase function of the a betas. So you get a unique profile where you do lower some of the forms of amyloid \u2013 the longer forms, typically the 1-40 amyloid beta. That has been assumed to be the most toxic, while it actually preserves and possibly enhance some of the shorter forms that potentially even can be beneficial. So we do think we have a unique profile, and it does not have the type of so far side effects that have been reported with gamma secretase inhibitor, including GI issues. This has been a very tolerable, clean ride. So we will certainly continue to look at ways to advance this molecule, and a standalone molecule, and we have the unique opportunity to consider combining it with BACE-1. So as a team we feel very enthusiastic about the recent advances, and thank you again for having noticed it. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Mikael. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin : Thank you. Ian, not to belabor this topic, but forgive me \u2013 I am, just for a couple more questions. If the decision is not to split later this year, should shareholders infer that you believe that Pfizer shares are fully valued? Because you spend a lot of time talking about \u2013 part of the decision is to decide whether or not there's trapped value. So if you decide not, I would assume that would mean that you feel that there is no trapped value. My second question is I think investors are also just frustrated that it's taking so long to decide. Is this all about tax considerations? Because it seems that when you initially floated the idea and created three separate companies, which is now two separate companies, you pursued both AstraZeneca and then Allergan. So I'm just wondering how important having a competitive tax basis is to making your decision a tax inversion? And, third, you brought this up in your comments, but just curious \u2013 your level of optimism that a new administration will pass broad tax reform. And should that happen, does it make sense for you to wait on deciding on a major transaction or deciding on a split? Thanks very much. Ian C. Read: Thank you. Well, I would leave the market to decide if Pfizer's shares are fully valued, and while I personally think that we have a lot of very positive energy in our pipeline and our stock, and whether it's fully valued or not doesn't mean there is or is not trapped value in one segment of it. So I think they are different questions. So the answer would be, I'm not sure there's trapped value, but I'm pretty sure that we have a very robust pipeline and we'll produce greater value for shareholders as we go forward. And so I think that's the way to answer that. Now, on the tax reform. I am cautiously optimistic as there is more discussion on both sides of the aisle on the need to reform the tax system, the need to invest in the United States. And so hopefully that with a new administration, whoever the administration is in, they will relook at the need and there will be energy around tax reform. And of course, the potential of that tax reform has implications for what type of transactions you want to do and what type of premiums you want to pay. So it is an influence in our thinking. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Ian. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Richard Purkiss from Piper Jaffray. Richard J. Purkiss: Thanks. I've got two questions. Firstly, could you give us an estimate of Ibrance penetration broken down, if possible, by line of therapy in the U.S.? And then on Sutent, I've been modeling pressure going forward as I-O therapies into earlier lines of setting. But is there an opportunity to protect value by moving it into the adjuvant space? Thanks. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Richard. Albert? Albert Bourla : Yes. Thank you very much, Richard. Let me start by saying that we are very pleased with the performance of Ibrance. As Ian said, this launch has been prescribed by more than 7,600 physicians, and received by approximately 35,000 metastatic breast cancer patients. On your question on the penetration in the different lines. The most recent markets served reports I have seen (48:17), the first-line markets of 43%, and the second and third line markets served of 46% and 24%, respectively. And also we continue to see very strong insurance. Feedback from prescribers and patients continue to be very positive, particularly on patient quality of life. And moving forward we will continue building momentum in the U.S. as we expand on our penetration in all lines of therapy. We will continue to expand geographically. As you know, we have filed in EU and could have an improved product by the end of the year, and we will continue to expand into earlier lines of therapy. As you know, we have three different studies ongoing in this population. Now let me move to Sutent. You're right. We did report the S-TRAC results. Let me just say a few words about it. Today there are not treatments approved or widely used in the adjuvant setting for RCC. Nephrectomy is the standard of care. The S-TRAC study that we did aimed to determine if adjuvant therapy with Sutent post-nephrectomy would be beneficial for RCC patients with non-metastatic disease, and we did work in high-risk of patient (49:35). The results were not only statistically significant but also clinically meaningful. So if approved, Sutent would be the first product approved in the adjuvant setting for RCC. Too early to comment on filing and approval timelines. We will update you on appropriate times, but how to think about the opportunity was basically \u2013 was also part of your question. The eligible population for S-TRAC was stage 3 patients and a small part of nonmetastatic stage 4. The stage 3 population in the U.S. is 5,000 to 6,000 per year, approximately. Assuming that 80% of patients that are stage 3, are receiving nephrectomy, these will result in approximately 4,000 to 5,000 patients eligible for Sutent in the U.S. per year, with similar numbers expected in Europe. Of course these are preliminary numbers, and in case of potential approval also will depend on the label. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Albert. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Geoffrey Meacham : Morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I have a few on Xeljanz. When you look, growth has picked up of late, and you do have ulcerative colitis and PsA as new drivers. But on the other side you have JAKs hitting the market soon and competitively, and uncertainty on psoriasis. So I think my question here is, where does this sit among Pfizer's priorities for commercial-stage products? And then do you have to press reset in the positioning here when you look at the marketplace, especially with baricitinib coming? Thanks. Ian C. Read: Geoff \u2013 Albert, do you want to take this question, please? Albert Bourla : Yes, absolutely. Look, we are very bullish on the opportunity with Xeljanz. The growth was significant, 72%, and we continue to expand the results for Xeljanz geographically, as you're aware. In March the EMA accepted our application for the treatment of RA. Discussions are going well, and also we are looking forward to new indications in psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis. Both of them are sizable markets. (52:00) each one of them of market opportunity. In your question about competition, first of all, it's difficult to make direct comparisons without head-to-head trials. The results from the initial Phase 3 studies of competitors, of baricitinib, for example, appear to be consistent with the JAK class. But we believe that these data continue to support the value of JAK inhibitors for the treatment of RA, and as a result will grow the class. For our product we are confident in the value of Xeljanz because we are the first in class JAK inhibitor, and the ongoing data dissemination of extensive real-world experience continues and will provide significant growth. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Albert. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS. Marc Goodman : Yes. Morning. A few things. First, can you give us a little more color on China and the growth there, and what are the key products and what's happening? Second, Lyrica, both first quarter and second quarter there's been a significant jump in revenues, and yet you look at the prescription trends and they haven't changed much, so it's clearly pricing. And I'm just curious if there's more of the pricing that's reaching the ASP versus \u2013 and gross to nets are changing there in a good way for you? And then, third, can you just let us know for the rest of the year what kind of data readouts will we see for your immuno-oncology assets? Thanks. Ian C. Read: Okay. John, China, please John Young : Okay. So thanks for the question, Marc. So China continues to perform well, even in the face of some anticipated cost pressures. We continue to see some strong volume growth overall. Our business grew around about 11% in the quarter. Hospira was a very small driver that growth, and to Ian's earlier comments, in China whilst we see significant potential from the Hospira portfolio, it will take time to realize that just given by the time of regulatory approval. Overall the franchises that are growing strongly in China include our cardiovascular business, which is really very well aligned to the increasing priorities of the Chinese government. Our anti-infective portfolio continues to perform well, and overall we're really very positive about the opportunities for our business in China. It's very well-aligned with priorities of the Chinese government, and we're working very closely with them to strengthen primary care services and management for chronic diseases, which we believe will do good things for the Chinese healthcare system and for patients, and obviously are very well-aligned with our portfolio as well. Ian C. Read: Thank you, John. Albert, Lyrica. Albert Bourla : Oh, Lyrica is doing very well. In the U.S., it was a significant growth, but also outside U.S., which had the growth this quarter. And it is a mixture. It's a mix of both volume \u2013 volume is growing \u2013 and pricing. And internationally it's mainly volume. Ian C. Read: I think the pricing in the U.S. reflects the value of the product to the patients and to the healthcare system. Data on immuno-oncology. Albert Bourla : Yeah, I'll say a few words on data readouts in oncology overall. We have readouts for non-small lung cancer, (55:16) patients with dacomitinib. We have a readout \u2013 that's a Phase 3 study. We have a readout also for Bosulif in first-line female. Again a Phase 3 study. And in the early pipeline we'll continue to update you as the data evolve on our I-O portfolio. (55:40) that was shared at ASCO for (55:42) avelumab. (55:43) avelumab likely to come at select conferences late this year and early next year. I should also mention that in our portfolio of targeted cancer drugs, we will share at the later quarter this year encouraging data with several compounds : glasdegib, also known earlier as SMO, in AML; PTK7 ADC ovarian cancer; lorlatinib for ALK-positive lung cancer; and our 7775 ED4 mutant drug for resistant lung cancer will also be shared. So it's quite a nice, rich data flow in both I-O and targeted cancer drugs over the period to come. Charles E. Triano: Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets. Alex Arfaei : Good morning, folks, and thank you for taking the questions. Ian, obviously 4% operational revenue growth for a company of your size is good. But as you step back and look at your Innovative segment, it is quite concentrated on Prevnar, the trajectory of which is uncertain, as illustrated this quarter. And it's also quite dependent on Ibrance and Xeljanz for growth, both of which have significant competition coming. And finally you've got these patent expressions between 2020 and 2023. So how do you think about the growth prospects of the Innovative segment, since that's clearly where you get most of your valuation? And could you comment on the need for business development there? And a couple quick follow-ups if I may. Sorry if I missed this, but what was Prevnar adult sales by region, if possible? And how should we think about Chantix's new growth trajectory? Thank you. Ian C. Read: Yeah, thank you, Alex. Look, on the Innovative business, I think it's in a very strong position right now. If you look at the underlying growth of Ibrance and Xeljanz and Chantix and Lyrica, clearly the business is functioning both well internationally and in the U.S., so I think there are strong short-term drivers. I do understand, as we've signaled to you, that Prevnar is likely not to be a growth contributor in 2017 and 2018. But on the other hand while we'll see a reduction in adult sales in the U.S., we'll begin to see a pickup of adult sales internationally, and we'll look to explore adult sales in the audience from 18 to 55 in the U.S. as well. So I think you'll see very strong growth drivers in most of our major products in the Innovative area with slower growth or flattish probably in Prevnar. And then I think you look to the \u2013 while we do have LOEs later on in the decade, we then begin to see the result of all of our investment in innovation. We began to see the launch of tanezumab. We see the launch of PCSK9, or you see the launch of ertugliflozin, which we believe is a best-in-class molecule and coming into a revitalized positioning in the marketplace. We see our vaccine products coming forward, with C. difficile or perhaps later Staph aureus. So I think we see our whole I-O portfolio coming through very strongly, and there I too believe that while table stakes is the PD-1, what is really going to differentiate the companies is the ability to play in spaces from, what we would call, cold tumors, which don't react to the PD-L1s. And you then need to get in there with biospecifics or vaccines where we're very strong, or where you need to go beyond the PD-L1 and you need to add triplets and doublets. We have nine products in immuno-oncology. So I think we're going to be positioned as a company that can give you the backbone of the PD-L1 and, in the same package, can give you doublets and triplets and traditional therapy. And I believe this is the key to really unlocking the value of immuno-oncology, is this offerings of capturing patients rather than capturing individual treatment arms. So I'm excited about both our near-term and long-term opportunities. Thank you. Albert Bourla : The revenues for adults and the question on Chantix, maybe I can take. The adult revenues this quarter were $320 million, and by region that was $276 million in the U.S., but as we said declined 37%, and $45 million internationally, but increased 41%, and that trend will continue and will increase. On Chantix, Chantix revenues were up 24% operationally, and that was driven by the U.S. (1:00:53) compared to other. And the evolving safety profile, based upon the EAGLES and real-world data. Apparently, EAGLES data is very important. Right? So let me give you some insight on that. The trial was the largest clinical trial of approved smoking cessation medicine. It was conducted at the request of the FDA and the EMA. The trial concluded, but the trial did not show a significant increase in the incidence of serious neuropsychiatric events with Chantix or with bupropion compared to placebo and nicotine. And in terms of efficacy, results showed that patients taking Chantix had significantly higher continuous abstinence rates than patients taking bupropion. In Europe, the Champix label has already been updated to remove the black triangle. And in the U.S., as you may be aware, the FDA has scheduled a joint advisory committee meeting that will review those data. Overall we believe that the available clinical data does not support an increased risk of serious neuropsychiatric safety events in patients attempting to quit smoking with Chantix. And obviously a black box warning is discouraging for physicians prescribe the product and for patients to take this medicine. So we are really looking forward to discussing in September with the advisory committee. Alex Arfaei : Thank you. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Albert. We'll move to the next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from John Boris from SunTrust. John T. Boris: Thanks for taking the questions. Just want to go back and revisit the taxation question, Ian. If we look at your current tax rate of 24%, our thoughts are that if you look at some of your losses of exclusivity, and if you've done really good tax planning on a lot of your assets that lose exclusivity between now and 2020, we estimate that there's approximately about $12 billion that lose exclusivity during that time period. And when you couple that with Prevnar that is above your tax rate \u2013 at least that's our assumption \u2013 isn't there an issue where we could see some creep upward on your overall effective tax rate? And just help us understand \u2013 I know you don't give a long-term projection, but again with that thinking, it would seem that with those sales accounting for about one-third of your total sales, that that might influence the tax rate or bias it upwards. Second question, since you haven't taken off the table a large acquisition, can you remind us the qualities of the AZN acquisition that you attempted? And is that something that you might consider revisiting going forward? And then the last question just has to do with Anacor. On the crisaborole asset, you've given a long-term revenue target for that asset. Are you still comfortable with that target? And by what year could you hit that target? Thanks. Ian C. Read: So on crisaborole, I think we're very confident of the \u2013 assuming approval \u2013 of our forecast we put out there. We think it's a unique product. Clearly, you need a ramp-up of \u2013 normally you hit peak sales in about fifth year out. Maybe it's faster with this product given the unmet medical need. But I don't think we've given evidence on that or given information out on that. Albert, do you have any update on that? Albert Bourla : No, you said it very well. We do believe what we said, but we continue, after seeing the product, that would be a $2 billion-plus opportunity and is driven by, really, the unmet medical need. Today patients suffering from this condition have limited treatment options, because approved therapies have limitations related to safety, including black box warnings. And crisaborole's known mechanism of action, already used systemically in other agents, has the potential to have a very favorable safety profile, which is particularly important in pediatric populations, which is a very big part of the overall atopic dermatitis population. Ian C. Read: So we're confident of our preliminary projections, and we expect earlier than the normal fifth-year peak sales, given the unmet medical need in the marketplace. You know, the attraction of AZ was threefold. It was around revenue and pipeline, especially their immune-oncology assets, which are now not as relevant to us given our deal with Merck. It was around operational expense savings, and it was around financial or ability to deploy our capital globally in a tax-efficient manner. You know, I really can't comment on any appetite around any specific company. So we remain interested in doing business development deals that would achieve some similar results, i.e., getting pipeline that's got growth that fills in our pipeline, operational synergy savings and potentially tax savings. Those still remain attractive to us. Charles E. Triano: Next question? Ian C. Read: And Frank on the tax rate. Frank A. D'Amelio: Yeah, so, John, the way to think about this is in 2009 our tax rate was 30%. We've given guidance this year with a tax rate at 24%. We've actually taken that tax rate down give or take about 1% a year since 2009. I think we've clearly established a really good rhythm \u2013 and by the way we did that during a period of very large LOEs. Now obviously, going forward we'll provide guidance on the 2017 tax rate on our fourth quarter earnings call when we close out 2016 and give guidance for 2017. But please know, obviously we do lots of tax planning. We understand what's coming at us for the next few years, and our objective is continue to have that tax rate be as effective and as efficient as possible. Ian C. Read: Thank you. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Frank. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question is from Manoj Garg from Healthco. Manoj K. Garg: Great. Thank you. I have two commercial questions and one capital allocation question for Frank. On the commercial front for Xeljanz \u2013 we noticed that it came off of Express Scripts' excluded list for 2017. Can you comment on any other notable changes for 2017? On Ibrance, are you proactively taking any measures there with contracting to ensure a leadership position when additional competitors \u2013 or if and when they do emerge? And then I'll follow up with my question for Frank. Ian C. Read: Okay. On the commercial situation, we continue to improve our access and our tiering on Xeljanz and on Ibrance. We think we're in a very strong position. We offer very good value equation to patients in managed care, and we'll continue to monitor that as and when competition comes through. And your question on the - Charles E. Triano: Xeljanz? Ian C. Read: No. On the capital allocation? Yeah, can you repeat the last question you had? Albert Bourla : I think was on Ibrance, yes. Ian C. Read: We're okay on that. Let's just go to the third question you wanted to propose to Frank? No? I'll come back. Frank A. D'Amelio: Sorry, we'll get you off-line. Charles E. Triano: We'll get him off-line. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. David R. Risinger: Yeah, thanks very much. I have one question for Frank and one for John. Frank, could you just talk about the stand-up costs preparing for separation that have been reflected in recent non-GAAP operating profit results? So, more specifically, I don't know if you have the numbers, but possibly the first half spending that was in your non-GAAP income statement in the first half of 2016. And then for John, with respect to your internal Pfizer-developed Remicade biosimilar program, could you please just update us on that and your plans for that going forward? And actually before I finish, going back to Frank, should we assume that whatever the stand-up costs or potential separation costs that are being run through the income statement this year will continue going forward? Since Ian had mentioned that even if you decide not to split at the end of this year, you plan to retain that optionality. Thank you. Ian C. Read: Frank. Frank A. D'Amelio: So on the optionality costs, Dave, those costs are all in GAAP results. They're not in adjusted results, so what you've referred to as non-GAAP. Let me run the numbers. For this quarter, it was about $60 million; year to date, it's about $110 million. Since inception of the projects \u2013 and that goes back a couple years \u2013 $600 million. And one key point here is, the way we program the work and therefore the resulting spending is approximately two-thirds of the spend would take place after we make a decision. So we've programmed it to try to preserve as much capital as we can while giving ourselves the ability to implement optionality if we decided to do so, within that 12-month period following the decision. And in terms of the sunk costs, that would obviously \u2013 that work is completed. And if we were to make a decision soon or sometime in the future, that work remains completed. We don't basically lose any of the work that we've completed to date. Ian C. Read: Yeah, and ongoing costs to maintain the reporting we have are not - Douglas M. Lankler: De minimis. Frank A. D'Amelio: De minimis. Charles E. Triano: De minimis. Ian C. Read: John. John Young : Thanks, David, for the question on our internal infliximab program. So just as a reminder, we outlicensed that as part of our agreement with the EMA when we acquired Hospira to Novartis/Sandoz. We retained the commercial rights for a number of territories, including the U.S. and certain other markets. That program is progressing on track. We expect to have the readout from our pivotal Phase 3 trials from that program towards the end of this year. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, John. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question is from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink. Seamus Fernandez : Oh, thanks for the question. So just a couple of quick ones. As we think about the Anacor acquisitions, you guys made an unusual move and seemingly a timely one given the increase in valuations in the biotech market. Ian, can you just kind of comment that on the valuations in the biotech space as you see them today? Do you see opportunities despite the increased valuation? Or do you think that enthusiasm here is starting to build in too high expectations? And as a follow-up to that, can you guys comment a little bit on the strategy with crisaborole? Obviously, it fits well with your pediatric sales force, but this is also an entry into the dermatology market to some degree, where you certainly are present with Enbrel internationally but don't really have a presence in the dermatology market in the U.S. Just wondering if there's a broader interest in the derm space, particularly medical derm, where when we hear from dermatologists, there is a significant vacuum in innovation. And then the second question, just biosimilars in general. We heard from Sandoz in June that pricing is coming in quite a bit below where they had modeled the market, but penetration is also coming in higher. Can you guys talk a little bit about \u2013 John, maybe you can talk a little bit about how the biosimilar market is evolving and how the uptake of Inflectra might be different from competition that you might see to Enbrel or how you might compete for pharmacy-delivered injectable products. Thanks. Ian C. Read: Hey, Seamus. On the valuations, I think that if you go back six or seven months, they were \u2013 I think we said that we thought they were frothy on biotech. They came down and are beginning to build back up again. It all depends on each individual company. What's the product? What's the opportunity? What are you willing to pay? What can you add to it? I don't know if you can generalize on valuations across different products. But thank you for the question. On the crisaborole? Albert Bourla : Yes. First of all, you're absolutely right that derm is a very important area for immunology, we have rheumatology, dermatology, and GI, and derm was what we were missing, and now we're getting with crisaborole. We are building derm capability as we speak, (1:14:35) capabilities. Anacor had already started building them and to continue very rapidly scaling them up, and we are going to use our own primary care footprint because a big part of crisaborole sales will be primary care, and of course our pediatric footprint. Ian C. Read: John. Thank you, Albert. John Young : Okay. Thanks for the question, Seamus. So exactly as you say, we believe that there's likely to be some significant variability molecule to molecule and product to product, and indeed across markets based on a variety of factors, primarily including the number of entrants, the quality and breadth of the label, as well as the individual reaction to biosimilar competition. That's pretty much what we are seeing in Europe. We've always said that we would expect price discounting to be somewhere in the 30% to 50% range. That pretty much is what we're seeing across Europe overall with some variability across molecules, and we expect similar range in the U.S. So overall, again, the market is very much behaving in line with our expectations, and we've been very positive with the rate of adoption of Inflectra that we've seen in Europe and are certainly very positive about the potential opportunity that this represents in the United States, too. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, John. Operator, can we take our last question, please? Operator : Your final question comes from David Maris from Wells Fargo. David Maris : Good morning. Two questions. First on the biosimilars and the new facility, when do you think that would be operational? And are there any trends that you're seeing in the marketplace that give you additional confidence in building this facility? And the other is on the overall pricing environment. A couple of your peers have mentioned that the pricing environment in the U.S. has more recently been difficult, and they're assuming increased price pressure in the U.S., including increased rebating and discounting. Are you seeing that? And how do you look at that going in the next year or so? Thank you. Ian C. Read: I'll do the pricing, and then ask John to answer on the biosimilar in China. I think pricing has been competitive and difficult for many years now. Managed care is organized, the market is competitive, the product has to have value add to get access. I think Ibrance is an example of a product that has got access. I don't perceive that in our therapies with the products we have that the pricing has become more difficult in the last year than previously. Is there political rhetoric that you would expect around the political season on pricing? Absolutely. Have there been some bad actors which have made it more difficult for the industry to get its message across? There have been. But I still believe that this society and the opinion leaders believe in an innovative industry and understand that a high-risk industry needs to have an ability to recuperate its capital and attracting capital, and so I think that overall we'll continue in a competitive pricing environment, which is appropriate for society. So with that I'll ask John to talk about biosimilars. John Young : So thanks for the question, David. So let me just make comment first of all about the penetration of biologic medicines generally into China, which is low vis-\u00e0-vis most benchmarks internationally. And so we believe that post the expiry of any relevant patents in China, a biosimilar is a significant opportunity. Obviously we are committed to bringing high-quality products to market, and so we're very excited with the investment that we announced in Hangzhou Economic Development Area to invest $350 million in what will be a state-of-the-art global biotechnology center. That center is expected to be completed in 2018, and we'll be working with the CFD and relevant Chinese authorities to bring products, biosimilar molecules coming out of that facility, to the Chinese market as soon as possible following the completion of the plant. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, John, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. Ian C. Read: Thank you. Frank A. D'Amelio: Thank you.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to Pfizer's third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Charles E. Triano: Thank you operator. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today to review Pfizer's third quarter 2016 performance. As usual, I'm joined today by our Chairman and CEO Ian Read; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Albert Bourla, Group President of Pfizer Innovative Health; John Young, Group President of Pfizer Essential Health; and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel. Slides that will be presented on the call can be viewed at our home page, Pfizer.com, by clicking on the link for Pfizer Quarterly Corporate Performance \u2013 Third Quarter 2016, and this is located in the For Investors section in the lower right-hand corner of the page. Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussion during the call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information regarding these factors is discussed under the disclosure notice section in the earnings press release we issued this morning, as well as in Pfizer's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, notably including part 1, item 1A, Risk Factors. And this is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available at their website, as well as the Pfizer website. Forward-looking statements during this conference call speak only as of the original date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements. Discussions during the call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's current report on Form 8-K, dated today, November 1, 2016. You may also obtain a copy of the Form 8-K at our website, Pfizer.com/investors. Also, any non-GAAP measures presented are not and should not be viewed as substitutes for financial measures required by U.S. GAAP. They have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to the calculations of similar measures at other companies. We will now make prepared remarks, and then we will move to a question and answer session. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian? Ian C. Read: Thank you, Chuck, and thank you for joining our call this morning. During my remarks this morning, I will briefly recap the highlights from the quarter and provide some comments on the strength and depth of our pipeline. Starting with the quarter, we reported another quarter of solid operational revenue growth, marking our eighth consecutive quarter of operational growth. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange and legacy Hospira operations, Pfizer's standalone revenues grew by 3% operationally. Looking at each of our businesses, Pfizer's Innovative Health achieved another quarter of strong revenue growth due to the performance of key brands, including Eliquis globally; Xeljanz, Lyrica, Chantix and Ibrance primarily in the U.S. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of Ibrance. Since our U.S. launch in February 2015, it remains the market leader for the treatment of first-line HR+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer. As expected, we are starting to see a tempering in new market share growth. However, our total scripts continue to grow, and we are focused on reaching additional metastatic patients currently receiving chemotherapy or hormone replacement therapy \u2013 sorry, hormone therapy alone. We also anticipate publication of our phase 3 PALOMA-2 study will occur by year-end and expect that the ability of our dedicated breast cancer field force to then detail on the strength of this data, which should allow us to achieve greater penetration into the right adopting physicians, many of whom are potentially high prescribers for Ibrance. A key milestone to grow the Ibrance franchise will be secure approval in the EU, where we have filed and received a positive opinion from the CHMP in September. We expect a decision from the commission later this year. Also of note, both Eliquis and Xeljanz continue to generate attractive growth on a quarter-over-quarter basis, and Chantix in the U.S. is benefiting from the publication earlier this year of the EAGLES study. Prevnar 13, sequentially we saw an increase this quarter in the adult indication as flu season approaches, and overall the Prevnar family continues to perform in line with our expectations. Turning to the Pfizer Essential Health business, it achieved operational revenue growth, primarily due to the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations and to a lesser extent from the Essential Health standalone sterile injectables portfolio. Excluding legacy Hospira, we experienced a slight operational revenue decline on a year-to-date basis. However, we remain confident that the Essential Health portfolio has the potential to pivot to achieve modest sustainable growth. We expect this shift to be driven by a combination of anticipated growth across the portfolio, including sterile injectables, anti-infectives, biosimilars, and emerging markets. Collectively, they may provide an offset to our Peri-LOE and legacy products portfolio, which by their nature are robust contributors to cash flow generation, given their multisource general decline in developing markets. As part of the Essential Health growth strategy, we anticipate continuing to refine the portfolio with business development activities, such as the pending acquisition of AstraZeneca's late-stage small-molecule anti-infectives business, and our recent agreement to sell the Infusion Systems units to ICU Medical. All in all, the PIH and PH business are performing well and have been further strengthened by the approximately $40 billion of acquisitions we've done over the past year. This has enhanced our near-term growth potential by expanding our footprint in the highest-growth therapeutic areas including biosimilars, sterile injectables with Hospira, medical rheumatology with Anacor, oncology with Medivation, as well as several smaller deals. These additions to our portfolio are bolstering near-term revenue generation opportunities as our pipeline continues to mature and advance. Turning to our pipeline, we remain confident that we have built a solid pipeline targeted in areas that have potential to have a meaningful clinical value for patients and will provide the largest return on investment for shareholders. Of particular note is our Oncology pipeline. For Ibrance, we have more than 60 research programs in breast and non-breast cancers, including squamous cell and neck cancer, metastatic pancreatic cancer, and mantle cell lymphoma. For Xtandi, the FDA approved the label update on October 20 to include important data from the first comparative trial that demonstrated the safety and efficacy of Xtandi compared to bicalutamide. We believe these data will help physicians better understand the difference between Xtandi and bicalutamide for their patients living with metastatic CRPC \u2013 that's castration-resistant prostate cancer. Similar to Ibrance, we hope to generate new data to drive increased utilization early in the treatment paradigm for prostate cancer. For immuno-oncology, we continue to execute our planned I-O strategy of 10 compounds in the clinic and 30 programs ongoing. Together with our partner Merck KGaA, we're on track to file avelumab for treatment of metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma by the end of this year in the U.S., and we just announced the European Medicines Agency validated for review our market authorization application in the EU. Over 3,000 patients have now been enrolled in ongoing avelumab studies. We have studies evaluating avelumab as monotherapy and are completing recruitments in second-line non-small-cell lung cancer and other small genotypes. However, we believe that doublets and triplets \u2013 that is, the combination of avelumab with other bio \u2013 drugs or with chemotherapy \u2013 are the areas of greatest potential for patients. And we are making targeted investments in support of developing clinical data to potentially advance these combinations. We've initiated avelumab combination studies with chemotherapy from targeted therapies and expect to see updated data next year on Inlyta plus avelumab in first-line renal cell carcinoma and rituximab plus 4-1BB in follicular lymphoma. We also anticipate data on avelumab plus 4-1BB next year. In addition to avelumab, for the remainder of the year we have studies underway with other agents in our portfolio, including OX40 as a single agent and in combination with 4-1BB and avelumab in various tumor types. PTK7, an ADC, is showing encouraging activity in ovarian cancer in phase 1b, and combination studies with avelumab will commence in 2017. Our IDO1 inhibitor is also in phase 1, and we expect combination studies to start in 2017. Our clinical allogeneic CAR-T cell program with Cellectis and Servier is on track, with recruitment in the UK ongoing. In Inflammation & Immunology, through our Anacor acquisition, we have added crisaborole to our pipeline for the treatment of mild to moderate dermatitis. It is currently under review by the FDA with a January of 2017 PDUFA date. If approved, crisaborole has the potential to be an important first-line treatment for the 18 million patients in the U.S. who suffer from this significant unmet medical need. We're also exploring filing crisaborole outside of the U.S. We continue to see strong potential to expand the label of indiscernible] (10:48) Xeljanz in diseases beyond RA, such as UC and psoriatic arthritis. We're excited about our next generation of selective JAK inhibitors currently in development. In CV/Met in September we reported positive phase 3 data for ertugliflozin in partnership with Merkel and are on track to submit new drug applications to the FDA for ertugliflozin in two fixed-dose combinations, ertugliflozin plus Januvia, and ertugliflozin plus metformin, by the end of 2016. As you saw today, we announced the discontinuation of the clinical development program for bococizumab. While these decisions are always difficult, we make these assessments in the best interest of patients and our shareholders and within the context of both the data defining the potential profile of the drug, as well as our view of the treatment and market landscape for the drug. The discontinuation decision was made based on the totality of information available to us across two key areas. The first is the emerging clinical profile from our six completed phase 3 lipid-lowering studies. Specifically, with longer-term efficacy data now in hand, including from two recently completed 52-week studies for which top-line results were announced today, we have seen an unanticipated attenuation of LDL cholesterol lowering over time. Additionally, we have observed an unanticipated higher-level of immunogenicity and injection site reactions with bococizumab as compared to other agents in the class. The second is the evolving treatment and market landscape of lipid-lowering agents in the PCSK9 class. In this market, a treatment's ability to impact CV outcomes is a significant value driver, which requires long-term efficacy and durability of a cholesterol lowerer. And we have also recently seen payers establish access restrictions to the class, which has meaningfully dampened our initial expectations for the market potential. Taken together, the totality of the emerging clinical profile and the treatment and market landscape, led us to the conclusion that bococizumab was no longer likely to provide value to patients, physicians, or shareholders. And as a result, we determined the appropriate decision was to discontinue the development program. In Rare Diseases, the acquisition of Bamboo Therapeutics complements our rare disease portfolio and enhances our leadership position in gene therapy. And with our partner SPARK, we are seeing data from the first seven patients being treated in our ongoing phase 1/2 trial, which is promising so far and has the potential to be a one-time therapy for the treatment of hemophilia B. In the Vaccines, we continue to advance Staph aureus and Clostridium difficile programs which are both currently in phase 2. We anticipate a C. difficile phase 2 readout before the year-end. And assuming it achieves its primary endpoint, we anticipate a potential phase 3 start in the first half of 2017. And in Biosimilars we remain confident that we will be well-positioned in the emerging biosimilars market with our broad pipeline. We recently announced that we will begin shipment of Inflectra to wholesalers in the U.S. in late November. As you can see, we expect to have several key pipeline milestones between now and the end of 2017 across several therapeutic areas. To summarize, the remainder of this year we anticipate potential EU decisions for Ibrance, avelumab filing in the U.S. in Merkel cell carcinoma, ertugliflozin filing in the U.S., and C. difficile proof-of-concept readout. In 2017, we anticipate potential U.S. decision for avelumab in Merkel cell carcinoma, potential lorlatinib submission in non-small-cell lung cancer, potential EU decision for Xeljanz in RA, potential U.S. filing in the first half of 2017 for label extension for Xeljanz in UC and psoriatic arthritis, and potential crisaborole decision in the U.S. In addition, between now and the end of 2017, we expect up to 12 pivotal studies with top-line readouts, with seven from Oncology, including the first I-O combination data readouts of avelumab, one from Rare Disease, and four from Biosimilars. Over the past five years, we have worked to shape the quality of the assets in our pipeline. I believe we have a mix of competitive assets that are positioned to deliver new therapy breakthroughs for patients over the next few years. Similarly, over the past few years, each of our businesses have gained a sharper focus, increased accountability, and a greater ability to capture the opportunities within their unique markets. Today, they have the independence and resources, as standalones and within Pfizer, to effectively compete in their markets while having the benefit of the operational strength and financial flexibility associated with being part of Pfizer. For example, we are now managing our Innovative Health business as five therapeutics-focused integrated businesses plus Consumer Health. We think of them as five small biotech companies, each concentrated on targeted areas of science and relevant patient groups and having a clear focus on delivering value to patients and return to shareholders. In conclusion, our business is performing well. We have taken steps to position Innovative Health and Essential Health for long-term success through competitive portfolios, pipeline investments in key growth areas that address the unmet needs of patients, and thirdly the financial strength to continue to invest in the growth drivers that will enable both businesses to be leaders in their markets. Now I'll turn it over to Frank, who will go into greater detail on results for the quarter. Frank A. D'Amelio: Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast. As a reminder, because we completed the acquisition of Hospira on September 3, 2015, Pfizer's financial results for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2016 include Hospira global operations, while the comparable prior-year periods include only one month of legacy Hospira U.S. and do not include financial results from legacy Hospira international operations. In addition, Pfizer completed the acquisition of Anacor Pharmaceuticals on June 24, 2016. Consequently, our financial results for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2016 include three months of legacy Anacor operations, which were immaterial. Finally, Pfizer completed its acquisition of Medivation on September 28, 2016, so financial results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 reflect three business days of legacy Medivation operations, which were also immaterial. Now moving on to the financials. Third quarter revenues were approximately $13 billion and reflect year-over-year operational growth of $1.2 billion or 10%, which was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $224 million or 2%. Legacy Hospira operations contributed $1.1 billion to Pfizer's third quarter revenues and our Essential Health business. If you exclude foreign exchange and the contribution from legacy Hospira operations, Pfizer's standalone revenues grew operationally by $381 million or 3%. Innovative Health operational revenue growth was 10%, driven by the strong performance of Ibrance in the U.S.; Eliquis globally; and Xeljanz, Lyrica, and Chantix, all primarily in the U.S., which were partially offset by the loss of Rebif alliance revenue versus the year-ago quarter due to the expiration at year-end 2015 of the agreement to co-promote Rebif in the U.S., lower Enbrel revenues in most developed U.S. markets due to biosimilar competition, and expected lower revenues from Prevnar 13 adult in the U.S. due to the high initial capture rate after its launch in the fourth quarter of 2014, resulting in a smaller catch-up opportunity versus the year-ago quarter. Essential Health operational revenue growth was also 10%, driven by the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations and to lesser extent from Pfizer's standalone sterile injectables, both of which were partially offset by the loss of exclusivity and the associated generic competition primarily for Lyrica and Zyvox in most developed Europe markets. Pfizer's standalone revenue in the Essential Health business, which excludes the contribution of legacy Hospira operations, declined 5% operationally as a result of a 7% operational increase in the standalone sterile injectables portfolio, which was more than offset by a 15% operational decrease in the Peri-LOE products portfolio and the 4% operational decline from the Essential Health standalone legacy established products portfolio. It's important to note that in emerging markets Pfizer's overall Essential Health revenues grew 9% operationally, due primarily to the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations and Pfizer's standalone sterile injectables portfolio and standalone legacy established products portfolio. Third-quarter reported diluted EPS was $0.21 compared with $0.34 in the year-ago quarter, due to a charge related to the pending sale of Hospira Infusion Systems, increased operating expenses, product losses of exclusivity, and foreign exchange impacts, including the Venezuelan bolivar, all of which were partially offset by revenue growth from certain new, in-line, and acquired products and lower asset impairment charges and lower acquisition-related costs. Adjusted diluted EPS for the third quarter was $0.61 versus $0.60 in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to increased revenues, a lower effective tax rate, and fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which declined by 105 million shares versus the year-ago quarter due to our share repurchase program, all of which were partially offset by an aggregate operational increase in adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses, and adjusted R&D expenses of approximately $1.1 billion or 16% which includes the addition of Hospira operations in 2016, a $0.04 negative impact due to foreign exchange, and continuing product losses of exclusivity. I want to point out that third quarter adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased year over year from 17.4% to 22.7%, primarily due to foreign exchange and the addition of legacy Hospira operations. Also, because foreign exchange increased cost of sales while decreasing revenues at the same time, which is atypical, there was an exaggerated increase of our adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues in the third quarter. If you exclude the foreign exchange impact, third quarter adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue would have been 20.9%. Although we have experienced this for two consecutive quarters, we continue to view this as an anomaly rather than a trend, and we have narrowed our 2016 adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue guidance within its original range. Foreign exchange negatively impacted third quarter revenues by approximately $224 million or 2%, of which approximately $175 million was attributable to Venezuela. While FX favorably impacted adjusted SI&A and R&D expenses, the previously mentioned significant negative impact on adjusted cost of sales drove the overall FX impact of $115 million or 2% of our total adjusted cost. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted third quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.04 compared with the year-ago quarter, with approximately $0.015 related to Venezuela. As you can see on the chart, we've narrowed the ranges for certain components of 2016 financial guidance. We increased the low end of our revenue guidance range, and we now expect 2016 revenues to be in the range of $52 billion to $53 billion. I want to point out that this range continues to absorb an anticipated $1.8 billion negative impact from product losses of exclusivity and an anticipated $1.4 billion negative impact from foreign exchange versus 2015, of which almost $850 million is attributable to Venezuela. I also want to remind everyone that, as we previously communicated, there are seven fewer selling days in the fourth quarter of 2016 versus the fourth quarter of 2015. This will impact only the quarterly year-over-year comparisons, given that there are essentially the same number of selling days in 2016 as there were in 2015. Because of our decision to discontinue the global clinical development program for boco, we now expect adjusted R&D expenses to be in the range of $7.8 billion to $8.1 billion and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.38 to $2.43, which is still within our original range of $2.38 to $2.48. It's important to note that the midpoint of our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range was negatively impacted solely to reflect this decision. Excluding this boco decision, the midpoint of the range would have increased by $0.02. Moving on to key takeaways, we achieved our eighth consecutive quarter of operational revenue growth. In the third quarter of 2016, growth was driven by the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations, new products that are early in their life cycles such as Ibrance, Eliquis, and Xeljanz, as well as the solid performance from Lyrica and Chantix. We narrowed the ranges for certain components of our 2016 financial guidance. We announced and completed the acquisition of Medivation and accomplished several key product and pipeline milestones, and we returned $10.5 billion to shareholders through the first nine months of 2016 through dividends and share repurchases, including the $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2016 and beyond. Now I'll turn it back to Chuck. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Frank and Ian. And at this point, operator, can we please poll for questions? Operator : Your first question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank. Gregg Gilbert : Yes, I'd start perhaps for John \u2013 a two-parter for John. First on biosimilar Remicade, how would you set expectations on the launch in light of rebates and aggressive contracting by J&J? And any legal risk that you see that remains for Pfizer? And separately, on the SIP business, which was very strong in the quarter, were there any temporary factors there that helped that? And then for Ian, following your decision to, for now, not split the company up, can you speak to your comments in the release that you will now move forward with focus on strategic priorities to grow and increase operational efficiency to be more competitive? And sort of what that means? Thanks. John Young : Okay. Thanks for the question, Gregg. So let me take the launch of Inflectra, first of all. We obviously are very excited, very positive, about the opportunities that we have, and that's based on the positive uptake that we've seen in the markets where we've already launched Inflectra. In fact, where biosimilars have launched, we've already seen around about a 26% volume share of branded Remicade switch to biosimilars of infliximab, and so we believe that actually the marketplace on a global basis is really beginning to become more comfortable with the introduction of biosimilars. And so in the United States we obviously are very positive about the opportunities that that represents, and we look forward, as we've already announced, to introducing INFLECTRA towards the end of this year. In relation to sterile injectables, obviously as you know we're very focused on the combination of the legacy Hospira sterile injectable portfolio along with the branded legacy Pfizer portfolio. The strong performance that we've seen in the sterile injectable business this quarter really is a reflection of the combination of the strengths of both of those portfolios together, both the legacy branded Pfizer portfolio, as well as the legacy generic Hospira sterile injectable portfolio. And I think we're seeing at a customer level that the combination of that much broader offerings to customers really provides us with the breadth of portfolio that our customers value and provides us with a strong operational offering to customers right across the world. So we're very positive about that opportunity and how the business is performing. Thanks for the question, Gregg. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Gregg. To your second question, my comment there really reflects that through this process we've now established two very strong teams in both businesses. We've established metrics and comparatives, and these teams are focused on producing strategies that indicate or ensure they're competitive within their comparison group and focused on generating the returns that shareholders require. Thank you. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Ian. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from David Maris from Wells Fargo. David Maris : Good morning, Ian. Perhaps you could talk a little bit about pricing in the U.S., specifically on Proposition 61? Most recent polling seems to show that if it were held today, it would pass. The industry's fighting it. Can you describe what you think the impact would be on innovation and pricing? What the difference between what \u2013 state agency pay versus the VA pay for Pfizer drugs? And then, separately, we've spoken a little bit about this, but some have pointed to the supply chain, specifically PBMs, as being part of the problem in lack of transparency. Do you agree? And do you think if the U.S. is willing to discuss price controls it should be willing to discuss PBM rebate controls? Thank you. Ian C. Read: So let me take that. This is going to take a little bit longer given the extent of your questions on this. Let's just deal in general with the pricing situation, and then we'll come back to the - Charles E. Triano: The PBMs. Ian C. Read: \u2013 the Prop 61. So look, obviously drug pricing affordability is an issue that is concerning to us and has clearly been amplified in this election cycle. There is considerable uncertainty and turmoil about both candidates' positions on these issues, and it's difficult to decipher between campaign rhetoric and legitimate policy views. It's been disappointing that this debate on pricing has completely neglected the other side of the ledger; that is the benefits and value added by the pharmaceutical industry. So while we understand the healthcare costs have been increasing for many patients, we disagree with the prevailing notion among some politicians that pharmaceuticals are the reason for these rising costs. And we believe that post the election cycle, good public policy will prevail. So currently in the U.S., just to use a comparator, we spend 17% of our GDP on healthcare, yet we only spend 2% on drugs. About 12% of GDP was spent on inpatient and outpatient services. When we compare that to the OECD countries who spend approximately 9% of GDP on healthcare, they spend 1.5% of GDP on drugs and only 5.5% of GDP on medical services. Over a half a point of GDP extra on drugs between OECD and the United States, you get a vibrant, research-based industry that is producing roughly $1.3 trillion of value to GDP. I think policymakers are well aware of the importance of maintaining an innovative pharmaceutical business. Further, if you look at cost increases in the U.S. from 2004 to 2014, hospital service costs have increased 75%, while prescription drug costs have increased 35%. While faster than the CPI, they are lagging the overall medical costs of around 40% growth. I think what's exacerbated the cost problem for patients is their insurance plans on average cover a much lower share, 83% actually of prescription drug costs, compared to the cost of medical services, where they cover 96%. So we're seeing insurance companies are making a choice as to subsidizing health services more than drugs. You see this in their actions taken, by increasing co-pays and shifting drugs into the overall deductible, which has pushed the issue with patients on affordability, but it's certainly not due to price increases, because in 2016, the branded pharmaceutical industry took about a 2.8% on average net price increase. I think the market is reacting to the fact that in the pharmaceutical business, there are two markets. There's a market of branded, patented-protected products, which increased prices in 2015 2.8, then a market of difficult-to-make generics, or generic that are exclusive, where we've seen certain actors take what society believes is unreasonable price increases. So I think we can have better solutions if we look to how do we fix the policy issues and the regulatory issues that allow single suppliers, single-source suppliers, and ease the pathway of the generics. Regardless of the election results, I'm not really concerned \u2013 well, no matter the outcome of the presidential and congressional races, we will continue to work with public officials. That being said, let's talk to the rebate issue. Look, I think the rebates have served an important contribution to allowing negotiations on volume-related transactions. I think they're now becoming less helpful in getting cost-effective solutions to patients. In reality, if we could find some way \u2013 and I think it would need a legislative fix \u2013 if we could find some way of ensuring that the pharmaceutical industry has an ability to moderate price according to volumes sold to the constant customers without rebates, I think that would be the best interest of patients. Now coming to the issue on Prop 61, if we voted today on the facts of the case and the merits of the proposition, it would be rejected by the California voters. We don't see any particular overall benefit in healthcare costs for California. However, we are in a highly politicized arena. It's difficult to say exactly what will happen on this proposition, but once we know the results, the industry will then formulate its public policy responses. I would like to say that what Prop 61 is asking for is basically untenable. It's asking for an industry that has given non-commercial prices to the veterans for a very good reason \u2013 they are a special part of our society, and we've given non-commercial prices to that part of society, to take that and extend it to the rest of government is not a workable economic model. So Prop 61, between its voting and its implementation in six months, I would expect to see a lot of public policy discussions between that time and its implementation. Sorry for the length of that answer. Charles E. Triano: Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Geoff Meacham : Morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just had a couple. On the bococizumab discontinuation, obviously this could have been a large commercial investment, which now you'll save. Ian, can you put this in the context of Pfizer's strategy in primary care? And what influence, if any, would this have on your appetite for bolt-on type of deals? And then, on the pipeline for Xtandi, now that you guys have TERRAIN formally in the label, how much of a tipping point do you think this could be for urologist adoption? I'm just thinking about the bigger M0 population as you move upstream? Thanks, guys. Ian C. Read: Thanks, Geoff. Look, on the bococizumab, I don't initially have \u2013 it doesn't have that dramatic implications. Its contribution to our EPS was modeled by most analysts as being moderate in the outer years. So, per se, it's not an issue that creates a sudden need to change strategies. It certainly does indicate that we need to continue to make our decisions on portfolio based on what we believe will generate return, and we need to look at the substrate we had in cardiovascular to review \u2013 to see how we strengthen our cardiovascular presence with more substrate. I'll pass it over to - Charles E. Triano: Xtandi. Ian C. Read: \u2013 Albert to do the Xtandi. Thank you. Albert Bourla : Yes, thank you, Geoff, for the question. And for Xtandi going forward, we believe there will be continued momentum in the oncology segment. But importantly, as you asked, we believe there is a large untapped opportunity within the urology segment, which we believe will be capitalized by the TERRAIN label update. Just some facts : In Q3, 26% of Xtandi units were prescribed by urologists, up from 20% historically. Right now, we have approximately 2,000 urologists prescribing the program. And recent market research suggests that 80% of urologists are highly compelled to prescribe Xtandi after seeing the TERRAIN data. So I think TERRAIN data publication and the inclusion in the label will be an important catalyst for Xtandi. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Albert. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin : Thank you. I have a couple questions. First, Ian, just on your decision to discontinue your PCSK9, it sounds to me like the only thing that has really changed is the emerging profile of your specific drug. The evolving landscape hasn't evolved yet, because we don't yet have clinical outcomes trials, for which we are waiting. I'm just wondering if you saw something with your outcomes trials that you can share with us, and any additional details on LGL lowering and events? And then my second question is back to the pricing question. Clearly, Pfizer, along with many of your peers, have taken multiple price increases during the year; Pfizer is no exception. How do you see your ability to take price going forward? How should we think about contribution from price going forward? And also, if you could just break out what was price versus volume this quarter? Thanks very much. Ian C. Read: Okay. On the LDL, on the bococizumab, we're making decision based on the profile of our drug, not on the profiles of other drugs. And, on our profile, what we saw was that earlier on we did see we had (39:39) but we had data earlier on at 12 weeks and 24 weeks, and we saw no substantial impact on LDL lowering. In fact we continue to see a robust LDL lowering. It was only recently that we got the data on the majority of our LDL trials out at 52 weeks, and out at 52 weeks, we saw a substantial population reduction in LDL lowering, and we correlated that with neutralizing antibodies. And then we had the injection-site reaction on some of our trials. So when you look at the total profile of our drug, we don't believe that it can be commercially successful or in the benefit of patients for us to continue to bring that to market. And then on the - Charles E. Triano: Pricing. Ian C. Read: On the pricing issue, we've always priced responsibly. We've priced to the marketplace the value of our product, and on the affordability issue, we've always made provisions for patients who have no insurance or poor insurance to get our product for free or nearly free. So I don't believe that there's any reason for Pfizer to change its approach to the pricing of our products as we sit here today. Thank you. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Ian. Great, next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen. Steve Scala : Thank you; I have three. On Prevnar 13 year to date, the franchise is down modestly, in part due to the Q3 government purchases. To hit the full-year guidance of comparable to slightly down, it implies Q4 will also be slightly down. Is that how to look at it? That does seem better than the cautionary commentary that the company provided, particularly that in August. Secondly, now that Pfizer's had a chance to see Novartis's CDK 4/6 inhibitor data, how would you compare and contrast the profile to that of palbo? And then lastly, the CTLA-4 from OncoImmune is described in the press release as potentially differentiated. I'm wondering if you could elaborate on its potential differentiation. Thank you very much. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Steve. I'll ask Albert to answer the Prevnar question, and then Mikael will hand the evolving profile of competitive products and our evolving profile, and also the CTLA-4 question. Thank you. Albert Bourla : All right. Thank you, Ian. Look, the statement is exactly the same as we did it last time. We already expect the total for the year of Prevnar franchise revenues to be slightly down compared to 2015. As we said, we were down 2% operationally; that was driven primarily by the adult indication, which as expected was down approximately 26% in the U.S. Notably, the quarter sequentially grew 37% versus second quarter, because we're entering a high flu season. And in the international markets \u2013 ending the year in aggregate, excuse me \u2013 in the third quarter we were up 21%, but this was driven by the volatility we see in this case, as CDC orders were much higher in this quarter. Mikael Dolsten : Yes, we are very excited and appreciative on the Ibrance profile. It's been taken up extremely well by patients and physicians. It's viewed as an effective, really well-tolerated therapy, and has had a profile for bones and metastatic breast cancer patients that has been great. And we see the profile being very suitable for also early breast cancer and many other indications. Now, we tend to not comment on other products, and as you know, it's difficult to compare across trials, but in contrast to other products, we have not seen issues with elevated liver tests, no issues with cardiovascular or Q2C (44:00), nor issues with GI. Our products has been really well-behaving, and we think its profile works across the breast cancer segment as well as in many other indications. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Mikael. The next question please, operator. Ian C. Read: CTLA-4 question, Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : On the CTLA-4 - Ian C. Read: Differentiation. Mikael Dolsten : Yeah, so when it comes to CTLA-4, our view \u2013 referring to -? Ian C. Read: I think it's referring to potential licensing opportunity that we have. Mikael Dolsten : Ah, okay. Well, thank you for that. As you know, the CTLA-4 agents are quite powerful but have been limited by quite some systemic adverse events, and we do look at having the most comprehensive I-O combination portfolio in the industry. And, as you know, we're quite excited by some of our existing assets, like 4-1BB, as a great partner to PD-1/L1 or OX40, either one. All of these are advancing in our portfolio. We do obviously assess the CTLA-4 class, but the type of drugs we're looking at would be CTLA-4 variants that would have some best-in-class properties that would retain efficacy but attenuate the adverse event profile seen. Those are the ones we're looking at, evaluating, and that would fit with our view of immuno-oncology product to be efficacious but need to demonstrate they're well-tolerated. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Mikael. Ian C. Read: Okay. Thank you, Mikael. Charles E. Triano: Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Holford from Jefferies. Jeffrey Holford : Hi. Thanks very much for taking my questions. First of all, on Enbrel, I wonder if you could just give us a bit more color on the market dynamics there for pricing and script switching in markets where you have biosimilars. Second, on Ibrance, I guess the prescription data is beginning to suggest that in the United States at least you may have reached a duration of therapy out there in the market. I wonder if you could maybe give us a bit more color of what duration of therapy looks like in first-, second-, and third-line patients. And then, just in general, sounds like you remain pretty committed on cardiovascular as a therapeutic area. Just how and when will we see you build that out further in terms of developing pipeline assets there? Thank you. Ian C. Read: Thank you. I'm going to just take the cardiovascular one first. As we sit here today, we have good assets in cardiovascular. We think it's an important area, and we'll continue to look for ways of strengthening our position there to ensure that we can be players in cardiovascular. Of course, like all of our therapeutic areas, we review these on an annual basis and make decisions on where we want to go and how much we want to invest. And none of this will be an exception this year, when we'll once again look at our long-term strategies in all of our therapy areas. I'm going to ask Albert to answer the Enbrel and Ibrance question. But I'd just like to point out with Ibrance in the marketplace, we're very pleased with the reaction from patients and physicians for the treatment of Ibrance and its relatively benign side effect profile. Go ahead. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Ian, and thank you, Jeff, for the question. The third quarter revenues for Enbrel were down 12%, and this decline reflects the negative impact from biosimilars in Europe that will launch later in Q1. We have been preparing for biosimilar competition for quite some time, and we plan to continue to differentiate Enbrel by generating new data, by enhancing the patient experience, and of course by leveraging our expertise in inflammation. For the remainder of the year, we expect to continue modest uptake of etanercept biosimilars, but due to their limited long-term safety and efficacy data, we anticipate their use will be primarily in new patients as physicians look to gain experience with these programs. On your question on price, so far of the limited pricing we have seen to date for Benepali, the discount levels are in line with our expectations, and we expect Enbrel's pricing to be competitive. In Norway or Denmark, where Benepali won national tenders, let me say Norwegians publish the outcome of their tender, and the Benepali won the tender with a 47% discount, while Enbrel have provided a 41% discount, but it is important to note that the tender process in Norway is not indicative by any means of the pricing practices and trends typically seen in other markets across Europe. Now let me speak about Ibrance. Ibrance had a terrific launch and has quickly become the standard of care. Since launch has been prescribed by more than 8,500 physicians, reaching more than 40,000 patients. This rapid uptake is a testament to its efficacy and its outstanding safety and tolerability profile. Very low rate of Grade 3 or 4 GI side effects, such as fatigue or diarrhea. Now, as expected given this performance, we are starting to see some tempering of growth. But let me clarify that. Recent reporting changes at IMS due to some specialty pharma consolidations might be marring the reports and not showing an accurate picture. Based on our data, we continued to grow in scripts by 9% in the third quarter versus the second quarter of 2016 sequentially, which aligns with our own net sales growth of 7% quarter after quarter. Now, moving forward, our strategy with Ibrance is the following : So far growth of Ibrance has come from establishing the product to early-adopting physicians. We believe growth in the next three years in the U.S. will come from late adopters that have limited prescriptions so far. We are now moving to the second phase of our strategy in building a dedicated sales team and field-based medical organization to maximize this opportunity. In addition, the publication of our phase 3 PALOMA-2 study data, which we anticipate to occur by year-end, will be important additional data for these late-adopting physicians. Now, outside U.S., additional growth will come from our geographical expansion. As you know, Ibrance is already in the U.S. and now in 20 more countries, and we have received positive opinion from CHMP in Europe and expect registration later this year. And, last but not least, in the midterm, the growth will come from the many studies currently running to move to earlier lines of breast cancer. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Albert. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Albert. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from John Scotti from Evercore ISI. John Scotti : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe initially for Ian, so I wanted to ask a corporate strategy question. Just \u2013 I wanted to get your sense on appetite potentially for other actions, from a corporate strategy perspective in addition to M&A, given that you decided not to split, et cetera. So things like spinouts of business units such as consumer, shock-and-awe buyback, and then of course also any color on the M&A environment right now. Are you still in the market for a transformative deal? And what are your therapeutic categories of interest? And then finally on I-O, I wanted to ask what your thoughts are on the probability of success of your study in the first-line PD-L1 positive setting for avelumab reading out next year. Do you have the ability to change the PD-1 cutoff? And then based on your current thoughts on how the market will play out, do you intend to move I-OI-O combos or chemo combos into phase 3? And when should we expect those registrational trials to start? Thank you. Ian C. Read: Thank you, John. So on the corporate strategy issue around the use of our cash flows, we've always had a combination of use of cash flows between buybacks, dividends, investment in our portfolio, and that has \u2013 also business development. And that combination is what we continue to try to maximize. So I would say today on the business development part of it, our appetite for continued acquisitions or investments in business development remains firm, that if it can improve the return to shareholders, we would act on it. And I don't believe that we're limited in the size of the deal we could do. That being said, clearly if you do it in therapeutic areas you're already well-established, you tend to get more value, because you get the value of the synergies in that area. So you tend to be looking to do deals in the areas where you're already strong. Secondly, I do think that the whole industry is on pause right now in major business development while we wait to see the consequences abroad \u2013 primarily I would suggest tax policy \u2013 on the results of the elections. Thank you. I'll pass it over to Albert to do the other questions. Mikael, sorry. I apologize. Mikael. Mikael Dolsten : Thank you, Ian. So I think the way we approach clinical trials is always to be agile and adapt to new information. And clearly we have taken notice about the impact of high PD-L1 for response in first-line lung cancer, and we are reviewing how to best execute the design of our trial. And you can be certain that we will incorporate the most appropriate design to maximize likelihood of success. And certainly we are encouraged that our drug and the class will do well in PD-L1 high lung cancers. Now, when it comes to opportunity to advance the class further, I really appreciated your question because I think in 2017 and 2018 you will see Pfizer propel as among the leaders when it comes to combination therapies. We aspire to have up to six triple therapies in the clinic by 2018 and up to four of them in the clinic by the end of this year. And that will include triple I-O agents such as 4-1BB, avelumab and OX-40. And it will include doublets and triplets with chemo and I-O agents. It will include also combinations with other emerging drugs in our pipeline, whether targeted drugs as well as combination drugs such as antibody drug conjugate, small molecules like IDO, and I think what you will see is across many solid tumors, some of the larger tumor cases \u2013 lung, ovarian, and gastric, as well as in blood cancers \u2013 a large set of trials that will be doublets and triplets and will address the need to further augment the promising results of immune-oncology, as well as deal with the colder tumors that are lower in PD-L1. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Mikael. I would like to add to that the commercial importances that we have all of those agents in-house and will enable a more efficient and focused relationship with the payers. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Mikael and Ian. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from John Boris from SunTrust. John T. Boris: Thanks for taking the questions. First question for you, Ian. It's been bantered about that there could be a repatriation bill. If there was one, what would the dynamics of that repatriation bill need to look like for you to consider repatriating some of the $80 billion that you have trapped offshore that you might potentially like to bring back to the States to put to use? Second question on pricing. I don't think \u2013 you answered Jami's question on price-volume and the contribution there, but just delving on pricing a little further, certainly McKesson and Cardinal have indicated that they expect significantly less price increases next year. Is your innovation product group and your established health group anticipating a similar level of increases to what they took in 2016, or less of increases, as been evidenced by what McKesson and Cardinal have said? And then lastly on Xeljanz, just any update on the European review on Xeljanz and the timing for potentially supplementing that with ulcerative colitis and the psoriasis data? Thanks. Ian C. Read: Thank you, John. So, Albert, could you deal with the Xeljanz question first, please? Albert Bourla : Yes, of course. Let me say first of all that Xeljanz completed robust growth, and this growth is primarily due to increasing confidence as a monotherapy agent and inclusion of Xeljanz in the ACR guidelines, introductions of Xeljanz XR, and growing brand awareness among patients. Now, to your question. We are expanding Xeljanz both geographically and therapeutically. And geographically we are moving it to Europe. As you're aware, in March the EMA accepted our application for the treatment of moderate to severe active RA. The application provides additional information to the original submission. It includes data from the oral development program, which consisted of six completed phase 3 clinical trials, plus two open-label long-term extension studies, one of which is still ongoing. While we cannot speculate what will be European authority's decision, we are very confident on the strength of the data, and discussions are going very, very well. On the UC and psoriatic arthritis, we are continuing the development of those two indications. They represent high unmet medical need; as a result, high potential, commercial potential. And we plan to file in 2017, as Ian said. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Albert. Frank, do you have the numbers on pricing? Frank A. D'Amelio: Sure. So, as you mentioned before, Ian, we have been, we are, we expect to continue to be responsible players when it comes to pricing. In terms of the absolute numbers, if you look historically, on a total company basis enterprise-wide, our pricing impact in any given year is plus or minus a range of low single digits. And that's what we're seeing again this year on the plus side, a low single-digit increase. And that's what we've seen historically; that's what we're seeing again this year. And obviously for 2017 \u2013 John asked about 2017. When we provide our 2017 guidance in January, we'll also talk about any major assumptions relative to pricing. Ian C. Read: Yeah, and, John, as I said before on pricing, we're going to continue to use the philosophy we've always used, which is to look at the value of our products, look at it in context of the marketplace, handle affordability outside of insurance by our programs that allow people without insurance or poor insurance to get it for free from Pfizer. And so I don't expect, at this moment in time, that there's going to be any dramatic change in Pfizer's policies there. Now, on repatriation, I would hope that Congress, with the administration, will reform the international tax code as soon as possible next year. I think it is entirely uncompetitive and negative for businesses and jobs in the United States. So I would hope they would reform it in terms of not only repatriation, but going to a territorial system or another type of system that permanently puts us on a level playing field with foreign companies. And I can't really speculate on how they're going to do it or the exact mechanisms, but we would evaluate the law they pass, and we'd make the appropriate decisions when we see what they're proposing. Thank you, John. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Ian. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Richard Purkiss from Piper Jaffray. Richard J. Purkiss: Oh, hi. Thanks. Two quick questions if that's okay. Could Frank just run through if there are any specific FX moves that are driving the higher COGS in the third quarter? And then just a question on biosimilars for John. Do you think the branded injectable industry is as complacent now as the branded pill industry was in the first half of the last decade? Thanks. Frank A. D'Amelio: So I'll answer the FX question first, which is there's really two things driving the impact on, I'll call it gross margin. I was going to use cost of sales, it's easier to do FX. One is FX negatively impacted revenues by $224 million or 2%. It also negatively impacted COGS by $189 million. Now, typically FX, it operates like an ocean tide. Everything rises, everything falls in the same direction, but we had an atypical move this quarter. We actually had it last quarter too, very unusual, where revenues were down, COGS were up. So if you look at our cost of sales as a percentage of revenue this quarter, 22.7%. If you remove the impact of foreign exchange, that 22.7% becomes 20.9%. So FX had a material negative impact overall on cost of sales. By the way, this kind of atypical relationship between revenues and cost of sales, we don't expect it to continue in 2017. We do expect it to continue next quarter, and it's really being driven primarily by Japan, and within Japan obviously the yen, based on just what's gone on there relative to the currency fluctuations of the yen and the amount of in-market inventory that we have there. But net-net, 22.7% becomes 20.9% for the quarter. John Young : So, Richard, thanks for the question. I certainly wouldn't characterize the industry or specific companies as complacent, but I think we would always say obviously the lifeblood of any company is its ability to innovate. But where there are important treatments that are coming towards the end of their period of patent protection, we as you obviously know, are very positive about the opportunities that biosimilars represent to be able to bring treatment options to patients that actually can add real value to the healthcare system. And so we are very focused on what we can do to bring that value to healthcare systems and patients and physicians in the U.S. and around the world. Ian C. Read: Yeah, and I don't accept the comparison to small molecules to sterile injectables. Sterile injectables is an incredibly complex process, needs high capital, needs constant focus on quality. The FDA is very active in ensuring that they meet those qualities, so I really don't think that the risk and the return on capital in sterile injectables can be compared to the small-molecule business. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Ian. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Christopher Schott : Great. Thanks very much. Just two questions here. The first, coming back to Ibrance, is there any numbers you can put around how large the opportunity is for this next cohort of physicians that you're planning on targeting post the PALOMA-2 publication? I guess just what percent of the market does that represent, or percent of physicians does that represent? And the second was, just staying on Ibrance as well, when we think about the EU opportunity for the drug, how should we think about both the launch and size of that opportunity relative to what we've seen in the U.S.? I guess how would you compare and contrast the uptake we've seen here versus what you hope to see as we roll out in Europe? Ian C. Read: Albert? Albert Bourla : Yes. I will try to give you my personal observations. We do have very high penetration among target physicians in the U.S. So many of them, in the range of 80% are prescribing, but the issue is that the vast majority of them are prescribing one to three prescriptions so far. So they are just testing the waters of the program, and this is where the opportunity is coming, and this is why we have developed a specialty force, and this is why I think that the publication of PALOMA-2 data will capitalize this. In terms of the EU markets, look, I cannot obviously give you a forward-looking statement on our progress, but we aim for leadership with Ibrance there, and we think that we have very robust plans which have built our sales forces. We are expecting the approval now. We have one of the most comprehensive compassionate-use products that Pfizer's ever launched. We have more than 1,000 patients on Ibrance, and we are looking to the future with a lot of optimism. Ian C. Read: So I'd just add to that, your question on the EU and the U.S., and the only sort of thing I could say to you is if you look at our experience with Sutent or perhaps the industry's experience, you normally see that the European markets, once you have the investment, can be as robust as the U.S. market in specialty high-value drugs. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Ian. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink. Seamus Fernandez : Oh, thanks very much for the question. So just a couple here. First off, can you guys talk a little bit about the scale in the consumer business as it sits today and your interest in expanding and building out those assets, as well as the argument for its fit inside the Innovative business rather than the GEP business. The second question is, just excluding product-specific issues, if you were looking at the PCSK9 market and the class with fresh eyes today, given your comments about the market itself, would you still view this as an attractive area for new investment for Pfizer? And then the last question is, as we look at and consider the market opportunity and your considerations in I-O, I would argue that it implies either a unique ability to displace existing players or a larger market opportunity. Can you give us your thoughts on which of the two you see for Pfizer going forward? Thanks. Ian C. Read: So on the I-O, they're both opportunities. You're going expand by the combination therapies. Tumors that today we called cold, they don't react, they don't benefit from PD-L1 therapy, and you will also see a replacement ability because we expect to have our efficacy with these combinations and triplets. So I think on the I-O we'll get both of those if we're successful. On the PCSK9 question, if you ask me would I today begin a new PCSK9 program, the answer is no, we're too far behind. And on the consumer business, look, it's a valuable business. It's growing well. We're investing. We've made acquisitions. But like all our businesses, we all look at them and we subject them to tests of are they worth more inside or outside of Pfizer? And we'll continue to run those tests. Thank you. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Ian. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS. Marc Goodman : Yes. Just on Ibrance, can you give us the penetration rates for first, second, and third line so we can figure out where we are and how much is more to go? And then, second question, remind us what the next milestone is for the Medivation PARP. And, third, can you give us an update on China and how that's doing in the quarter and year-to-date, what the trends are there? Thanks. Albert Bourla : Okay. For Ibrance, the market share, the latest that I saw \u2013 actually I saw them today in my office \u2013 we have approached 50% in first line and 50% in second line of markets there. Ian C. Read: Okay. Thank you. Medivation, PARP? Mikael Dolsten : Yeah, thank you for asking about the PARP inhibitor. I think it's really a growing drug class, which was fueled by very promising ovarian data that was presented at ESMO, and within that class we are very excited about talazoparib because of its very strong potency and also that it has a potentially unique differentiation with what is called PARP trapping. When it comes to the near-term opportunities, we have a phase 3 trial called EMBRACA, which is in BRCA-mutated breast cancer that was a readout due next year, possibly middle of the year, and we look forward very much to see that data set, as we think that the talazoparib and the PARP class, for these type of sensitized tumors with DNA-repair deficiency, can perform very well and supplement other therapies. I wanted to just to punctuate that the existence of this BRCA and other DNA repairs deficiency now goes into a number of cancers and opportunities likely much larger than earlier anticipated. It's not just breast, ovarian, but also increasingly seen in prostate and lung. And these tumors often carry a high mutational burden, which allow us uniquely to combine talazoparib with immuno-oncology products, and of course that can include doublets like avelumab and potentially even triplets. So I think you should really keep an eye on what we may be able to do with our really comprehensive portfolio to move this asset standalone and in combination. Ian C. Read: Thanks. Frank A. D'Amelio: China. There's more \u2013 the numbers on China. For the quarter, operational revenue growth, 16%, year-to-date operational revenue growth, 10%, and we remain bullish on China. Increasing population, increasing personal wealth, increased government commitment to healthcare spending. Strong GDP, although moderated somewhat. But net-net, doing very well there, and we remain bullish. Ian C. Read: Thank you. Charles E. Triano: Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi. Andrew S. Baum: A couple of questions, please. First, going back to the PBMs, which are clearly striving to deliver value for their shareholders. CVS pulled Xtandi and Tasigna, two oral cancer drugs, from their 2017 formulary. Given and following your acquisition of Medivation, plus your existing compounds, the contribution from all cancer drugs in your portfolio is going to be highly significant as we go out five years. Within those categories, there's going to be three CDK 6's, probably five ALKs. Xtandi, as we mentioned, is already gone. I guess what I'm driving at is what you see the risk that PBMs will alight upon oral cancer drugs and therefore the volatilities, given your exposure in that area. And then, second, on ribociclib, the hepatotoxicity that's been reported with ribociclib. Mikael, you mentioned that yours is behaving very well. There's been case reports of hepatic failure with palbo. What are you seeing more broadly in the real-world practice? Do you think what you're seeing or what Novartis are seeing with ribociclib is due to CDK 6 activity or simply off-target activity of their particular molecule, or are you seeing anything to suggest that may be a mechanism and may in fact impact your molecule as well? Many thanks. Ian C. Read: Andrew, on the PBM question, Xtandi was being managed by Medivation, and we probably have more extensive and deeper relationships with the payers than Medivation. So that's one. Two, while I think that PBMs will take a hard look at what we they can achieve, you have to realize that there's a huge emotional content around oncology, and a huge impact on lives saved, value of life, months added. And even in countries like the UK, you've seen them have to react to outrage from the population over lack of access. So I think you'll see a good balance in our society between access and pricing and the efficacy of the drugs. So with that, I think we've tried the Ibrance question and Medivation, and we go to Mikael. Mikael Dolsten : Yeah, we're always careful to comment on other company's drugs, but I hear you saying that ribociclib has had reports on cases with liver and also with cardiovascular. And, as you heard from Albert and myself, Ibrance has performed extremely well. It has a very nice tolerability, appreciated by patients and physicians, and we haven't seen these type of issues with our drug. So I'll likely conclude it doesn't seem to be related to CDK 4 and 6, but I'm careful to comment on other companies' drugs. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Mikael. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Bernstein. Timothy Minton Anderson : Thank you. A few questions. On Xeljanz, can you talk about the U.S. reimbursement outlook heading into 2017? It's a crowded category, lots of moving parts in that marketplace. Second question on PBM, kind of going back to the very first question you got but asked differently, do you think that there's going to be a material change in the relationship between pharma companies and PBMs going forward over, let's say, the next three years? Whether it's a good relationship or not, do you foresee that there's actually going to be material change? And then just a last quick question on CTLA-4 again. And I know it's preclinical, but did you did call out differentiation. You're not in humans yet. I'm wondering what gives you the basis to think that that might actually have a differentiated clinical profile? Ian C. Read: Okay. Xeljanz. Albert. Albert Bourla : Yes. The current growth of Xeljanz \u2013 which is very impressive, 86% \u2013 is driven primarily by the increasing confidence of Xeljanz as monotherapy, inclusion in the ACL guidelines, the recent introduction of Xeljanz XR, and growing brand adherence among patients. All of these reasons, plus our extensive relations with payers, are driving to us having increasing access. And right now we think that the access is going to be much higher in 2017 than it is in 2016. Ian C. Read: On PBMs, I mean, we work with PBMs. They have played up to date a role in improving access and reducing cost to patients. I think the issue of the size of the rebates and the net pricing and the general focus on getting pricing transparency could have a marked change, but it would require legislative change. I don't think accident ledgers have changed. I think the market will be stable around the PBMs. It just depends what happens when the new administration and Congress is in and how much they want to get rid of this issue of having high gross prices and low net prices, which I think today we would say is a disservice to patients, especially those that are not insured or poorly insured. Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : Yeah, no, I really appreciate, Tim, your interest in how we try to build an industry-leading combination portfolio. And, as you know already now, we have up to 10 different immuno-oncology product. And as I stated, we will have six triplets by 2018, multiple doublets in 2017, and four triplets. Among the many opportunities, given that we think there are ample potential to expand I-O beyond what we see with single therapies, we do evaluate \u2013 and the CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies that you came back to. And I tried to stay at the high level, because I don't want to in detail reveal what type of approaches we are considering. But basically we think there are opportunities to potentially see a second generation also in CTLA-2 that will deliver the benefit that you see in the tumor or possibly have a better safety profile, and we do look at CTLA-4's that could have this differentiated profile. As you have noted our agreement with OncoImmune as one example, and there may be several opportunities to tailor a next generation of CTLA-4 antibodies to potentially have such a differentiated profile, so that's why we are eager to further add this to our nice collection of I-O agents. But I have to obviously be careful in not revealing what we think are the unique opportunities that we are assessing. As our portfolio matures, we'll talk more about that. Ian C. Read: Thank you. David. Charles E. Triano: Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. David R. Risinger: Yes. Thanks very much. I have two questions. First, with respect to biosimilar Remicade, do you believe that the NOR-SWITCH trial will be relevant at all to U.S. payers or the U.S. medical community? And then second, for Frank, could you just comment on the operational efficiency opportunities that you foresee in the future for Pfizer? Thank you. Ian C. Read: Okay. John. John Young : Okay, so thanks for the question, David. So obviously we think the increased data on the biosimilars and the utilization in appropriate patient populations is going to be helpful to make sure that patients, that physicians, that payers can gain confidence in how to use them appropriately. NOR-SWITCH is a significant additional add to the data that we have for Inflectra. As you know, it was a randomized double-blind parallel group study with almost 500 patients, and importantly it was funded by the Norwegian government. And the study found no significant difference in disease worsening between patients who underwent a single switch to Inflectra CT-P13 versus those who remained on Remicade. It also found that the incidence of anti-drug antibodies and the frequency of reported adverse events between Remicade and Inflectra CT-P13 were similar. And so we think that the impact of that data is that it certainly will be helpful and informative in helping to make sure that physicians, patients, and indeed payers can make an informed choice about the role that biosimilars and Inflectra specifically can play in that patient population. Ian C. Read: Thank you. Frank? Frank A. D'Amelio: On operational efficiency, Dave, I think \u2013 two comments on this. One, obviously with the two separate businesses we have running within the company, separately we should see separate accountability, really managing their businesses in a very detailed way. We see that as a potential for operational efficiency. And then, just as a company, we're always looking at every dollar, every dollar of capital that we deploy, always with the intent of how do we maximize, how do we optimize the capital that we've spent. So, given that, that's what we meant when we talked about operational efficiency. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Frank. And, operator, if we could please take our last question. Operator : Your final question comes from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Great. Thanks so much for getting me in. So just two questions following up on topics that came up before. So, one, on your decision to not split, I'm just wondering if you could give any sort of sense around timing for when you may reassess that decision? Is there an ongoing review, or should we not assume anything is going to be looked at again for the next several months or several quarters? And then, second one, on the consumer side, which I know came up a couple times, you mentioned that it's been growing, but looking back at the numbers really it doesn't look like it's grown that much since 2013. So I'm just curious, internally, are there opportunities such as Rx-to-OTC switches or other things that could drive the growth beyond what we've seen over the last two, three years here? Thanks. Ian C. Read: Yeah, well, I see growth in consumer. Clearly, it's not a market that grows that much, but I'll ask Albert to talk to that. Albert Bourla : This quarter it grew 2%, but the year-to-date growth is 5%, which is beating the market growth, and we expect to stay there. Ian C. Read: So it's a very valuable asset inside our company, and as I said, we look at all of our businesses to continuing tests that they're generating the right return to shareholders. Look, on the split issue, I think we've made a decision. It was a major undertaking to look at it. I don't expect us to revisit that on a quarterly basis, as you suggested. I think it will be reviewed in the context of strategic decisions on a longer timeframe than that. Charles E. Triano: Great. Thank you, and thanks, everybody, for your time this morning. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Pfizer's third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Charles E. Triano: Good morning. And thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer's fourth quarter and full-year 2016 performance, as well as our 2017 guidance. I'm joined today by our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Albert Bourla, Group President of Pfizer Innovative Health; John Young, Group President of Pfizer Essential Health; and Doug Lankler, General Counsel. The slides that will be presented on this call can be viewed at our home page, Pfizer.com, by clicking on the link for Pfizer Quarterly Corporate Performance \u2013 Fourth Quarter 2016, which is located in the For Investors section in the lower right-hand corner of this page. Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussion during this conference call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainty that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information regarding these factors is discussed under the disclosure notice section in the earnings press release we issued this morning, as well as in Pfizer's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Item 1A, Risk Factors, that is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available at SEC.gov and on our website at Pfizer.com. The forward-looking statements during this conference call speak only as of the original date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements. Discussions during the call will also include certain financial measures that are not reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's current report on Form 8-K dated today, January 31, 2017. You may obtain a copy of the Form 8-K at our website, Pfizer.com/Investors. Any non-GAAP measures presented are not and should not be viewed as substitutes for financial measures required by U.S. GAAP. They have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to the calculations of similar measures at other companies. We'll now make prepared remarks, and then we'll move to a question and answer session. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian? Ian C. Read: Thank you, Chuck, and thank you for joining our call this morning. During my remarks, I will make a few comments about the year and where we see the opportunities for continued growth in 2017. Frank will provide details regarding the quarter and our 2017 financial guidance. 2016 was marked by solid execution, which led to another year of operational revenue growth, both in terms of our overall portfolio, which showed an increase of 11% for the year, and on a Pfizer standalone basis excluding legacy Hospira and Medivation, where the annual growth was 5%. We saw robust revenue growth from both new and mature brands. Pfizer Essential Health established market-leading positions in sterile injectables and biosimilars. Our sterile injectables portfolio achieved over $6 billion in revenue during the year, and in our biosimilars business we launched Inflectra, the first biosimilar monoclonal antibody available in the U.S. Globally, we had three marketed biosimilars and are the leader in total sales, as well as having a robust pipeline of biosimilar assets. We look to the sterile injectables and biosimilar portfolios to continue to generate growth for the Essential Health business and also expect continued growth of the Essential Health portfolio in emerging markets, which achieved 7% operational growth in 2016. For Pfizer Innovative Health, Eliquis achieved 88% operational growth for the year and is the number one prescribed new oral anticoagulant by cardiologists in 12 markets around the globe. Xeljanz grew 78% operationally and is now nearly a $1 billion brand on an annual revenue basis. Chantix grew 27% operationally. In December, the FDA approved updates to Chantix's labeling, including the removal of the boxed warning regarding serious neuropsychiatric events based on the outcomes of the EAGLES study. Lyrica grew 14% operationally, and our consumer healthcare business achieved another year of solid performance with 5% operational growth. Ibrance remains a significant growth driver. Its revenue almost tripled year over year and grew 17% globally on a sequential quarterly basis, reflecting its attractive clinical profile and continued acceptance by physicians, payers, and patients. Ibrance received EU approval in November and will begin to launch across Europe during the year, resulting in incremental revenues, primarily in the second half of the year. We feel very confident about our leadership in the CDK 4/6 inhibitor class. Our business development activities during 2016 have provided us with attractive revenue growth opportunities within both of our businesses. With the acquisitions of Medivation and Anacor to our Innovative business, we have added Xtandi for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and Eucrisa for the topical treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in adults and children as young as 2 years of age. And the addition of AstraZeneca's small molecule anti-infective business to Essential Health has strengthened our anti-infectives portfolio, which is the industry's largest, with more than 60 products. Each of these acquisitions strategically aligns with our approach to business development, which is to look for opportunities that contribute immediate and/or near-term revenue growth. As we look at the total company operational revenue growth profile, we see our current in-market products, including our recently acquired products, as having the ability to deliver an enhanced revenue growth rate over time and more than offsetting continued headwinds from product losses of exclusivity. In 2017, on an operational basis, the midpoint of our revenue guidance reflects 4% revenue growth, excluding the Hospira Infusion Systems business, which we expect to divest next month. Improved revenue growth is an important driver of valuation and requires continued solid executions in addition to the ongoing advancement of our key pipeline assets. In 2016, we received five product approvals, achieved six regulatory submissions, and advanced 39 compounds in our pipeline. Our current pipeline contains 96 clinical programs \u2013 half biologics, half small molecules \u2013 and about two-thirds new molecular entities, and is well-positioned. And in 2017, we're expecting pivotal top line study results in oncology and biosimilars. A few pipeline highlights include : In oncology, we a very robust life-cycle program for Ibrance. It is being studied in an additional four pivotal studies in early, advanced, or recurrent breast cancer. In addition, Ibrance is being studied in several non-breast cancer indications, including two sponsored trials in pancreatic and head and neck cancers. Xtandi has provided us with a novel treatment in metastatic prostate cancer. We see a potential opportunity to extend the type of androgen receptor blocker in Xtandi into other indications and to seek regulatory approval in non-metastatic prostate cancer. In immuno-oncology, we're making significant progress in building a strong I-O portfolio and see avelumab as a core asset. Through our partner, Merck KGaA, in the U.S. the avelumab submission for treatment of metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma was accepted by the FDA with priority review. And we also have announced that the European Medicines Agency validated for review the marketing authorization application in the EU. We have 11 compounds in the clinic, including anti-PD-1 MAb, a T-cell retargeting P-cadherin T-DART (9:32), a small molecule IDO1 inhibitor, and the allogeneic UCART19 T-cell therapy for pediatric and adult acute lymphomic leukemia. Our avelumab program with Merck KGaA now has 30 programs ongoing, 10 of which are potentially registration enabling. And over 4,000 patients have now been enrolled in ongoing avelumab studies. The breadth of our I-O portfolio allows us to differentiate with combinations, which is core to our strategy. For example, we are starting to deliver data with avelumab and 4-1BB. We plan to initiate by the end of the first quarter a triplet with avelumab, 4-1BB, and OX40. And we'll have studies with avelumab combined with rituximab and 4-1BB. We also have studies with avelumab with lorlatinib, our next-generation ALK inhibitor, and avelumab with Inlyta. In biosimilars, we recently announced positive top line results for both infliximab, a potential biosimilar to Remicade, and trastuzumab, a potential biosimilar for Herceptin. And this month we announced positive top line results from the comparator REFLECTIONS study for adalimumab, a potential biosimilar to Humira. This marked the third potential biosimilar molecule from our pipeline to report positive top line data results during the past four months. This year, we expect readouts in bavituximab and filgrastim, and we have a total of 14 biosimilar molecules in various stages of development. In inflammation and immunology, we have one of the strongest JAK franchises in the industry and have advanced four immunokinases, including three selective JAK and one IRAK4 inhibitor to clinical two studies. Our Phase 2 trials cover 10 different indications, from rheumatoid arthritis to gastrointestinal to dermatology. And in vaccines we have a robust portfolio that continues to progress. We achieved proof of concept of our C. difficile vaccine and expect to enter Phase 3 in the coming months. Our staph aureus vaccine is currently in Phase 2, and we now have a novel pneumococcal vaccine in the clinic in Phase 1 that could potentially cover up to 20 serotypes. Of note, during 2017 we anticipate potential U.S. decisions for our avelumab Merkel cell carcinoma, potential lorlatinib submission for non-small cell lung cancer, potential EU decision for Xeljanz in RA, potential U.S. filing in the first half of 2017 for additional indications for Xeljanz in ulcerative colitis and geriatric arthritis. As we look at the year ahead, Pfizer's well-positioned with our in-market portfolio and our pipeline assets. I also see our company's structure, with its two distinct businesses, as affording us the focus and sense of urgency to deliver enhanced revenue growth over time. For 2017, we look forward to working with a new administration and across the healthcare system. Our efforts will continue to be focused on developing, delivering, and providing access to innovative therapies that address areas of unmet medical need and that advance patient care. Pfizer has long held a contract with society through our business practices and culture to ensure that patients get the medicines they need. In summary, in 2016, we created significant value for our shareholders through several initiatives, including acquisitions and partnerships that bolstered each of our businesses, share repurchases, and an increase to the dividend. We enter 2017 with strong financial position, products that are leaders in their categories, strong and emerging mid- and late-stage pipeline, and an operational structure that gives us the flexibility to differentiate our business in ways that will continue to create shareholder value. Now I turn it over to Frank to provide more detail on the quarter. Frank A. D'Amelio: Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I am reviewing today are included in our webcast. As a reminder, because we completed the acquisition of Hospira on September 3, 2015, Pfizer's financial results for the full year 2016 reflect legacy Hospira global operations for the entire period, while full year 2015 includes only four months of legacy Hospira U.S. operations and three months of legacy Hospira international operations. Our financial results for the fourth quarter 2016 and fourth quarter 2015 include legacy full Hospira global operations for both periods. In addition, Pfizer completed the acquisition of Anacor Pharmaceuticals on June 24, 2016. Consequently, our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016 include three months and approximately six months of legacy Anacor operations, respectively, which were immaterial. Finally, Pfizer completed its acquisition of Medivation on September 28, 2016, so financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016 include three months of legacy Medivation operations. Now moving on to the financials. Fourth quarter 2016 revenues were approximately $13.6 billion and reflect a year-over-year operational decline of $191 million or 1%. It's important to note that fourth quarter revenues were negatively impacted by four fewer selling days in the U.S. and three fewer international selling days versus the prior-year quarter, which unfavorably affected revenues by approximately $750 million. If you'll recall, in the first quarter of 2016 I pointed out that there were nine more selling days versus the prior-year quarter and that this imbalance would be primarily offset in the fourth quarter 2016, which would have seven fewer selling days. It's important to note that there are essentially the same number of selling days in full year 2016 as in full year 2015, so they impacted the quarterly year-over-year comparisons, notably the first and fourth quarters. Fourth quarter 2016 revenues were also unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of $228 million or 2%. Our Innovative Health business recorded 2% operational revenue growth in the fourth quarter, driven by the strong performance of Ibrance in the U.S., Eliquis globally, Xtandi in the U.S. with the Medivation acquisition in September, and in Xeljanz and Lyrica, both in the U.S., all of which were partially offset by a 23% operational decrease in global Prevnar 13 revenues. In the U.S., Prevnar 13 declined 33% due to a decrease in revenues for the adult indication after the high initial capture rate of the eligible population following its successful fourth quarter of 2014 launch, which resulted in a smaller remaining catch-up opportunity compared to the prior-year quarter and the unfavorable impact from the timing of government purchases to the pediatric indication. We continue to believe that Prevnar 13, both pediatric and adult indications, will remain very significant products for Pfizer, notwithstanding this decrease in the fourth quarter 2016 and the expectation that full year 2017 global Prevnar 13 revenues will remain flat to slightly down. We do expect Prevnar adult launches in international markets, as well as the potential for increased utilization in the 18 to 64 population to temper. We expect a decline in sales in the U.S. Fourth quarter Innovative Health revenues were also negatively impacted by lower revenues for Enbrel in most developed Europe markets, primarily due to continued biosimilar competition and the loss of Rebif alliance revenue versus the year-ago quarter due to the expiration at year-end 2015 of the agreement to co-promote Rebif in the U.S. Revenues for our Essential Health business decreased 6% operationally, driven by a 20% operational decline from Peri-LOE products and a 3% operational decline from legacy established products, which were partially offset by operational growth of 3% from the sterile injectable pharmaceuticals portfolio and 48% in biosimilars. Revenues from legacy Hospira products declined 1% operationally; however, excluding the performance of Hospira Infusion Systems, these revenues actually increased 2% operationally. In emerging markets, Pfizer's overall Essential Health revenues grew 4% operationally, due primarily to 3% growth in the legacy established products portfolio and 9% growth in the sterile injectables portfolio. Fourth quarter reported EPS was $0.13, compared with the loss of $0.03 in the year-ago quarter, primarily due to the non-recurrence of foreign exchange losses related to Venezuela, a Protonix-related legal matter, and pension settlements in the prior-year quarter, and a lower effective tax rate in Q4 of 2016 compared with Q4 of 2015. These were partially offset by fewer selling days, foreign exchange impacts, higher restructuring costs, and losses related to the early redemption of debt and the pending sale of Hospira Infusion Systems. Adjusted diluted EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.47 versus $0.53 in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to fewer selling days, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, continuing product losses of exclusivity, and a higher effective tax rate, all of which were partially offset by revenue growth due to certain new inline and acquired products and fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which declined by 105 million shares versus the year-ago quarter due to our share repurchase program. As I previously mentioned, foreign exchange negatively impacted fourth quarter 2016 revenues by approximately $228 million or 2% and negatively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses, and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $50 million or 1%. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.04 compared with the year-ago quarter, with approximately $0.03 related to Venezuela. On a full-year basis, foreign exchange had a $0.21 negative impact on adjusted diluted EPS, with approximately $0.10 attributable to Venezuela. As you can see, we achieved or exceeded all elements of our 2016 financial guidance ranges. It's important to note that every major currency except the yen weakened against the U.S. dollar in 2016, which negatively impacted our full year 2016 revenues by approximately $1.5 billion, of which $778 million was attributable to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar. In full year 2016, we generated 11% operational revenue growth, and excluding legacy Hospira and legacy Medivation operations, Pfizer's standalone revenues grew 5% operationally. I also want to point out that 2016 adjusted SI&A expenses were at the top end of our guidance range as a result of spending to support new products including Ibrance, Eliquis, Prevnar adult, Xeljanz, and biosimilars. Now I'd like to walk you through the 2017 guidance ranges for revenues and adjusted diluted EPS relative to our 2016 actual results. First, it's important to note that our 2017 financial guidance assumes the pending disposition of Hospira Infusion Systems in February 2017 and excludes its $1.2 billion contribution to 2016 revenues and its $0.03 contribution to adjusted diluted EPS in 2016. Also, while our 2017 revenue guidance range reflects anticipated strong growth of certain new, inline, and acquired products, this growth is partially offset by an anticipated $2.4 billion negative impact due to continuing product losses of exclusivity and an anticipated $900 million negative impact due to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. Consequently, we're absorbing a negative impact of $4.5 billion related to these three factors. In addition, I'd like to clarify for modeling purposes that while expanding revenues from the U.S. are included in alliance revenues, revenues that our generated outside the U.S. are booked as royalty and therefore included in other income. In summary, we expect our 2017 revenues to be in the range of $52 billion to $54 billion. I also want to point out that the midpoint of this revenue range implies another year of mid-single digit operational growth, excluding the impact of the pending sale of Hospira Infusion Systems and foreign exchange. Adjusted diluted EPS guidance, as I mentioned, excludes the contribution from the Hospira Infusion Systems and includes the negative impact of product losses of exclusivity, as well as an expected $0.05 negative impact from foreign exchange. In addition, the guidance range for adjusted diluted EPS incorporates $5 billion of anticipated share repurchases in 2017, which are expected to more than offset potential dilution related to employee compensation programs. As a result, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.60. The midpoint of this range implies operational growth of approximately 10%, excluding the impact of the pending sale of Hospira Infusion Systems and foreign exchange. Moving on to key takeaways, we finished full year 2016 with 5% standalone operational revenue growth, excluding Hospira and Medivation. We issued 2017 financial guidance. Excluding the pending sale of Hospira Infusion Systems and foreign exchange, the midpoint of the revenue guidance range implies another year of mid-single digit operational growth, and the midpoint of the adjusted diluted EPS guidance range reflects approximately 10% operational growth. We accomplished several key product and pipeline milestones, including the European Commission's approval of Ibrance for the treatment of women with HR+, HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer and the FDA's approval of Eucrisa for the treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in patients 2 years of age and older. We returned $12.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2017 and beyond. Now I'll turn it back to Chuck. Charles E. Triano: Thank you. Operator, at this point can we poll for questions, please? Operator : Your first question comes from Tim Anderson from Bernstein. Timothy Minton Anderson : Thank you very much. I'd like to ask you about Immuno-Oncology and just the commitment to the agreement on avelumab and with your partner, Merck KGaA. As you outlined, you've got lots of registration-enabling trials ongoing and lots of combinations. Should we interpret that as meaning that you're fully committed to that partnership and to avelumab? Or is it in the realm of possibilities that in this fast-changing world of I-O, where the landscape continues to shift, you have to be more open-minded to continually reassess the way and try to become a leader in this area? And maybe Merck KGaA and the assets that you have in development don't quite get you there. Then a second question is on border tax. Can we just get your perspective for how you think this whole issue might play out both in the nearer and longer term? Do you think this proposal has legs? My understanding is that it could clearly be a potential negative for multinational drug companies. Ian C. Read: Tim, thank you for the question. Regarding avelumab and our partnership with Merck KGaA, we believe avelumab is a highly competitive molecule, and we're focused along with our partner on delivering its promise as both monotherapy and in combination with other agents. In the I-O area, we believe that having a backbone with a PD-L1 compound is necessary but insufficient in the future competitive environment. So we see avelumab as potentially competitive in selected first-line settings but believe the true value will be in combinations, potentially with targeted agents such as Inlyta, antibody drug conjugates, analytic (27:00) vaccines, and other I-O agents such as OX40, 4-1BB, IDS1 (27:05), and drugs in Pfizer's pipeline. So I think that addresses most of the risk and concerns you have about our strategy. Everybody needs, I think, a PD-L1, but that's just the chip to the entry. After that, you need an extensive portfolio around combinations to really open up the value of immuno-oncology. On the issue of border tax, look, the tax codes are complicated \u2013 or the tax suggestions are complicated. I think the Republican leadership has overall tax changes that are overall favorable for the pharmaceutical industry. Certainly would allow us to create more jobs in the United States. And I don't really think that we would feel that the changes as being proposed are negative for our industry \u2013 far more positive, in fact. Frank, do you want to add something to that? Frank A. D'Amelio: I'd just punctuate what Ian said, which is I don't think you can look at one individual \u2013 one potential individual part of reform. You got to look at what the total package would look like. So it'll include what's going to be corporate taxes? What are going to be the impact on future foreign earnings? Base erosion, which is where border adjustability comes in. Accumulated foreign earnings, interest expense deductibility. So I think what we'll need is we need the full picture, the full puzzle, instead of just trying to comment on one individual piece of it. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Frank and Ian. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Christopher Schott : Great. Thanks very much. Just two questions here. First of all, on just appetite and priorities for business development from here. And as you're just thinking about that, would a repatriation kind of tax holiday or broader tax reform affect any of your capital deployment or business development priorities? Basically, could that make deals that didn't make sense previously make sense given the new capital structure? Second question was just maybe talking a little bit more about Prevnar. We had a step down in sales this quarter. You've talked about sales to be flat to maybe modestly declining in 2017. Could you just elaborate a little bit more? Where are we with regards to the in adult kind of bolus in the U.S.? And how should we think about this kind of ramp in Europe offsetting potential further erosion of the U.S. opportunity? Thanks very much. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Chris. Well, I'll make a few comments on the BD. Frank, you may want to add something, and then we'll go over to Albert for a discussion on the Prevnar vaccines. To the extent \u2013 I'd like to point out that the most impactful thing with tax reform will be to level the playing field between U.S. companies and foreign companies in regards of the foreign companies not having the tax advantage of acquiring companies and then taking it to a low-tax location. So that'll be a fundamental change in competitiveness. To the extent that tax changes would make it cheaper for us to access financing, then you're quite right. Some deals that previously would not have been affordable, may now be affordable. But the lens we look at it is always from the point of view of creating value for shareholders. So per se I don't see that the tax reform alters our approach to doing BD, which is, are we going to generate above our cost of capital in making this investment, and is it, both short- and long-term, the right think for shareholders? So I hope that answers on BD, and we'll go over to Albert to talk about vaccines. Albert Bourla : Prevnar 13 is expected to continue to be a significant program. Overall this year, we expect Prevnar 13 to be flat to declining. And this is a result of complex movements in the marketplace. As discussed previously, in the U.S. we have already vaccinated approximately 50% of the 65-plus population. So we expect to continue to see a decline here in the adult indication, as we exhaust the catch-up opportunity (31:09). This will be offset by international adult growth, and growth of adult vaccinations in the 19 to 64 age range. And we will also see a modest growth in pediatric indication. From our perspective, moving forward in U.S. and in EU, in the U.S. we are focused on protecting the remaining 50% of the 65-plus population and expanding uses to 19-64 age range. We are aware that vaccinating the remaining 50% is more challenging than it was to vaccinate the first half. And to realize the full potential of 19-64 we need an SEP (31:53) recommendation, but we are moving forward with plans given the current situation. In Europe, as you know, it's all about recommendations and reinvestments. We continue to advocate with vaccine technical committees for recommendations and payers for reinvestments. The timing of the success varies country by country and in some cases region by region within the same country. Last couple of data (32:17) in 2016, we had relatively limited number of recommendations and reinvestments. We had in Denmark and we had one region in Spain, Madrid region. In 2017 we expect funding decisions in a number of important markets, like France, Italy, and Belgium. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Albert. And, as you know, I think we've said in the release that we expect, given the pressures on the ability to get into the residual 50% of the adult markets, we expect sort of flat to slightly down for our overall Prevnar franchise next year. Charles E. Triano: Thank you. Operator, can we move to the next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. So, one, again going back to the business development and some of the D.C.-related comments you made earlier. I'm just wondering, in terms of \u2013 given there's a lot of uncertainty around how everything's going to play out in terms of corporate tax and border pricing, all these issues, is it fair to say that there might be a little bit of a pause in Pfizer's desire to do larger scale business development until these issues are sorted out, presumably later this year? And then my second question that I had just relates to Xtandi. And I'm just curious on that product sort of your expectations given how much you paid for that asset in your acquisition last year. J&J commented a little bit last week around some market contraction that they're seeing in that space. And I'm just curious if you can give a little bit more color in terms of what you're seeing in terms of volumes and pricing from Xtandi? Thanks. Ian C. Read: On the BD, I don't see it as a pause. We're going to play the cards we get dealt. As I said, the change in the tax code may reduce competition for assets from external buyers. It may alter somewhat the overall cost to make an acquisition, but it's not dramatic in the sense of we're going to take a year pause or so while we see what the tax code's going to do. We're going to continue to do BD where we see value for our shareholders. We think we have the flexibility on the balance sheet to do that, and so I don't see a dramatic pause. Frank, do you want to add anything to that? Frank A. D'Amelio: Just that since September of 2015, with the current cards we've been dealt, with the current tax laws as they're written, we've done approximately $40 billion in deals, all of which obviously we believe are or will create shareholder value. And, to Ian's point, if we get dealt a new set of cards, a new hand, then obviously we'll play that hand. And once again the compass never changes. The compass is always creating shareholder value. Ian C. Read: Okay. Albert, on Xtandi? Albert Bourla : Yes. Vamil, let me provide some insight of the market dynamics and then also provide our expectations for the product. Xtandi revenues in Q4 declined 8% versus Q3 of the same year and 13% versus same quarter of last year. However, Xtandi demand, as measured by specialty pharma, was up \u2013 increased 4% in Q4 versus Q3 and over 9% versus the same quarter of last year. The same inconsistency between revenues and demand is also observed on a full-year basis, where revenues were up by 8%, while total prescriptions were up by 15%. This inconsistency is due to changes in the demand mix, with a significant increase in patient assistance program last quarter, which impact revenue. This spike in PAP programming is unprecedented compared with prior experiences. We remain confident in the growth potential of Xtandi in the metastatic first stage cancer market for the following reasons : We expect to continue to grow sir (36:36) with both oncologists and urologists. Urology is where the largest growth potential exists. Currently the number of oncologists prescribing the product is almost 4,000 of a universe of 6,500. The number of urologists prescribing Xtandi now grew to around 1,400 this quarter. However, there is still a great opportunity with over 5,500 urologists prescribing casodex. The publication of the positive data from TERRAIN, which is the only study demonstrating superiority against casodex, head to head, will have a significant impact. Recent market research showed a significant increase in prescribing intent by both oncologists and urologists that were aware of current data versus those that were not aware. Beginning of January 1 this year, we put a strong commercial management team in place from Pfizer. Given our strong reputation and experience in both oncology and urology, together with partner Astellas, we expect to accelerate the Xtandi growth. Charles E. Triano: All right. Thank you, Albert. Our next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin : Thank you. My question is for you, Ian. As you know, President Trump is meeting with a group of industry executives right now as we speak, and he said he wants to bring drug pricing down. Do you think that the industry is doing enough to quell concerns out there? And, if this comes to a head \u2013 I mean, how do you think it does come to a head? How are we going to get closure on this drug pricing issue? Will the industry have to give something up? How do you look at it? And just specifically on your price increases, which you announced January 1, are you holding to one price increase a year? Can you comment on that? I think it's just interesting that a number of the distributors this morning said that they are expecting that drug companies will raise prices again in the June and July time period. So just sort of your overall views on how this is all going to come to a head. Thanks. Ian C. Read: Okay. Thank you, Jami. On our price increases are, I don't want to get into the will and the when we increase prices for simply competitive reasons. But we are not changing our philosophy vis-\u00e0-vis how we price our medications and when we take those price increases. And regarding the meeting with President Trump, which I couldn't attend because I'm on this analyst call, I'd like to sort of broaden exactly and look at what he said. He said, well, number one, you need to get manufacturing back to America, so that falls squarely inside of getting a tax reform which allows us to reinvest in the United States and create jobs. So I think we can be a very positive part of the story of creating jobs in the United States if we get the tax reform. Regulations. He's going to cut up to 80% to help streamline the approval process. That will help with drug prices, because it'll induce more competition. We have been advocating for a long time to speed up the approval of generics and remove the barriers to their approval, because that will help with drug prices. Regulations, the way insurance is delivered. Cost to consumers, which is really, I think, what the president is talking about. Cost to patients is driven by the fact that the out-of-pocket expense on average for a patient to visit a hospital is 3%, but on his drug bill it's 15%. So we'd like to see regulations that would allow that unfair playing field to be squared up. It'd be positive to get a new FDA head and very positive if we can \u2013 if young companies (40:53) and companies can be \u2013 get to the market quicker. And that's good for us and good for the whole system. So I think complexity of drug prices involve all of the other comments he made. And I think there are lots of ways, like changing regulations to allow value-based contracting between the industry and the health system, will also be very helpful. We have a regulation that was created for fee-for-service, and now we need regulations in a new world of value-based pricing. So I think there's lots of ways we can work with the administration to ensure that patients have affordable drugs \u2013 or more affordable drugs in the United States. I think that covered most of what you asked. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Jami. Thanks, Ian. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI. Mark J. Schoenebaum: Hey, guys. First of all, I'd like to thank the Pfizer organization for all the help while I was gone, especially Chuck, Ryan, and Bryan helping my team. Thank you. I wanted to ask again about the possibility of a repatriation holiday. So maybe this is a question for Frank. But I just want to understand if I'm doing this right. Your OUS cash, I believe, is at least $14 billion, I think is what you said publicly, not updated for the 4Q. Your leverage ratio right now, total debt to EBITDA, is something around 1, 1.3, somewhere in there. I believe you said you'd be willing to go to at least 2. And I'm wondering if \u2013 my understanding is that if you're able to repatriate cash, you probably alleviate some of your needs for short term paper in the U.S. So, in the event of a tax repatriation holiday, how high, Frank, would you allow your leverage ratio to go? And would you consider maximizing your borrowing to maximize cash on hand? And, then second of all, if you don't mind, just the 5% operational growth for the year in revenue. Can you break out price versus volume? Ian C. Read: Mark, I know you've directed most of the questions to Frank; I think he can give you the answers you're looking for. I'd just like to say welcome back. Good to have you back on the calls. Frank A. D'Amelio: Yeah, welcome back, Mark. I also wanted to also say that, too. So, listen, on capital structure, the real punchline to the question was how high would we go? Let me run a few numbers, and then I'll answer the question, which is at the end of last quarter we had about $24 billion in cash. We say at any point in time, up to $10 billion of that is in the U.S. So that $24 million minus that $10 million that disclosed is how you got to your $14 billion. At the end of last quarter, we had give or take about $44 billion in debt. So if you put the debt of $44 billion, put that on our EBITDA number, you get a number that's close to 2. If you do a net debt number, which is probably the calculation that you did, you get to a leverage ratio that's about 1, 1 and change, which is, I'm assuming how you got to the basis of your question. In terms of how high we would go on leverage, the answer is, it depends on what we're doing. I mean, quite frankly, to lock myself in on a number really to me isn't an appropriate thing. It really depends on what is the use of capital? And the compass on capital, whether it's business development, whether it's buybacks, whether it's dividends, whether it's investing in our business, but the compass is how do we maximize capital deployment to maximize shareholder value? So that's how we think about it. To the extent we need it to lever up because we think there'd be an opportunity that made sense, we'd lever up. But to lever up just to lever up isn't what we're all about. So that's how I'd answer that. On price, I think the way I'll answer it is I believe for the full year our operational revenue growth all in was 11%. Then you took out \u2013 you made a couple adjustments to get to 5%. But I look at the 11%, the majority of that 11% is volume. Low single digits, approximately 2% of that, is price. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Frank. Next question, please, operator? Operator : Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. David R. Risinger: Yes. Thanks very much. I have a couple questions. First, with respect to pipeline news flow in 2017, could you just highlight what the top two or three readouts are in your mind that we should be focused on? And then second, with respect to future business development, you've obviously commented on it in some detail, but it would be helpful to get some more perspective on what your expectations are for potential timing on large transactions. It would seem that it would be most beneficial for Pfizer to have clarity on the likelihood of tax reform and/or repatriation before pursuing a very substantial transaction. But would love to get your comments on that, Frank. Thank you. Ian C. Read: Well, I'll ask Mikael to do the pipeline flow, and then myself and Frank will answer your BD question. Mikael Dolsten : Yeah, thank you for the question. I think we are in a really good rhythm with the pipeline. Actually over the last six years we have had over 20 key approvals with an average of three to four approvals per year, and the pipeline, the quantity and the quality that we have of the pipeline of more than 90 programs in clinical development, we'll have a similar flow or even more. Actually in 2017 and 2018 we expect about five approvals every year. Concerning readouts, and I'll focus mainly on pivotal studies that are registration enabling, we will have about 15 pivotal readouts in 2017 and 2018. Particularly in 2017, more near term, I can mention readouts expected for dacomitinib, lorlatinib, avelumab in certain indications, and also two of our biosimilars. And there will be a continuous flow up to 15 pivotal readouts in total, 2017 and 2018. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Mikael. Frank, would you like to have a stab (47:37) at the BD question? Frank A. D'Amelio: Sure. And, Dave, you commented specifically you mentioned large transactions. The way I'd answer the question is \u2013 and Ian and I have both said this before \u2013 we always start with we're agnostic to size when it comes to business development. Our compass is, will continue to be, shareholder value. In terms of the other part of your question about access to overseas cash, or easier access to overseas cash, clearly that would be beneficial. That would be favorable, all other things being equal. But in terms of does that make it easier to do deals? The answer is it depends. For example, what happens to the valuations of all the companies? If it's easier to have access to overseas cash, does that drive valuations and prices up? So the compass has to continue to be shareholder value, return on capital, relative to our cost of capital. That's what we've always done. That's what we'll continue to do. But at a macro level, all other things being equal, does easier access to our global cash help us, is it more favorable? The answer is yes. But there's other factors that we'll have to understand as we work our way through business development. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Frank. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from John Boris from SunTrust. John T. Boris: Thanks for taking the questions. First question just has to do with a very broad question on - Ian C. Read: John, we can't hear you. You need to speak up, sorry. John T. Boris: Sure. Can you hear me now? Frank A. D'Amelio: Much better, John. Loud and clear. John T. Boris: Okay. Great. Thank you. So the first question is just a very broad question on how fragmented the pharmaceutical industry is relative to other industries. Can you just give your thoughts on consolidation, and especially in light of the pricing pressures, just your thoughts on the need for the industry to consolidate? There's a lot of manufacturing inefficiencies out there, just a lot of inefficiencies in the industry in general. So that's the first broad question. Second question, in 2006 you made a decision to sell your consumer business. Is there any way of giving some quantification as to what kind of earnings contribution you currently get from the consumer business? And if you were to consider externally selling it, how would you offset that dilution? Would you add to that $5 billion share repurchase? Third question, Ibrance. Was there any \u2013 obviously outperformance, great performance on the brand in the quarter. Was there any additional product put into the channel on Ibrance? Was that all sell-through? And then lastly, Ian, applaud your highlighting the 96 clinical programs you have, but one thing I hear a lot from investors is that you haven't had an R&D meeting in a long time. Would love to see that innovation displayed in front of the investment community. Any thoughts about doing an R&D meeting? Ian C. Read: Okay. Thank you, John. Four good questions. So the issue of fragmentation. So if I look at it from a society point of view, society has to decide, do they want continuing \u2013 a flexible (50:45) organization with lots of shots on goal? If they do, they need to continue to support that and support it through a robust market-based system in the United States. To the extent that that would change, and we don't have a robust ability to recover our value, then I do think you'd see the fragmentation disappear and innovation would go down. So it's a sort of really macro decision that the government has to make or society has to make as to how much progress and how fast do they want to see progress and how much resources they're willing to put behind it. And that would dictate, I think, the fragmentation or infragmentation (51:19) of the industry. Vis-\u00e0-vis the consumer business, we don't give out obviously our profits for sub-businesses, but we see it as an asset that is valuable to us, valuable to our shareholders. And just like all of our portfolio and all of our assets, if there's a better mix, we're always open to it, but it has to be for strategic reasons rather than cash. On Ibrance, I'll ask Albert to talk a little bit about Ibrance, but before he does, you asked about the R&D portfolio. Charles E. Triano: R&D day. Ian C. Read: R&D day. Well, look, let's look at it. We haven't had one for some time. I haven't often found them that productive. We give you a lot of visibility by publishing on Clinical.com (sic) [ClinicalTrials.gov] (52:15). Mikael's available to analysts whenever they want to talk about the science. More than willing for you to come in and talk to Mikael, John. So I'm not sure that a big R&D day really is worth the disruption and the focus on getting it done vis-\u00e0-vis explaining what we're doing, but we'll take a look at it. Okay, Ibrance, Albert. Albert Bourla : It was a great performance for Ibrance, John. As we said, exceeded $2 billion this year in the second year of its launch, and it was almost 200% growth. And this excellent financial performance is driven by underlying demand, and there was no abnormal situations in inventories. Ian C. Read: Okay. And, Frank, why don't you add some more on the consumer? Frank A. D'Amelio: Yeah, so, John, just to run some numbers to help you in terms of answering your question. So for the quarter, consumer revenues, $950 million, plus 4% operationally. For the year, $3.4 billion, up 5% operationally. We don't give specific margins, but one of the things we do say about the consumer business is that the margins are lower than the pharmaceutical business because it's a less risky business. That gives you enough information, I think, to be able to really ballpark what the number is. And, by the way, in terms of just the theory or the case of when we divest an asset, how do we deal with it from a dilution or accretive perspective? The answer is it depends, but think about Zoetis. We did a big buyback. We did a share exchange. And so even though we divested what was a very good, very profitable company, we wound up making that transaction accretive. So there's lots of ways for us to do that. You mentioned share buybacks, and, yes, that's clearly one of the ways when we divest assets that we can deal with accretion and dilution. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Frank. Our next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Geoffrey C. Meacham: Hey, guys. Good morning. I want to dig in a little bit on the biosimilar franchise. What can you guys tell us about the Inflectra experience so far in the U.S.? And then what's the Pfizer view of the new interchangeability guidance and what it means to speed to market? And then, at a higher level, when your biosimilar franchise scales to add more assets, do you think about gross to net any differently? In other words, is the long-term value here biased to more margin contribution or more revenue growth? Thanks. Ian C. Read: John, would you like to comment on that? John Young : Yeah, so first of all, I think we obviously are very positive about the opportunity that we have with biosimilars. First of all, the commercial opportunity to provide real value to our shareholders, but also the opportunity that biosimilars represent to continue to bring some of the competition that Ian referred to, to the healthcare system and to bring efficiencies and savings. So we think the opportunities in both regards are very significant. It's obviously very early days of Inflectra in the U.S. We're literally in the first \u2013 this is just the second month of launch, so it's early days. We anticipate that the uptake in the first few months in the U.S. will be slow. That represents our progress in Europe, where we've seen that actually after the first few months as physicians get comfortable with biosimilars, we've seen the rate of uptake really begin to accelerate. Just to give you a data point to compare in Europe, the uptake of biosimilars overall for infliximab in Europe is something like 28%, 29% in the second year. So we're actually very satisfied with what we've seen about the progress of biosimilars can make when we begin to get information about how a high-quality biosimilar and our data can really actually deliver significant value to the healthcare system. In regard to your second question about the portfolio, we certainly continue to have, as you've heard from Ian and Frank, a bias to shareholder value. So our compass, whether it's in BD, as Ian and Frank have talked about, or when it comes to the individual contribution of a product portfolio such as biosimilars, will always be around shareholder value. And so we certainly are very positive about the opportunities for revenue growth, but our compass is always going to be shareholder value as we determine how to invest in that portfolio going forward. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, John. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen. Steve Scala : Many thanks. I have two questions. First for Ian. As someone who's been in the industry for a long time, I would be interested in how you view the current potential threat from government intervention on drug pricing versus that sporadically over the last 20 or 30 years. Would you say it is now among the most significant threat you've ever seen? Would you say it's similar to past periods or not as severe? And then a question for Dr. Dolsten on JAVELIN 100. The study is similar to KEYNOTE-024 and CheckMate 026, reads out this summer, the PD-L1 expression threshold is 1%. Is Pfizer amending the protocol to use a higher threshold? Since otherwise it seems that the study is unlikely to be successful. Thank you. Ian C. Read: Steve, on the relative threat, it's a good question. I think the misinformation is far greater than I've ever seen before out in the marketplace. And we're seeing added onto previous price discussions the behavior of companies that work in the generics sector, who are moving to change their prices in a volatile manner, hence creating a negative perception there. But if you actually look at the price increases of the branded pharmaceutical companies as a whole for 2015, it was 2.8%. So if you separate the hysteria, frankly, in the media and often the examples are companies that are in the generic market, then I think it's really a huge amount of misinformation out there that we and the pharma as an organization needs to begin to start dealing with (58:26). Mikael Dolsten : So great to get the question on our clinical strategies. We always carefully monitor new learning in clinical science to make sure we try and incorporate them into our studies, and this is true also for the JAVELIN first-line lung cancer study, where we are obviously incorporating the best way to define the patients concerned in PD-L1, and you can be certain that our patient population we've optimized for what is the best knowledge how to get the likely maximum response to a PD-L1 inhibitor such as avelumab. Finally, I just wanted to add, beyond the monotherapy, which we think will be a productive profile for initial monotherapy, we worked on doublets and triplets with 4-1BB and OX40 that will over time, we think, be able to move the needle even further, including indications such as lung cancer. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Mikael. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank. Gregg Gilbert : Thank you. First for John Young. John, do you think the Essential business can grow without deals and without the benefit of innovative projects coming over the wall, over time? Can you also give us a roadmap for what biosimilar launches Pfizer might have in the next two to three years? And comment on your copaxone ANDA status in light of the legal ruling? And over to Ian and Frank. Rather than asking you to predict as to what replaces the Affordable Care Act and when, could I ask you to quantify the effect you think the ACA has had on Pfizer? Industry fee, donut hole, increased volume potentially, biotech exclusivity. These are the things that come to mind. But how do you quantify what ACA has done for Pfizer as we think about where that may go in the future? Thanks. Ian C. Read: Please, John. John Young : Okay. So thanks for the question, Gregg. So I think we have been fairly consistent in terms of saying that we really believe that we have a strategy and a portfolio that can return the Pfizer Essential Health business to some sustainable growth after the impact of LOEs has begun to lessen. We certainly still have an impact of some LOEs in our portfolio, as you know, but that impact will lessen over the next few years. And I think we believe that just strategically at a high level, the strength that we have in our emerging market business that would be typically in most of the large emerging markets, number one or two in most of those countries. We have the leading sterile injectable business, leading biosimilars business. And within our, what we think of as our global brand portfolio, we actually also have the largest portfolio of anti-infectives in the business. So we believe that those core areas of strength really provide an opportunity for us to really drive this business to sustainable growth. Just to run some numbers for you. Whilst in the fourth quarter this year, the growth of the business overall was minus 6%, if you adjust for the impact of LOEs, giving you a sense of what is actually happening to the core business without that headwind, the answer is flat. But if you adjust for and equalize for the selling days, which I think Frank highlighted in his opening comments, that core business grew by 6%. So I think it hopefully gives you a sense that we are actually growing those portfolios that we believe will be the positive drivers of growth going forward. We'll continue to look at opportunities to strengthen those portfolios. And certainly our aspirations for setting (1:02:06) this business to sustainable growth remains undimmed. In terms of biosimilar launches, as you know, we are also \u2013 we're very well-positioned to be the leader that we are today in terms of revenues, but actually a leader over the next five to 10 years given the strength of our portfolio. In the relatively near term, we anticipate that in the 2018, 2019 timeframe we'll be able to file around about five biosimilar products. I think you're aware of the products that we have in our pipeline. We certainly have potential biosimilars for trastuzumab for cancer; for bevacizumab, also for cancer; for adalimumab, which is an anti-TNF product and one of the biggest products in the world; and rituximab; as well as EPO, which we filed in response to the complete response letter that Hospira had previously received. And we filed that response in December of last year. So when you look at all of those drivers, both combining that with the early stage pipeline that we have, we believe we're really well-positioned to have a rich pipeline of biosimilars in the marketplace over the medium term. Thanks for the question, Gregg. Ian C. Read: Gregg, thank you. I'm going to just point out some of the \u2013 I'll get Frank to go through some of the costs of ACA first. I'd like to just make the point that there was no windfall for our industry from the expected 20 million more patients. Because mostly these patients were not treated with a type of \u2013 given the level of insurance they have, they didn't really have access to innovative drugs. So there was very little revenue growth from the exchanges for Pfizer (1:03:54) the expenses of the ACA. Frank A. D'Amelio: Yeah. So the donut hole in the fee on pharma sales this year for the full year, Gregg, $722 million. Now, by the way, the thing to add to that is the Medicaid component, although it's very hard to really come up with that number now because many states have moved to managed Medicaid. But if I just ballpark that number and assume it's been roughly the same as it was a couple years ago, that number grosses up to about $1.25 billion. And you divide that by, call it, 80 million per share pre-tax to that $1.25 billion, $0.15, $0.16 a share. Thank you. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Frank. Can we move on to the next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS. Marc Goodman : Yes. Morning. Looks like another year of flat spending. Can you talk about the push and pulls specifically on SG&A for this year? But also just more broadly, just philosophically, it looks like R&D SG&A the past couple years has been flattish. Should we be thinking flattish for the next couple years as we model? And basically however the top line drives the bottom line? And then, second of all, just on Ibrance, you mentioned there was no unusual inventory, but you also on the quarter usually give us some metrics, how many patients were on the product and what kind of penetration rates you've got in first line and second line. That would be helpful. Thanks. Ian C. Read: Why don't you do the Ibrance, Albert? Then we'll get back to the movement of R&D and - Charles E. Triano: A side comment (1:05:27). Albert Bourla : Yes. Marc, let me give you a brief overview of the performance of Ibrance. And let me start by saying how happy we are with the success. Ibrance has been prescribed in the U.S. by approximately 9,500 physicians. This is up from 8,500 that were in Q3. It's been given to approximately 50,000 patients. Our initial on strategy was to establish Ibrance as the standard of care with early adopting physicians. Moving forward, we believe the growth will come from late adopters, many of whom have already prescribed Ibrance, but in a limited number of patients. 20% of the approximately 12,000 prescribing physicians in the U.S. have not yet prescribed the product. From those already prescribing it, approximately 30% have only one or two patients on Ibrance. With the publication of PALOMA-2, we think that this is important data for these late-adopting physicians. Let's not forget that the study demonstrated more than two years PFS, making at the first and only treatment of this population to do so in a randomized Phase 3 study. And then last, to answer your question, our internal market shares are approximately 45% in first line for the quarter, 40% in second line, and 25% approximately in the third line. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Albert. I'm going to make a couple of comments on your question from the sort of strategic point of view of our expenditure in R&D and SG&A, and then I'll ask Frank to give you more analysis. So we spend in SG&A and R&D according to the opportunities we see and how we can create value. So that layer is always there, and expectations of R&D and SG&A are really related to the opportunities we see in the marketplace. Underneath that, though, we have consistent programs to look for efficiencies in how we do R&D, how we deliver our SG&A. And perhaps Frank can comment upon some of those efficiencies. So right now, looking at it, I'm satisfied with the level of support we have next year for SG&A and R&D, and each budget cycle we look at it, look at the opportunities and the growth we can get from those opportunities. Frank. Frank A. D'Amelio: Yeah, maybe I'll give you some of the puts and takes, Marc, to see if that helps. So \u2013 and I'll run some numbers first. So let's do SI&A. So last year, the SI&A actual number for 2016 full year was $14.7 billion. Our guidance for 2017 is $13.7 billion to $14.7 billion, with a midpoint of $14.2 billion. There's a lot going on underneath those numbers, so if you look at the $14.7 billion compared to $14.2 billion, just in terms of the midpoint of the guidance, what's going on there? One is ongoing cost reduction programs that Ian alluded to. Two is we get the benefit of the sale of Hospira Infusion Systems. Right, so that comes out. And then foreign exchange actually helped SI&A to the tune of about $200 million. We called that out. So think about that as things that are helping the number, but then there's offsets against that. So for example, we get the full year effect of Mediviation next year \u2013 launch costs for that, launch costs for Eucrisa, which is another area. Spend on some of our other areas. But those are the kinds of things that are going on in terms of $13.7 billion, $14.7 billion, what the midpoint is relative to next year. There's items that are driving the number down. There's items that are driving the number up. If you look at R&D, same kind of, I'll call it, puts and takes. So last year, 2016, $7.8 billion. Guidance for this year, $7.5 billion to $8 billion, so the midpoint's roughly the same as last year, which is part of the basis of your question. But once again, lots going on there. So for example, the large boco charge we had in the fourth quarter comes out. So that would reduce spending all other things equal. On the other hand, we've got the Medivation acquisition, and we're actually increasing our investment in things like Ibrance, immuno-oncology, and see (1:09:27) some of our late-stage pipeline assets. So when you put that all together, we get to that range of $7.5 billion and so just kind of the rhythm of the numbers. (1:09:46) Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Frank. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi. Andrew S. Baum: Hi. Couple of questions, please. It seems as if a new administration is proposing lower drug prices in exchange for accelerating development timelines for drugs. Do you really believe that that's the underlying issue with the economics of pharmaceutical industry? Does that represent a fair trade to you? And then, second, in terms of the industry group highlighting other players in the healthcare value chain who may be contributing to drug price inflation, perhaps you might like to comment both on the role of the PBMs, as well as on the 340B hospital program. And then very quickly on biosimilars. In relation to your oncology biosimilars, could you outline what you think the anticipated adoption rate and market impact will be, how fast, and in particular to which customer groups in the U.S. you think you're going to be most accessible in the initial launch period? Thank you. Ian C. Read: So your question on the administration, I would look at it this way. I think to the extent that \u2013 and I would hope this is how the administration's thinking of it \u2013 to the extent that they can remove regulations and make it easier and faster to bring drugs to market, that will make the marketplace a lot more competitive, which will then in turn help to bring down drug prices. I believe that this is the philosophy of the administration, to ensure there's competition in the marketplace, and that would be one way of ensuring that drug prices are modified some way. Regarding your comment about the difference between our price and the list price, I think we get \u2013 I think there's a study that recently came out indicating the percentage we get of the list price. So we have got into a marketplace, and the way the marketplace has developed, that we have list prices but then rebates negotiated that gives a net price. I believe there are alternative systems where we could have just as an efficient system but where the list prices could be lower and the net prices would stay substantially the same or might drop slightly because of the middleman not making so much money in the middle. But that's very complex, and we need to come up with a competitive marketplace solution to that. But I do believe that's one of the problems in the market today, because people without insurance or through the deductibles are hit with the list price rather than the net price through the insurance companies. So maybe there are ways we can work with the insurance company administration to get rid of this big difference between list price and net price. And the last question was for John on biosimilars. John Young : So thanks for the question, Andrew. So obviously there are no currently available oncology product biosimilars, either from our portfolio or any other company's portfolio in either the U.S. or Europe or any other major market around the world. So to some extent it's very early days to conjecture what reach of uptake might be. Yet what I can say is that we are very positive about the pipeline that we have. As I mentioned earlier, we have bevacizumab, a potential biosimilar to Avastin. We have rituximab, a potential biosimilar to Rituxan, and we have a potential biosimilar, trastuzumab, to Herceptin. And we're very positive about the way that those clinical programs are unfolding. I think in oncology, it's very likely that biosimilars will be used initially for new patients. I think it's probably unlikely that oncologists will choose to change a patient's therapy, but given the particular dynamics where patients by definition start and finish courses of therapy more often we don't see that as being an inhibition in any way to the uptake once physicians actually see the clinical data for a biosimilar and then can make an informed decision along with their patients around how to most appropriately manage their course of therapy. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, John. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Tony Butler from Guggenheim Securities Tony Butler : Yes. Thanks very much. Three very brief questions. Frank, have efficiencies in gross margins actually been totally wrung out to date? And number two, to John Young again on biosimilars, do you believe in the U.S. that overall demand is dependent upon formulary positioning \u00e0 la pushing a brand back to a higher tier for where your biosimilar may be at a lower tier as opposed to physician pull-through? And then finally to Mikael Dolsten on first-line lung, yet once again, do you wait until JAVELIN 100 completes before moving forward with the combination studies? Or are you already underway with those? And I noticed or cannot find any trials other than in head and neck, which has radiation which may involve chemotherapy plus avelumab. So I'm curious how you and/or Pfizer think about that and combinations specifically for lung? Thanks very much. Ian C. Read: Okay. Frank? Frank A. D'Amelio: Yeah, and, Tony, I'll answer it by using cost of sales, which is basically the same thing. So think about it this way : Our cost of sales in 2016 was 22% of revenue for the full year. Our guidance for 2017 is 20% to 21%, so midpoint to that guidance 20.5%. So we're actually down from 22% to a range of 20% to 21% in 2017. Couple things going on there. One is more alliance revenue, so alliance revenue we book is \u2013 we book the revenue based on net gross profit, so there's no COGS. So that obviously helps the percentage, but also ongoing cost reduction programs taking place in our factories and throughout the company. And then there's -the offset to that is we've got 2.4 billion of LOEs next year, some of which obviously have a negative impact on the cost of sales. But when you put that together the short answer is we're going down year over year and no, the short answer is no, we haven't wrung it out completely. There's always opportunities to continue to improve in everything that we do. John Young : Okay. Thanks for the question on biosimilars, Tony. So I'm going to, I think, just hit on a couple points I made already, which is clearly one component of ensuring appropriate uptake for biosimilars in the marketplace is physician education, making sure that they're familiar with your clinical data, the strength of your program, and we also believe actually the importance of the company profile in your experience in biosimilars. That said, plainly access is a critical component as well. And we're absolutely clear that ensuring that we can negotiate appropriate patient access and we take the steps necessary to ensure that patients can have access to high-quality biosimilars is equally important. Mikael Dolsten : Yeah, so great to hear about your interest in how we'll evolve the I-O combinations. So as we have optimized JAVELIN 100 for PD-L1 monotherapy, and I think based on current experiences across the field of PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies, one can assume that monotherapy may be particularly robust in the PD-L1 height (1:17:27) fraction of tumors but likely of less magnitude in PD-L lower lung cancers. We have several Phase 1 studies ongoing where we study combination of avelumab, such as JAVELIN Lung 101, which contains avelumab plus ALK inhibitors Xalkori/lorlatinib for ALK+ lung cancer, and we also have JAVELIN Medley \u2013 and so the tumor basket studies that contain avelumab with 4-1BB, avelumab with OX40, and we're planning this quarter to start a triple, avelumab, 4-1BB, OX40, which likely, to the best of my knowledge, will be the first triple with these agents. I should say that although you cannot predict outcome of combination drugs, it has been the history of oncology to evolve to that as we learn about single-agent activity. Both 4-1BB and OX40 show some single-agent activity, whether on clinical activity or important immunoparameters (1:18:40). Finally, I should say that we also are starting studies where we combine avelumab with our own PDE4 inhibitor for the T790 mutation, which is a growing segment. We will review those data as they emerge in the first half of the year, particularly, avelumab, 4-1BB and OX40 data will emerge, and take rapid decisions together with our partner, Merck, (1:19:08) how to leverage those data, and we will certainly not wait to see an outcome of JAVELIN 100, as we think the design of combination studies can also contribute to expand and supplement the position we can have in monotherapy. Charles E. Triano: Thank you. Thanks, Mikael. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink. Seamus Fernandez : Oh, thanks for the question. So just a couple of quick ones. Ian, maybe you can just kind of comment on the fact that I-O investment overall seems wildly inefficient. In that context, can you just discuss the general efficiency of pharma's investments into this area? And in oncology, if you think the industry should really be looking to consolidate more of that spend over time. Or should companies really be taking these independent paths, chasing the same targets? And then the separate question is just for Frank. On the tax rate, can you just help us understand a little bit more the \u2013 relative to your current repatriation thresholds, what would the tax rate need to be in order to maximize your free flow of capital? Obviously 15%, I think, would get us there, which is the current proposal for a territorial tax system. But would 20% get us there? Would 22% get us there relative to forecasting your current pro forma tax rate, which typically runs between 22% and 25%? Thanks. Ian C. Read: Seamus, regarding your question, I think you can see that clearly with the way investors have treated initially BMS and Merck and those that have been the frontrunners on I-O, that they think it's a very effective investment strategy. The question you're really asking is, is there value to multiple shots on goal and multiple combinations? And there are a lot of combinations that you can try. So I think that the field is in its infancy and that implies some lack of efficiencies as we explore for leads and different ways to take these products forward, which will, over the medium term shake out. Now, whether you want people chasing \u2013 only one person chasing \u2013 only one company chasing one target, well that would be the result of not spending as much on research by not supporting prices and not supporting innovation. Okay. Taxes. Frank A. D'Amelio: So, Seamus, on taxes, now let me run a few numbers, and then I'll answer the question which is, there's \u2013 really, there's kind of the proposals from the administration, there's the proposals from Paul Ryan and the rest of the Republicans. Think about it this way. You got to think of foreign earnings in terms of accumulated earnings to date and then future earnings. So on future earnings, the administration has a proposal, I believe, of 15% minimum tax, where Paul Ryan has a proposal that's basically a total territorial tax system that would bring it back at zero. Now that comes, by the way, with base erosion called border adjustability. By the way, I like that total territorial at zero. I mean that's kind of really good. Ian C. Read: (1:22:43) Frank A. D'Amelio: Puts us by the way, to Ian's point, in terms of a level playing field with our competitors. If you look at accumulated earnings, so everything that's been accumulated already to date, the administration has a proposal of 10%, Paul Ryan has a proposal of I believe it's 8.75% on the cash, 3.5% on the noncash, and then it's payable over eight years. My short answer is the lower the better. We obviously want to have easier access to our overseas cash. And in terms of maximizing shareholder value, the lower that number is for us, the better it is for our shareholders. So my threshold, though, is low. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Frank. Frank A. D'Amelio: Yes, sir. Charles E. Triano: Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets. Frank A. D'Amelio: Good morning, Alex. Alex Arfaei : Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. First, Ian, thank you for prioritizing your investors and being on the call as opposed to the White House. This morning, the president said that foreign countries must pay their fair share for drug development. This may not be a fair question to you, but do you think that is actually achievable? And if so, how could it be achieved? And then also, forgive me, I'm not sure if I understood your earlier comments regarding the connection between U.S. manufacturing and tax reform. If you could clarify that. And then on finally on the business, Hospira operational growth was a little bit lower than expected at 2%, given all the ex-U.S. launches. Can you provide some commentary there? Thank you. Ian C. Read: Okay. On the \u2013 stopping free riding is the way I'd put it. The economy's free ride on innovation paid for by Americans, clearly it's trade policy. It's how we interact and how we do our trade policies and how we negotiate them, and I think the president has been clear that he thinks that they haven't been negotiated hard enough. And as regards to free riding on American innovation of pharmaceuticals, I totally agree with him. And hopefully we will get something done on that. He certainly has declared his intentions to do so. I'll hand it over, the other question to John. John Young : Yeah, so thanks for the question. So we continue to be very positive about the contribution that Hospira has made to our business, both in terms of its strategic fit but also its operational performance. Just to run some numbers by you, our sterile injectable business for Hospira on the quarter as we printed it was flat. Our biosimilars business grew by 48%. The infusion systems business, which had some softness in the fourth quarter, declined by 9% and the total of minus 1%. But just to come back to the selling days true-up, that if you adjusted those for selling days and equalized between 2015 and 2016, the numbers become 9% growth for the sterile injectable business, 61% growth for the biosimilars business, infusion systems would be minus 2% compared to the minus 9%, and the total business would be 8% compared to the minus 1% when you adjust for selling days. So overall we remain very positive about the organic performance of that business. Ian C. Read: So regarding the connection between tax reform, manufacturing, and bringing jobs back, we are not \u2013 as an industry, we're interested in highly qualified workforces that have been trained, and \u2013 but we're driven by the tax code today to manufacture outside of the United States. If there is no penalty by the border adjustment for manufacturing inside the United States to supply your markets outside of the United States, that will encourage us to put more jobs in the United States. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Ian. And, operator, if we could take our last question, please. Operator : Your final question comes from Richard Purkiss from Piper Jaffray. Richard J. Purkiss: Thanks. I had a couple of quick product questions. Firstly, for Albert on Bosulif, do you see the results from the BFORE study allowing you to expand into the first-line setting in the face of Gleevec generics? And then for Mikael or Albert on Ibrance, can you tell us when you expect to see the neoadjuvant breast cancer data from the PALLET study? And also, can you give us a quick update on how enrolment is going in PALLAS? Charles E. Triano: Can you repeat the first question, Richard? Ian C. Read: Bosulif? Richard J. Purkiss: Sure, yeah. It was a question for Albert on Bosulif - Charles E. Triano: Bosulif. Richard J. Purkiss: \u2013 the BFORE study, allowing you to expand into first line in the face of Gleevec generics. Ian C. Read: Yeah, I think we'll ask Mikael to make some comments on that. And the second one was on - Charles E. Triano: Ibrance. Ian C. Read: Ibrance. You can take those two, Mikael. Thanks. Mikael Dolsten : Yeah, thank you for noting the very strong performance of Bosulif in the BFORE study that was run with the venture group Avillion supporting us in developing into earlier line. We were really pleased with the data that we \u2013 I think have been released on a first type of high level that showed it outperformed Gleevec and showed superiority. So we think it will certainly give Bosulif an opportunity to be a major drug across all lines in chronic myelogenous leukemia. Thank you for noting that. When it comes to Ibrance, we have had solid enrollment for our early breast cancer trials, which I think reflect, as Albert has alluded to, the very favorable tolerability profile for a drug like Ibrance to be used. And we have both, as you know, PALLAS and PENELOPE. PALLAS is the broader study that covers both high-risk and intermediate-risk patients that will be treated with Ibrance for two years. The smaller PALLET trial, which is a Phase 2, more of a neoadjuvant trial, may read out later this year or possibly 2018. Always difficult to have a firm projection. We anticipate data could come this year. That's a study that in some way will give additional data from a Wash U university study that was earlier shown at ASCO, which did show on Ki-67 as a proliferative molecule estrogen receptor-positive cancer cells as well as on clinical responses that Ibrance was very active in this equivalent of early breast cancer. And these are the endpoints but in a larger trial, Phase 2 APPELLATE (1:29:38), we look forward to the data and think if we just add more aspects of Ibrance and its activity across many segments of breast cancer, whether advanced, recurrent, or, here, earlier breast cancer. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Mikael, and thank you, everybody, for your attention this morning. Ian C. Read: Thank you, everybody. Frank A. D'Amelio: Thank you, everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude Pfizer's fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Chuck Triano : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer's first quarter 2017 performance. I'm joined today by our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Albert Bourla, Group President of Pfizer Innovative Health; John Young, Group President of Pfizer Essential Health; and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel. The slides that will be presented on this call can be viewed on our newly redesigned website, Pfizer.com/investors. Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussion during this conference call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information regarding these factors is discussed under the Disclosure Notice section in the earnings press release we issued this morning, as well as in Pfizer's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K, including in Part 1, Item 1A, Risk Factors, that is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available at www.sec.gov and on our website, www.pfizer.com. The forward-looking statements during this conference call speak only as of the original date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements. Discussions during the call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's current report on Form 8-K dated today, May 2, 2017. You may obtain a copy of the Form 8-K on our website, pfizer.com/investors. Any non-GAAP measures presented are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for financial measures required by U.S. GAAP, have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP, and may not be comparable to the calculations of similar measure at other companies. We will now make prepared remarks, and then we will move to a question and answer session. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian? Ian C. Read: Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. I'll open with a few brief comments regarding the quarter, our strategy, and the external environment. 2017 is off to a solid start, as we noted in our earnings release. Revenues in the quarter as compared to the prior-year quarter were impacted due to one less domestic and two fewer international selling days, which represents approximately $300 million of revenue. Additionally, revenues were impacted by the divestiture of Hospira Infusion Systems. We saw strong performance from our core brands, notably Ibrance, Eliquis, Lyrica, and Xeljanz within the Innovative Health business. For the Essential Health business, Sterile Injectables had a strong quarter, and we saw robust operational growth within Emerging Markets and the Biosimilars business. We have reaffirmed our 2017 financial guidance, which at the midpoint represents 4% operational revenue growth and 10% operational adjusted diluted EPS growth on a year-over-year basis, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange and the divestiture of Hospira Infusion Systems. As we look at the coming year, both of our businesses remain focused on their individual strategies and delivering on their operating objectives. For the Innovative Health business, this means supporting product launches and the late-stage pipeline. And for the Essential Health business, this means continuing to refine and strengthen its portfolio to enable it to ultimately pivot to growth following two upcoming significant LOE events : Viagra in the U.S. later this year and Lyrica in the U.S. at the end of 2018. Additionally, we are working to improve our growth profile for the overall company by maximizing and focusing on the growth of major inline brands and the growth of new products. The strong performance by key products again this quarter reinforces our view that we have a strong portfolio of meaningful revenue growth contributors. Behind these products is a pipeline of distinct assets that we believe have the potential to become meaningful revenue contributors towards the end of this decade and into the next. We expect Ibrance will continue to perform well even as it faces competition, and we look forward to advancing the recent launches of Eucrisa and Inflectra. While there has been some displacement in Xtandi revenue relative to demand growth, we expect patient assistance program utilization as a percentage of total demand to stabilize and moderate gradually throughout 2017. While this is a complex reimbursement market, ensuring broad access to these important medicines remains in the best interests of physicians and patients. And with a portfolio well-positioned to compete in Emerging Markets, we see continued growth opportunities for both the Essential Health and Innovative Health businesses in these markets. Of note, about 20% of our total company revenue base comes from Emerging Markets. Now, turning to the pipeline, our focus remains on advancing assets within core therapeutic areas that address important patient needs. Some of the more noteworthy highlights include : Last month we completed enrollment in EMBRACA, the Phase 3 study of talazoparib in germline BRCA-positive metastatic breast cancer. We expect the study to complete in the upcoming months and to receive top line results by January 2018. In Immuno-oncology, we continue to believe that doubles and triplets are the best areas of greatest potential for patients. We've initiated avelumab combination studies with chemotherapy and targeted therapies. In 2017, we expect to see early data from a variety of avelumab-based studies, including avelumab plus 4-1BB, avelumab plus OX40, avelumab plus Inlyta. In addition, we have entered the clinic with our first triple combination of avelumab, 4-1BB, and OX40. In targeted cancer therapies, we are studying lorlatinib as a single agent in second-line ALK+ small-cell lung cancer and hope to have a filing in the U.S. during the second half of this year. We are also studying it in combination with avelumab and expect to have early data in 2017. Also of note, last week lorlatinib was granted breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA for the treatment of patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase, or ALK, positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer previously treated with one or more ALK inhibitors. In Inflammation & Immunology, we submitted a regulatory application for Xeljanz in psoriatic arthritis in February in the U.S. Additionally, we expect to submit a regulatory application for Xeljanz in ulcerative colitis in the U.S. in the first half of the year. We also plan to submit regulatory applications for both of these in the EU in the second half of the year. We have a broad portfolio of investigational next-generation selective kinase inhibitors and see the potential for approximately 10 Phase 2 studies to be in process by the end of 2017, including a potential proof-of-concept readout for our selective JAK1 inhibitor in atopic dermatitis. In Rare Diseases, along with our partner, Spark Therapeutics, we recently disclosed data from the first 10 patients being treated in our ongoing Phase 1/2 trial in hemophilia B, a gene therapy asset, and we anticipate a potential proof-of-concept in the second half of 2017. This is for factor IX. In Internal Medicine, we're advancing our portfolio in NASH, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, otherwise known as fatty and inflammatory liver disease. To date, we have positive Phase 1 data for our ACC inhibitor drug and expect to report additional Phase 1 data on two assets, DGAT2 and KHK, later this year. And in Vaccines, our C. difficile vaccine candidate entered Phase 3 in March of this year. Regarding our views on capital allocation, we continually assess a variety of opportunities to create incremental value for shareholders, whether it be acquisitions, divestitures, direct return of capital, or managing our investments in the business. And we have engaged in all of these opportunities when we determine they are right for creating shareholder value. Looking ahead to the rest of the year, I believe each of our businesses is well-positioned within their individual markets, with strong portfolios, highly skilled and accomplished leadership, and focused strategies. We are closely monitoring the evolving political landscape and uncertainty coming out of Washington and are keenly aware that tax reform may open up additional avenues of capital deployment to deliver value to our shareholders. We will continue to be alert and flexible to potential policy or legislative changes that could influence decisions we make. And we are continuing to engage with elected officials to educate them on issues relevant to our business. I am proud of what the people of Pfizer have accomplished over the course of the past six years. We have built a stronger, more resilient, competitive business with solid portfolio of market-leading products and a robust R&D pipeline. We have the resources, expertise, talent, acumen, culture required to control our destiny. In summary, we're looking ahead to the rest of this year. Our businesses are strong. Our pipeline is solid and focused on the areas that address patients' unmet needs. And our financial strength will enable us to deliver sustainable value creation for our shareholders. Now I'll turn it over to Frank to discuss the quarter in more detail. Frank A. D'Amelio: Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast. I want to remind everyone that because we completed the acquisition of Anacor Pharmaceuticals on June 24, 2016, and the acquisition of Medivation on September 28, 2016, Pfizer's financial results for the first quarter 2017 reflect three months of legacy Anacor operations, which were immaterial, and three months of legacy Medivation operations. In addition, Pfizer completed the sale of Hospira Infusion Systems, or HIS, on February 3, 2017. Consequently, our financial results for first quarter 2017 include approximately one month of legacy HIS domestic operations and two months of legacy HIS international operations, while the year-ago quarter reflected three months of legacy HIS global operations. Now moving on to the financials. First quarter 2017 revenues were approximately $12.8 billion and reflect the year-over-year operational decline of $110 million or 1%. It's important to note that first quarter revenues were negatively impacted by one less selling day in the U.S. and two fewer international selling days versus the prior-year quarter, which unfavorably impacted revenues by approximately $300 million. First quarter 2017 revenues were also unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange, $116 million or 1%. Our Innovative Health business recorded 6% operational revenue growth in the first quarter of 2017, driven by Ibrance and Eliquis globally; the addition of Xtandi revenues in the U.S. from the Medivation acquisition September of 2016; and Lyrica and Xeljanz, both primarily in the U.S., all of which were partially offset by a 7% operational decrease in global Prevnar 13 revenues. In the U.S., Prevnar 13 declined 9% due to a continuing decline in revenues for the adult indication because of a smaller remaining catch-up opportunity versus the prior-year quarter, which was somewhat offset by the favorable impact of timing of government purchases for the pediatric indication. In international markets, Prevnar 13 revenues decreased 4% operationally due to the unfavorable impact of timing of government purchases for the pediatric indication in certain emerging markets, partially offset by modest growth of the adult indication in certain developed Europe markets. Fourth quarter Innovative Health operational growth was also negatively impacted by lower revenues for Enbrel in most developed Europe markets, primarily due to continued biosimilar competition and Viagra in the U.S. due to lower market demand. Revenues for our Essential Health business decreased 9% operationally, driven by a 23% operational decline from peri-LOE products such as Pristiq in the U.S., Lyrica in most developed Europe markets, and Zyvox in developed Europe and the U.S. Essential Health revenues were also negatively impacted by a 68% operational decline in HIS revenues due to the previously mentioned sale in February of 2017 and a 5% operational decline in legacy established products, all of which were partially offset by a 3% operational growth from the Sterile Injectables portfolio and 62% operational growth from Biosimilars, driven by Inflectra in certain developed Europe markets and in the U.S. I want to point out that if you exclude the impact of HIS, fewer selling days, and the LOEs, Essential Health revenues grew 3% operationally. In Emerging Markets, Pfizer's overall Essential Health revenues grew 5% operationally, primarily due to 21% growth from the Sterile Injectables portfolio. First quarter reported diluted EPS was $0.51, compared with $0.49 in the year-ago quarter, primarily due to lower legal charges and asset impairment charges, as well as higher net gains on asset disposals, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate, fewer selling days, and lower royalty income. Adjusted diluted EPS for the first quarter was $0.69 versus $0.67 in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to a lower effective tax rate and lower operating expenses, unfavorably impacted primarily by fewer selling (16:14) and lower other income. I want to point out that diluted weighted average shares outstanding declined by 133 million shares versus the year-ago quarter due to our share repurchase program, reflecting the impact of two $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreements, one completed in June of 2016 and the other executed in February of 2017. In the first quarter of 2017, fewer shares outstanding contributed approximately $0.01 to reported diluted EPS and $0.015 to adjusted diluted EPS. As I previously mentioned, foreign exchange negatively impacted first quarter 2017 revenues by approximately $116 million or 1% and positively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses, and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $61 million or 1%. As a result, foreign exchange had essentially no impact on first quarter adjusted diluted EPS versus the year-ago quarter. As you can see, we reaffirmed all components of our 2017 financial guidance. Moving on to key takeaways, our performance in the first quarter 2017 was solid. Excluding HIS revenues in the first quarter and the year-ago quarter, we recorded operational revenue growth despite the $300 million negative impact of fewer selling days versus the year-ago quarter. We reaffirmed all elements of our 2017 financial guidance. We accomplished several key product and pipeline milestones, and we returned $6.9 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which includes a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in February of 2017. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2017 and beyond. Now I'll turn it back to Chuck. Chuck Triano : Thank you, Frank. Operator, can we please poll for questions? Operator : Your first question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin : Thank you. Ian, I think you referenced the Xtandi issue with patient assistance programs, but can you explain what's going on? Why this is occurring now? Why this seems to be only occurring with prostate cancer drugs? And, most importantly, did you plan for this at the time you did your $14 billion deal? And when do you expect the impact to normalize? And maybe if you could remind us again what the value proposition was of Medivation. And my second question is \u2013 and, I guess, Ian, this again is directed to you. You and the senior management team have for some time now been signaling a desire to go bigger, doing a larger-scale transaction, and I'm just curious to know what's holding you back. It's now May 2, not that I'm impatient, but is it corporate tax reform? Is it something else? Can you remind us what you're looking for exactly, and what are the trigger points for making you decide to pull the trigger? Thanks very much. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Jami. All very good questions, and no one would ever describe you as being impatient. I'll ask Albert to make a few comments on the Xtandi performance, and then I'll put an overlay. Thank you, Albert. Albert Bourla : Thank you, and thank you, Jami, for your questions. Xtandi net sales performance in the first quarter declined 11%. However, demand grew significantly at 13%. The inconsistency of 24 points observed in demand versus revenue continues to reflect significant increase in utilization of our patient assistance programs. This was likely the result of dislocation in the reimbursement market. However, we believe that the demand for patient assistance as a percentage of total demand will stabilize, moderate gradually through 2017, and over time resolved. Now to your question if that was expected. The answer is no. This was not anticipated. Today, Xtandi is performing below our expectations in the U.S. That said, the main thesis for Xtandi is broadening both the indications towards earlier, non-metastatic lines of therapy, and the prescriber base, particularly towards urologists. This remains intact, and we remain confident in achieving both of these initiatives going forward. EMBARK, ARCHES, PROSPER \u2013 the studies that are focusing on early prostate cancer are progressing well. Also, both demand and monthly urology writers are at all-time high point for the brand. So in summary, at the moment, we continue to see significant upside for Xtandi as a brand going forward. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Albert. Let me just try and unpack a little bit of what is going on in the reimbursement market. There is a guidance, and has been for several years, in place addressing co-pay donations, which the Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General issued several years ago, which guides companies on how to appropriately provide support through independent third-party foundations to patients who have difficulty paying for their medicines. This, of course, is important in the Medicare population, and most of the early-use Xtandi, this is heavily weighed towards Medicare. A separate part of the government has recently raised questions about these donations with respect to many companies. We have engaged in a dialogue with the government about these issues. The government has expressed a view that they're not looking to shut down these foundations, or stop contributions to them. They just want to provide appropriate safeguards additionally to what the Office of Inspector General had issued. We continue to make donations to independent third-party charities, because we believe they will help ensure that patients can afford medically necessary drugs. Nevertheless, this conversation that's going on between the industry and the government, I believe, had a chilling effect on the amount of assistance patients are getting from the donation programs. We expect this to be resolved during 2017, and the market to normalize after that. This is very important for the access of many patients to these medically necessary products. Now on BD, we continue to leverage BD as a means of accelerating top and bottom line growth. From a macro standpoint, Jami, I believe the industry will continue to consolidate over time. I believe there is simply too much redundancy and fragmentation, both globally and in the U.S., for the sector to continually efficiently deliver medicines to society. Pfizer has been, and I expect will continue to be, active industry consolidators. However, there is a lack of clarity on potential tax reform, healthcare policies of the U.S., and uncertainties in the European markets both with the French election and the U.K. snap election. And on top of that, certain large companies have significant, almost binary, risks embedded within their business and pipelines, which could meaningfully alter their values. So we remain prudent in our evaluation process regardless of target size. We will continue to evaluate deals. We never say never, but I believe the current environment needs to stabilize in order to be an advantageous market for big deals. Thank you for your questions. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Ian. All right. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Bernstein. Timothy Minton Anderson : Thank you. A couple of questions. So just going back to M&A, you went after AstraZeneca once. Of course, it didn't happen. It's widely assumed you would not be able to revisit that particular target, but I'm wondering if you could. I know it's a very direct question, but given how open you guys sometimes are to questions like these, just wondering if there's anything you can say here. And then forgive me for asking the same question I asked last quarter, but can you discuss your level of commitment and enthusiasm for the IO agreement you have with Merck KGaA? Just wondering if it's in the realm of possibilities in IO, where the landscape continues to shift, if you have to remain open-minded when it comes to assessing the best way to try to become a leader in this area. And on that same topic, in the avelumab label, there is a mention of some negative side effect differentiation that seems like it could be problematic for that product. Ian C. Read: Okay. Tim. I can't speculate, as you know, on any individual companies. Clearly the U.K. as an area of interest for BD, we need a resolution of the political environment there and the willingness of the government to allow inward investment. And hopefully these elections will provide that clarify for that market in its total. As regards to Merck, an IO deal, we remain committed to developing avelumab along with, as I mentioned in my opening comments, doublet and triplet therapy. And specifically for avelumab and our development plan, to put that in context, I'd like Mikael to address what is the overall framework of our development plan and data flow, and also this issue you raised about the potential differential in the label where you claim is \u2013 well, Albert will address that. So go ahead, Mikael. Mikael Dolsten : Thank you. It's two and a half years since we initiated an alliance with Merck KGaA. And of course we are pleased that we've been able to initiate more than 30 avelumab programs, and nine are currently registration intent. We were able to get the first registration in Merkel cell carcinoma. We have a second indication under priority review. And when you look at our overall plans for avelumab, we envision that we will have one or more approvals from 2017 all the way to 2022 on an annual basis. So we think there is a really good rhythm in the program. Of course, the initial emergence of this field was with monotherapies, and I think given the heterogeneity we see in cancer, it's likely to quickly evolve to more of a combination drug play. We are pleased to have six IO combinations in the clinic now, several of them unique and position us for a strong go-forward role, pending of course data readout. That includes avelumab/4-1BB across many tumor types, and we just initiated avelumab/4-1BB/OX40. We have additional studies ongoing with either one that could be of great interest to supplement avelumab, and we also have cancer vaccines now in clinical studies. Of course, we have learned increasingly that combining IO with targeted therapy is very favorable. We have seen really robust data, as one example, combining avelumab with Inlyta in renal cell carcinoma. Some more data will be shown at ASCO, and with studies ongoing with avelumab combined with Xalkori, volitinib. We plan to initiate additional studies in the EGFR field with proprietary compounds from our pipeline. We're looking at opportunity to combine with talazoparib. And finally, we have four chemo combo trial running. So I think you will see the field unfold with a number of these opportunities, and I think we are quite well-positioned. In addition to this checkpoint combination platform, we also have additional modalities. In total we have 11 IO compounds in the clinic covering checkpoints by functional antibodies, cancer vaccines, and also CAR-T program, which I think over this period of a few years will position us for advancement and a really strong platform. Thank you. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Mikael. Albert, on the differential profile? Albert Bourla : Yes. I guess, Tim, you're referring to injection-related reactions that there is a mention in the label. First of all, it is important to note that adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug. And many do not reflect the rates observed in practice. For Bavencio, the vast majority of injection-related reactions were low grade. 97% of them were mild or moderate, grade one or two. Also less than 1% of patients stopped treatment due to them. And also in our studies, the injection- and infusion-related reactions were managed very successfully with premedication. So we think that this is nothing to be worried about. Ian C. Read: Other than that, we see a very balanced profile of avelumab compared to the other PD-L checkpoints. Okay. Next question. Chuck Triano : Thank you. Yes, next question. Operator : Your next question comes from Tony Butler from Guggenheim Securities. Tony Butler : Yes. Thanks very much. Just on the same question with respect to the infusion-related reactions. I was curious of the notion that could it be due to the ADCC activity of avelumab? Would that perhaps explain the difference, if there is one? And then second, Mikael, I would love to have some thoughts around the potential use of palbo plus avelumab. I actually heard some discussion \u2013 maybe it was nothing but chatter \u2013 at AACR that suggested maybe those two together might have some dramatic effect on a number of solid tumors outside of breast cancer. Thanks for the time. Ian C. Read: Mikael, if you could answer those, please. Mikael Dolsten : Yeah. Thank you, Tony, for raising these two questions. As Albert alluded to, these infusion-related reactions seems to be mild, transient, and hasn't been clinically an issue. I don't think there are any reason to assume it's related to a potential ADCC function. The latter, we think, could for some tumors actually be a differentiating factor, and we're exploring the possibility in some tumors to have it as an advantage. I think you raise a real interesting question. There has been some recent data suggesting that combining palbo-like compound with checkpoints could actually, in some cases, be of additive value. So we're actively looking into it in our broad effort to combine targeted therapy and avelumab. So thank you for shedding light on this, which we think has quite some interest to explore. Chuck Triano : Thank you, Mikael. Next question, please, operator? Operator : Your next question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS. Marc Goodman : Hi. Two questions. One on Ibrance. In the U.S. last quarter, you had a pretty big quarter, and we were asking if there was anything going on with inventories, and you had said no. And this quarter it looks a little bit light. I was just curious if maybe there was some inventory that you picked up later or what's happening. Can you just give us a sense of the number of patients and the share? What's going on there? And then second of all, Mikael, you talked about a lot of the pipeline stuff with respect to IO. Can you talk about some of the other pipeline assets we should be watching for that are non-IO? Thanks. Ian C. Read: Albert, please? Albert Bourla : No, we are very happy with the performance of Ibrance this quarter, and of course \u2013 no, there was not material moving inventories. We achieved revenues of almost $680 million, which was 59% growth. And our internal market shares are around 50s for the first line, and the 40s and 30s in second line and third line, respectively. We had this quarter more than 7,000 new patients that came to the brand. And we had more than 61,000 total scripts this quarter. To remind you, from the beginning of the launch, we have more than 360,000 scripts in total. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Albert. Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : Yeah. Thank you. I'm pleased with your interest in our really robust pipeline. We have 96 programs in clinical development. We have over the last years since 2011 had 21 approvals, three to four per year, on average two NMEs. And we envision in 2017 and 2018 up to 10 approvals. So we continue to have a pipeline that can deliver really robust flow of approvals including NMEs. I'll highlight some compounds outside IO starting in Oncology with the CDK platform. You may have noted that we plan to start a trial for HER2+/ER+ breast cancer, which I think opens up a really interesting field combining Ibrance, palbociclib, with HER2-active drugs. We have several programs now ongoing to also deal with a growing number of patients that will progress eventually through CDK-like drugs into resistance, and that's a field where I think we can lead through several ongoing trials in our pipeline. Targeted NME outside the CDK area, we have had positive data in AML with glasdegib, which is our first in class for blood cancers agent, and we're looking to summarize those data, engage with agency about a possible filing based upon Phase 2 data. There was a readout of talazoparib, the EMBRACA study, that I think could also open up an interesting opportunity for that pipeline asset. And of course in line, we have numerous trials. Recently we got breakthrough designation for lorlatinib, which I think is the best-in-class ALK inhibitor second generation. Its unique mutation has brain-penetrant activity. And we also have a finalized Phase 3 study with dacomitinib for another segment, EGFR-activated lung cancers, that will be soon reported in a conference. We spoke in the introduction about the Prevnar 13 vaccine, and you're obviously aware that we have initiated Phase 3 with C. difficile, which is very unique designed vaccine. And we expect to early next year put in an RSV vaccine, again with a unique Pfizer leading technology. Ian spoke about our I&I platform with our inject drugs. We'll have later this year a readout for our inject one drug in atopic dermatitis, and I'm very enthusiastic, based on a lot of supporting science, for that aspect. And our unique JAK1/2, the most advanced with its profile in the industry, has entered into a platform with numerous trials \u2013 ulcerative colitis, alopecia, psoriasis \u2013 and the drug looks really promising with its unique dual activity. Finally, mentioning the NASH, as Ian took that into his introduction, we have had a positive Phase 1b readout of our ACC drug in NASH. We have positive proof-of-mechanism data emerging from our KHK drug in NASH, and we have two other NASH drugs that are in or moving into the clinic with quite some promise. So I think that's another platform that you should keep an eye on for Pfizer. And I'll end with the Rare Disease. In addition to the gene therapy platform, we have now enrolled to the target for domagrozumab, our anti-myostatin drug in DMD, and we actually have tafamidis that you may not have kept an eye on that's going to read out likely next year in cardiomyopathy, which again could open up a big opportunity for us. Chuck Triano : Thank you, Mikael. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi. Andrew S. Baum: Thank you. Couple of questions, please. For Mikael, could you update us on the patent extension for Ibrance/palbo? I just saw that you filed a second letter following up with the patent authority following initial letter in 2015. Is there any risk that you don't get sought-after patent extension, given the importance of that product? Second, could you comment \u2013 I know it's early days \u2013 but whether you're seeing any impact of rebates and pricing from Novartis's ribociclib on Ibrance, either at the physician or more importantly at the PBM level? And then finally a question for Ian. Given Tom Price's comments yesterday about dramatic cuts in drug pricing won't take three years, does he see any risk that drug pricing becomes more vulnerable given the President's intent to support tax or broader ACA repeal? Ian C. Read: Okay. Let's look at the patent issue. You know, Andrew, we don't have any significant changes to our patent position or estate with palbo, so we'll look into that and let you know. You may have spotted some filing we did, but the patent estate remains intact and strong, and we have no issues around that. I'll ask Albert to talk about the incipient competition from Novartis. Albert Bourla : Yes. Andrew, we are very confident in the future of Ibrance and its continued growth and leadership. We have established Ibrance as a standard of care in metastatic breast cancer. Two years, 10,000 prescribers, 50,000 pilot patients \u2013 55,000 patients in the U.S. alone. And this is a testament not only to its efficacy with over two years PFS, but also to its manageable safe and tolerability profile, with no cardio or liver monitoring required. Last but not least, we have great access for our patients. We price our products appropriately to their value. We have managed successfully priced competition in the past, and we will do it in the future. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Albert. Really quick general question on pricing. Look, questions around drug pricing have been around since I've been in the industry. The reality is twofold. Number one, drug pricing, pricing of innovative branded medicines, are low \u2013 low-single-digit increases in recent years. So in 2016 (sic) [2015], the net price increase of branded drugs was about 2.8%. That was in 2015. And in 2014, it was about 5%. And we don't have 2016's numbers yet. So the cold reality, the facts that policy makers are looking at, is that drug prices, net drug prices, are not a cause of inflation in healthcare. On the other hand, they produce huge value both for the industry, for the GDP, and also for patients. What we're seeing, I believe, is that \u2013 and this may be part of any type of healthcare reform, is the fact that the insurers have, because of the exchanges, have moved to put large co-pays and large total deductibles into their business model, which includes first dollar on pharmaceuticals. So individuals are now suffering in absence of good insurance on pharmaceuticals because they have to burn through sometimes a $6,000 deductible before they get any real relief. So I think those are the type of issues that need to be looked at to ensure that any healthcare reform ensures access to important medicines, a level playing field so that as any subsidies that are given by the government are evenly spread today under the ACA, under the plans, the hospital out-of-pocket for patients is 3%; the out-of-pocket for patients is 15% on drugs. So I think these are the type of things we want to see happen in healthcare reform. Reforms in the way that we can be more competitive in the generic market, where we can be more competitive in offering programs to hospitals and managed care, and that I think is the line that we need to take and I think \u2013 I believe \u2013 the Trump administration will look at, how is to make their market more competitive. Thank you. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Ian. Next question, please, operator? Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen. Steve Scala : Thank you. A couple questions. Pfizer guidance for Prevnar in 2017 is flat to slightly down. With Q1 down 7% to 8%, presumably the franchise will need to grow at some point in 2017 to get to the full-year guidance. So is that your expectation, a return to growth in 2017? And should we expect that to continue in 2018? And then second question, final OS data for palbo plus letrozole will be presented at OS from the Phase 2 study. The interim was not statistically significant. Could you help us set an expectation relative to your ability of hitting OS when we see the data at ASCO? Thank you. Ian C. Read: Albert, would you like to talk about the first question on Prevnar, please? Albert Bourla : Yes, absolutely. We continue to believe and expect that Prevnar 13 will be flat to declining this year. Slightly declining this year, exactly as we have said it in the past. With the first quarter, the 7% decline in the U.S. is driven by the U.S. adult that went down 32%. As previously discussed, we have already vaccinated approximately 50% of the 65-plus population, and we were expecting that because we are comparing it to a very, very strong quarter of last year. We expect that this decline in adult will continue but will be partially offset by growth of adult vaccinations in the 18 to 64 age range, and in addition is also expected to be partially offset by international adult growth in developed markets. In Europe, for example, this quarter the adult went up 25%. Also, I want to note that it is very common to have volatility in overall vaccines sales because they are highly dependent from governmental purchases that the timing can vary quarter by quarter. Ian C. Read: Thank you. So net-net, we expect to meet our original guidance on Prevnar. Frank A. D'Amelio: No change. Albert Bourla : No change. Flat to slight decline. Ian C. Read: Thank you. Mikael, within the rules of embargoed data and everything, what can you say? Mikael Dolsten : Thank you, Ian, for adding that perspective. I can only say that the confidence in Ibrance is extremely high among us and all stakeholders. Of course you're aware that Ibrance was recently given full approval, which underlines the strength in data across numerous advances in metastatic breast cancer segments. And the PFS data has been very robust. Durability is up to almost two years of use of the drugs and a delta of 10 months. OS data in these type of indications, in general, are something that you always need to be aware is difficult to interpret it as patients that go off trial can embark on a variety of different treatments. That's why we think the PFS data has been the strong indicator of the performance of this drug. But we look forward, of course, to share the entire profile and OS data at ASCO. Ian C. Read: Thank you. Chuck Triano : Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Christopher Schott : Great. Thanks very much. Just had two questions here. Maybe first can you \u2013 a biosimilar question on two sides here. So maybe first talk about what you're seeing in Europe with Enbrel and how that has been playing out relative to your expectations? And on the flip side can you maybe talk about Inflectra and how you're thinking about the U.S. launch as we go through this year? My second question was coming back to business development and priorities. Appreciate the earlier comments, Ian, but \u2013 and maybe to paraphrase it sounds like the environment for larger deals might not be ideal today given some of these uncertainties around tax and binary events for certain targets, but that could change over time. I guess my question is how does that dynamic impact your thoughts on mid-sized transactions? Let's just say Medivation or larger. Is that an area where you still see opportunity? Or are you looking to keep powder dry in the event one of these larger transactions does in fact become available? Thanks very much. Ian C. Read: Yes, I'm going to ask Albert to deal with the European situation on Enbrel, and then Inflectra, John. And I'll deal with the BD. Look, we in BD we don't see it as an or, but we see it as an and. We think we have the capability if there is value in a deal to do what you would call a mid-size. I would say given our market cap, probably a little less than a mid-size, of the type of deals that we've done. But we also believe we have the ability, should the opportunity arise and should the value be there, to do a large deal. But as I stressed, we do want to see these uncertainties in the marketplace resolve themselves around tax and the politics, healthcare reform, French elections, British elections, et cetera, et cetera. Frank, Do you want to add anything to that? Frank A. D'Amelio: Just \u2013 and our actions suggest we've done that, right? Ian C. Read: Yeah. Frank A. D'Amelio: When you look at the last year and a half, we've done about almost $40 billion in mid-size deals. To the extent that we see mid-size deals that we think make sense, we'll pursue them. Ian C. Read: Right. And Enbrel in Europe, Albert? Albert Bourla : Yes, Chris, this quarter, as you have seen, Enbrel achieved almost $600 million of revenues, $588 million to be accurate. That was down 18% operationally versus the first quarter of 2016 and of course reflects the negative impact from Biosimilars in Europe that were launched late in last year, in 2016. Also, this decline reflects some mandated price reductions that we had to take in a few countries. So far, from the limited pricing we have seen to date for Benepali, the discount levels are in line with our expectations and we expect Enbrel's pricing to be competitive. This year we expect continued modest uptake for Benepali, but also we expect introductions of one to two additional biosimilars, likely before the end of the year. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Albert. John? John Young : Okay. Thanks for the question, Chris. So obviously we remain very positive about the opportunity for Inflectra in the U.S. Just as a reminder, the U.S. launch of Inflectra represented the first launch of biosimilar infliximab in the United States. Based on the size of the originator business, we see significant potential for Inflectra as the first biosimilar in the U.S. to Remicade. While the launch is in the early stages, customer reception has been very positive, and Inflectra is now available through both national and regional wholesalers, and multiple GPO contracts are in place. We've seen increased access to Inflectra. And we estimate that over half of commercial lives and about 100% of Medicare and Medicaid lives are covered. So far, discounting has been in line with our expectations, and we remain confident that our contracting status is offering appropriate pricing flexibility. And, as we've always said, we expect that biosimilar adoption will be gradual at first but accelerate as physicians build their own clinical experience with both new patients and switch patients. We saw the same with Inflectra in Europe, and in the third year of launch in Europe, infliximab biosimilars have now reached something like 41% of total infliximab volume. So we'll see a slow but steady uptake in the U.S., which is in line with our expectations. And we remain very confident that we have the right strategies in place to bring Inflectra to patients in the U.S. Ian C. Read: Thank you, John. Chuck Triano : Thanks, John. We'd like to on to the next questioner, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Umer Raffat : Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. Ian, you guys have clearly made a lot of progress on initiating a bunch of Phase 3 trials for avelumab. My question is specifically on the contract you have with Merck KGaA. And there's been some feedback that there's a multibillion-dollar breakup fee if you were to ever consider walking away. Can you help clarify that, number one? And then perhaps one for Mikael. Mikael, there's a program we're trying to look into, Prevnar 20. Just trying to understand what the current status is, any gating factors, and when you reasonably expect it could enter a potential pivotal trial. Thank you very much. Ian C. Read: Well, our contract with Merck is confidential, but we remain focused on developing avelumab, and I really think that's all I would say on that. I don't think that any type of breakup fee would be material compared to the size of a large deal. So \u2013 but as I always say, we said we're committed to this partnership, and we have a lot of trials ongoing there. Mikael Dolsten : Thank you, Umar, for noticing our pneumococcal next-generation vaccine with 20-valent approach, which is likely the most comprehensive vaccine developed. And we are very pleased with the progress we have made. We have concluded a comprehensive Phase 1 trial. We think data emerging is encouraging, and we're preparing our plans and regulatory dialogues how to move swiftly \u2013 move it forward to subsequent trials. And I think we will be able, given our tremendous expertise in analytics of these complex vaccines, immunogenicity, and how to design clinical studies, to move very swiftly after finalizing proper regulatory dialogues. Chuck Triano : Thank you, Mikael. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Richard Purkiss from Piper Jaffray. Richard J. Purkiss: Well, thanks, guys. Could Albert maybe give us a perspective on how he sees the RA market outside the U.S. developing, just given the increasing complexity there with TNF, brands, biosimilars, other biologics, now JAKs? And then just a quick one on Ibrance. Can you just update us on when we might see data from the PALLET study? Thanks. Ian C. Read: Okay. So I don't think Albert \u2013 you came a bit low over the speaker. So, Albert, it's how do you see the RA development given the multiplicity of TNF factors in there and the fact that we'll be the only company with a JAK in that marketplace orally, the only oral treatment really beyond \u2013 a modern oral treatment. What's your view of that marketplace? Albert Bourla : Yes. Thank you very much. We are very enthusiastic about Xeljanz. We are very enthusiastic because we are expanding geographically with Xeljanz. We are going to Europe and other places, and we're also expanding therapeutically with potential new indications in psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis. Now, as regards to the rheumatoid arthritis that you spoke, we had 27% growth overall for Xeljanz. 21% was in the U.S. The scripts were a little bit higher at 25%. This growth was mainly driven by increased confidence as an effective agent. Also, inclusion in the ACR guidelines of Xeljanz, that played an important role. We are growing brand awareness among patients. And last but not least, we are improving access with Xeljanz in rheumatoid arthritis. As I said, growth of revenues although high at 21% were lower than the scripts, and this was negatively impacted by some timing of purchases but also unfavorable channel mix in this quarter because we had a little bit more Medicaid than we were expecting and some rebates higher. But we expect to return to much higher growth next quarter. Ian C. Read: Yeah, we're very enthusiastic on Xeljanz, as Albert said. Look, we have an opportunity to be the JAK in the marketplace for rheumatoid arthritis, oral, twice-a-day use in combination with trexate or monotherapy. So we see this position existing for some time in the U.S. So really strongly behind the development of this product that is very efficacious. Now on the PALLET, Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : Yeah, I'm happy to comment that \u2013 we really appreciate your interest in Ibrance studies that are indicative on large potential in early breast cancer. And of course Ibrance has been recruiting and showing a great interest from all participants in this space because of its fabulous profile, very well-tolerated. There is no need for monitoring of liver or cardiac events, which would be quite an issue for patients in that type of very early disease. And it doesn't have a lot of gastrointestinal adverse events, which also would limit the ease of use in drugs. So that has been all great experiences we have. PALLET studies using early breast cancer and using a neoadjuvant approach to get insight into the efficacy. We had earlier a trial by Washington University in a very similar setting that showed very robust effects on Ibrance in this setting on tumor size and also on biomarkers for tumor proliferation. The PALLET study primary completion day will be early fall this year, and you will, at proper conference, hear the data. And I'm quite encouraged given the previous performance that this would add further confidence about the great opportunity for Ibrance across many breast cancer segments and potential in the future for early breast cancer. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Mikael. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank. Gregg Gilbert : Thank you. Three quick ones. First, do you see a rationale for looking at continuous dosing for Ibrance? And if you don't, is that because of side effect profile or you just don't believe that it brings anything to the table from an efficacy standpoint? Secondly, for John. I think in light of the EpiPen recall and the generic Copaxone delay and some other recalls of injectables, can you update us on the progress in rectifying some of the legacy quality issues? And lastly for Ian, Bristol has hinted that it will go after PD-1 and PD-L1 therapies based on its IP portfolio, as it did with Merck in extracting that large settlement. Can you comment on your confidence in your freedom to operate in the IO space? Thanks. Ian C. Read: Okay. I'll ask Albert to address the... Albert Bourla : Continuous dosing. Ian C. Read: ...dosing. Albert Bourla : Yes. There is no evidence currently to suggest that continuous dosing leads to better efficacy. Ultimately, Phase 3 results will demonstrate the extent of efficacy improvement, and of course relatively to the impact of continuous dosing on the safety profile of a given CDK inhibitor. Now, from the patient experience perspective, we need to take into account those interruptions and reductions. For example, abemaciclib is taken twice daily, whereas Ibrance is taken only once daily, which may be more convenient for patients. In addition, a dosing schedule of three weeks on, one week off may be preferable to patients. Many of them, they like this break. So I don't think that there is anything in continuous dosing. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Albert. John, on the McPherson position. John Young : Okay. So thanks for the question, Gregg. So allow me to say we're obviously disappointed with the outcome of recent regulatory inspections at some of our manufacturing facilities, including McPherson. Pfizer takes these matters extremely seriously. We've implemented corrective and preventive actions to address issues identified by the FDA. We are making all the investments necessary to satisfy the items identified during the recent inspections, and our goal is to have these issues remediated in a timely fashion. This includes both capital investments as well as obviously exchanging experiences and capabilities across the whole of the Pfizer network. So we remain confident that we will be able to remediate these issues, and we're working closely with the FDA in order to be able to do so. Ian C. Read: Yeah. I would just add to what John said. The actual inspections were recently of Hospira. They were within, I believe, the first nine months of our acquisition. So the data in the 483s are based on a view of the plan as a year and a half ago or year ago. So we have made progress. We continue to make progress. And we believe that our plans to rectify those observations are well underway. I think that was it. Chuck Triano : The IP. Ian C. Read: IP. Look, I have no reason to have concerns about our IP estate on avelumab. Chuck Triano : Thank you, Ian. Next question, please, operator? Operator : Your next question comes from John Boris from SunTrust. John T. Boris: Thanks for taking the questions. Just have a couple. Just back to the original question on Medivation, Ian, is \u2013 when we did our original analysis, it seemed to get a return on this investment that was heavily weighted on the pipeline. In light of some of the issues related to (1:02:22) prescribing going forward, do you continue to believe you can generate a return on this that's above your weighted average cost of capital? The second question on the established health products group. We saw some information come across, Frank, that you're looking to divest or bundle together some products. Can you give some information around those products and the operating margin around those products and the timing for divestiture? And then lastly, Mikael, you indicated in 2017 and 2018 there'd be 10 approvals. How many of those would be NMEs, and what are the NMEs that you're being graded for approval? Thanks. Ian C. Read: Okay. Why don't I ask John to deal with your question, and then Mikael can talk about the NMEs and the approvals, and I'll come back on the Medivation. John Young : Yeah, so thanks for the question, John. So we've been very clear that one of the things \u2013 that as part of our active portfolio management strategy, we want to be very focused on \u2013 is with core segments of our business, such as our portfolio in Emerging Markets, such as our Sterile Injectable business and Biosimilars. We will be very invested in making sure that we can grow those portfolios. But to the point of your question, we're obviously clear that across what is a very broad portfolio of products, not all of those products are necessarily core to our business. And some of them are declining because they're in a position where they're post-LOE. And so we've been very clear that one of the things that we will assess is whether there are opportunities for some products or portfolios to create greater shareholder value outside of Pfizer than inside of Pfizer. So that process is ongoing. We have identified some portfolios that are noncore to our business, and we will assess opportunities to create value for our shareholders as the opportunity presents itself. I would just add that one example of that strategy at work was the divestment of the Hospira infusion Systems business, as Frank said, we completed in the first quarter. And we will remain very vigilant and active in seeking to create value across this business, both by growing core portfolios, as well as by assessing the opportunities for value creation through divestment. Ian C. Read: Thank you. Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : Yes. So we see up to 10 potential key approvals in 2017 and 2018, and we see a rhythm continuing in 2019, 2020, and 2021 where we have some really large opportunities in our pipeline. In the 2017 and 2018, about two-thirds will be in Oncology. The remaining likely Immunology, Biosimilars, Internal Medicine. I'll mention, of course you're projecting what can happen in the future, so I will just give example of assets that are in the peri-registration phase. The outcome of those assets is of course pending the regulatory review. But you have assets such as elotuzumab, which has priority review. You have our partnership with Merck on ertugliflozin alone and combined with metformin, as well as Januvia. You have our recent breakthrough designated drug, lorlatinib, for patients with progression on ALK+. It also has activity on ROS tumors, and you have example of the Biosimilar portfolio as well as some really interesting salient indications that are in this registration phase, psoriatic arthritis. You have Sutent as the first drug to conclude an adjuvant trial. So it's a nice mix of assets with a various profile, and I think some of them represent really novel modalities, like elotuzumab antibody-drug conjugate; some represent our stronghold in targeted agents. And I think a nice mix of agents here. Ian C. Read: And to the extent that it's a combo product with a 4-1BB or OX40, it's new entity coming into the marketplace. Okay. On Xtandi, Frank, why don't you answer that question, as you're the guru capital of returns? Frank A. D'Amelio: Sure. So, John, I'll start by saying that we continue to expect our return on capital for that transaction to exceed our cost of capital. Now, the performance to date is less than we had planned for. Ian and Albert have explained why that is on the call. But, as we've said all along, the real critical pivot point for that deal is the non-metastatic, the earlier stage prostate cancer. We remain confident in our ability to get approval for those indications. That's the pivotal point relative to that. Ian C. Read: And I do believe at this time that this dislocation in the reimbursement market is temporary in nature. Chuck Triano : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. David R. Risinger: Thanks very much. So I have two questions for Frank, please. The first is, could you comment on the outlook for margins beyond 2017? Obviously you are not providing guidance, but just wanted a framework for how to think about it with respect to how you plan to offset negative mix shift when U.S. Viagra and U.S. Lyrica expire? Obviously there'll be more of a mix shift towards other franchises, including emerging markets that are lower margin. And then, second, if you could just update us on the total cash and ex U.S. cash at Pfizer, and if you don't have the end of March, just remind us where you were at the end of December? Thank you. Frank A. D'Amelio: Sure. So, Dave, on U.S. cash, I'll go through the end of December. At the end of the year, we had $25 billion in cash, short-term investments, and long-term investments. And what we always say is, at any point in time, no more than $10 billion of that is in the U.S., and obviously the majority of it being outside the U.S. We'll give an update on the balance sheet when we issue our 10-Q this quarter. In terms of the outlook for margins, beyond 2017 \u2013 let me talk about 2017 first, and then I would talk about a rhythm beyond 2018, which is if you look at 2017, we have significant LOEs in 2017. Call it almost $2.5 billion. Yet I've looked at our margins; our margins are still very good relative to last year. For example, our gross margin is actually improving. Our cost of sales is lower than last year. And it gets to the mix of business, which you alluded to. So think about, even though we're losing some of the high-octane margin products from LOEs, things like alliance revenues, where we're getting significant growth in Eliquis, significant growth in Xtandi, those have no associated costs, so they have a really significant positive impact on our margins, and you see that in our 2017 guidance. Net-net, beyond 2017, as of now, we don't see any major changes in our margin profile. Chuck Triano : Thank you, Frank. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Holford from Jefferies. Jeffrey Holford : Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question. I just wondered if you can go into the alliance revenues just in a little bit more detail for us. They're obviously quite difficult for us to model and follow. I wonder if you can break it down a little bit more, just in terms of the drivers and dynamics within that number. Thank you. Ian C. Read: Go ahead, Frank. Frank A. D'Amelio: So \u2013 by the way, what we did this quarter is, if you look on page 28 of our product tables and the attachments to the release, we've actually broken it out now. So you can see, if you look up at the top of the page, \"Eliquis alliance revenues and direct sales,\" and obviously the bulk of that is alliance revenues, $564 million. You go down a little bit further, you'll see \"Xtandi alliance revenues,\" $130 million. And then if you go down below, you see \"Total Alliance revenues\" at the very bottom of the page, which is $656 million. So you can easily reverse-engineer what the Eliquis direct sales were. I mean, it's very simple to do. Just take the alliance revenue, subtract Xtandi, and it'll give you the residual, which is essentially Eliquis alliance revenue. So we've broken that out for you. We've given you additional detail on that starting this quarter. Chuck Triano : Great. Thanks for the clarity, Frank. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets. Alex Arfaei : Good morning, folks. Thank you for taking the questions. Most of my questions have been answered. Ian, a higher level question on R& D productivity : While I appreciate the earlier comments on your pipeline, as I look at the Street expectations for what will be the key growth drivers, most of them come from acquisitions. It seems as though the focus is always more on what you're going to buy as opposed to what's coming out from your pipeline. So just wondering, what are your thoughts on your R&D productivity? Is it meaningful enough to drive growth, and is there anything you can do structurally to improve it? Thank you. Ian C. Read: Alex, thank you. Normally most big pharmaceutical companies have a component of their growth from business development, and I don't think ours is out of weight with the rest of the industry. I do think we have very productive R&D with potentially very large products coming. You've got the whole line extensions of Ibrance, which was internally discovered and developed. We have our C. difficile vaccine, which is internally developed. We have a Staph aureus vaccine, which is internally developed. We have a lot of substrate coming out of Immunology & Inflammation. So \u2013 and our cancer, we have most of our productivity there is coming from the \u2013 what we believe is coming from the doublets and the triplets (1:12:24) So I think our R&D productivity is good. It can always be better. I think every conversation I have with Mikael is more, faster. We have robust mechanisms, and we continue to improve them to measure productivity, to understand from Phase 1 to Phase 2, from Phase 2 to Phase 3, from time lags between those. There is a constant push in this organization to improve productivity. But overall I'm pleased with the strength of our internal development, and I'm pleased with our external acquisitions, and I think the mix is appropriate. Thank you. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Ian. And if we can take our last question, please, operator. Operator : Your final question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Geoffrey Meacham : Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to revisit Xtandi a little bit. When you look at the opportunity among urologists, have you guys seen script volume per doc or number of urologists writing a script increase? And what would be your view as a tipping point? Is it data and M-zero? And one for Ian. When you look at the P&L impact of a deal, the law of large numbers always comes into play for Pfizer. So would you expect to revisit a split or a larger-scale spinout at some point if the deal opportunities aren't a fit? Thank you. Ian C. Read: Albert? Albert Bourla : Yeah, so basically you're speaking about the growth potential of Xtandi in the metastatic setting, which is currently the current indication, because as we discussed, we have great expectations for the upcoming early non-metastatic. So we believe that there is a lot of room to grow here. The novel form of therapies are about 55% of the total market, so there is room for expansion, and we believe that will continue showing growth. The total demand was up 13%, as I say, in the first quarter, despite the fact that was affected, the total demand, by the lack of assistance for some patients that they cannot afford their co-pays, and they are not eligible for free drug that we are provide. The number of urologists prescribing has reached a all-time high. We have 1,500 urologists prescribing right now the brand. And a recent market research saw the significant increase in prescribing intent by both oncologists and urologists that were aware of the TERRAIN data versus those that were not aware. I want to remind you that the TERRAIN data that came out recently and have been already incorporated in our label saw a reduction of risk of radiographic progression or death by 40% compared to Casodex, which is the main product that urologists are prescribing today. And also we are taking several actions to make sure that this is happening. We are engaging with payers and implementing successful strategies to ensure optimal access to Xtandi. For example, effective, we believe, next quarter, in second quarter, we have regained full access of Xtandi with two large payers, PBMs. Also the commercial team now is focused on leveraging the Pfizer scale, and portfolio synergies to drive growth. And that includes leveraging existing Pfizer urologist sales representatives that have current relationships with urologists, and now they will support also Xtandi. And of course also we expect to accelerate Xtandi growth by focusing on educating physicians, and particularly urologists, on the updated label, positive experience with Xtandi in the metastatic prostate cancer market. Ian C. Read: Thank you. Regarding your question on size and the size of the company and the need for deals to make a difference, we have always said that we continue to review on an ongoing basis our total portfolio. We look at what are the ways to maximize shareholder value, and we look at all the large segments of our business to ensure that their value inside Pfizer is greater than what we believe their value outside of Pfizer would be. So that is an ongoing effort. So there would need to be a triggering event for us to relook at the Essential business being separated. Now, remember, our four questions were : Is it functioning well inside the company; is it maximizing inside? Do we believe it could do a better job outside of the company? Is there trapped value? Can it be released in a tax-efficient manner? So those are still relevant questions. So a triggering event, major tax reform or a major change in the way we allocate our resources, would of course cause us to review all of our portfolio with that same lens. Thank you. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Ian, and thanks, everybody, for your attention on the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude Pfizer's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to Pfizer's second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Charles E. Triano: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer's second quarter 2017 performance. I'm joined today by our Chairman and CEO Ian Read; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Albert Bourla, Group President of Pfizer Innovative Health; John Young, Group President of Pfizer Essential Health; and Doug Lankler, General Counsel. The slides that will be presented on this call can be viewed on our website, pfizer.com/investors. Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussion during this conference call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties is discussed under the Disclosure Notice section in the earnings release, as well as in Pfizer's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K including in Part 1, Item 1a, Risk Factors. And this is filed with the SEC and available at sec.gov and on our website at pfizer.com. The forward-looking statements during this conference call speak only as of the original date of the call, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements. Discussions during the call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's current report on Form 8-K dated today, August 1, 2017. You can obtain a copy of the Form 8-K on our website, pfizer.com/investors. Any non-GAAP measures presented are not and should not be viewed as substitutes for financial measures required by U.S. GAAP. They have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to the calculations of similar measures at other companies. We will now make prepared remarks, and then we'll move to a question and answer session. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian? Ian C. Read: Thank you, Chuck, and good morning. During my remarks today, I will briefly talk about the progress and opportunities within each of our businesses and the areas where we see the greatest potential in our pipeline. Year to date, our performance is on plan, and the results for the quarter are operationally comparable with the prior-year quarterly performance. If you exclude the impact of the Hospira Infusion Systems divestiture and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, revenues for the quarter increased 2% operationally compared to the prior-year quarter. We also raised the midpoint of our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range for the year. When you look at our projected adjusted diluted earnings per share growth for this year and add the dividend yield, it is approximately 11%. I'll begin with a few words regarding the performance of each of our businesses, beginning with Pfizer Innovative Health. This business had another strong quarter, growing its top line by 9% operationally, driven by the performance of the core brands that are key revenue drivers : notably Ibrance, Eliquis, and Xeljanz. Their solid performance is enabling us to improve our growth profile through continued market penetration and the potential for additional new indications that are nearer term with Xeljanz and in the future of Ibrance. For example, we have submitted regulatory filings for two potentially new indications for Xeljanz in psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis. As you may know, later this week there's an FDA Arthritis Advisory Committee meeting to vote on a recommendation for a psoriatic arthritis indication. Now a few comments on the performance of Xtandi. This quarter we continue to see strong underlying demand. Total sales were $300.7 million in quarter two 2017, up 10% from first quarter 2017, which translated into 8% growth for Pfizer's Xtandi alliance revenues. Of note, the number of urologists actively prescribing Xtandi in a given month reached an all-time high in May. This is a key factor, given that increasing Xtandi prescribing by urologists was one of the commercial opportunities we identified for Xtandi prior to the acquisition. I would note that the patient assistance program proportion of total demand was comparable with the first quarter. We expect that the patient assistance program utilization will normalize as we move into next year. We're also excited about the amendment to the protocol of the Phase 3 PROSPER trial of Xtandi in non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, or CRPC. We believe this will accelerate the timeline for potentially expanding the indication for Xtandi to include non-metastatic CRPC by two years. With our collaboration partner Astellas, we anticipate having top line data later this year and soon hope to provide Xtandi to more men with earlier stages of prostate cancer. Expanding the indication for Xtandi is another key factor and a value driver for realizing the product's full commercial potential as we continue to conduct trials evaluating the use of Xtandi in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, allowing us to potentially move into even earlier settings, including the ARCHES trial in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer and the EMBARK trial in non-metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. Regarding the PARP inhibitor talazoparib, enrollment in the EMBRACA Phase 3 study in germline BRCA-positive breast cancer closed in April of this year, and we're expecting top line results by January of next year. We continue to be very confident on the potential of the molecule and have an aggressive development plan that includes monotherapy and combinations with checkpoint inhibitors. In addition to breast cancer, we are evaluating the potential to develop talazoparib in prostate cancer and in combination with avelumab in various tumor types. Overall, we remain confident that the Medivation acquisition was a good investment that will deliver value for the patients we serve and our shareholders. As you know, we closed the Anacor acquisition last year. We are seeing a solid uptake in the demand for Eucrisa. Sequential prescription demand increased more than two-and-a-half-fold. Due to the timing of building the inventory, which is normal during the initial launch period, net revenues did not follow the same pattern of growth. We expect this will normalize when we move forward, and we'll start seeing net revenue sequentially grow in quarter three. In our vaccine business for Prevnar 13, the recommendations and associated reimbursement in key EU countries for Prevnar 13 in the adult population have taken longer than anticipated. I would note that in the EU reimbursement is a second step, which differs from the U.S., where ACIP governs both. We continue to work in securing additional recommendations and reimbursement programs within the EU adult population. Turning now to Pfizer Essential Health. While revenues for the quarter declined, we saw good operational growth in emerging markets and in Biosimilars, primarily in certain developed markets. Within Biosimilars, Inflectra uptake in the U.S. is being driven by a number of factors, including Inflectra's clinical package, patient support programs, price differentials versus innovators by channel, and the access reimbursement environment. To date, reimbursement coverage has been mixed. While we achieved 100% Medicare coverage, we have experienced access challenges among national commercial payers, where our lower price product has not received access at parity to the innovative product and remains in a disadvantaged position despite recent price increases taken by the innovative product. Given our extensive experience working with commercial payers, we will look at all relevant factors impacting reimbursement to determine next steps to enable greater access for Inflectra. In aggregate, we have a strong Biosimilars portfolio and remain on track with our plans to file six biosimilar assets in the U.S. As we saw this quarter, the PEH business continues to be impacted by LOE events, specifically Pristiq in the U.S. We also faced two upcoming events : Viagra in the U.S. later this year and Lyrica in the U.S. at the end of 2018. To counter these headwinds, the PEH business is refining and strengthening its portfolio to ultimately pivot the business to grow. One example is a focus on our anti-infectives. Late last year we acquired AstraZeneca's small molecule anti-infective business, and we just completed a license agreement with Basilea for the commercialization rights in Europe for Cresemba, a novel antifungal treatment for potential life-threatening fungal infections among immunocompromised patients. The scale and global reach of our PEH business is unparalleled in the industry. With its broad portfolio that span 600 essential medicines, it impacts the lives of more than 300 million patients in about 160 countries. Emerging markets play a key role in enabling the business to achieve its growth objectives. This quarter PEH revenues in emerging markets grew 5% operationally year over year. The most robust revenue growth came from the largest areas of PEH businesses within the emerging markets, namely legacy established brands and sterile injectables. Turning now to the pipeline. We have a strong pipeline with a steady flow of scientific innovation coming from Pfizer's key therapeutic areas. Over the next five years, we project the potential for about 25 to 30 approvals, of which up to 15 have the potential to be blockbusters. And we believe half of these potential blockbusters could achieve approval by 2020. The most noteworthy highlights include : In Oncology, we see an opportunity for five different potential blockbuster approvals over the five years, including Xtandi in non-metastatic prostate cancer and Ibrance in early adjuvant breast cancer. We also see the opportunity for a number of Bavencio IO combinations, including doublets and triplets such as targeted combinations like avelumab and Inlyta or (11:59) IOi combinations like avelumab plus 4-1BB. And we believe we have a leadership opportunity with Bavencio combined with chemotherapy for ovarian and head and neck cancer indications. In Vaccines, we see the opportunity for three potential blockbusters, including our next-generation valent pneumococcal vaccine, which is in Phase 1 and we are working to accelerate given the continued burden of disease. We plan to start Phase 2 by the fourth quarter of this year. In addition, our C. difficile vaccine is in Phase 3, and Staph aureus vaccine in Phase 2b, both of which have fast-track designation. In Inflammation & Immunology, we are in the registration phase for Xeljanz in ulcerative colitis and psoriatic arthritis in the U.S. We have a comprehensive program of several unique next-generation JAK inhibitors across multiple dermatological, gastrointestinal, and rheumatological indications. We have recently completed a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study for our JAK1 selective oral molecule in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis and are assessing the data with the potential to advance the program. In Rare Disease and Internal Medicines, we have several pivotal Phase 2 and Phase 3 programs ongoing. This includes a Phase 2 trial for Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and Phase 3 trial for rivipansel for sickle-cell disease, tafamidis in TTR cardiomyopathy, and tanezumab for chronic pain. And in Biosimilars we have several assets across major cancer and inflammatory diseases which we believe are high-value opportunities. In total there are 14 distinct biosimilar assets in the pipeline, eight of which are in mid- to late-stage development, and six assets are in early-stage. In summary, the business is executing on our strategy. Our Innovative business is generating strong growth and is positioned to continue this growth. Our Essential Health business has well-documented revenue growth challenges in the near term given the upcoming LOE events but generates very strong cash flow, and it's working to solidify long-term growth drivers within its portfolio. We see a very attractive next wave of noteworthy pipeline products potentially starting in the next two years, and we expect there will not be a significant impact from expected LOEs during the period 2020 through 2025. Given this backdrop, over the near term our focus is to maximize the market opportunities we see for our inline portfolio as we continue to advance the pipeline while managing our cost structure and delivering attractive financial performance. Our businesses and our people are well-prepared and stand ready to meet the challenges posed by the uncertainties that exist domestically and in the global markets where we operate. Our compass remains bringing new therapies to patients that significantly improve their lives and create value for our shareholders. Now I'll turn it over to Frank, who will go into greater detail on the results of the quarter. Frank A. D'Amelio: Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast. Now moving on to the financials. Second quarter 2017 revenues were approximately $12.9 billion and reflect a slight year-over-year operational decline of $48 million. Second quarter 2017 revenues were also unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of $202 million or 2%. If you exclude both the revenues for HIS in both periods, as well as the negative impact of foreign exchange, second quarter 2017 revenues increased $248 million or 2%. Our Innovative Health business recorded 9% operational revenue growth in the second quarter 2017, driven by Ibrance and Eliquis globally; the addition of Xtandi revenues in the U.S. from the Medivation acquisition in September of 2016; and Xeljanz and Lyrica, both primarily in the U.S. \u2013 all of which were partially offset by lower revenues for Enbrel in most developed Europe markets, primarily due to continued biosimilar competition and the 7% operational decrease in global Prevnar 13 revenues. In the U.S., Prevnar 13 declined 16% due to the unfavorable impact, the timing of government purchases for the pediatric indication, and the continuing decline in revenues for the adult indication because of a smaller remaining catch-up opportunity versus the prior-year quarter. In international markets, however, Prevnar 13 revenues increased 8% operationally due to the favorable timing of government purchases for the pediatric indication in certain emerging markets. Revenues for our Essential Health business decreased to 12% operationally, of which 5% was attributable to the divestiture of the HIS business in February of this year. The remainder of the decline was due to a 27% operational decline from peri-LOE products such as Pristiq in the U.S., which lost marketing exclusivity in March of 2017, Vfend and Lyrica in developed Europe markets, as well as a 3% operational decline in legacy established products, all of which were partially offset by a 60% operational growth from biosimilars, driven by Inflectra in certain developed Europe markets and in the U.S. In emerging markets, Pfizer's overall Essential Health revenues grew 5% operationally, primarily due to 7% operational growth from the legacy established products portfolio and 10% growth from the sterile injectables portfolio. Second quarter reported diluted EPS was $0.51, compared with $0.33 in the year-ago quarter, primarily due to lower asset impairment charges, higher gross margins, and lower legal charges, all of which were partially offset by a higher effective tax rate and higher purchase accounting adjustments. Adjusted diluted EPS for the second quarter was $0.67 versus $0.64 in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to a higher gross margin and fewer shares outstanding. I want to point out that the diluted weighted average shares outstanding declined by 112 million shares versus the year-ago quarter due to our share repurchase program, reflecting the impact of two $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreements, one completed in June of 2016, the other executed in February of 2017 and completed in May of 2017. As I previously mentioned, foreign exchange negatively impacted second quarter 2017 revenues by approximately $202 million or 2% and positively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses, and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $247 million or 3%. As a result, foreign exchange positively impacted second quarter 2017 adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.01 versus a year-ago quarter. We increased the midpoint of our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range by $0.02 to reflect the $300 million increase to the guidance for adjusted other income and deducts as a result of lower-than-forecasted net interest expense, higher-than-forecasted royalty income from certain products, and higher-than-anticipated dividend income from ViiV. As a result, we now expect 2017 adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.54 to $2.60. I want to point out that our updated adjusted diluted EPS guidance range absorbs $75 million of adjusted research and development expenses that were recorded in the second quarter 2017 due to our agreement with Sangamo Therapeutics, which we announced in May 2017 to develop and commercialize gene therapy programs for hemophilia A. To punctuate what Ian said earlier, the midpoint of our updated 2017 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range, which is $2.57, versus our 2016 adjusted diluted EPS of $2.40 implies a growth rate of approximately 7% year over year, which is above that of our peer group average. In addition, this implied year-over-year adjusted diluted EPS growth rate, in conjunction with our current dividend yield of 3.8% to 3.9%, equates to approximately 11%, which is again above that of our peer group average and which we believe is robust for a company of our size. With the exception of increasing the midpoint of the range for our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS and increasing guidance for adjusted other income/deducts, we reaffirmed all other 2017 financial guidance components. Now moving on to key takeaways, we continued to deliver solid financial performance in the second quarter of 2017. Excluding HIS revenues from both periods, revenues increased 2% operationally year over year, driven by the strong growth from Ibrance, Eliquis, and Xeljanz and the contribution of the newly acquired products including Xtandi. We increased the midpoint of our 2017 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range by $0.02. We now expect the range to be from $2.54 to $2.60. We accomplished several key product and pipeline milestones, and we returned $8.9 billion to shareholders in the first half of 2017 through dividends and share repurchases, which includes a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in February. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2017 and beyond. Now I'll turn it back to Chuck. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Frank. Can we now go to the operator to poll for questions, please? Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Your first question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank. Gregg Gilbert : Thanks. Good morning, team. First for Ian and Frank, last quarter you suggested that doing big deals might be on hold tied to uncertainty on tax reform, as well as binary events in the industry. So looking for your updated thoughts on that. Taking a wild guess here that MYSTIC might've been one of those binary events. And my second question is for John. I was intrigued by Ian's comments about the Remicade \u2013 Remicade holding on commercial \u2013 commercial plans in particular. Now that Merck has jumped into the biosimilar Remicade market, can you talk about the implications of where they set price and what you think it's going to take to get Inflectra ramping the way you hope in the next couple of years? Thanks. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Gregg. Well, as we've always said, we have a base plan, and we look to improve that plan. And part of that may be improving or changing our capital allocations. We look at BD as a way of improving returns for shareholders, and right now I would reaffirm that I think there are short-term events in the marketplace, such as a tax reform, that may change asset values. So any focus on BD, to my point of view, is somewhat delayed by a resolution of that. And I'll ask John to talk about the Remicade. John D. Young: Okay. So thanks for the question. So, first of all, let me just be clear that the Merck biosimilar, Renflexis, launched at exactly our Inflectra ASP. So ASP is the average selling price that is set by CMS on a quarterly basis. It is $753 for Inflectra, and that was exactly the price that Merck announced the pricing of Renflexis to be last week. So actually their pricing essentially is exactly on parity with our price. In terms of the second part of your question, which is what do we think it's going to take to really accelerate performance, I think I would just start by saying actually overall biosimilar revenue was $121 million in the quarter. It grew by 60%, and that included $23 million of sales in the U.S. We continue to see the value of biosimilars in the marketplace and expanding patient access to important high-quality, lower-cost treatment options, but we know the market is still in development. Inflectra penetration in the U.S. has been slower than we expected due to some challenging marketplace dynamics. By the end of June, our Inflectra share was 2.3% of the overall infliximab volume, and that includes a mix of new and switch patients, as every provider customer is taking a different approach to adoption. But we've made steady progress to improve the availability of Inflectra through contracting with GPOs. We've achieved some wins with integrated healthcare systems, particularly those where the insurer and provider are the same. The VA would be a good example of such a provider, where we actually have an infliximab share of 20% or more, and that continues to grow. With insurance plans, we've achieved 100% coverage for Medicare patients. But in the commercial insurance space, access for Inflectra has been substantially limited due to J&J's pursuit of exclusionary contracting with insurers and providers. And as Ian said in his comments, our lower-price product hasn't received access at parity to Remicade, and it does remain, in that sector of the market, at a disadvantaged position. So we are actively working on a range of commercial and other strategies to make Inflectra accessible to more patients and also make sure we lay the groundwork for a smoother and more rapid uptake of all future biosimilars in the U.S. marketplace. Charles E. Triano: Okay. Thanks, John and Ian. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin : Thank you. Ian, just \u2013 if I can just go back to the capital allocation question again. If I take your words in your prepared remarks or in the press release literally, it does sound like you're backing off from a large-scale deal and saying that you're going to focus on maximizing internal opportunities. And this coming off of the first six months of the year where you and your senior management have been on the road talking up your core competency of doing major acquisitions and aggressive cost-cutting. And that after two failed mergers to lower your tax rate and that around the time that you plan to break up the company into three parts and then two parts. So it's just a little bit confusing what the message today is to investors. I mean, we understand that corporate tax reform is facing some headwinds and uncertainty, but that was also true after Q1. So just trying to get a sense for your general priorities here. Is it to get bigger in order to break up? Is it to lower your tax rate? Is it to get bigger in oncology? Is it to achieve significant cost synergies? I think we're all a little bit confused about that, and if you could clarify. My second question, again going back to MYSTIC, just curious to know what you think the failure of MYSTIC tells you. We have heard that you have said in the past that if it did fail it would place a higher value on the PD-1 leaders, but just wondering how you think about that. Thanks very much. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Jami. I'm sorry it's confusing. I don't think we've changed our approach at all in the seven years that I've been CEO. Our focus has always been to use BD as part of capital allocation to improve returns to Pfizer shareholders, and we look at it in the totality of our capital allocation. For instance, since September 2015 \u2013 not to use since 2010 but 2015 \u2013 we've paid out $12.9 billion in dividends, we've repurchased $10 billion of our shares, and we've spent $36 billion in BD. So we have been active in BD. Now you're asking me about, have we backed off any intention to do a big deal? My answer to that is we will look at the circumstances and the asset prices and determine the appropriate capital allocation when we feel that we have a realistic handle on what asset prices truly represent. And right now I believe we need to see tax reform or the absence of tax reform to understand what the market values are. We then would look at BD opportunities inside other opportunities with capital allocation, including share buybacks and dividends, investing in our own portfolio. And rest assured we will aggressively take the actions that we believe will improve the value to shareholders. Now in regard to MYSTIC. I think MYSTIC certainly indicated that the IO-IO may be more problematical in the near term. Certainly I think reinforces the value of PD-L1 franchises and where they stand in the different therapies, and which order they stand. Surprisingly, the market didn't infer that really through to the other CTLA-4. We only saw it narrowly in MYSTIC. So I'm not quite sure what the market is saying that they believe that the read-through is. So we really want to see the full report, not just the top line. But certainly I think it strengthens the case that the PD-L1 is going to be for the foreseeable future a major player in the game. Thank you. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Ian. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO. Alex Arfaei : Good morning, folks, and thank you for taking the questions. First on Ibrance, if you could just update us on the latest market share penetration \u2013 very impressive results. So just want to get a better sense as to what the upside there is. And then on Xeljanz, wanted to \u2013 again, solid performance. Wanted to get your thoughts on the latest, I guess, concerns about the risk of thromboembolic events with JAK inhibitors. And then finally, Ian, very impressive commentary about the R&D potential. Would you be interested, or are you considering, hosting an R&D day so that the investment community can better appreciate the potential of this pipeline? Thank you. Ian C. Read: Okay. Alex. Thank you for the recommendation of the R&D day. We'll have a discussion internally and see what we think is the best way to communicate that more and more fully. I would ask Albert to talk about Ibrance, and then Mikael Dolsten to talk about the issues you raised with \u2013 or the potential issues you raised around Xeljanz. Albert? Albert Bourla : Thank you, Ian, and thank you, Alex, for your good words for Ibrance. Look, for Kisqali, it is a little bit early to comment, but so far we have seen a minimal uptake of this product. Its most recent market share has been 4% across all lines, 5% in first line. We have seen some early signs of market growth. The CDK market share in new patients has grown from an historical 50% to approximately 57%, indicating that the Kisqali introduction could potentially grow the total market. As you know, only 50% of the patients that they could receive benefits from CDK treatments are now under a CDK program. We remain confident in our leadership in the class. Two years, more than 10,500 prescribers, more than 60,000 patients in the U.S., now more than 13,000 patients in the EU in just a few months from the beginning of the year. And this is testament not only to Ibrance's efficacy with over two years PFS, but also to its manageable safety and tolerability profile with no EKG or liver monitor required. And, last but not least, we have great access for patients. So we are very optimistic for the future of the project. Mikael Dolsten : So thank you for the question concerning, I assume, the recent news surrounding venous thromboembolism for baricitinib, and you wanted to learn about Xeljanz. We are very pleased with the profile for Xeljanz. It has been extremely consistent, and our analysis from more than 21,000 patient-years in clinical studies and postmarketing experience in over 90,000 patients shows that there is no causal relationship between Xeljanz and venous thromboembolism. We have not seen any signals for thrombosis. This suggests that not all JAKs are the same, and the news around baricitinib is likely to be seen as compound specific and not JAK class specific. I wanted also to add, as an example that underlines this, barcitinib has reported elevated platelets, thrombocytosis, which in some circumstances can be associated with increased risk for thrombosis. We have not seen that either with our Xeljanz inhibitor, and we are very pleased with its balanced and well-performing profile. Indeed, this week there was a Lancet oral strategy report that underlined how well Xeljanz was performing and compared its profile in a very, I think, favorable way also to Humira in that study. Thank you for your interest. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Mikael. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Christopher T. Schott: Great. Thanks very much. Just a couple product questions and then one tax question. First on Xtandi, you mentioned patient assistance dynamics are expected to normalize as we move into next year. Can you elaborate a little bit more on what drives that confidence? And should we think about an uplift in realized price as that occurs? Second question was Prevnar 13 adult in the EU. I think you mentioned here reimbursement's been a bit slower. What are the hurdles that are affecting that uptake? And is there anything the company can do to either accelerate this or address this? And then the final question was on this topic of U.S. tax reform. What are the key elements that Pfizer is looking for as we go through tax reform in order for the company to best optimize its capital structure? Is repatriation the critical piece? Is the absolute tax rate the critical piece? I guess what aspects of tax reform are you most focused on as we hear various proposals over the coming weeks and months? Thanks very much. Ian C. Read: So, Chris, thank you for the questions. On Xtandi, what we've discussed previously is that access to Xtandi in its present setting is concentrated more heavily in patients who are on Medicare or Medicaid, and there are access barriers there. And the industry in total have dealt with this by allowing foundations to provide funds to those patients to meet some of their copay obligations, and it's been done from a third-party stance, with us donating money to foundations who then dedicate themselves to making sure that individuals have access to these medications. There was a temporary, I think, chilling of that under a subpoena and some investigations from the legal system, which we believe that are temporary in nature and that there are clear guidelines as to how this should be done by different government agencies. We are clarifying these or have clarified them, and we believe the industry will return to funding these foundations within the established and clear guidelines of the U.S. government. Hence, we would expect that the percentage of patients who are on our patient assistance program will drop as they move towards the foundation covering their copays. This will tend to be more abrupt at the beginning of the year, as most patient assistance programs guarantee you access for the remainder of the calendar year whenever you join. And then when the calendar year changes, then most of these patients or new patients, we believe, will likely turn to the foundations as a source of financing or help with their copays. I would ask \u2013 Prevnar adult; would you like to talk about that, Albert, in the European situation? Albert Bourla : Yes. Absolutely. And, Chris, let me start by restating that we're not changing this in our assessments. We expect the Vaccines business to be flat to slightly declining in 2017. Now, in developed Europe, our revenues for the adult claim in the second quarter, they grew slightly. We had the 2% growth compared to the same quarter of last year. Year to date, we are growing double digit at 15%, and this is in line with our expectations so far. In Europe, the vaccine business is all about recommendations and subsequently reinvestment, and the process is slow, as Ian said. We wanted and we were hoping to be a little bit faster. And right now most of the effect of the reimbursement we expect to happen in 2018. To give you some examples, in France in April there was a national at-risk recommendation, but the process of getting from recommendation to reinvestment will likely take us into 2018. Before France, in the first quarter, Italy announced new national recommendations for 65, but then there is \u2013 from recommendation to reimbursement also takes some time. We continue to advocate with both the European technical committees for recommendations and payers for reinvestment. Ian C. Read: So, thank you, Albert. I think net-net we realize that the Prevnar franchise is difficult to forecast, so we have given \u2013 I think in the last quarter we gave guidance that the total franchise will be flat to slightly down on a full-year basis, and I think that's what you should use for your modeling. Frank, why don't you talk about the tax situation? Frank A. D'Amelio: Yeah, Chris. So I think in terms of what we'd like to see for tax reform, I think first a territorial tax system. Two, a repatriation holiday. Three, lower corporate tax rates. And then, four, and this kind of applies to a couple of these, which is if there's going to be some minimum tax, obviously the lower the minimum tax the better. Ian C. Read: And we believe that type of reform will make us more competitive. It's not as good as a pure territorial system, but within the art of the possible and what they're trying to achieve, that would help us access our global capital. Charles E. Triano: Thank you. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Holford from Jefferies. Jeffrey Holford : Hi. Thanks very much for taking my questions. I have two. First on Consumer, I think you previously had \u2013 or shown little interest in any kind of disposal of this business, but as we're continuously talking about consolidation of pharma and on the watch for pharma asset prices, could this be a potential source of funds that is worth more in the hands of others rather than yourselves going forwards? That's the first question. And then second, you talk about a number of blockbuster opportunities; obviously adjuvant Ibrance is one of those. That's more than just a $1 billion opportunity. I would think it's very much more substantial than the metastatic opportunity. I wonder, can you can give us any more thoughts around potential timing with that being a partially event-driven study for a readout there? And then what kind of size do you think the market for adjuvant breast cancer could be for the CDKs? Thank you. Ian C. Read: Thank you. On the Consumer business, I think we've commented on this before. We're investing in it, it's growing, it's a good source of U.S. cash flow, and we see stable growth. But the Consumer business, like any of our businesses, we subject to periodic reviews as to whether there'd be more value created being outside of Pfizer rather than in. And clearly, as we discussed before on this tax reform, the tax reform will change the net value of assets in the marketplace in various ways, and we think it's prudent to wait for a decision on tax reform so that we can really understand the valuation of our assets as we do these reviews across all of our business. Now, with regard to Ibrance, Albert, would you like to take that one? Albert Bourla : Yes, and you're right, we also believe that the opportunity in the early breast cancer is much larger than the opportunity of metastatic breast cancer. The populations are more than double, and the duration of treatments are expected to be much longer. So we are looking forward to bring in the Ibrance label the claim of early breast cancer. Now, as regards the studies that we are running, in early breast cancer we have three studies that are running. The first one is PENELOPEB. And this is for high-risk early breast cancer patients. The estimated completion date of this is in 2020. The second is PALLAS, which is for patients with intermediate-risk early breast cancer, and we have here an estimated primary completion date in 2021. And there's also PALLET, which is a smaller study that has an estimation completion date end of 2018, beginning of 2019. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Albert. Ian C. Read: These are all event-driven trials. Albert Bourla : And these are all event-driven trial. This is a little bit difficult to estimate, and the better the product does, usually the events delay to complete. We need to wait see the results. Ian C. Read: Thank you. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Albert. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Umer Raffat : Hi. Thank you so much for taking my question. I wanted to focus on the IO strategy for a minute, perhaps starting with the backbone itself. I notice you have an in-house PD-1, as well as the avelumab collaboration. So just wanted to understand how you're thinking about positioning both? And also on that same tone, you also have an investigational monthly subQ arm for your in-house PD-1, the wholly owned one. Any early thoughts on that? Was very curious. And stepping outside of the whole PD-1 side, I find it interesting you do have preclinical CTLA-4s, you have a preclinical IDO. So, from your perspective, do you think you have everything you need for IO-IO combos in these particular assets? Or would you rather have something more advanced depending on the trial results in the next few months? Thank you. Ian C. Read: Thank you. It's a very complicated and deep question, the whole issue of IO strategy. I'm going to sort of ask perhaps Mikael to make some initial scientific comments on the overall target selection and then have Albert add comments on the commercial implications. What I would point out is that in immuno-oncology, we certainly feel we have a good PD-L1 in partnership with Merck from Germany, but undoubtedly the depth of our clinical exploration is not the size of either of the two major competitors who have PD-L1s who are ahead of us. But, Mikael, why don't you - Mikael Dolsten : Yes. Thank you very much. So I'll briefly touch upon what are key things to keep in mind here. As Ian alluded to, we are pleased with our partnership with Merck KGaA on avelumab, and we have more than 30 studies ongoing and some 10 that are in registration \u2013 intent fashion. Among those, I wanted to mention that we think we will be in a leadership role for ovarian cancer, both advanced, second, and third line, as well as first line in chemo combinations. We think we'll also have a leadership position in RCC due to various promising data reported for Inlyta in combination with avelumab at ASCO. And you may have seen recently also that Inlyta is running a combination also with Keytruda, and that will solidify, we think, that Inlyta drug combined with either avelumab or other PD-1 drugs. And finally, in head and neck cancer, combining radiotherapy and chemo we also think we can establish unique leadership for avelumab. More recently, the organically generated PD-1, which is part of the alliance with German Merck, showed a very well-behaved molecule suitable for monthly delivery and good early efficacy signals. So we are looking at opportunities where that profile may have a differentiated role, such as treatment of very early cancers or possibly adjuvant cancers, and we will share more quite near term about how we see that molecule. When it comes to combination, we are eager to see the readout of the areas where we think we are unique. Our 4-1BB should have data reporting later part of this year, OX40 with avelumab early next year, and a triple the later part of next year. Finally, you spoke about CTLA-4. Clearly the native CTLA-4 antibodies have shown a tricky balance between efficacy and adverse events. We have embarked on modified CTLA-4 where we have two preclinical compounds that we think can have a more tumor-specific effect and a mitigated systemic effect to explore whether that second generation can be more easily developed. Albert, anything you want to add here? Ian C. Read: So I think you gave a very extensive answer, Mikael. I would just add that our internally developed PD-L1 \u2013 as you say, it's earlier use; it's used in the adjuvant setting. If we can get its administration subQ, it would be a very important differentiating factor there. But, Albert, do you want to add anything? Albert Bourla : No, no, no. Just what you just said. That could mean treatment in home versus treatment in the infusion centers, which makes a big difference. Ian C. Read: A big difference. Okay. Charles E. Triano: Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from David Maris from Wells Fargo. David Maris : Good morning, Ian. How do you feel about the administration's understanding of the drug industry and its contribution to jobs and innovation? Maybe you could tell us a little bit how you've been integrating or engaging with the administration. And do you think what we've heard and seen so far as to potential executive orders is really what we should expect, which is marginal or incremental change, not price controls or anything more ominous? Thank you. Ian C. Read: Thank you, David. Well, we've had long conversations about this. I believe that the pharma industry has worked hard, along with other parts of the healthcare industry, to ensure that the administration has a full view of the contribution that the industry makes. It's a \u2013 I think $1.6 trillion contribution to GDP, the pharmaceutical industry, and about 4 million jobs that are created by this industry. And we are the only part of the industry that actually prices go down. If you did a triple bypass operation 10 years ago, compare that to what you pay today, it has significantly gone up, whereas Lipitor has significantly gone down in price. So we're one of the few parts of the healthcare system that automatically have price reductions built in and the utility of that product remains for society. So we've been working and discussing with this administration. I think they understand the importance of the industry. They understand the importance of innovation. And I would expect that we've discussed with the administration that any executive order should help increase competition, should help get generic products to the market faster. This is where in fact most of what we may call \u2013 has been called \u2013 outrageous pricing issues have occurred in the generics sector. The Brand Effect has only seen a 2.3% price increase in 2016. So there seems to be a mischaracterization of what's creating issues. Cost and affordability is an issue for most patients because of large deductibles and high copays and the fact that the rebates that we give to insurance companies to help get access are not being used to ensure the patient pays the net price after the rebate. And this has been a conversation we've been having with the administration. So overall I think we've given several suggestions to the administration. It's been a good conversation, and I expect that from a public policy point of view, the administration understands the importance of our industry to patients. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Ian. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from John Boris from SunTrust. John T. Boris: Thanks for taking the questions. Ian, just a question on the environment. Over your seven-year tenure, what are some of the things that appear to be going right for the industry? Seems like on the regulatory front, certainly the FDA is approving things, and cycle times are coming down. But certainly on the generics side you're getting a lot faster approval of ANDAs. On the reimbursement side, certainly seems to be a lot of pressure. But just some general commentary about the environment and the pushes and pulls that are going on there. Secondly, you mentioned that some of your businesses are subjected to periodic reviews. You have the Genetics Institute business that's in hemophilia. You have some competitive threats there from ACE910 and gene therapies. Have you considered a spin or split of that business like one of your peers had recently done? And then lastly for Frank, just on foreign exchange. Certainly, the headwind is lessening, but you didn't move your guidance range on revenues at all. Can you maybe just discuss some of the pushes and pulls there that forced you to leave guidance where it was? Thanks. Ian C. Read: Thanks, John, wide-ranging questions. I think in the environment, certainly on the registry side through actions taken by the FDA, certainly the new commissioner and the PDUFA negotiations I think we're beginning to see an improvement in the FDA's speed in approving and bringing new products to the marketplace. I would say the oncology division is probably one that I would call out as being the most active there. On the negative side of the situation, I suppose you would say that we've seen increased pressure from payers. We've seen the marketplace devolve a little bit into high deductibles, high copays, which is denying access to patients, which is not well-understood. And overall I think we've also seen an uptick in our ability to take science and take what we've learned in science over the last few years to improve our understanding of how to get vaccines and precision medicine through to the marketplace. On the hemophilia franchise, we think we're well-placed. While I would agree with you, we are seeing entrances that have longer half-lives, but we think we have a strategy to use that business and move on to new formulations and new products. And I would just ask Mikael to talk a little about our research in that area. Mikael Dolsten : Yes, thank you. As you mentioned, John, gene therapy has the potential to transform incremental gains by slightly increasing half-life. We have shared with Spark Therapeutics recently experiences from factor IX for hemophilia B patients. 10 patients have been dosed, single infusion. We see a robust level of synthetic gene giving rise to dramatic reduction in bleedings or the need for any infusions, and patients basically without the need for any treatment beyond a year or year and a half, because this is as far as we've gone in the observation period. As we noted at \u2013 advance in the field, we recently licensed, in a partnership with Sangamo, a factor VIII gene therapy, which is quite a big market. We're just embarking on clinical studies with that. And we are exploring to take a step into really difficult diseases like Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. We're planning our internal program to go into the clinical study early next year. So as Ian alluded to, we decided to move from more incremental to more transformative therapies, and so far are very encouraged about the quality of these technologies. Ian C. Read: Okay. Thank you. Frank, would you like to do the - Frank A. D'Amelio: Foreign exchange? Ian C. Read: \u2013 foreign exchange? Frank A. D'Amelio: Yeah. So, John, you're correct. If you look at the impact of foreign exchange on our revenue guidance, let's say the first call we had this year, early February, to today's call, it's a negative, but it's less of a negative. So you're absolutely correct, and the reason we chose not to change guidance was there's many parts of the portfolio that are performing very well. We've mentioned some of those today \u2013 Ibrance, Eliquis, Xeljanz \u2013 but there's other parts of the portfolio that we've mentioned today that aren't performing the way we thought they were going to from a planning perspective. We mentioned Inflectra on the call. We mentioned Xtandi on the call. We mentioned Prevnar 13 adult in Europe on the call. So when we put that all together, we thought it was prudent to leave the revenue range where it is, $52 billion to $54 billion. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Frank. Next question, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Bernstein. Timothy Minton Anderson : Thank you. I want go back to Inflectra if I can, your comments about being disadvantaged. Am I correct to think that the only way to overcome the reimbursement hurdles is price, and the experience of payers today basically says the product is priced too high? Or could it simply be a prediction by payers that prescriber demand just won't be there regardless of price? And to answer that, I think one of the ways you could \u2013 would be to look in channels where you do have full coverage \u2013 I think you said Medicare \u2013 and what the uptake has been in those channels. And then another question is one that I've asked in the past, so forgive me, but your commitment to avelumab, you've described in the past, but I interpret to be to be kind of an unwavering commitment to that relationship and to that product. So is that a fair characterization? Is it full speed ahead with avelumab? Ian C. Read: Okay. On avelumab, we were in a very good partnership with Merck. We have a plan to develop avelumab. You've heard on this call today where we think we can be successful in first line, where we can be successful in combinations. And we always review all of our strategies and all of our potentials to see how we can maximize participation in any sectors. So we're \u2013 have a strong partnership, but we continue to review the best way to be successful in IO combinations, but that extends beyond PD-L1. It extends to our own 4-1BB, our own OX40, our own other targeted agents, our own vaccine, oncolytic vaccine strategy there. So I think, as I say, we enjoyed a very good relationships with Merck. And the first question was \u2013 remind me again. John D. Young: Inflectra. Charles E. Triano: Inflectra. Ian C. Read: Inflectra. I think the key for me \u2013 and I'll ask John to expand upon it \u2013 is the issue of \u2013 I think we have the right strategy on our pricing strategy. I think we are competitive on price. But in enclosed systems we have a 20%-plus market share but in the commercial plans, certainly, there are exclusive provisions that are in place by the originator's owner that make penetration difficult regardless of price. John, would you like to add anything? John D. Young: Yeah. I mean, I think Ian's covered it well, Tim. I think all I would say is we're very clear that by definition biosimilars are defined in law as being highly similar and having no clinically meaningful differences. So, therefore, we recognize the value proposition versus the originator has to offer value to the healthcare system in the form of savings. And I wouldn't add to Ian's comment other than to say we remain extremely vigilant as more competitors have and will continue to enter this and other marketplaces, that we need to offer our customers value in order for them to both stock and also to provide insurance coverage for their patients. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, John. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Richard Purkiss from Piper Jaffray. Richard J. Purkiss: Oh, thanks. I've got two questions. On Xtandi, could Albert outline how he sees the opportunity in additional patient numbers from PROSPER if it reads out positively later this year? And then on pipeline efforts, could you just flesh out expectations for Besponsa in ALL and also just the filing timeline on lorlatinib? Thanks a lot. Ian C. Read: Albert, please see what you can \u2013 give an answer to those, and if you need, I'll ask Mikael to add a contribution. Albert Bourla : Yeah. Let me start with PROSPER. We are very excited with the prospects of bringing Xtandi to early stages of prostate cancer, and PROSPER is just one of the studies that we are having running in order to do that. EMBARK, ARCHES, and PROSPER are three studies that are focused on early prostate cancer. EMBARK is focusing on non-metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, ARCHES in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer but early, and PROSPER in non-metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer. We think about, as we discussed in the breast cancer, the opportunity's significant because the population of early non-metastatic prostate cancer is almost double than the population of the current registered claims in the opportunity of Xtandi. And we are expecting the duration of treatments to be much longer, so significant commercial opportunity. Mikael, do you want to answer the \u2013 ? Mikael Dolsten : Yeah. On lorlatinib and I think you also mentioned ALL and Besponsa. Albert Bourla : ALL and Besponsa, yes. Mikael Dolsten : Yeah. On the R&D side, as Besponsa got approved in EU and we expect positive outcome soon in the U.S., it's a highly differentiated drug for patients at great need. When it comes to lorlatinib, that drug has performed really well. It's to the best of my knowledge the second generation ALK/ROS inhibitor that covers most mutations, mutations that patients progress on also on other currently new ALK inhibitors. And it also has good brain exposure for patients. So we, for us, it's really the best-in-class drug that can extend the franchise and complement Xalkori, and we expect to file it later this year. Ian C. Read: Any quick comment on Besponsa? Albert Bourla : Just, I wanted to say, first of all, I misheard the question. So, yes. On the Besponsa, it has received already registration in Europe. We have breakthrough designation, and fast track in \u2013 by the FDA for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adults. And ALL is an aggressive form of leukemia, has a very poor prognosis in adults, and has limited treatment options. And we estimate that approximately 2,250 new cases of ALL occurring in adults will be diagnosed in the U.S. every year. And, as a result, this represents a meaningful new option for patients and a meaningful opportunity for us. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Albert. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Geoffrey Meacham : Hey, guys. Good morning, and thanks for the question. Ian, just on the topic of deals. When I look at your NME slide, what strikes me is how crowded some of these categories are, and Rare Disease obviously looks less so, as is neurodegeneration. So I know ROI and tax reform are inputs, but how much does the landscape inform your priority for deals? And then second question for Albert, can you go into a little bit more on the PROSPER protocol change, what went into the decision? Was it competitive? Was it something you were seeing in the data so far? Thank you. Ian C. Read: So on the deals, a lot of areas are crowded. It's an issue of finding products that have significant clinical differentiation. And I think if you look through our franchises we see that we have that opportunity in Vaccines; we have the opportunity in Inflammation. We continue to see that opportunity in Oncology with the future development of Xtandi, with the PARP inhibitor of Ibrance, with the PD-1 strategy with Merck, which is a core part of our strategy. And I think if you extend it out into CVMED or internal medicine, we continue to see huge opportunities to differentiate in inflammation, in our JAK franchises. And in neuroscience it's a hard area, and we continue to work at it. We're sort of refocusing somewhat on neuroscience into sort of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, and away from psychiatry. But I think our deals need is to play to the strengths we have. The deal has to be part of a strategy, and the strategy is to strengthen your anchor disease areas and ensure you can get synergy savings and also \u2013 both synergy savings and synergies in the revenues. So I feel comfortable with the position we've taken on our deal targets. Albert, do you want to comment on PROSPER? Albert Bourla : Yes. We did announce in June, together with Astellas, an amendment of the protocol for PROSPER, which is a multinational randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Xtandi. The primary purpose of the amendment is to revise the plan for the analysis of the primary endpoint of metastasis-free survival and secondary endpoints. The amendments also reduce the target sample size to approximately 1,140. Basically, the fundamental reason for the acceleration was that we were able to decouple the metastasis-free survival from the overall survival. And now the metastasis-free survival is the primary endpoint, and will read first. Because we knew we have let's say many more data that have been read out since the time that the protocol was established, we feel very comfortable in discussions with the FDA that we can maintain the same power and reduce the number of patients that are needed to complete the target sample size, and this is the reason for the acceleration. I want to say that, as I said, the enrollment has been completed in June, and results are expected this fall. Charles E. Triano: Thank you. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS. Marc Goodman : Morning. We talked about Ibrance in the U.S. before, but can you give us a flavor for what's going on in Europe? How much geographical growth has there been? We've seen a pretty good ramp quarter to quarter; just trying to get a sense for how fast this ramp is going to occur over the next year or so? Second, Xeljanz, can you just give us a flavor for how it's being used? How much is being used second line or third line or just \u2013 we haven't heard from you on that in a while. And then, third, can you give us an update on the trends in China and how that's going? Thanks. John D. Young: Yes. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Marc. Why don't \u2013 China, I'd ask just to have John start on China, which is \u2013 a major part of the business there comes under John's leadership, although Albert can also comment on the innovative in China. And then Ibrance and Xeljanz from Albert. John D. Young: Yeah. So China is our largest emerging market. It represents around about 45% of our emerging markets sales, and we see China remaining an attractive growth opportunity. In the quarter for the Essential Health business, revenues were around about $690 million, about 13% operational growth, and we continue to see strength across our portfolio for the Essential Health business. Our portfolio remains a great fit, with priority areas of treatment for the Chinese government, cardiovascular disease, treatment of serious infection, and other noncommunicable diseases. So we actually think that we're very well-placed to continue to grow our business in China. It's a major market where we have invested in the past, and we will continue to be opportunistic in making investments in order to drive our business. Ian C. Read: Let's have Frank do the - John D. Young: Maybe Frank can talk about the overall performance of the company. Frank A. D'Amelio: Yeah, I'll do enterprise-wide. So, for the quarter as well, China remains a very strong marketplace for us. For the quarter, revenues grew 13%. Year to date, revenues grew 16%, and that's compared to last year where revenues grew 11%. And just in terms of how we think about China, it has an increasing population, rising personal wealth, higher spending on healthcare and that's a government public objective \u2013 and continues to have a strong GDP. So when we look at China, we remain very bullish, and the results there have been very strong. Ian C. Read: Albert, if we can get to you on Xeljanz - Albert Bourla : Yes. And Ibrance. Ian C. Read: \u2013 and Ibrance. Albert Bourla : Yes. You're right that Ibrance approvals are continuing across the world. In this quarter we've had approvals in Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Jamaica, Jordan, and Oman. In total right now Ibrance is registered in more than 65 countries. Specifically, in the EU and how we are doing there, through June or through the end of the quarter, the sales in the EU were approximately $200 million, and we have approximately 13,500 patients that have been treated. We are very, very pleased with this performance. Also, the early launch indicators \u2013 they saw very rapid Ibrance adoption in first line, but also we have very strong adoption in patients that have already been treated with AI monotherapy, with aromatase inhibitor monotherapy, and in patients in later lines of therapy. We are having positive discussions with reimbursement bodies right now, and generally speaking, I think they are doing well. So we are awaiting \u2013 as you know, in Europe it takes time to get the reimbursement, and that will accelerate the sales much more. Coming to Xeljanz, Xeljanz demonstrated a very, very strong quarter. We had a growth of 56%, and this is primarily driven by volume. In the U.S., the same, 53%, the growth again primarily by volume. The reason of this growth is primarily because there is an increased confidence as an effective monotherapy agent. There is inclusion now in the ACR guidelines. The Xeljanz XR also played a significant role. Right now we have approximately 40% of the prescription volume in total and 60% of the new patients' prescriptions in Xeljanz XR. There is a growing brand awareness among patients. And, last but not least, we had significant improvement in access. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Albert. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Albert. Operator, next question, please. Operator : Your next question is from Salim Syed from Mizuho. Ian C. Read: Okay. We should move on to the next one. Operator : And your next question comes from Tony Butler from Guggenheim Investments. Tony Butler : Thanks very much for taking the question. A brief two-part question. I'd love for you to comment on Mylotarg because after seven years it looks like it may be able to resurrect itself. And I'm curious if in fact now with chemotherapy as opposed to single agent, do you actually change the name? Or do you call it the same? And moreover, do you feel like (1:13:15) would be, let's just say, reticent to try it again even under the umbrella of chemotherapy? Or do you think they embrace it because there hasn't been much new in the AML \u2013 at least in newly diagnosed AML category in some time? Thanks very much. Ian C. Read: Interesting perspective, Tony. I think we intend to commercialize under its original brand name, and we feel that the new data package and the new label we have will lead to appropriate use of the product, and the physicians should be willing to embrace it. Thanks for the question. Albert Bourla : There was a positive opinion just a few weeks ago from an advisory committee in the FDA that was almost unanimous, I think it was minus one vote, to recommend the positive benefit-risk assessment. Ian C. Read: Yeah. Thank you. Charles E. Triano: Thank you. And, operator, if we can take our last question. Operator : Your final question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. David R. Risinger: Thanks very much. I have two questions. So first for your oncology team, I just wanted to get your perspective on CTLA-4's ability to offer a better benefit-risk ratio than chemo in lung cancer. And I ask you the question because obviously you previously owned the CTLA-4, you know the existing agents quite well, you're developing a more targeted set of early-stage CTLA-4 agents, but just wanted to get some perspective on your current opinion. And then second, with respect to biosimilars, I was wondering if your biosimilars team is planning to conduct any U.S. biosimilar interchangeability studies? I ask because the Inflectra uptake has been disappointing and also because BI announced in the last few days that it's started enrolling patients in a U.S. Humira interchangeable study. Thanks very much. Ian C. Read: Thank you. On CTLA-4, I'll ask Mikael to make some comments, but really his comments are more in the nature of his understanding of the science and general observations of his reading of the science. So, Mikael, what would you like to comment on CTLA-4? Mikael Dolsten : Yeah, you know the CTLA-4 antibodies have played some role in melanoma and it's used as a treatment there. It has been hard, I think, looking at the science, as Ian says, to fully develop the potential of that system, as it has a very narrow therapeutic window between the benefit and the systemic side effects. And we noticed in the MYSTIC trials the difficulty of getting those regiments and patient selection at least initially to unleash the potential of that pathway. That led us to focus on second-generation CTLA-4. It's early stage, but aiming to see if we can deliver it more locally into the tumor when it comes to its efficacy. And we've also explored CTLA-4 locally delivered with vaccines, where we think we may be able to get a different type of balance as we've seen systemically. So that's my kind of science comment, and we'll carefully monitor the remaining ongoing trials and see what we can learn. Charles E. Triano: Thank you. John, you want to take the last question on \u2013 ? John D. Young: Yeah. So thanks, David, for the question. So on interchangeability, obviously that is still relatively new guidance from the FDA. We don't believe in our assessment that interchangeability is necessarily going to be equally important across all biosimilars. As a company, we are actively looking at our portfolio and assessing where we believe that actually interchangeability data and an interchangeability designation from the FDA may be valuable both commercially but also to patients and healthcare professionals and their ability to take up and use biosimilars. And, lastly, I would say on Inflectra, just as a reminder, that obviously as the development program is completed by our partner Celltrion, we don't believe that the profile in the near term is going to be at a competitive disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis any immediate competition that we see that would have an interchangeability designation vis-\u00e0-vis us, so we think we're going to have a level playing field there. So thanks for the question. Charles E. Triano: Okay, thank you, everybody, for your attention this morning.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Charles E. Triano: Good morning and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer's third quarter 2017 performance. I'm joined today by our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Albert Bourla, Group President of Pfizer Innovative Health; John Young, Group President of Pfizer Essential Health; and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel. The slides that will be presented on this call can be viewed on our web site, pfizer.com/investors. Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward l1ooking statement. Official information regarding these factors is discussed under the disclosure notice section in the earnings release we issued this morning, as well as in Pfizer's 2016 annual report on Form 10-K, including in part one, item 1A. And that is filed with the SEC and available at sec.gov and at our web site at pfizer.com Forward looking statements during this conference call speak only as of the original date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of those statements. Discussions during the call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's current report on Form 8-K, dated today, October 31, 2017. You may obtain a copy of the Form 8-K on our web site at pfizer.com/investors. Any non-GAAP measures presented are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for financial measures required by U.S. GAAP. They have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to the calculations of similar measures at other companies. We will now make prepared remarks, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian? Ian C. Read: Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. During my remarks today, I will briefly talk about the progress and opportunities within each of our businesses, our recent announcement regarding our Consumer Healthcare business, and some of the promising assets in our pipeline, which we believe have the potential to become a foundation for our future growth prospects. Starting with the quarter. We again reported solid operational revenue growth. If you exclude the impact of the Hospira Infusion Systems divestiture and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, revenues for the quarter increased 4% operationally compared to the prior year quarter. We also raised the midpoint of our adjusted diluted EPS guidance for the year. I'll begin with a few words regarding the performance of each of our businesses, starting with Pfizer's Innovative Health. This business had another strong quarter, growing its top line 11% operationally. This increase was driven by continued growth of key brands, including Ibrance and Eliquis globally and Xtandi, Lyrica, Xeljanz and Chantix in the U.S. Ibrance had another strong quarter with revenues up 59% on an operational basis compared with the same quarter last year. We remain confident in its continued growth potential and leadership, despite there now being two other approved CDK 4/6 inhibitors. Ibrance share is now nearly 50% for first time, new patient starts in advanced breast cancer. And prescription volume continues to grow. As of the end of September, Ibrance has been prescribed by more than 11,000 physicians to 70,000 patients in the U.S. and more than 18,000 patients in the EU, and received regulatory approval in more than 70 countries, including Japan. With Xtandi, we continue to see growth in prescription volume. Although Xtandi's revenue growth is not yet tracking in line with prescription growth, due to patient assistance free drug program utilization as a proportion of total demand, we are pleased to report that we have now recorded sequential revenue growth for two consecutive quarters. I would also note that the patient assistance program proportion of total demand was comparable with that seen in the first and second quarters. And we continue to expect that the program's utilization will normalize as we move into next year. Of note, the number of urologists actively prescribing Xtandi again reached an all-time high this quarter, and these increases remain one of the key factors supporting Xtandi's continued growth. In June we announced the readout of the Xtandi's Phase 3 PROSPER trial in non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer has been accelerated by two years. We are pleased the trial met its primary endpoint of improved metastatic-free survival. And we have said previously we see these positive results as key value drivers that support our acquisition thesis for Medivation. And we are working with our partner, Astellas, on worldwide submission plans based on the PROSPER data to seek expansion of the label to non-metastatic CRPC. We continue to hit all-time highs in terms of new rheumatology prescriptions for Xeljanz. We received a record 9.8% of weekly new prescription share for the month of September for our current indication of rheumatoid arthritis. And with the weekly high reaching 10% so far in October, Xeljanz continues to be the fastest-growing advanced RA therapy. We see the potential for two additional and meaningful growth opportunities for Xeljanz with our two pending regulatory submissions for other conditions. For psoriatic arthritis, Xeljanz received an overwhelmingly positive vote in favor of approval at the FDA advisory committee meeting in August. We anticipate a final decision by the FDA before the end of the year. Xeljanz has also been accepted for review by the FDA for ulcerative colitis, with a PDUFA date in March. We've completed filings for both pending indications in multiple other countries. For Eucrisa, we've seen steady progress. Approximately 83,000 patients started treatment with Eucrisa by the end of the third quarter. More than 23,000 prescribers have provided Eucrisa to patients across the dermatological, pediatric, and primary care communities. And more than 60% of those prescribers are repeat prescribers. Prescription volume and share velocity continue to strengthen through the third quarter, supported by the successful launch of our DTC campaign. Turning now to Pfizer Essential Health, while revenues for the quarter declined, we once again saw strong operational growth both in emerging markets and in our biosimilars portfolio. We also continue to see the value of biosimilars in expanding patient access for important high-quality, low-cost treatment options. Our biosimilars business continues to grow, with global revenue increasing 67% operationally in the quarter. In September we presented two positive Phase 3 readouts for our first oncology biosimilar, trastuzumab, which is a proposed biosimilar to Herceptin. The readouts were presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology 2017 Congress. Both the FDA and EMEA have accepted our filings for this potential therapy. As of the end of September, Inflectra in the U.S. has grown, albeit slowly, to a 4.9% share of the overall U.S. infliximab market by volume. We continue to have 100% Medicare coverage as well as strong coverage in Medicaid. And in situations where the insurer and provider are the same, such as the VA, we have seen rapid uptake of Inflectra, with share in these situations reaching 54%, up from 20% in quarter two. That said, Inflectra penetration in the U.S. continues to be slower than expected due to the exclusionary contracting of Remicade by J&J, contracting that we believe violates the antitrust laws. As you know, we recently filed suit in the U.S. District Court against J&J. We did this to help ensure the true value of biosimilars can be unlocked for the benefit of patients, providers, and our nation's healthcare system. We are actively working on a range of strategies to help Inflectra accessibly to more patients and also to lay the groundwork for a smoother, more rapid uptake of all future biosimilars in the U.S. marketplace. Additionally, just yesterday, along with our partner, Celltrion, we presented new data showing that switching patients with Crohn's disease to Inflectra from Remicade leads to a comparable efficacy, safety, and tolerability to treatment with Remicade. That's adding to the totality of evidence supporting switch to Inflectra. Within our Essential Health portfolio, we have been experiencing supply shortages with some products. The shortages are primarily for products from the legacy Hospira portfolio and are largely driven by capacity constraints and technical issues. When we acquired Hospira, we originally thought it would take one to two years to integrate the manufacturing plants and resolve the majority of the supply chain issues. We have a robust action plan in place, and we believe we will make substantial progress in 2018 towards reducing the sterile injectable shortages. As we look ahead, in addition to continuing to expect revenue growth from our patent protected portfolio, we are very encouraged by the convergence of two positive trends, the decline in the number and revenue impact of LOEs facing our business and the further strengthening of our R&D pipeline and its potential to drive incremental revenue. We expect the full-year year-over-year impact of LOEs to continue to be significantly lower than our recent past. We're forecasting the impact to be approximately $2 billion in each of the next three years, about $1 billion in 2021, and then $500 million or less from 2022 through 2025. At the same time, we expect a steady flow of new products to begin to emerge from our pipeline. Here are a few of our most recent advances. The development plan for ertugliflozin for Type 2 diabetes remains on track, and we expect the decision from the FDA in December. In oncology, our PARP inhibitor, talazoparib, top line results from the Phase 3 EMBRACA trial will read out by the end of the year. The EMBRACA trial is exploring talazoparib versus standard-of-care chemotherapy in germline BRCA-positive metastatic breast cancer. In partnership with Merck KGaA, we expect data on Bavencio, our PD-L1 inhibitor, in combination with our 4-1BB agent later this year. The study is looking at patients who have not been previously treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. These data could be ready for potential presentation during 2018. We also anticipate data from our triplet combination with Bavencio, our 4-1BB agent, and our OX40 monoclonal antibody in late 2018. This study is recruiting on track. Also, by the end of the year, we plan to submit an application with the FDA for lorlatinib, our next-generation ALK inhibitor for the treatment of ALK-positive metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer. On October 16, we presented full results of the lorlatinib Phase 2 data that will form the basis of our discussions with the agency. In Inflammation & Immunology, we recently presented positive Phase 2 data for our once-daily oral JAK-1 inhibitor in atopic dermatitis, and we are planning to move this compound into Phase 3 studies shortly. In Vaccines, we started Phase 2 trials for our next-gen 20-valent pneumococcal vaccine and have received fast track designation for it from the FDA. These pipeline advances represent just a few of the assets that we expect to form the foundation for offsetting our remaining LOEs. We believe the combination of our strengthening pipeline and the anticipated continuing easing of LOE impact has the potential to support a nice inflection for our future revenue growth rates. I'll close my remarks with a few comments regarding our Consumer Health business. Earlier this month, we announced that we were reviewing strategic options for this business. This could include everything from a full or partial separation of the business to ultimately deciding to retain the business. We are taking this action as part of our regular ongoing reviews of our portfolio, pipeline, and business strategy. Although there was a strong connection between our Consumer Healthcare business and elements of our core biopharmaceutical portfolio, it is also distinct enough from our core business that there's a potential for its value to be more fully realized outside the company. We anticipate there will be broad interest from potential acquirers. And we expect to make a decision in 2018. In summary, we continue to execute on our strategy. The fundamentals of our business are strong, and we have several key brands that we believe are positioned for continued growth. The unfavorable impact of LOEs remains lower than in previous years, and we expect it to drop off even further in the coming years. And our innovative core is as strong and vibrant as it's ever been, which is positioning us well in the areas of greatest patient need and where science is evolving. Now I'll turn it over to Frank, who will go into greater detail on the results for the quarter. Frank A. D'Amelio: Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast. Now moving onto the financials. Third quarter 2017 revenues were approximately $13.2 billion and reflect year-over-year operational growth of $178 million. Third quarter 2017 revenues were also slightly offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $54 million. If you exclude both the revenues of Hospira Infusion Systems, or HIS, in both periods as well as the negative impact of foreign exchange, third quarter 2017 revenues increased $458 million or 4%. Our Innovative Health business recorded 11% operational revenue growth in the third quarter 2017, driven by Ibrance and Eliquis globally, the addition of Xtandi revenues in the U.S. from the Medivation acquisition in September of 2016, and Lyrica and Xeljanz both primarily in the U.S. All of which were partially offset by lower revenues for Enbrel in most developed Europe markets due to continued biosimilar competition and Viagra in the U.S. because of wholesale or de-stocking prior to anticipated generic competition beginning in December of 2017. Revenues for our Essential Health business decreased 11% operationally, of which 5% was attributable to the divestiture of the HIS business in February of this year. The remainder of the decline was due to a 22% operational decline from peri-LOE products, including Pristiq in the U.S., which lost marketing exclusivity in March of 2017, and Lyrica and Vfend in developed Europe markets. As well as a 12% operational decline in the sterile injectables portfolio, primarily due to legacy Hospira product shortages in the U.S. All of which were partially offset by operational growth of 67% from biosimilars. In emerging markets however, Pfizer's overall Essential Health revenues grew 7% operationally, primarily due to 6% growth from the legacy established products portfolio and 14% growth from the sterile injectables portfolio. Third quarter reported diluted EPS was $0.47 compared with $0.22 in the year-ago quarter, primarily due to the non-recurrence of a re-measurement loss on HIS in the year-ago quarter, higher gross margins, and lower restructuring and implementation cost, all of which were partially offset by higher purchase accounting adjustments. Adjusted diluted EPS for the third quarter was $0.67 versus $0.61 in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher revenues, adjusted gross margin, and adjusted other income as well as fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by product losses of exclusivity, product supply, and a higher effective income tax rate. I want to point out that diluted weighted average shares outstanding declined by 109 million shares versus the year-ago quarter due to our share repurchase program, reflecting the impact of our $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in February and completed in May of 2017. As I previously mentioned, foreign exchange negatively impacted third quarter 2017 revenues by approximately $54 million and positively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $16 million. As a result, foreign exchange unfavorably impacted third quarter 2017 adjusted diluted EPS by $0.01 versus the year-ago quarter. As you can see on the chart, we narrowed the ranges for certain components of 2017 financial guidance. We narrowed our revenue guidance range. And we now expect 2017 revenues to be in the range of $52.4 billion to $53.1 billion. This range continues to absorb an anticipated $2.3 billion negative impact due to continuing product losses of exclusivity, $1.2 billion due to the divestiture of HIS, and an anticipated $100 million negative impact due to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates versus 2016 rates. In addition, supply challenges primarily related to legacy Hospira products have had a negative impact on projected 2017 revenues of several hundred million dollars. Consequently, we lowered the midpoint of our 2017 revenue guidance range. That said, we expect these challenges to moderate in full year 2018. I want to point out that if we exclude the impact of foreign exchange and the sale of HIS, the midpoint of our updated revenue guidance would represent a 2% increase from fiscal year 2016 revenue levels. With respect to adjusted diluted EPS, we increased the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.03. And we now expect 2017 adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.58 to $2.62. The midpoint of our updated 2017 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range, which is $2.60, versus our 2016 actual adjusted diluted EPS of $2.40, implies a growth rate of approximately 8% year over year. It's important to note that this guidance range includes the anticipated negative impacts of approximately $0.03 due to the sale of Hospira Infusion Systems, $0.01 for foreign exchange compared to 2016, and $0.01 resulting from our May 2017 agreement with Sangamo to develop and commercialize gene therapy programs for hemophilia A. Excluding these, the midpoint of our adjusted diluted EPS would have been $2.65, which represents a 10% increase versus 2016 actual results, which is significant given the $2.3 billion of top line headwinds we are facing due to the product losses of exclusivity that I just mentioned. I want to take a moment to comment on the impact of the hurricanes that took place toward the end of the third quarter. First and foremost, we have nearly 2,000 Pfizer colleagues who live and work in Puerto Rico. And their safety and well-being is our first priority. I'm pleased to say that we have confirmed the safety of all colleagues in Puerto Rico. And we are now providing direct assistance to them. Pfizer also has three manufacturing sites in Puerto Rico. While these sites sustained some damage, we have made significant progress in repairing our facilities in anticipation of ramping up to full operations over the coming months. As a result of dual source supply options and sufficient pre-hurricane inventory levels, our assessment at this point is that any revenue impact is expected to be insignificant. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and make any updates to our outlook if warranted. Moving on to key takeaways. We continued to deliver strong financial performance in the third quarter of 2017. Excluding HIS revenues and the impact of foreign exchange from both periods, revenues increased 4% operationally year over year, driven by the strong growth from Ibrance, Eliquis, Xeljanz, Chantix, and the contribution of newly acquired products, including Xtandi. We narrowed certain 2017 financial guidance ranges, including raising the midpoint of our 2017 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range by $0.03 to $2.60 from $2.57. We accomplished several key product and pipeline milestones. And we returned $10.8 billion to shareholders year-to-date 2017 through dividends and share repurchases, which includes a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in February. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2017 and beyond. Now I'll turn it back to Chuck. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Frank and Ian. Operator, can we please poll for questions? Operator : Your first question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Umer Raffat : Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. Perhaps first, Ian, one for you. If there were to be no tax reform, is your bias at that point to look for an ex-U.S. company or not? And I want to tie my second question back to the first one as well, which is when we get these updates on avelumab plus 4-1BB and OX40 combinations from your ongoing MEDLEY trial, how does that inform whether or not you'll look externally for a large IO acquisition? Thank you so much. Ian C. Read: Thanks for the question. So on the tax reform issue, if there's no tax reform, we will continue to look at acquisitions based on the value creation for shareholders as we've always done. So I don't really speculate on that. And on the IO development, obviously the IO is an interesting category. It has a lot of variability right now and in performance of different products. We remain focused on improving our business in IO. And we'll have to wait to see with the readout of those trials as to what it tell us and what direction we want to take. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Ian. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Christopher Schott : Great. Thanks very much. Just two questions here. Maybe the first was just elaborating a little bit on Ibrance trends in the U.S. You talked about 50% penetration right now. So the question is, where do you see penetration peaking over time? And what do you think it's going to take to get that additional penetration in the market? My second question was on repatriation and tax reform. I think you've talked in the past of about $160 billion of foreign earnings at Pfizer. And that repatriation of these earnings could allow the company to bring back significant future earnings to the U.S. at a very low tax rate. To the extent we get repatriation, should we think of that as just fundamentally altering your approach to either leverage or capital deployment? I guess another way of looking at this, should we think about a step-up in Pfizer's annual capital deployment if this were to occur, whether that's large deals, small deals, or repo? Or is this just \u2013 be kind of business as usual as it relates to business development? Thank you. Ian C. Read: Albert, do you want to deal with Ibrance? Albert Bourla : Yes, thank you. First of all, let me say that we are very pleased with the results of Ibrance. We've had 59% growth globally versus the same quarter of last year. Ibrance last year was already a $2 billion product, so this is a significant growth. Moving forward, the growth for Ibrance will come in the U.S. from expanded usage with already prescribing physicians, but also from expanding the CDK market as you well alluded. The penetration of CDK right now, it is 50%. But if you see the new patients, it is 57% and historical was always 50%. I think the introduction of new CDK competitors in the market and, more importantly, the publication of more data is enhancing the confidence of physicians in the class and will benefit overall the class. So I see that \u2013 I don't see any reason why this will not go very high, because it is the standard of care anyway Ian C. Read: Thank you, Albert. Frank? Frank A. D'Amelio: Yeah. Ian C. Read: Do you want to discuss the repatriation alternatives? Frank A. D'Amelio: Sure. So, Chris, all the numbers you cited, the $160 billion is a number I've cited previously. Remember that's accumulated profit and earnings, that's not cash. You basically said that in your question. You really had two questions. One was, does it alter our approach in capital allocation? From my perspective the answer is no. Our priorities for capital allocation don't change. They are dividends, share buybacks, investing in the business, and M&A. Those will continue to be our capital allocation priorities going forward. And then your second question was, would that alter our approach on business development? My answer is no. From my perspective our approach doesn't change. It's we're agnostic to size. And hopefully our actions over the past or in the past have demonstrated that. And our compass on deals has been, is, and will remain shareholder value. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Frank and Albert. Next question please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi. Andrew S. Baum: Thank you. Couple of questions, please. Firstly, on talazoparib, given the recent Merck/Astra [AstraZeneca] deal and the anticipated heavy investments in the program, could you give us an outline of where you intend to go and how quickly with your DNA damage repair agent, both on monotherapy in selective patient populations as well as in combination with Bavencio and your broader portfolio? And then second, while I know shareholder value will guide your direction, should I assume Pfizer has no interest in asset swaps with enthusiastic potential buyers for your Consumer business, such as GSK? In the event of a trade sale, most likely use will be cash to fund business development? Ian C. Read: Sorry. Mikael, would you like to take the tala question? Mikael Dolsten : Yeah, thank you for your interest in talazoparib. We regard it as a very potent PARP inhibitor. It's dosed as 1 milligram. And it has tumor activity that has been very efficacious in preclinical models and in early clinical studies. We look very much forward to the near readout of our Phase 3 EMBRACA trial that's exploring talazoparib versus standard of care in germline BRCA-positive metastatic breast cancer. We also are looking at avelumab plus talazoparib across a number of tumor indications, which may allow us to take benefit of the increased impact of talazoparib to make tumors immunogenic, in which avelumab can augment and benefit for patients. We are starting those studies and look forward to expanding them rapidly. We see also opportunity for talazoparib in other combination, such as Xtandi in prostate cancer. So indeed, it's a growing important asset for us. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Mikael. On the question of the Consumer business. We have some time been looking and seeking strategic deals for our Consumer business, whereby we would \u2013 perhaps involving asset swaps. I think this process we're going to take in the strategic review may shake loose more alternatives in that aspect. And in regarding the proceeds, it's really premature to speculate, given the fact it may not be \u2013 we may spin the division as a separate company, depending on how we create maximum value. So we'll have to wait to see exactly how we recover the full value of this business. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Ian and Mikael, next question please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank. Gregg Gilbert : Thanks. Sticking on the theme of big deals, since you're asked about your willingness and interest in doing big deals so often, I was hoping you would offer your historical view on whether very large deals in the industry and for Pfizer in particular have been value enhancing. Secondly, John, can you go into some more detail about what's causing the shortages? Is this a system-wide issue? Is it tied to FDA issues or just demand outstripping supply? And when do you expect the close out letter from McPherson? Thanks. Ian C. Read: Okay. Frank, retrospective on big deals, please. Frank A. D'Amelio: Yes, so I guess the big deal would be Wyeth in terms of what we've done. I think the retrospective on that is it's been very value enhancing. If you look at our portfolio today, much of it has come from the Wyeth acquisition. When we announced that deal, we announced $4 billion in synergies. We clearly exceeded that. If you look at the value we got for the Nutrition business that came from Wyeth, if you look at the value we got in Zoetis, much of which came from the Wyeth acquisition, if you look at the Consumer business that we currently have. So quite frankly, if you look at the Wyeth business retrospectively, significant value creation from that acquisition. Ian C. Read: I think in general, I would say that the big deals prior to that have also been value creation deals. So, as we always said, we're agnostic to size as we have a core competency in business development and integrating companies. And we'll continue to use that competence. John, do you want to comment on the shortages? John D. Young: Yes, so thanks for the question, Gregg. So in the Essential Health portfolio, as Frank mentioned in his comments, we have been experiencing some supply shortages for some of our products. The shortages are primarily for products in the legacy Hospira portfolio. And they're driven by I guess a blend of what we term capacity constraints and technical issues. I think as Frank also mentioned, when we acquired Hospira, we originally thought that it would take one to two years to integrate their manufacturing plants and resolve the majority of the supply chain issues that we were aware of. What I would say is we have a robust action plan in place, and we believe that we'll make substantial progress in 2018 towards reducing the sterile injectable shortages. In regard to McPherson, I think all I would say is that we've submitted a corrective and preventative action plan to the FDA, and we've been diligently working to address the items outlined in the warning letter. We provide regular updates to the FDA on the status of that action plan and will continue to do so. Charles E. Triano: Thank you. Next question please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from David Maris from Wells Fargo. David Maris : Good morning. On biosimilars and the J&J suit, maybe if you could, just address them. How pervasive do you think these types of anti-competitive contracts are? What do you think the timeline on resolution and potential outcomes could be? And do you think this largely explains the major difference in the uptake in Europe and other outside the U.S. markets on biosimilars versus the U.S., or do you think there's another dynamic going on? Thank you. Ian C. Read: Doug, would you like to answer that? Douglas M. Lankler: Sure. So taking the last part of the question first, we do think so. We think in what we're calling the closed market area, we're seeing uptake that we think supports our claim that J&J's anti-competitive practices concerning Remicade have denied U.S. patients and the broader healthcare system the benefits of robust price competition and therapeutic options in the biologics marketplace. Our concern that J&J has threatened to withhold significant rebates to insurers for both current and future patients and also engage in what we think are inappropriate and inaccurate marketing claims, for example, suggesting that patients need to fail first on Remicade before using Inflectra \u2013 seem to be unique to J&J. But obviously, we believe it's a violation of the antitrust laws. Ian C. Read: John, do you want to add something? John D. Young: Yes, I would just add, David, that as Ian mentioned in his comments, Inflectra has actually performed well in closed systems in the United States, and those are systems which prioritize healthcare cost savings over short-term rebating. And as of quarter three, we've reached a 54% share in those closed systems. And I think our perspective is that the performance in those closed systems demonstrates that where payers, providers, and patients have access to Inflectra, Inflectra can offer significant value. The closed systems obviously only represent a relatively small portion of the market, around about 5% of total infliximab volume. And I think as Doug has commented, due to J&J's exclusionary contracting, lower priced Inflectra has largely not received commercial access at parity to Remicade and remains disadvantaged. But overall, I think that our performance in the closed systems really represents the value that Inflectra can deliver to healthcare providers and to patients. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, John and Doug. Could we move to our next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin : Thank you. I just have a couple. First for you, Ian, has Pfizer had discussions with other companies regarding alternative drug distribution models or potential new entrants into the drug distribution business? Obviously, I'm referring to the havoc that is wreaked upon that industry because of the threat from Amazon. I just would love your thoughts on that. And just taking a five-year view, do you see new entrants entering the drug distribution industry, PBMs or drug retail pharmacy industry? Just wondering what your thoughts are on that. And then just if I could move to the Essential Health business, that business continues to be a real drag on your overall performance. And there you cited specific reasons this quarter. At the time of the Hospira deal, I think you had projected that this business would eventually flatten out because of growth in emerging markets, opportunities from the sterile injectable business, as well as biosimilars. But that doesn't seem to be panning out. Is this business salvageable? Can it ever stop declining and in fact start growing, or is this just an anchor you're going to have to deal with? Thanks very much. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Jami. On the potential changes in distribution, all I would say is that any system of distribution that can cut costs and get a wide availability of products to patients is something that the whole industry would be interested in vis-\u00e0-vis a distribution system going back into PBMs and adjudication. I think that's somewhat more of a difficult strategic proposal, as it then enters the whole issue of the world of insurers and PBMs and deciding on differential access, and that's a whole different skill set. Regarding the Essential Health business, I'll ask John to make his comments on that. John D. Young: So look, thanks for your question, Jami. And let me just reiterate what we've said in the past, which is we've always said that in the medium term, we believe that we can return the Essential Health business to low to mid-single-digit growth. We didn't specifically put a timeline on that. But we framed that out as being over a three to four-year period. The reason that we believed that it was going to take time is because of the headwind of LOEs. Frank commented on that in his comments. And whilst for the corporation, the impact is moderating, in 2017 we still have some headwinds, predominantly in the Essential Health business. So in quarter three, just to quantify that, the total LOE impact on the business in the quarter was around about $339 million, due to just a range of products that have gone off patent or are experiencing generic competition, Pristiq, Lyrica, Vfend, Relpax, Nitrostat, and so on. The thing about those time-bound events, however, is that by definition they will moderate. And so that basic aspiration to return this business to be a low to mid-single-digit grower is something that we still retain. And just to break out the performance in the quarter for you, Jami, although Pfizer Essential Health declined by 11%, if you actually exclude the impact of the Infusion Systems business divestiture and also the impact of LOEs, the business was actually flat in the quarter. So I think whilst we are still on that path to recovery, I think we remain committed to and actually very positive about the aspiration to return this business to the growth profile that we've outlined in previous quarters. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, John. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink. Seamus Fernandez : Great, thanks for the question. So first question, Ian and Frank, can you guys comment on the structure that you think would really optimize the value for the Consumer business? You guys have sold businesses in the past, but also I think the Zoetis split was a great example of success. And you've also done some creative combinations. So just trying to get a better sense of where you think the most value has really been added for shareholders in the context of those different decision points with Consumer? And then the second question really is when we think about the opportunity in the IO space, would you guys please comment on clinical trials that could read out next year that you're most excited to see the results of? Thanks. Ian C. Read: Okay, I'll ask Frank to answer \u2013 give you our thoughts on the structure that would most likely optimize value. And then I'll ask Albert to talk about IO studies \u2013 sorry, I'll ask Mikael... Mikael Dolsten : Yeah. Ian C. Read: ...about how IO studies reading out. Frank A. D'Amelio: So, Seamus, on structure. Let me just start with obviously we have a baseline view in terms of what we think that Consumer business is worth, based on obviously our projections on future cash flows, discounted back to a net present value. In terms of structure I think it's really, what maximizes value? And if you look at what we've done in the past in terms of some of our larger divestments, we sold the Capsugel business. We sold the Nutrition business. And then we split, to your point, the Zoetis business. Obviously when we were doing the Zoetis transaction, we were receiving incoming calls, had offers. But quite frankly, we didn't think that those offers exceeded the value that we could get from a split. And so we went ahead and we proceeded with a split. So my answer, my short answer is we will pursue the structure that best maximizes the value to our shareholders. And hopefully our actions in the past have demonstrated that that's what we've done. Ian C. Read: Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : So thank you for the interest in our IO portfolio. So we actually have, together with our partner Merck KGaA, a very much, well running IO portfolio. And we have 30 studies, including nine in new pivotal indications and more than 6,300 patients enrolled. In the near-term readout from now towards 2019, we have actually eight pivotal readout, starting quite soon with gastric third line, followed by in 2018 lung second line, ovarian second line as we come towards end 2018 and into 2019, real interesting studies in earlier lines such as kidney cancer, combo of Bavencio and Inlyta, Bavencio in gastric first-line maintenance, in lung first-line, bladder first-line, and ovarian first-line, chemo, IO, all in 2019. In addition to those eight pivotal studies that can be registration-enabling for us, we have a number of non-pivotal that can guide us to accelerate clinical programs. And that includes late this year and early next year, IO combos with 4-1BB followed by Bavencio with OX40. We'll share further data on Bavencio with lorlatinib and with also late next year, our triple combo will be part of this. So I would also like to say that we have, beyond just the checkpoint inhibitor, a very interesting vaccine opportunity, where we have our prostate vaccines that will be followed by another vaccines go into human studies in the quite near future, that contains multiple vaccine components, plus PD-1 blockade, plus CTLA-4 blockade, really interesting concept. And finally, beyond the IO, you probably are aware that we have a very rich and vibrant and quality portfolio where we recently announced in our targeted portfolio, positive data for Xtandi in PROSPER. We have in preparation for registration plans around dacomitinib, lorlatinib. We have soon readout of talazoparib. And we have positive data on glasdegib, which make us engaged in also registration study. So it's a very rich and quality pipeline, where obviously the IO and Bavencio is an important piece. Thank you. Seamus Fernandez : Thank you. Charles E. Triano: Great. Thanks, Mikael. Can we move for our next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Hi. Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. So first, I just want to see if you can give a little more color on the impact of price in the U.S. on the quarter for the Innovative Health business as a whole? Or at least for some of the key products, like Ibrance, Lyrica, Eliquis, Xeljanz. And then my second question also on \u2013 touching on Eliquis. Just curious there what your thoughts are. Have we seen positive data from Xarelto from the COMPASS study? They have some additional data coming from their lifecycle management program over the next few years. So do you see that data in any way impacting Eliquis' growth? And just curious, just looking back now, there's a very limited lifecycle management program around Eliquis. And I think it's just sort of surprising for such a large product. Is there anything that you and Bristol [Bristol-Myers Squibb] are doing in terms of trying to come up with new indications or somehow extend out that product beyond what it is right now? Thanks so much. Ian C. Read: Thank you. Frank, impact of price? And then Albert can discuss Eliquis. Frank A. D'Amelio: So globally, all-in, total company price for the quarter was 0%. In the U.S. it was plus 3%. That's for the quarter. If we go year-to-date, so the nine months cumulatively, same numbers. All-in enterprise-wide, total company globally, 0%. In the U.S. plus 3%. Ian C. Read: Thank you. Eliquis, Albert? Albert Bourla : Yes. First of all, let me say that Eliquis had a phenomenal performance again this quarter, 43% operational growth for the quarter. The U.S., significant growth of 39% operational growth. It is the number one NOAC prescribed by specialists and primary care physicians. To your question on data already presented, based on the consideration that I'm going to say, we see the potential impact of COMPASS study upon Eliquis business will be limited. First of all, in the broader protocol of exclusion of NVAF patients, the rivaroxaban-only arm did not meet efficacy endpoints. There were high bleeding rates for both rivaroxaban arms in the trial and at different dose and dosing regimen compared under rivaroxaban NVAF dose. That being said, I want to emphasize that we cannot make a comparison when we don't the complete studies. But we feel very confident on the growth projections that we have right now with Eliquis. Charles E. Triano: Thank you. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. David R. Risinger: Thanks very much. I have two questions. First, could you please update us on the recent IPR developments on your pneumococcal vaccine patents through 2026? And the potential implications for Merck's 15-valent vaccine or other potential pneumococcal vaccine competitors? And then second, could you just frame for us where Ibrance's ex-U.S. rollouts stand and whether you ultimately expect ex-U.S. Ibrance sales to eclipse the dollar revenue opportunity in the U.S.? Thank you. Ian C. Read: Doug, please, the IPR, inter-partes review, process. Douglas M. Lankler: Sure. Thanks for the question, David. So we were very pleased to see the October 20 denial of Merck's inter-partes review filings on two of our U.S. patents covering compositions of pneumococcal vaccines. So these patents stand as valid and will not expire until 2026. We believe these patents and others in our portfolio may present freedom to operate issues for Merck or anybody else trying to develop a pneumococcal vaccine. As Ian mentioned at the outset of the call, we've started Phase 2 trials for our next-generation 20-valent pneumococcal vaccine and have received Fast Track designation from the FDA. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Doug. Albert, on Ibrance? Albert Bourla : Yes, ex-U.S. Ibrance is performing very well, and we are very pleased. Let me focus on Europe right note. It is the best-performing area, because we have also the upcoming launch of Japan, but it's not started yet. The early EU launch indicators, they show rapid Ibrance adoption in first-line. There is also strong adoption of Ibrance in patients who were already treated with AR monotherapy, also in patients in later lines of therapy. We are having positive discussions with reimbursement bodies right now. Pricing and reimbursement process are ongoing across Europe in accordance with national procedures and timelines. But we have already secure investment in several countries. We are in the middle of multiple negotiations, so I wouldn't like to speak more about that. Our international sales were in this quarter $165 million. This is up 30% versus the previous quarter, sequential of the second quarter. In Europe in particular the growth was even greater, 35% up versus the previous quarter. We see this trend continue as we are launching in other jurisdictions and as we are getting price reimbursement in Europe and as we are going of course to places like Japan. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Albert. Next question please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Bernstein. Tim Anderson : Thank you. A couple of questions. On the lawsuit with J&J on Inflectra, if you don't win, do you think that would have broad negative ramifications to other future U.S. biosimilar launches? And it would foretell a different future uptake profile in the U.S.? My guess is that you'll answer that yes, otherwise you wouldn't be suing, unless you're suing for some other reason. And second question is going back to a question I've asked frequently in the past. Your commitment to avelumab? The reason for my question is pretty obvious. In the past you've said you're committed. But some investors I talk to claim that over the last couple of months, management has said they would be willing to upgrade \u2013 you'd be willing to upgrade your anti-PD under the right circumstances. I'm wondering if you'd like to either confirm or deny that? Or maybe at minimum just add some current color to the question? Ian C. Read: On the lawsuit, Tim, I think the lawsuit was taken because we strongly believe that the actions of J&J are not acceptable under the anti-trust litigation. More importantly I think the solution to this will come from a societal view on that biosimilars are there to provide access to patients once the patent has expired. And that enough is enough. That you shouldn't be using contracting mechanisms to extend your exclusivity, when society expects to get access to products once the patent is expired. So we believe there will be quite rigorous debates within society, within the CMS, as how does the governmental systems accrue the benefits of biosimilars. So we sort of see it as both a legal strategy and a strategy of alerting policymakers that Europe is obviously benefiting from biosimilars, so why isn't the U.S.? Given that the law was passed to make biosimilars readily available. On avelumab, we remain committed to our programs with our partner. Regarding any rumors you may or may not heard, I really can't speculate on them. I've actually I think addressed a couple of questions from you on calls about our partnership with Merck. And I don't really think it would be helpful to add any more comments. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Ian. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from John Boris from SunTrust. John T. Boris: Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the quarter. First question for Frank. I know you haven't outlined 2018 guidance, but could you maybe walk us through qualitatively what some of the headwinds and tailwinds are that you're expecting for 2018 that might impact or shape our models? Second question on the Established (sic) [Essential] Health business. On some of the smaller companies we've seen multisource competition being accelerated by ANDA approvals on injectables. Are you seeing an increased number of ANDAs being approved across injectables? And is that having an impact on pricing? Third question on Ibrance. In Europe in particular in markets where you have to negotiate pricing, do you \u2013 are you recording any deferred revenues or for revenue recognition purposes that might show up in 4Q or in 2018? And that should do it for the questions. Thanks. Ian C. Read: Okay. Thank you, John. On Ibrance the answer is no. We continue to sell Ibrance under our traditional model of selling and booking sales when we make them. On the Essential business, perhaps John could make some comments. John D. Young: Yeah, so, John, look, I think the FDA have been very clear about the perspective that they have that they believe that competition is the most important factor in being able to reduce health care costs. That's actually a position that Pfizer has long supported, that we believe in a competitive marketplace and we also believe that the availability of timely approval of generic alternatives is critical to patient access and long-term sustainability of the health care system. We manufacture and commercialize a number of products in the FDA's published off-patent pharmaceutical product with limited or no competition today. And we do anticipate that certain products on that list that we currently commercialize could face competition from additional manufacturers over the next several years. All of that said, we also are currently exploring opportunities to bring to market certain other products on the list, which Pfizer could have the manufacturing capability and capacity to reliably produce. So the FDA have been very clear about their perspective in this space. It's a competitive market space. And one that we expect to remain so. Ian C. Read: And I would add that the requirements from the FDA and the European Union on the manufacturing of sterile injectables continue to increase and ensures that any competitor needs to have robust good manufacturing practices, which is also positive for patients. Frank, on the models? Frank A. D'Amelio: So, John, we'll give detailed guidance for 2018 on our next earnings call, as we always do when we close out the fiscal year. We'll close out 2017, and then we'll provide guidance on 2018. But in terms of you mentioned headwinds and tailwinds. The way I'll do this I think is maybe the rhythm of the revenue. So we'll have LOEs next year. Our current estimate on LOEs is about $2 billion, so that will be a headwind. In terms of tailwinds, we continue to expect new products like Ibrance, Eliquis, and Xeljanz to perform very nicely. Our recently acquired products, like Xtandi and Eucrisa, we expect to perform very nicely in emerging markets. If you look at emerging markets for the quarter, up 11%, year to date up 9%, so we continue to expect those areas of the business to perform well. Biosimilars this quarter up 67% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. So lots of areas where we expect to see continued growth going forward. And we'll give details on guidance on the next call. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Frank. We'll take the next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Richard Purkiss from Piper Jaffray. Richard J. Purkiss: Thanks. I have two quick questions. Firstly on Xeljanz, how much interest are you getting from rheumatologists and gastroenterologists on the prospects of its approval in psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis? And then also I noticed your JAK-1, you presented data in atopic dermatitis. Can you just give us some color on how it compares to other JAK inhibitors in that space? Thanks very much. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Richard. Of course, on Xeljanz, we don't do any pre-marketing activities on indications that haven't been approved. But in discussions with experts who advise us, we think it is a competitive profile in both of those conditions. And on JAK-1, I'll ask Mikael to add some commentary. Mikael Dolsten : Thank you for your interest in JAK-1. We shared data recently at the EADV conference in Europe. And obviously, there has been another JAK-1 that together define the JAK-1 class performance in atopic dermatitis. On the efficacy side, we shared that it was a very impressive number of patients that reached cleared or almost cleared skin lesions, about 45%, in that range. What is very interesting with this class is that it has a rapid onset of action. Within a few weeks, you see improvement. And between weeks four and six, you have reached a very significant part of maximal effect. Atopic dermatitis patients suffer particularly from pruritus itch, and I think this is really unique in the yaquant clause (59:02) and was evident in our study that already two days \u2013 I repeat, two days of the initiation of therapy, you could see itch relief. And then within two weeks, it has reached really impactful effect and plateaued at 64% that got very substantial itch relief. And to the best of my knowledge, there hasn't been any reported drug or recently approved drug that has had such favorable rapid onset, which is critical for these patients. Thank you for interest. Charles E. Triano: Great. Thanks, Mikael. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen. Steve Scala : Thank you. I have a few questions. I think the sale of Pfizer Consumer to J&J a decade ago was viewed as at a great price, but in retrospect a strategic mistake for Pfizer. Would you agree with that characterization, and why is it different now? Second, regarding Xtandi and the PROSPER trial, the release says Pfizer will discuss the results with health authorities. Given the positive study, what is there to discuss as opposed to just filing outright? And then lastly, I appreciate that it is completely in line with background rate, but there are about 40 DVTs or PEs reported in Xeljanz studies. Has Pfizer looked at whether these patients were also on Celebrex or other COX-2 inhibitors? And if you have, then what did it show? Thank you very much. Ian C. Read: Steve, thank you. I'm not sure that your general characterization of the J&J deal is accurate. But nevertheless, that's something that's in the past. We make decisions on future dispositions based on the facts we see today and the opportunities we see today. And we believe that it's well worth exploring the strategic alternatives for that business. Vis-\u00e0-vis PROSPER... Albert Bourla : PROSPER, I can take. Ian C. Read: Yeah, will you please? Albert Bourla : Steve, I want to be clear. We were delighted with the PROSPER positive top line reports that came two years earlier than anticipated. We are looking forward to disclosing detailed results at an upcoming major medical congress. Given the nature of the data and the importance of the claim, we have resourced very well. The team is preparing the dossier, and we expect to file soon. Mikael Dolsten : Concerning Xeljanz, first of all, as you know, it's been performing excellent. It has been prescribed to more than 100,000 patients worldwide. And we had recently an advisory committee for expansion into psoriatic arthritis and got an overwhelming positive vote for the efficacy and safety profile. Concerning specifically thromboembolic events, we have of course carefully looked at Xeljanz, both in clinical studies comparing Xeljanz to control group, as well as in registers and how it's performed in the market. And we do not see any difference between Xeljanz-treated or other treatment of rheumatoid arthritis patients. We're aware that there have been some competitive reports of some other compounds in this space. But we do not see any issues with Xeljanz at all in all our different analyses, where the clinical registers on the use of the drug in the market. So we are very pleased with the profile of Xeljanz as it stands. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Mikael. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO. Alex Arfaei : Good morning, folks. Thank you for taking the questions. I have three, if I may. First, following up on Xeljanz ex-U.S., could you please comment on how we should think about the uptake there relative to the strong growth that we're seeing in the U.S? Second, on Eucrisa, I think it's fair to say that the launch is slower than expected. Is the outlook for that product still peak sales of $2 billion, even with the JAK-1s emerging as competition? And then third, on Hospira sterile injectables, I think, Frank, you said supply challenges led to sales being several hundred million lower. If that reflects demand, is it fair to say that most of that should come back in 2018 as you address those shortages? Thank you. Ian C. Read: Albert, could you address the Xeljanz ex-U.S. and the Eucrisa performance? Albert Bourla : Yes, let me start ex-U.S. with Europe. We are very pleased with the performance in Europe. Xeljanz can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerant methotrexate or when treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate. So far, we have launched in nine markets, and those includes UK, Netherlands, Sweden, but we do not have still pricing negotiations completed with the rest. We think that the uptake in Xeljanz based on our initial interactions with physicians will be very strong in Europe. Now let me go back to Eucrisa. First of all, let me start. Yes, we think that will be a $2 billion-plus product, and we are very excited with the progress. In the third quarter we almost doubled the number of patients versus the previous quarter, the second quarter. As Ian said, we have 83,000. And the product has been prescribed so far by more than 20,000 physicians. And the majority of them, 60% of them, are repeaters. We have 90% of commercial lives that have removed the NDC block, which is very, very good. And they're covering now Eucrisa. However, at this moment, only approximately 50% of the commercial lives have unrestricted access or require one electronic step edit, some require more. And they're working very hard to revisit that. Also I need to emphasize that the net sales, the so-significant sampling and couponing, which was introduced to launch and to drive success. The free trial voucher now has expired. However, we have a standard co-pay card that continues to be supporting patients' affordability. Ian C. Read: And I think the JAK-1 marketplace is different from the topical Eucrisa marketplace. And they're appropriately medically segmented, giving opportunities to both \u2013 for both products. Albert Bourla : Very different and a very different profile with Eucrisa have a very benign profile in terms of safety and could be given to kids as young as two years old. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Albert. Frank, please. Frank A. D'Amelio: Yeah. So, Alex, John mentioned that the Hospira remediation efforts in the legacy Hospira manufacturing facilities are taking a little bit longer to remediate than we thought. However, we believe those will be substantially completed by the end of 2018. As a result, we expect that several hundred million in 2017 to moderate into 2018, which means we'll be lower in 2018 than 2017. Alex Arfaei : Thanks. Charles E. Triano: Thank you. Thanks, Frank. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS. Marc Goodman : Yes, Mikael, I was hoping you could give us some highlights on some of the key products in the pipeline that have moved into clinical studies, maybe into Phase 2 and stuff. I saw there was a NASH drug that moved in there. Maybe you can talk about that a little bit. And then also provide us an update on tanezumab. When are we going to see the first pivotal study? Thanks. Ian C. Read: Good questions, Marc. Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : Yes, thank you. Starting with tanezumab. We're very excited about that product. And of course given the national crisis with opioids, it's \u2013 the really main opportunity near term for novel pain relief mechanism that has no addictive abuse related profile. So you should expect during somewhere between first to second half transition next year, that we will start to communicate the studies, osteoarthritis followed by chronic lower back pain. It's overall, six Phase 3 studies in approximately 7,000 patients, a very comprehensive package. And we are very encouraged and optimistic that this could be a real very important option for patients going forward. And that's why we look forward to see the data in this study. In the portfolio that you asked me about, I will just mention that with the recent positive readout of our JAK-1 atopic dermatitis that I earlier commented on, is a really intriguing example of how this next-generation JAK can contribute very meaningful clinical efficacy. Within that JAK portfolio, we have a lot of momentum. And we expect next year to have readouts of two different JAKs in alopecia. And I remain very encouraged that these two novel JAKs could represent new treatment options for a patient group in alopecia that haven't really had any new treatment in decades. We also have a readout for our 2Q (1:09:15) JAK-1 in psoriasis Phase 2. And you may have remembered from an earlier small trial readout that that drug performed in a very impressive excellent manner. So these are example in the JAK portfolio. We recently also shared positive data from our gene therapy Factor IX study. And we're now advancing that together with Spark Therapeutics towards planning for pivotal studies. We have data ongoing with Sangamo on our Factor VIII gene therapy. And finally, on the ACC NASH study, we are very encouraged about the ACC drug that we have. We think there is opportunity due to its liver selective profile to give it that really optimal level to get a very meaningful lowering of lipids in the liver. And we are just, right now, on the cusp of starting those studies. And hope to have readout late next year or early the following. So stay close to us. Marc Goodman : Thank you. Ian C. Read: You're quite welcome. Charles E. Triano: Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Tony Butler from Guggenheim Partners. Olivia Brayer : Hi. Good morning. This is Olivia Brayer on for Tony. I have a two-part question regarding the JAVELIN Lung 100 study for Bavencio. What was the reasoning behind the dosing amendments to the trial? And can you provide some sort of color on how you were thinking about those amendments and on PD-L cutoffs that you were using? And then my follow-up question is, do you see crossover as a potential problems for your overall survival data? And for which hazard ratio did you power the study? Thank you. Ian C. Read: Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : Yeah. So I will only comment since this was a while ago that we introduced a hierarchy of PD-L1 cutoffs that were basically aligned what other current studies are using that allow us to study high, medium, or low. And we have sized the study appropriately. Of course there is always in first line studies an issue that patient may crossover. But the unique characteristics of IO will allow you really to look at the benefit, given that you have this tail of patients that will stay responders if you've got a good mix of patient selection and study planning. So we remain optimistic about this study. I should say that we also have included a high dose Bavencio arm that could offer a unique differentiation versus other PD-1 or PD-L1 lung cancer studies. Charles E. Triano: Thank you for the background, Mikael. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Holford from Jefferies. Jeffrey Holford : Hi, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. Just first for Ian, I think you've been one of the most shareholder friendly and proactive CEOs across the whole industry. But in light of some of the frustrations you've had around M&A, inversion, splits, et cetera, I wonder if you can discuss a little bit the succession plan for the CEO role? And the potential timing of that? And what if any structural changes you would still like to look at implementing at Pfizer during your tenure? And then second, sorry to go back to the J&J litigation again, but maybe you can help me a bit on this. Maybe for Doug. Is it not fairly standard for companies to remove or adjust rebates on the loss of formulary positioning? For example, has Pfizer not engaged in that practice in the past? Or is it that you're potentially suggesting that there should be some kind of double standard for biosimilars with respect to that? Just because they don't have an equivalent to an AB rating just as yet? Thank you. Ian C. Read: Well, while Doug is thinking about that question. Succession, Pfizer, like all major companies, the board has a responsibility on succession planning. We have a robust succession process within Pfizer. And at due points they \u2013 that succession plan will become active. My focus in Pfizer has always been focused on creating shareholder value for all the moves we make and all of the actions we take. And of course I'm extremely pleased about the maturing and \u2013 the maturing nature of our pipeline and the very promising assets that I see sit in that pipeline, which will come to market 2019 through 2025 or more. Thank you for the question. Doug? Douglas M. Lankler: Yeah. So thanks, Jeff. So rebate programs in and of themselves are accepted industry practice, so long as they are legally structured. We think J&J's practices in the character of the biologics marketplace in particular, where, among other things, there's no mandatory substitution at the pharmacy, and thus originated firms have substantial leverage over existing patients, make this a violation of the federal antitrust laws. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Doug. And can we take our last question, please, operator? Operator : Your final question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Geoffrey Meacham : Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Just have a couple. Albert, on Xtandi, do you feel like commercial trends in prostate have stabilized in the U.S.? Or is there a risk that co-pay and reimbursement, et cetera, could be a headwind looking to next year? And then as you move upstream in the paradigm, what's been the progress with new urologists as first-time prescribers? And then, Ian, real quick on the deal front. Where does geography fall in the priority list? I know previously it was more of a lever for inversion. But I wasn't sure if there was an objective, for example, to grow specifically outside the U.S. Thank you. Ian C. Read: On the geography, once again, it comes back to value for shareholders and opportunity. A dollar made in China is worth the same as a dollar made in Europe. So we're more focused on what does it do to our strategy? How does it strengthen the enterprises we're in? We've already got a very big international footprint. So how do we leverage that footprint? So all of those things come into consideration of how we produce value. Albert? Albert Bourla : Yeah. On Xtandi, let me take the opportunity to speak about the investment thesis of Medivation and that will answer all your questions for Xtandi as I do. When we bought the acquisition \u2013 when we bought Medivation, we said that the value drivers are, one, continue growth in the metastatic setting, primarily by growing prescription from urologists, as you said. The second was to obtain a broader indication in non-metastatic prostate cancer. And the third was to develop and commercialize talazoparib. In the metastatic prostate cancer we are very pleased, because Xtandi total demand continues to demonstrate some growth. This quarter, we have 15% growth compared to the same quarter of previous year. Urologists were growing 37%, as we have predicted that we would be able to grow. As Ian said, there is an all-times high with approximately 1,700 urologists prescribing the product. This, compared to Zytiga, that prescribed almost 407, so very big difference. In the non-metastatic prostate cancer, we were delighted with the positive results of PROSPER, two years earlier than expected. And as I said before, we are working very hard to file. And for talazoparib, we had an extensive discussion before. And Mikael alluded to the very robust development program. So the fundamentals of this acquisition are very, very helpful. We know that the next sales are lagging behind because of the Patient Assistance Program. So let me tell you where we stand with that. The program as a proportion of total demand was generally stable compared to the previous quarter, as Ian said. And as we stated previously, any change this year will be very gradual. And the reason is because all patients already enrolled in the program, they remain in this program for the entire calendar year. So there is not a possibility to have radical changes over there. But we believe as we move to the next calendar year, that the patient assistance as a percentage of total demand will start normalizing. Thank you. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Albert, and thanks for everyone on the call for your attention this morning. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude Pfizer's third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Charles Triano : Good morning and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer's fourth quarter 2017 performance and 2018 financial guidance. I'm joined today by our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Albert Bourla our Chief Operating Officer; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development, John Young, Group President of Pfizer Innovative Health and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel. The slides that will be presented on this call can be viewed on our website, pfizer.com/investors. Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Additional information regarding these factors is discussed under the disclosure notice section in the earnings release we issued this morning, as well as in Pfizer's 2016 annual report on Form 10-K, including in part one, item 1A, that is filed with the SEC and available at their website sec.gov and on our website at pfizer.com Forward-looking statements during this conference call speak only as of the original date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of those statements. Discussions during the call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's current report on Form 8-K, dated today, January 30, 2018. You may obtain a copy of the Form 8-K on our website at pfizer.com/investors. Any non-GAAP measures presented are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for financial measures required by U.S. GAAP, have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to the calculations of similar measures at other companies. We will now make prepared remarks, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian? Ian Read : Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. During my remarks, I will speak about our performance for the year; the continued advancement of our pipeline which we believe is more robust and productive than it has been in more than a decade and the expected impact of U.S. tax reform on Pfizer. Frank will provide details regarding the quarter and our 2018 financial guidance. Pfizer had another solid year in 2017, despite having just over a $3 billion negative revenue impact due to LOEs and the divestment of Hospira Infusion Systems, we were able to offset this impact and report flat operational revenue as we saw growth in many of our anchor brands. We also saw continued growth in emerging markets, which was up 11% operationally compared with the previous year. I\u2019ll begin with a few words regarding the performance of each of our business starting with Pfizer Innovative Health. This business had another strong year, growing its topline 8% operationally, thanks to the continued strength of several of our best-selling medicines. Ibrance revenues grew 47% operationally to $3.1 billion for the year. To date, Ibrance has been prescribed to more than 100,000 patients around the world and received regulatory approval in more than 80 countries; however, revenues in certain developed European markets were negatively impacted by a onetime price adjustment to full year 2017 revenues. This adjustment was the result of agreements to establish pricing levels comparable to historical European pricing analogs for oncology products ensure patient access and drive expected future growth in these markets. We see this as a positive for the future of the brand. We remain confident in the profile of Ibrance based on a number of factors including safety and efficacy. We are working to build on Ibrance\u2019s initial success with trials in the early breast cancer setting and the HER2 positive metastatic setting and move our novel next-generation investigational CDK inhibitor, which may be effective for patients as they become resistant to Ibrance. We expect to have this asset in the clinic this year. Eliquis alliance and direct sales revenue grew 47% operationally to $2.5 billion, and is the number one new two brand oral anticoagulant prescribed by cardiologists in 21 markets. Xeljanz experienced 45% year-over-year operational growth and achieved its first year of blockbuster status. We expect our information immunology franchises to continue to strengthen over the recent U.S. approval of Xeljanz\u2019 s for psoriatic arthritis, and we are hopeful that we will receive U.S. approval for a further indication ulcerative colitis this year. Chantix revenue grew 18% operationally to nearly $1 billion for the year. Lyrica revenues within [ph] Pfizer\u2019s Innovative Health grew 9% operationally the $4.5 billion for the year. Lyrica continued to be a strong contributor to the Innovative Health and we anticipate that Lyrica will maintain its market exclusivity in the United States until the end of 2018 or through June 2019 if the FDA grants approval for the paediatric extension exclusivity. Pfizer\u2019s share of Xtandi\u2019s U.S. net sales was $590 million for the year. In the fourth quarter 2017, Pfizer\u2019s share of net sales was $168 million up 12% from the third quarter 2017 and 22% from the fourth quarter of 2016. A number of urologists actively prescribing Xtandi continues to grow and reach an all-time high of more than 1,700 in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with approximately 500 for ZYTIGA. In terms of potentially expanding Xtandi\u2019s benefit to men with non-metastatic prostate cancer, in September we announced that the Phase 3 PROSPER trial in non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer met its primary endpoint. And we look forward to presenting detailed results at the ASCO GU Congress on February 8. We also pleased that in partnership with Astellas we have submitted the PROSPER data to the FDA seeking to expand the label to the non-metastatic CRPC setting. We are awaiting the FDA\u2019s acceptance of the application for review. Finally, we continue to review strategic options for our consumer healthcare business. This could include anything from a full or partial separation business to ultimately deciding to retain the business and we continue and expect to make decisions during 2018. Turning now to Pfizer Essential Health. While revenues for the year declined, due in large part to expected products LOEs, we once again saw strong operational growth both in emerging markets in our biosimilars portfolio. Emerging markets revenue grew 7% operationally for the year to 7 billion. China led the way growing 16% operationally. Our biosimilars business grew 66% operationally in 2017 to 531 million, and we remain the number one biosimilars company globally. We also advanced six biosimilars pipeline products during the year through various regulatory and data milestones. EH\u2019s growth in emerging markets and biosimilars were offset by product supply shortages in the sterile injectable business. Our sterile injectable shortages are primary for products from the legacy Hospira portfolio, and are largely driven by capacity constraints and technical issues. As we stated previously, we have a robust action plan in place and we believe we will make substantial progress in 2019 towards reducing these shortages. Turning to Inflectra. At the end of December each share increased to 5.6% of overall U.S. infliximab volume, up from 4.9% at the end of September. This increase was primarily due to the products continued strong performance in closed systems, such as the VA where the insurer and provider are the same entity. Despite J&J\u2019s exclusionary contracting with regard to Remicade, we continue to see increased coverage for Inflectra amongst commercial payors. And just last week, the appellate court ruled that a key patent that J&J is asserted to block access to Inflectra is invalid. Last quarter, I talked about the expected decline in the number and revenue impact of LOEs facing our business. And the further strengthening of R&D pipeline, we expect these trends to continue. In terms of LOEs, we expect the full year year-over-year impact to be about $2 billion in 2018, which remain significantly lower than our recent past. We expect the impact of LOEs will remain in the $2 billion range through 2020 before improving to $1 billion in 2021 and then $500 million or less from 2022 through 2025. At the same time, our pipeline continues to generate exciting new opportunities for our company and for the patients who benefit from our innovative therapies. In 2017, we received 10 approvals from the FDA. This is significantly more than we achieved in any year in the past decade. Let me touch on some of our most recent advances. In oncology, we recently presented positive results from the Phase 3 EMBRACA trial, which showed that our PARP inhibitor, talazoparib significantly extended progression free survival versus standard-of-care chemotherapy in patients with BRCA-positive metastatic breast cancer. In partnership with Merck KGaA, we look forward to continued progress with Bavencio, our PD-L1 inhibitor. We have upcoming data readouts in second line non small cell lung cancer and first line renal cell carcinoma in combination with INLYTA. In addition, the triplet study exploring the combination Bavencio, our 4-1BB agent, and our OX40 monoclonal antibody in solid tumors ended the clinic in the first half of 2017. We will continue to evaluate this combination throughout 2018. In 2018, we expect to advance multiple oncology filings in the registration process including talazoparib in EMBRACA positive metastatic breast cancer, Xtandi for non metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer, for which we have submitted an sNDA based on the Phase 3 PROSPER data. Lorlatinib which has shown activity in almost all known clinically acquired ALK mutations and health positive non-small cell lung cancer. Dacomitinib in EGFR mutated non small cell lung cancer based on the positive ARCHER 1050 findings published in September and our SMO inhibitor, glasdegib, for acute myeloid leukemia based on Phase 2 results. In Inflammation & Immunology, we have seven ongoing JAK clinical programs providing us with the strongest immuno kinase franchise in the industry. The Phase 2 data for our oral once daily JAK1 in atopic dermatitis was presented in September and this asset is the first and only JAK1 to enter Phase 3 in 2017. In Vaccines we began Phase 3 trials with our C. difficile vaccine. The studies have been enrolling well and our recent competitive decision has positioned us as a potential first-in-vaccine. Leveraging the success of Prevnar, we also moved into Phase 2 of our next-generation pneumococcal vaccine candidate with the potential to cover 20 serotypes. In addition, we are advancing a Phase 2 tetravalent Staphylococcus aureus vaccine with fast-track designation. In 2017 we also continue to take important steps towards becoming an industry leader in gene therapy. We see gene therapies as a field that holds tremendous promise for patients in areas of devastating need, particularly in rare, monogenic diseases with loss of function. We finished the year with two assets in the clinic that are potential therapies for Hemophilia B and Hemophilia A. In 2018, we expect readouts from multiple pivotal studies in rare diseases, including Rivipansel for Sickle cell disease and Vyndaqe in Cardiomyopathy. We also have begun screening patients for our potential gene therapy for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. We also broke ground on $100 million commercial gene therapy manufacturing facility in Sanford, North Carolina and when complete we\u2019ll have end-to-end capabilities from manufacturing to commercialization. Before closing my remarks today, I\u2019d like to spend a few moments discussing the new U.S. tax code, and its expected impact on our business. As you know, Pfizer has been advocating for many years for comprehensive tax reform. That\u2019s because the system that had been in place for U.S. based multinational companies that are competitive disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis foreign competitors with regard to the tax rate and international access to capital. The new tax code addresses these issues and helps level the playing field to make U.S. companies more competitive. After evaluating the expected positive net impact, the new tax code will have on Pfizer; we have decided to take several actions. Over the next five years, we plan to invest approximately 5 billion in capital projects in the U.S. including the strengthening of our manufacturing presence in the U.S. We also expect these reforms to favourably influence future investments. We plan to make a $500 million contribution to our U.S. pension plan in 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we made a $200 million charitable contribution to the Pfizer foundation. This organization provides grants and investment funding to support organizations and social entrepreneurs in an effort to improve healthcare delivery. We have also earmarked approximately 100 million for a special one-time bonus to be paid to all non-executive Pfizer colleagues. Given the more favorable repatriation provision, we are continuing reviewing our capital allocation opportunities under the new tax code. We will remain disciplined in our approach with value creation for shareholders remaining our compass. In summary, we continue to deliver our strategy in 2017. As a result, we saw continued growth of new brands, achieved a record number of product approvals, further advanced our pipeline, which we believe will be a significant competitive advantage and growth driver going forward. And we entered 2018 even better positioned to deliver new medicines for patients and increase value for our investors going forward. All of these achievements have been made possible by the strength of our leadership team, which we further strengthened recently with Albert Bourla taking on the role of Chief Operating officer, John Young, leading Pfizer Innovative Health and Angela Wong becoming the head of Pfizer Essential Health. These appointments are testament to the depth and breadth of our leadership talent, which has positioned us very well for continued success. Now we\u2019ll turn it over to Frank to provide details on the quarter and our outlook for 2018. Frank D'Amelio: Thanks Ian, good day everyone. As always the charts I am reviewing today are included in our webcast. Now moving onto the financials, fourth quarter 2017 revenues were approximately $13.7 billion, which include the favorable impact of foreign exchange of $114 million, partially offset by slight operational decline of $39 million. If you exclude both the prior year quarter revenues for Hospira Infusion Systems, or HIS, and the positive impact of foreign exchange, fourth quarter 2017 revenues increased $240 million or 2%. Our Innovative Health business recorded 5% operational revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2017, driven primarily by Eliquis globally, Xeljanz in the U.S., Prevenar 13 in emerging markets, and Lyrica, Ibrance and Chantix in the U.S. all of which were partially offset by lower revenues for Viagra in the U.S. because of generic competition beginning in December of 2017 and Enbrel in most developed Europe markets due to continued biosimilar competition. Revenues for our Essential Health business in the fourth quarter decreased 8% operationally, of which 5% was attributable to the divestiture of the HIS business in February of 2017. The remainder of the decrease was due to an 18% operational decrease from Peri-LOE Products, including the expected declines in Pristiq in the U.S. and Lyrica in developed Europe markets, as well as a 10% operational decline in the Sterile Injectable portfolio, primarily due to continued legacy Hospira product shortages in the U.S. all of which were partially offset by operational growth 72% from biosimilars, mainly driven by Inflectra in the U.S. and developed Europe. In Emerging Markets, Pfizer's overall Essential Health revenues grew 10% operationally, in the fourth quarter primarily due to 10% growth from the legacy established products portfolio and 23% growth from the sterile injectables portfolio. Fourth quarter reported diluted EPS was $2.02 compared with $0.13 in the year-ago quarter, primarily due to a lower effective tax rate due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts over the TCJA in late 2017. As a result, Pfizer\u2019s fourth quarter full year 2017 provision for taxes on reported income was favourably impacted by approximately $10.7 billion, primarily reflecting the re-measurement of U.S. deferred tax liabilities which includes the repatriation tax on deemed repatriated accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Our fourth quarter reported diluted EPS was also favourably impacted by lower restructuring and implementation cost and unfavourably impacted by higher losses on debt retirement. Adjusted diluted EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.62 versus $0.47 in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to a lower effective tax rate, lower adjusted total cost and expenses and fewer shares outstanding. I want to point out that diluted weighted average shares outstanding declined by 80 million shares versus the year-ago quarter due to our share repurchase program, reflecting the impact of our $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in February 2017 and completed in May of 2017. In addition, the full year 2017 weighted average shares used to calculate EPS was 6,058 million shares, a reduction of 100 million shares compared versus full year 2016. As I previously mentioned, foreign exchange positively impacted fourth quarter 2017 revenues by approximately $114 million and negatively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $127million. As a result, foreign exchange favorably impacted fourth quarter 2017 adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.01 versus the year-ago quarter As you can see on the chart, we have met or exceeded all components of our 2017 financial guidance. Moving onto full year 2018 financial guidance, it\u2019s important to note that this guidance includes a full year contribution from consumer healthcare and assumes no generic competition for Lyrica in the U.S. during 2018. We currently expect generic competition in June of 2019 contingent upon a six month term extension for paediatric exclusivity, which we are currently pursuing. We expect 2018 revenues to be in the range of $53.5 billion to $55.5 billion. This range incorporates an anticipated 900 million favorable impact of foreign-exchange. I want to point out that beginning in the first quarter of 2018 forward, total Viagra worldwide revenue will be reported in essential health, due to generic competition that began in the U.S. in December of 2017. Previously revenues for Viagra in the U.S. and Canada have been recorded in our innovative health business through December of 2017. We expect the effective tax rate on adjusted income to be approximately 17% in 2018 and sustainable for the foreseeable future, which is significantly lower than the approximately 23% that we previously anticipated for full year 2017 and reflects the enactment of the TCJA. Because of the significant changes in complexities to the tax law, this financial impact on 2018 guidance is provisional only and therefore subject to further analysis, interpretation and clarification of the tax reform legislation. I want to point out for modeling purposes that based on 2017 results a 1% reduction in the effective tax rate on adjusted income results in an approximate $0.03 increase to adjusted diluted EPS. Finally, as a result of the enactment of the recent legislation, we expect to repatriate the majority of our cash held internationally in 2018. As a reminder, as of the third quarter 2017 Pfizer had approximately $24.2 billion of cash and investments. Finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS will be in the range of $2.90 to $3, which incorporates $0.06 favorable impact from foreign exchange and $5 billion of anticipated share repurchases in 2018, the impact of which we expect to be offset by about half from dilution related to share-based employee compensation programs. Moving on to key takeaways; we delivered solid financial results in the fourth quarter of 2017 excluding HIS revenues for the prior quarter and the impact of foreign exchange, revenues increased 2% operational year-over-year driven by the strong growth from Eliquis and Xeljanz. We issue 2018 financial guidance ranges reflecting 4% revenue growth and 11% adjusted diluted EPS growth at their respective midpoints compared with 2017 actual results. We accomplish several key product and pipeline milestones and we returned $12.7 billion to shareholders in 2017 through dividends and share purchases including a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2018 and beyond. Now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Chuck. Charles Triano : And again, for the prepared remarks, operator, can we please poll for Q&A now. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets. Alex Arfaei : Great. Thank you. Good morning and thanks for talking the questions. I guess the first one for Ian, how should we think about the European pricing adjustment longer-term. Are these established contracts or should we expect more step downs, and could it have implications for U.S. pricing and pricing in general? And then follow-up for Frank, I appreciate that you\u2019re still reviewing your capital allocation opportunities, but your 5 billion share buyback seem conservative given all the options available to you if we think about the potential divestiture of the consumer business more efficient access to ex U.S. cash, how should we think about potential upside there? And finally Mikael, the tanezumab Phase 3 pivotal trials are coming up, how should we think about some of the previous safety issues that have delayed the seemingly promising asset? Thank you very much. Ian Read : Thank you, Alex. So, I\u2019m going to let Albert answer European price question, but I would like to point out ahead on that these negotiations were not related to competitive pressure. And I see the establishment of pricing for Ibrance in Europe as a major positive for the business going forward at prices that are consistent with the European oncology analogs. Albert, do you want to add any more context? Albert Bourla : Yes. First of all, as you said, the MBC something most of you said now, and you said it your remarks. And let\u2019s clarify the demand in Europe, continuous to throw [ph] very strong growth. We had 20% this quarter compared to previous quarter. And we had 29,000 Ibrance patients in Europe this year. To point that in context in the first year of the U.S. launch we had 20,000. Now the negative on this quarter as Ian said, it is due to one-time price adjustment with the full-year revenues, and these were part of finalizing broader reinvestment negotiations that will establish pricing levels to the historical, very comparable to historical European pricing analogs. And at the same time ensure broad patient access to drive potential future volume and more importantly revenue growth in these places. I'm very satisfied with these agreements. Overall we recognize the value that Ibrance brings to patients, and at the same time they offer an attractive cost-benefit to the payers. So in conclusion, in 2018 we expect to see strong volume and revenues growth in Europe and other international markets as a result of these deals. Ian Read : Thank you. Frank, do you want to talk about the capital allocation? Frank D'Amelio: Sure. So, Alex, you mentioned the 5 billion in buyback. Let me just run the numbers and then I'm going bump this up to a capital allocation conversation. So we\u2019ve announced 5 billion in buybacks. We also announced we\u2019re increasing our dividend to $0.34 a quarter, the combination of dividends and buybacks to 2018 we\u2019ll return more than 13 billion directly to shareholders. Now let me pump it up to more of a capital allocation conversation. The four priority areas that we've had in the past continue to be our four priority areas; those are obviously investing in our business, dividends, buybacks and M&A. So those were the areas, they remain the areas. And the nice thing about Pfizer is we have the ability to play in all four areas as we\u2019ve demonstrated in the past. Now, given tax reform and given, we\u2019re exploring strategic options for a consumer business, we will continue to review what our value \u2013 what our options our. We\u2019ll continue to evaluate our options in all these areas on a going forward basis. Ian Read : The answer to tanezumab please, Mikael. Mikael Dolsten : Thank you. You know, Alex, thank you for shading attention on tanezumab. We are very excited about the trial of six different studies, 7000 patients that are starting to read out early fall this year and then each of the trials further on into 2019. We have a unique position in the space as we gathered tremendous experience and insight in how to manage our NGF antibody and deal with rare events recorded as rapidly progressing away. We have been able to design the trial to minimize the risk for such to cure [ph] that includes reducing concomitant chronic use of insights. It includes lowering the dose of tanezumab in OA where some of these rare cases were seen in our trials while keeping higher doses in chronic low back pain where this is for worst not really reported. We've introduced risk management program and stopping criteria for individual patients. So overall we think we have really learned uniquely and been able to design a study that should minimize the risk of such events. I also want to take a step back and say that macro environment for the need of new pain medications have really changed. Perspective a number of years ago was that unmet medical need was rather satisfied. Unfortunate we have learned that the current pain medications particularly opioids have severe issues no just when it comes to the impact on G.I. respiratory but also the great addiction crisis that we\u2019re battling with. In contrast of course, monoclonal antibody like this that can be given conveniently sub-cute every eight weeks. We believe have a very attractive profile and we look forward very much to the readouts of the trials and report those. Thank you. Charles Triano : Thanks Mikael. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Vamil Divan : Hi, great. Thanks so much for taking the questions. So just one that there\u2019s been lot of discussion around the potential new entrants entering direct distribution; we had a news today around Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan. The quote and the commentary around -- they\u2019re obviously talking lot about healthcare costs and the impact it\u2019s having on the economy. You guys generated 26 million of sales in the U.S. last year. Just if you can kind of comment on how you see these impacting things maybe near-term and also longer-term? And how is it not ultimately a bad thing for larger companies such as Pfizer and that have generate so much of their sales from the U.S. And then my second question just quickly around guidance, totally different topic, with Xtandi you mentioned sort of positive news you have there, but just if you can talk about how you\u2019re thinking about that product. We obviously make ZYTIGA generics in the market later this year. And I\u2019m wondering how you think might impact ZYTIGA business? Thanks so much. Ian Read : Vamil, thank you for the question. You know, vis-a-vis Amazon I think we\u2019ve discuss this before. We welcome any entrance to the distribution system like an improve efficiencies and ensure that patient state their medication at the appropriate cost and in the appropriate time. So all in all I would say that, the distribution system not necessarily the way that the rebates and price that handle, but the distributed system is already highly efficient. Now with regard to the announcement today, I really surprise with your comments, don\u2019t really know how to react to it. There\u2019s very little detail in the announcement. Nevertheless, I would see it as totally positive for our industry. Any attempt to lower healthcare costs, I going to have to involve -- my belief using medicines to ensure adherence, make sure the management, that the appropriate management of diseases. We represent two points or we represent 10% to 14% healthcare costs. So I would hope that private actors have come into this space with low cap. We\u2019ve initially seen more opportunity through a whole distribution chain of cost. And so \u2013 and we look at that as a positive way in controlling costs. So I think it\u2019s encouraging that private actors enter in this and it\u2019s encouraging for the use of modern pharmaceuticals. And Xtandi, would you deal with please, Albert. Albert Bourla : Of course, and first let me start by saying how please we are to see total demand outstanding, growing 26% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, particularly the number of urologists actively prescribing Xtandi continues to grow and reached an all time higher 1700 in this quarter, which is more than three times the number of urologists that are prescribing ZYTIGA for example. Urologists, right now, represent 41% growth in 2017 compared to 2016. And of course not to mention what we had \u2013 not to miss mentioning that we had another quarter with sequential sales growth. The sales of this quarter were 12% higher than the sales of the previous quarter. As regards to patient assistance program, as a person of total demand, it was generally stable compared to the third quarter of this year, which is what we were expecting, knowing that the people out there are enrolling ourselves in this program. They are enrolled for the full calendar year. We believe that the demand for patient assistant programs as a percentage of total demand will decrease in 2018 as compared what we saw in 2017. As regards ZYTIGA generics, they are difference between Xtandi and ZYTIGA safety, they are differences in terms of closing frequency, they are differences in terms of requirements for steroid core administration, and they are also very different monitoring acquirements. And as you know in the future we hope to have different indications also based on potential approval of the PROSPER study in non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and more studies that are coming in the earlier setting. So, of course, we will continue monitoring the market but we are not right now concern about ZYTIGA generics. Charles Triano : Thanks, Albert, can we move to our next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. David Risinger : Thanks very much and congrats Ian and Frank on all of your efforts to educate Washington having finally paid off. With respect to my questions I wanted to ask for a little bit more color and perspective on Ibrance in Europe. I think it would just be helpful if you explain which countries agreed. How it all came together, so quickly to result in a price reset in a given quarter since obviously many countries negotiate pricing independently. So that\u2019s my first question. Second, with respect to Inflectra has J&J's contract language changed such that Inflectra will have greater commercial access and commercial uptake in 2018? And then my third question is for Frank. How should we think about the tax rate beyond 2018? Should we expect it to a decline below 17%? Thanks very much. Ian Read : So David, thank you for the congratulations. I do believe that Pfizer was to play a major role in putting a spotlight on the disadvantageous corporate tax situation for U.S. multinationals, so appreciate the comments. Now on an Ibrance, I would like to number one, we\u2019re not getting into discussion of which countries. This is all proprietary information that\u2019s important for us that we don't discuss in the public. Two, it was not quick. It was a result of ongoing negotiations over substantial part of 2017. And I think this is what you need to be focused on, if you don\u2019t mind we\u2019re saying so is, what is this set up for the future Ibrance. And we have managed to establish wide reimbursement and pricing. What we believe the European market is comparable analogs. We don't see there\u2019s any spill over to other markets in Asheville or in the European context. So we see this agreement as setting a strong baseline for patient access in Europe and continued growth of the franchise. So I think this is extremely positive for Ibrance. It comes in an unusual way as the negotiations reflected the full impact in one quarter rather than spread over the whole year or spread over a period of years. So, to my point of view it's very, very positive going forward for Ibrance and for patients in Europe. Would like to do with Inflectra, please John. John Young : So thanks for the question, David. So I\u2019m obviously not aware of any changes that J&J have made to their contracting status. And I think we\u2019ve commented on that previously and Ian mentioned this in his call. And let me just say that we obviously continue to work towards minimizing the impact in 2018 of their exclusionary contracting practices by growing include systems and continue to seek increased coverage amongst commercial players. As Ian mentioned in his prepared remarks in quarter four approximately half of Inflectra\u2019s volume comes from closed system such as the VA where the insurer and provider are the same entity. And in those close systems where which prioritize healthcare savings over short-term rebating. As of quarter four we\u2019ve now reached to 50% share of infliximab. But we\u2019re obviously very conscious that those closed systems represents only a small proportion of the market round about 5%, but we really believe that our performance in those closed systems demonstrates that where payers, providers and patients have access to Inflectra that it can offer significant value to the healthcare system. And we\u2019ll continue progressing that aggressively. Ian Read : And then on the tax rate question, Dave, we set for this year approximately 17% and then in terms of going forward I would continue to use approximately 17%. We believe that rate is sustainable. If anything were to change obviously I will let you and everyone else know. Charles Triano : Thank you. Next question please operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Geoff Meacham : Good morning guys, and thanks for the question. Ian or Frank, just on the topic of repatriation, in the past you guys have talked about tapping into un-invested foreign earnings not just U.S. cash, so should we view the $24 billion you mentioned Frank is the ceiling for repatriation or you still evaluating? And then more on the pipeline; when you think about Pfizer's IO strategy in moving beyond avelumab and 4-1BB, what\u2019s the capacity or should say the priority to expand the number of IO combinations, I know you guys are looking at OX40, but obviously room for many more combos and maybe what\u2019s the rate limiting step for that tap? Thanks. Frank D'Amelio: Yes. On the 24 billion is the ceiling on the repatriation, of course, it does mean that all future cash flows can come back to the U.S. without restriction, which I think is the really important point rather than the 24 billion we\u2019re bringing back. It\u2019s unfreezing [ph] permanently of our access to our global capital cash flows. Ian Read : And it\u2019s up 24 billion. Frank D'Amelio: And it\u2019s up 24 billion. IO strategy, Mikael please. Mikael Dolsten : Yes. Thank you. We look at IO field development into three buckets as part of your question. Initial monotherapy with PD-1, PD-L1 including our Bavencio combinations of those agents with chemo-targeted agents or IO agents and three longer-term aiming [Indiscernible]. In the first bucket we are present mainly as a minor player with Bavencio approvals in Merkel cell, bladder cancer and plan readout lung cancer. We didn't really plan to be a leader in the space. However we\u2019re really aim to grow impactful leadership with Bavencio in segments of combinations, which are near and mid-term promising opportunity. We have now five pivotal studies over the next 18 to 24 months with various Bavencio combinations that we think will be really interesting to watch. Ovarian second-line and third-line with chemo, renal first-line in lighten Bavencio, gastric first-line on maintenance of Bavencio after chemo bladder first-line, maintenance of Bavencio of the chemo ovarian, Bavencio combined with various chemo combinations. In addition to those pivotal readout in the more near-term, we mid-term see more than 20 Bavencio combinations whether radio immunotherapy pivotal studies in head and neck or with our vast number of targeted agents which is really unique aspect of Pfizer compared to many other place in this space that includes for lung, [Indiscernible] XALKORI, for breast with Ibrance for breast trend, for leukemias and myeloid corrected with glasdegib, and of course we are conducting additional IO studies with 4-1BB combined with OX40 where we have encouragement that this may from an immune point of view will be a real interesting combination. And finally, I want to say that we are really one of the few that have both an IO agent Bavencio and a PARP inhibitor talazoparib and we do think that will be a very powerful combination and we\u2019re running broad basket studies over many solid tumors and expect opportunities to take from those dataset into pivotal studies in the near term. The longer term bucket was aim to turn cold tumors hot and we have invested in numerous platforms that which combined with PD-1 or avelumab such as cancer vaccines, oncolytic viruses, antibody drug conjugate where we have Phase 1, 2 studies with PTK7 were non-particles loaded with various immune targeted agents and finally bifunctional antibodies. Ian Read : Thanks Mikael. That\u2019s a comprehensive review. And of course you know immuno-oncology is one stool of our oncology platform because we\u2019re both in breast, we\u2019re in targeted agents, we\u2019re in prostate cancer, and so I think we have a very robust overall strategy. I would like to point out that while we are behind in lung now our expectations are we have two important readouts; one this year and one later on which is in \u2013 we have very creative design and let\u2019s see what results are in lung and how positive it can be. We haven't anyway given up and our attempt to participate in that large market. Thank you very much. Charles Triano : Well, thank you, Ian and Mikael. Next question please operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Holford from Jefferies. Jeff Holford : Thanks very much. My first question is just on the second generation Ibrance product that you have. And there\u2019s specific resistance mechanisms that you\u2019re identifying within Ibrance\u2019s patients. And I wonder if you can talk a little bit about those and how this convinced them? And then the second big picture question, obviously you guys have look to the potential separation of the essential health business in the past. You did talk about a number of factors that influence that decision not to do before. I am just wondering if now we have a tax reform in place whether that potentially influences that decision going forward and when you might next look at that again. Thank you very much. Ian Read : Thank you, Jeff. I\u2019ll ask Albert to \u2013 sorry, Mikael to discuss the second generation as you\u2019ve named it for Ibrance\u2019s agents. Mikael Dolsten : Yes. Thank you. We have two current approaches to deal with resistance to CDK and breast cancer. We are starting this quarter as our plans with a second generation CDK drug and that\u2019s based on unique proprietary science that we have performed to identify resistance mechanisms that can occur related to the cell cycle. And we look forward very much to start it up in breast and it also application outside of breast as a resistance mechanism. And second resistance we have noted is related to targeted phosphate PS3K and we have a phase 1B study with a unique inhibit to get a policy and I\u2019ve seen so far encouraging data and are expanding those studies. Ian Read : Thank you. Why don\u2019t we go to Frank for the discussion of the separation? Frank D'Amelio: Yes. Jeff, one optionality, if you\u2019ll recall we had laid out four questions. So, was the business performing well inside the company? We\u2019re continued to perform well on a standalone basis. Was there trap value? Can we unlock that trap value in a tax efficient way. So let's focus on questions three and four. With tax reform, now the question four is yes, to the extent that there is trapped value we believe we would be able to analyze that trapped value in tax efficient way. But let's really zoom in on question three which is their trap value? When we announced we look at optionality, specialty form of valuations have price-earnings multiples that were 20-ish. If you look today that we\u2019ve cut roughly in half, so we really don't see any trap value. So our current view is for the foreseeable future where the key for our essential business is execution. That\u2019s to really get that business right to do. Now deal with our sterile injectables, continue to grow biosimilars, continue to grow an emerging markets and continue to manage our peri-LOE products as effectively as possible. So that's our view for the foreseeable future. Ian Read : Great. Thank you, Frank. Next question please operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason Gerberry from Bank of America. Jason Gerberry : Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. First I just want you to get your guys perspective on 2018 M&A evaluations that are getting paid. And I think investors and even company management teams have been vocal that these evaluations have been pretty lofty. So just kind of curious to get your perspective on evaluation, certainly seems like a seller\u2019s market. And then secondly on Xtandi, can you comment a little bit year-to-date 2018 the dynamic between the PIP and the co-pay foundation, I realize you have no line of sight into the co-pay foundation, but potentially you have a line of sight in to the PIP. So just kind of wondering if the patients are being funnelled in a way that will improve revenue recognition or revenue generation with Xtandi patient in 2018? Thanks. Ian Read : Well, vis-\u00e0-vis the evaluations, I mean, every deal is a deal by deal. So it's very difficult for us to assess the value transactions on deals because it's not clear what the opportunities that with the specific assets and researching capabilities companies have when they pay for these assets. They would appear to be in terms P [ph] and multiples, lofty prices, but once again everybody does their own deals and every deal is specific. So we will continue to look for value in the BD space and when we find it we have the capability and the capability to operate on it. With that I\u2019ll ask Albert to discuss the issues around and the dynamic. Albert Bourla : Jason, look, I have no visibility in what is going on with in terms of co-pay foundations. I know because they have made publicly available, but we are contributing, but I'm aware of the amount that we\u2019re giving by quarter by month, because we have established very strong -- let me call it, Chinese wall between our commercial operations and the groups that they are contributing to this foundations. What I know, it is only -- how many are enrolling in the commercial free goods, which is the patient assistance program. And this is what I said before, but in the fourth quarter it was the same more or less amount percentage wise as we had in the third quarter. And from the first indications that they can see how many are enrolling in 2018, I expect this number to the lower in [Indiscernible] even 2017 [ph]. Charles Triano : Thanks, Albert. Our next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from John Boris from SunTrust. John Boris : Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the solid results. So Ian just going back to the question on M&A going forward, I think you previously mentioned that you essentially want to take a pause on large-scale type of M&A until tax reform within the rear view mirror and how things shook out on repatriation. I think you\u2019ve also provided some commentary that there were some significant binary events that would have to occur going forward to also for consideration on larger scale M&A. Just wondering how the tax outlook shapes that view going forward? Second question for on tax, tax rate goes down by 500 basis points. Can you just walk us through the pushes and pulls of what's going on with the international subsidiaries that cause that 500 basis point contraction? And then why the tax rate wouldn\u2019t continue to go down as you do and certainly how does that influence your tax planning going forward? And then that last question just on tafamidis. Cardiomyopathy and the trial of potential readout, what do you potentially expect out of that? Is there are potentially mortality outcome out of that? And you can you contrast the drug with myeloma [ph] and Ioannis drugs that are being studied in that area? Thanks. Ian Read : Okay. So on M&A, I think we\u2019ve been recently consistent over the years when we discussed M&A to say that we had the capacity before tax reform to do M&A, in fact we attempt to do two large ones, which was thwarted by government interventions. So the tax reform was really more important in -- from the point of view M&A or the point of view of how you would finance the deal or what the relative values of companies would be. And I expect to see some changes in that as some premiums for previously established tax advantages for certain companies disappear, but it doesn't really change the underlying focus of how we look at M&A and how we look at that the disposition of our capital that Frank talked about earlier. So we\u2019ll continue to look at M&A for the point of view of value for our shareholders. And we\u2019ll be directed by the science and the opportunities. And we\u2019re also look at opportunities across the other spectrums, which is the dividends and the buybacks and investment in the business. So I think which is really a continuation of a very thoughtful I believe from the part of you at Pfizer of deployment of capital. Frank, do you want to answer the tax rate please. Frank D'Amelio: Yes. John, let me run the numbers just to grant everybody. So we had guided this year to approximately 23%. Now obviously we\u2019re giving guidance for next year is 17%, so approximately 600 basis point decrease in the tax rate year-over-year. Now in terms of the going forward rate, I had answer really that for modeling purposes we should assume that that 17% -- approximately 17% was sustainable. And you asked me about kind of the international impact with our subsidiaries. I mean, at a macro level the way to think about this is we do business in over 150 countries. Every country obviously has their own tax structure, their own tax rates. Some of our business is outside the U.S., the major part of business is inside the U.S. The new corporate tax rate going forward is 21%. On overseas earnings we have now territorial system, but with the minimum tax of 10.5 %. When you do all the work and all the tax planning and we work through everything, the blended rate gets us to that approximately 70% diluted too. So going forward you all should expect us to sustain give or take a 70% tax rate. Charles Triano : Mikael, do you want to take on the tafamidis please. Mikael Dolsten : Sure. We have tafamidis study for cardiomyopathy. As you know the drug is registered in Europe to deal what\u2019s call TTR amyloid polyneuropathy. This study in cardiac condition is 400 subjects and the first and largest study in this important segment including both patient limitation and the large population with excess of amulet but no mutation, we expect readout first half of this year and pending the data we will then consider further potential regulatory action. It's of course the first of its kind in this rare disease. So, there is high-risk but also very high upside given that this is a much larger population than neuropathy and a very few treatment. This is Polaroid drug and deferred from injectables such as oligonucleotides that you referred to. We look really forward to do readout and to review it. Charles Triano : Thanks, Mikael. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Greg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank. Greg Gilbert : Thank you. First on the innovative side, for you new JAK, can you talk in some more detail about how you\u2019ll develop it and differentiate versus Xeljanz over the longer term, and versus other JAKs in the space? And then shifting over to the essential side, Just questioning whether you are manufacturing and supply chain network that\u2019s where it needs to be there. It sounds like you describe that is more of fixing legacy problem versus sort of investing new capital. Can you shed some more light on the strategy there? Is it sort of a set of expensive bandage or it\u2019s there a fundamentally new approach to have success on the essential side? And lastly what your plan to do with your own biosimilar version of remicade which would presumably be more profitable then the Celltrion version? Thanks. Ian Read : Hi. You know, Greg, thanks for the questions. Just good to see lot of questions on our pipeline as it becomes into focus. Mikael, would you like to talk about the JAK1 and JAKs? Mikael Dolsten : Yes. Thank you. So we have six next generation immunokinases including five oral and they have been uniquely design to go into areas where we think the first generation of JAKs such as the Xeljanz is less optimal. And while we\u2019re very excite about Xeljanz\u2019s strong performance in array and if possible further expansion into ulcerative colitis. We have JAK1 as you noted went to into Phase 3 for atopic dermatitis and have a unique profile for that. We have a two JAK1 that is targeted to the mechanism between psoriasis and Crohn's, which is colitis, where JAK3 selective into RA and in term we look at interesting conditions such as alopecia where two of these JAKs again, uniquely targeted. So the whole story is to going to other areas were Xeljanz may not be fully optimized while we think we can grow Xeljanz rheumatology and select segment of G.I. but now we target broader diseases within arm G.I. but then beyond Xeljanz. So we hope to expand the opportunity for JAK and obviously, also plan for live cycle management on Xeljanz. Ian Read : Thank you, Mikael. So, in reality we belief from the Science of the Jack who been investing in for over 10 years, we can bring significant relief to specific patients segments with this specificity of the JAKs that we\u2019ve developed and this would be the sort of backbone of our strategy and our competitive advantage. So that\u2019s very good. Now I\u2019ll go to, we can ask the biosimilars and also\u2026 Mikael Dolsten : And manufacturing. Ian Read : Please, Mikael, please go ahead. John Young : So thanks for the questions, Greg. So look, as Ian mentioned in his comments, the essential healthy portfolio we\u2019ve obviously been an experiencing some supply shortage with some products. The shortage is of primarily for products from the legacy Hospira portfolio. And as Ian said there are largely driven by capacity constraints and technical issues. Let me just make a comment and say there obviously as we said before during the Hospira acquisition we were aware that there are manufacturing issues that were confirm during the due-diligent process, but we have a robust action plan in place and we believe that we\u2019ll make progress during 2018 towards reducing sterile injectable shortages and that will include investing capital in those specific plans. Turing now to our own infliximab by biosimilar. As you know in Inflectra\u2019s existing marketed infliximab biosimilar is currently available in the U.S. and it will continue to be available to patients and physicians. Although we\u2019re very pleased with the U.S. FDA approval of IXIFI as the first Pfizer developed biosimilar in the U.S. Pfizer doesn\u2019t currently plan on launching IXIFI in the U.S. and we\u2019re evaluating our strategic options for this product. Ian Read : Thank you, John. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin : Thank you. Ian, I think in the past you have as an industry leader have spoken about the inevitability about industry consolidation. Today\u2019s news about the Amazon partnership, consistent pricing pressure, the Hillary tweet, I think that\u2019s when you started talking about it, but we really haven\u2019t seen it in the last wave of large scale deals was back in 2009. And today on the call you\u2019re saying that there is less reason to do a tax deal obviously because of tax reform. And the spin is probably off the table now, because you don\u2019t see trapped value. I\u2019m just wondering if you still see value and industry consolidation from synergies and scale. That is something you really haven\u2019t touched upon. And if you do, do you see Pfizer as a consolidator as you been in the past. Or do you think you will continue down the path of smaller scale BD activity? Thanks very much. John Young : Thanks Jami. I do believe that given the pressures being applied by the consolidation in the payer network and the pressure there exists on governments to find ways of curtailing overall health care costs, while I'm optimistic that actually drugs will play a bigger part in that as being very cost effective, I do believe there'll be a need to further consolidation to deal with the size of our customers and the size of the opportunities. I think these things come in waves. I think everybody is looking at potential combinations and consolidations. I can't tell you when it will start, but I believe there will be moments when there is a key detonator to initiation of further consolidation. But we are -- I would say, we have a core competency in consolidation of large companies into Pfizer. We will -- if there is an opportunity for shareholder additional value consolidation, I expect that Pfizer would be at the forefront of it. At the same time, we'd also be looking at deals of a different size. We never say never to big deals, but we also say we can -- we think we have the capacity to do both the small deals and the big deal when the moment arises. And we know we also -- by the way, I'm just getting some flags here from Frank. I think that we don't feel any pressure to immediately do any type of deal in the sense that we've just had a very good year in 2017. We're going to have a good year in 2018. We have very good franchises with -- focused on developing our own pipeline. That being said, we are opportunistic in looking for intellectual property that we can buy and do better than the present owners. We continue to look at that. And so I'm very optimistic about our hand and all the arrows that we have to fire in our arsenal. Thank you, Jami. Charles Triano : Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi. Andrew Baum : Thank you. A couple of questions please. First to Ian and Albert, despite the rhetoric which [Indiscernible] could have done to the industry given the last question on 340B hospitals, the proposal for PMBs to part from new base and you made the right action on drug pricing. The -- together with the new Head of HSS, reiterated his comments. And I'm just interested how you quantify the risk or whether you think it's more na\u00efve? Does it impact how you look at M&A valuation? In such that you believe there is risk, are you more concerned of drugs under pharmacy versus medical benefit? So, that's my first question. The second question is whether you could comment on the market pricing dynamic for new molecule oncology given the density in this area to parts of CDK 4/6, that when you're seeing net pricing is going to come under much more pressure than maybe we should be thinking about? And then finally, for Mikael, could you talk to Pfizer's biomarker adoption beyond PD-L1, particularly human mutational burden and how you're implementing that within your oncology take [ph] and would you might like to comment on your foundation recent relationship? Thank you. Ian Read : So Andrew, thank you for those three questions, all very powerful and all very extensive. I think on the question of the pricing risk, this industry has, for decades, had a pricing risk present in its commercial business. And in fact, we've highlighted that in our -- on our 10-Qs and things like that. So, I don't see that the pricing risk has dramatically changed from where it was 10 years ago or five years ago. I believe that we need to be in a constant dialogue with society and with payers and the government over the value of pharmaceuticals. I think that dialogue is ongoing with both the administration and Congress. And I think the dialogue is being informed by facts. And we are looking for ways, as you've mentioned, to lower the cost, the out-of-pocket cost of patients. The fundamental problem is not, I believe, the pricing of products. The fundamental -- because to be able to fund and run a modern innovative pharmaceutical company, there's a certain level of resources necessary. And unless we see a breakthrough in innovation and a breakthrough in the process, this is the cost of bringing products to market. The question is does society want to continue to support that innovation? I think the answer is absolutely yes. The next question is how will society ensure access to those products? So, this is really about how you ensure people, do rebates, get to the point-of-sale, where we think they ought to be. How do you make drugs affordable? Right now the system is set up adversely to transfer the costs of lowering premiums to healthy people on the sick people. I don't think that's a good policy and we're in discussions with the government to change that. So, I think this pricing risk is reversed. I think it remains reversed, and it's a constant issue that the industry needs to deal with given the nature of the marketplace. On your question about the density of small molecules, to a certain extent I would apply that to the density of PD-L1s. I don't think it's specific to small molecules, I think the pricing always rests on the value of the products bring to the society. And we will continue to develop innovative products that have differences compared to this and we will expect to earn a reasonable return on those products. So, there was one other question on the PD-L1. Mikael, do you want to talk to that? Mikael Dolsten : Yes, I'll be brief. We started with PD-L1 as what was the initial most frequent used. And for some tumors, like lung useful biomarker, we are now assessing tumor mutation burden, clearly you have good insight into this field. And our innovation that we will see in the future studies to start, maybe even a combination of PD-L1 and TMB. Exploratory markers include immune cell subset, T-cell repertoire sequencing, and then combination drug-specific choices. Charles Triano : Thanks Mikael. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Tony Butler from Guggenheim Partners. Tony Butler : Yes, thanks very much. Two questions, please. One, Mikael, in first-line renal cell carcinoma, you've got very interesting trial with Inlyta. Obviously, there will be an IO/IO combination, I suspect, in the market by the time your trial reads out, but I'm most interested in whether or not you think that Inlyta or tyrosine kinase inhibitor actually improves the synergy with Bavencio? And then second, still within oncology, if I might ask, clearly you're in a little bit euphoria around the CAR-T space and I recognize you all have an interest in and off-the-shelf first once selected and I'm just curious if you might comment, yet again, on whether you're ramping up some efforts there. And then, finally, Frank, once again, on taxes, if I may. LOEs are diminishing. You've clearly stated that your U.S. business is doing extremely well, disproportionately I might add. So, the U.S. percentage of your total business increases. And again, I have to ask, given those, unless there's something which we totally miss, why doesn't again tax change, certainly out in the future beyond 2017. Sorry for that, but thanks. Ian Read : Okay, I'll ask Mikael to address your first question. Mikael Dolsten : Yes, we do think that combining Inlyta with Bavencio is really a unique combination for renal cell carcinoma, and that data as reported were really impressive and, at least to me, I believe it stands out among the absolutely best seen this far. Inlyta targets the micro environment as the BDF inhibitor, so I think it has unique position, and we view it currently as really promising, and the preference for us then adding more immuno-oncology agent as we see a very high responsive. And we look really forward to the readout that will come within the next 12 months or so from this study. Ian Read : Thank you. On the question of CAR-T, we have seen the explosion of interest. We do have an off-the-shelf version as you say it, which we're developing with Cellectis. We are currently looking at our strategy of how to ensure that those -- that product can get to patients in the most rapid and effective way and we'll be looking at our strategy around CAR-Ts. And then the last question -- okay. Frank D'Amelio: Yes, on the tax rate. Yes, so Tony, in terms of the overall business, if you look at last year, 2016, roughly 50% of our revenues were in the U.S. 50% of our revenues were outside of the U.S. If you look at 2017 about 49% of our revenues were in the U.S. about 51% were outside the U.S. So not a lot of change, but not \u2013 be a little bit more pointed towards the international part of the business. When we put all that together, when we look at where the mix of our business is, when we look at the countries we do business in, where we manufacture our products, where we ship from, I\u2019m currently comfortable with the 17% and my statement about sustaining that 17% beyond 2018. Charles Triano : Thank you Frank for covering that. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks very much. Just two questions here. Maybe coming back to business development, I know the return seemed to be there, you\u2019ve highlighted you are agnostic to size, but given where the business in the pipeline stands today, I guess ideally what are you trying to achieve? Is it focused on enhancing near term growth? Is it more of a long term growth? Do you want to stay using verticals? Do you want to add verticals? Try and understand a little bit more what the strategic priorities are as you consider deals before you think about the financial terms associated with them? And my second question was on the Prevnar outlook for 2018, are we still expecting the U.S. adult business to be under pressure and can growth elsewhere in the franchise start to offset that erosion as we think about the 2018 outlook? Thanks very much. Ian Read : Thank you Chris. On BD, I mean we look at across the spectrum with BD from near term to long term. Clearly if assets were available at appropriate valuations, we would have a preference for short-term acceleration in our revenue growth and our EPS growth. On the other hand if there is availability of different deal which also produces value or it may take longer i.e. through consolidation and things like that we would also be interested in that and continue to look across that spectrum. I think we are well positioned. We can be considerate any options we look at and we do have a certain sense of urgency to find deals that would accelerate our revenue and EPS growth. You know with that, we\u2019ll go to Prevnar. Albert Bourla : Chris, you're right. We do expect that there will be a pressure in the adult sales in the U.S. which will be less as the product is coming more to a stable state. But this will be offset by higher paediatric sales globally. And we do not provide guidance or specific products because this is already incorporated in the guidance that Frank gave. But I can tell you in general terms that Prevnar will be roughly flat in 2018 compared to 2017. Charles Triano : Thanks Albert. Next question, please operator Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Bernstein Tim Anderson : Thank you. A couple of questions. Can you talk about how you see your international sales of Enbrel; evolving from here as we move into 2018 relative to what we saw in 2017, further the levels of price erosion, volume loss and that sort of thing. In 2017 sales were down about 15% versus the prior year, is that the sort of contraction that you expect we\u2019ll see in 2018 as well as future years beyond that so maybe 15% per year. I\u2019m trying to understand what your long term modeling shows in setting the path somewhere? And then second question there is continued or I should say renewed interest recently on the topic of whether PD-1s and PD-L1 ones are the same, the argument being that PD-1s might offer better efficacy because of mechanistic differences. Wondering what Pfizer\u2019s current view of this debate is? Ian Read : Okay, Tim on Enbrel thanks for the question as you know we don\u2019t give product specific forecast but I think the range as you described in your opening commentary is aligned within internal channel thinking about the way that franchise will be managed over the future. PD-1, PD-L1 might not... Frank D'Amelio: Yes, I would start to say that we have a unique situation that we actually have one PD-L1 Bavencio and one PD-1 and the PD-1 is right now in studies with our cancer vaccines, very well behaving. It has potential for subcute monthly administration. On the other hand we are very pleased with our PD-L1 that is more advanced and we monitor carefully what you said, where did our any new date that would indicate under certain specialized setting that one would be better than the other. But in the big picture, I think they look pretty similar overall within these two classes. Ian Read : Thanks, Mikael. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS. Marc Goodman : Yes, morning. I got a couple of questions. First, Albert in the past we've talked about there's a new competition will come in with CDK is whether you had to take any price and I was curious whether you've had to take any price, now that there are three in order to maintain the dominant share you have. Second question is consumer, if you could just refer to the U.S. business and handle a little week in the quarter. And then third question to Newsome. Have you talked about six phase III studies? Can you tell us how many you're expecting to actually report out this year? Thanks. Ian Read : Okay. Albert, if you want to take the Ibrance and the consumer? Albert Bourla : Yes. Marc, so far despite the press over, they need incumbant product phase is when multiple compared to center of the market. We have not seen any material importance on my branch performance. We believe that positive results from the other CDK inhibitor, that must try the significance of CDK inhibition and will benefit a class overall. It's important to remember that almost 60% of newly diagnosed patients were assuming a CDK but only 50% of the total with relation. So, that they must raise the potential to grow the class. Within this class, we remain very confident, in high branch leadership based on the strength of free data, efficasy safety profile and that can go on and one. Importantly, you know that there is no clinic available in [indiscernible] that was observed across the along the trials. There is no requirement for ACC or GAT IOP and CCT monitoring in the current prescribing information. There is no requirement for monitoring the signs and symptoms of thrombotic events or precautions of. We feel that three years in the market with this as we said very large market's there. 11,000 prescribers, more than 100,000 patients, we feel we are very strong with that. Marc Goodman : And I believe on the value we're receiving it remains consistent with our previous years' experience and I'm not seeing any undue pressure due to the competition on our pricing, given the profile Albert just described for the except for Ibrance consumers performance. Albert Bourla : Consumer area, Frank has spoke about that. We had a 2% growth and this was affected mainly by the U.S. the U.S. was declining 2% and in the fourth quarter we're decling 2%. And then the U.S. that will drove this decline was my mistake. And the reasons or such the negative of impact of hurricane Maria, in Portorico but also the U.S. were impacted by maximum how to see LOE about to happen in this quarter. As Frank emphasized, this business is performing at 5% every year, that was in the last three years and we are hoping to see it coming back to this level of performace this year. Ian Read : Okay, Mikael. Mikael Dolsten : Yes. So, we'll have the first shot the 16 week efficasy trial reading out these all followed by the slightly longer 24, 56, week and safety trials in a way and turn it lower back pain for the U.S. and newer markets reading out the first few months of 2019. And that will really constitute the data package for potential filing consideration pending data for the major markets. And then we have other smaller studies for Japan and cancer pain later on. Ian Read : Right, thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen. Steve Scala : Thank you. I have a few questions on Ibrance's EU price. Could you give us examples of the pricing analogs to which you're referring? Secondly, Pfizer had been saying that essential health would return to growth in a couple of years, now that via the U.S. is an essential health and presumably Lyrica U.S. will be moving over in the future. How does this affect this essential health's return to growth timing? And then lastly, Inflectra U.S. increased 10 million quarter-over-quarter or a bit less than 1% of market share increase. Is that a trajectory we should be expecting going forward or should we anticipate some sort of inflection? Thank you. Frank D'Amelio: Thank you, Steve. I dont really for proprietory reasons on pricing, I dont want to get into analogs. I would say that we are satisfied in the European context of the reimbursement price we got. It was very hard negotiations but in the end in old patient access was important as well as the reimbursement price. We think we arrived at a fair compromise on that. And we think we have a basis for vibrant growth at an appropriate price for Ibrance in Europe. And I think that's the most important thing to look at there. The, could John, would you take the other questions? John Young : Yes. So, thanks for the questions, Steve. So, we have consistently said over the last two to three years that we expect the essential health business to return to growth in the medium term. And actually, that remains our view, that actually as the head wins from major LOEs and the portfolio that are currently sits with MP EH begin to lessen. And we're seeing for example in 2017, the impact of LOEs were something like 1.4 billion in this business. Expected that would kind of shrink to around about 900 million in 2018, given the portfolio. Combined with the continued growth of emerging markets, combined with the continued growth of biosimilar. So, when you put all those things together, we continue to expect that actually in the near term that actually essential health is poised to deliver modest single-digit growth. We still feel that that is a sustainable pattern of growth for this business. In relation to Inflectra in the U.S. let me just sort of say first of all Inflectra globally had revenues of a $135 million the quarter. That was a 110% increase or $70 million or $68 million growth. Actually a $41 million increase in the U.S. so, once we commented in answers to some other questions about some of the challenges in terms of access due to J&J's exclusion contracting, we expect to continue to make progress in the U.S. with Inflectra in the course of 2018. Ian Read : Right. Thank you, John. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Unidentified Analyst : Hi guys, this is John Miller [ph] on for Umer. A couple of questions, at JP Morgan, you showed an interesting slide titled step change and further R&D productivity and everyone think on that was LOE on combination. So, how do you think your internal IOIO portfolio measures up against external and hove your thoughts changed based on the early results from JAVELIN Medley. Secondly, Frank, the 17% rate tax going forward, is the if your efficacy's a non-GAAP tax rate is going to be consistent with the cash tax rate. And last, I noticed you guys have an oral GLP-1 in Phase 1. Are you looking at that more in diabetes or in that? Ian Read : Okay. We'll as Mikael to answer the question research and then Frank will answer the tax question. Mikael Dolsten : Yes. Thank you for noting our up to 15 and five subject to attrition. That's typical in development blockbuster projections for the next five years. As you noted, it contained actually a five oppertunities in oncology. And the first one included Bavencio mono and combos for IOIO. And we clearly continue to be positive about Bavencio's quality tier 1 and then eluded to certain trials coming up soon. And we follow we had a significant interest the triplet combo we do 4-1BB. We also as I spoke earlier to have numerous pivotal study readouts with combinations of chemo and targeted agent and actually more than 20 of such combinations overall in the portfolio. So, I think there is ample opportunity for us to make very valuable contribution and in this field through IOIO targeted and chemo combinations. And that's a very important part of our strategy. Frank D'Amelio: Yes. And then on the GAAP tax rate versus the 17%. 17% obviously is an adjusted results tax rate. The GAAP rate versus the adjusted, we'll see first relations quarter-to-quarter based on the counting that we're doing for various items. That we quarter to have significant items, some positive, some negative. Example this port there are 2+ significant items to the reversal 10.7 billion in primarily U.S. deffered tax liabilities which cause incredibly negative tax rate. So, it will be volatile, every fluctuations for quarter-to-quarter, differences between GAAP and the adjusted results as there has been in the past. Ian Read : And Mikael, just on the GLP-1. Mikael Dolsten : Yes, thank you for noting that. We are really excited about this oral GLP-1. Small molecule we think maybe the first real small molecule nature to the newer studies. And we look upon initial opportunity, NASH and joint reflect such as obesity. But certainly we look at this profile also for treating diabetes where these drug class has been so successful as injectable and of course and oral drug with a unique profile seems very attractive across entire metabolic spectrum. Ian Read : Thank you, Mikael. And we'll take our last question now, please. Operator : Your final question comes from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink. Seamus Fernandez : Thanks very much for squeezing me in here. Just a couple of quick ones. Ian, can you just give us your big picture thoughts on Eliquis and its overall opportunity growth continues to be pretty spectacular given where this product is in its life cycle. Just wondering if you think given where we are in the developed world in terms of global markets overall, if this could possibly exceed LIPITOR sales at peak. The second question, as we think about your pricing analogs in the discussion around international pricing of Ibrance. Is it wrong to think that this may in fact anticipate success in the augment setting so that there wouldn\u2019t be another step down in pricing as that patient population grows substantially? And then the last question is on the PARP as we think about the opportunity for talazoparib. What is Pfizer doing in prostate cancer, given some early data there for a combination of talazoparib with Xtandi? Thanks so much for the question. Ian Read : Thank you. I'm going let Albert in his capacity to take over so the Eliquis questions and the pricing on Ibrance and then Mikael can also tell the questions. Thank you. Albert Bourla : So, let's start with Eliquis. Yes, we are very optimistic for Eliquis. We expect the growth will continue. The next leg of growth will be driven by increased knock penetration of the market and increase Eliquis surgain of the class of non-flus. And this, so again it's expected to be at two by increasing focus on the following strategic intiatives. We are going to accelerate markets are gaining with the market. In those markets who have achieved the leadershiop position in the risk reduction already of stroke systemic embolis. We're going to generate and utilize local readable data to see preferencial access for Eliquis. And we have very good demonstration of this value so far with the first studies that do that that for. That they're getting the attention of peers. And of course we're going to increase diagnosis of the NVIF patients in those markets who have achieved already a leadership poasition in the risk reduction of stroke. And you saw are very positive. Mikael Dolsten : Yes. Concerning tell us a period. We are very excited about that drug profile. Did our report of the EMBRACA trial in breast cancer while we had a nice superiority to chemo therapy and at the end of very favorable profile. So, we are looking forward to additional readouts for talazoparib and investment in a drug and we've two prostate cancer studies. One, that was recently initiated in combination when salute are made or Xtandi in a selected subset of prostate cancer and we also have a more advanced posted cancer in open sing-along trial that could be of potential feel about the character. And then where we invest this significantly in combination with Bavencio for what we think will be a number of different holotypes. So, I look forward to continue the dialogue as we advanced. What I think is the potential best-in-class popping EBITDA. Thanks, Mikael. We'll just now go back to Albert for another comment. Albert Bourla : Yes, because i forgot to mention to answer your question about Ibrance. First of all, I cannot say if it would be bigger. When Lipitor what I can say it is going to be. And then wish about what I want to say. Then early whisper what I want to say it is that this is an extremely appealing opportunity for us. And a big part of the opportunities as we alluded comes from advancement or five brands into the early settings of treatment. We have three studies that are related with [Indiscernible] two are Phase 3 studies. And is PENELOPE [ph] but it is in high risk breast cancer and that will become very good towards the end of 2020. And the other one it is the PALLAS, that it is with intermediate risk early breast cancer and that will come a little bit earlier in the third quarter of 2020. Of course also we had pallet. The \u2013 in totality the early breast cancer represents very big opportunity because they will show you the number of patients is more than double and also the economy, the financial opportunities are just because you have much longer duration of treatments. I don\u2019t think that its early to speak about pricing as you eluded because those are coming in the 21 timeframe for negotiations with payers. Ian Read : Thank you, Albert. So the pricing analog of your question of whether the overall survival data that matures in Ibrance will influence the pricing in Europe is a good question, the one that really is relatively remote. It\u2019s going to take three years to get that data and assuming the data is positive I would expect us to relocate the value of Ibrance and if it was negative which is a very \u2013 it\u2019s very difficult in this type of long, long, long disease progression to get any really accurate information I would expect that the use of Ibrance will be very well entrenched in the patterns of treatment by physicians by that time. Thank you. Charles Triano : Thanks. And thanks everybody for your attention today. Ian Read : Thanks everybody. Thanks for your time. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude Pfizer\u2019s fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to Pfizer's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Charles E. Triano: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer's first quarter 2018 performance. I'm joined today by our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Albert Bourla, our Chief Operating Officer; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; and Doug Lankler, General Counsel. The slides that will be presented on this call can be viewed on our website, pfizer.com/investors. Before we start, I would like to remind you that our discussion during this conference call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information regarding these factors is discussed under the disclosure notice section in the earnings release we issued this morning, as well as in Pfizer's 2017 Annual Report on form 10-K. Forward-looking statements during this conference call speak only as of the original date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements. Discussions during the call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's form 8-K, dated today, May 1, 2018. Any non-GAAP measures presented are not and should not be viewed as substitutes for financial measures required by U.S. GAAP, have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP, and may not be comparable to the calculations of similar measures at other companies. We will now make prepared remarks, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian? Ian C. Read: Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. During my remarks I will discuss the progress and opportunities we are seeing across the business, as well as the continued strengthening of our R&D pipeline, which we increasingly believe has the potential to drive significant future growth for Pfizer. In the first quarter, total company revenues declined 2% operationally. This was due primarily to the loss of exclusivity of Viagra in the U.S. in December 2017, biosimilar competition for Enbrel in Europe, and product supply shortages related to our legacy Hospira products in the U.S. and our production facilities in Puerto Rico. These declines were partially offset by continued strong growth in emerging markets biosimilars globally and many of our anchor brands. I'll begin with a few words about each of our businesses, starting with Pfizer Innovative Health. This business had another solid quarter, growing its top line 3% operationally, thanks to the continued strength of several of our biggest selling medicines. The year-over-year growth rate of the Innovative business was negatively impacted by approximately 1 percentage point due to the reclassification of U.S. Viagra sales to the Essential Health business, following its loss of exclusivity at the end of 2017. In addition, both Ibrance and Xeljanz revenues in the U.S. were impacted by customer buying patterns this quarter. But we expect to remain on track for our full-year outlook for both products. In the first quarter, global Ibrance revenues were up 35% operationally to $933 million, with non-U.S. revenues almost tripling. Ibrance continues to hold a leadership position in first-line hormone receptive positive HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer. Since its launch, approximately 12,000 physicians have been prescribed Ibrance in the U.S. and more than 120,000 patients have been prescribed the medicine worldwide. The overall CDK class continues to increase penetration within the eligible patient population. And we now see approximately 70% of eligible patients receiving CDK therapy. Within the CDK category, Ibrance again increased its share from 52% last quarter to 56% this quarter. Xtandi's U.S. alliance revenues were up 21% in the quarter to $159 million. In mid-March, the U.S. FDA granted priority review for the sNDA for Xtandi in non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with a PDUFA date in July 2018. In the EU, the EMA has validated the Type II variation submission for the same indication and began the new review process on March 5. Xeljanz revenues increased 29% operationally in the quarter to $326 million. We recently received two important regulatory milestones for Xeljanz. The FDA Advisory Committee recently gave us a favorable outcome for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. And this indication has a PDUFA date in June 2018. And just last week the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use for the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion for Xeljanz 5 milligrams twice daily in combination with methotrexate for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis. We believe the potential for Xeljanz in psoriatic arthritis, for which we've already received an FDA approval in December, and ulcerative colitis, if approved, could be significant. Global Eliquis revenues were up 30% operationally in the quarter to $765 million. Eliquis is the number one new-to-brand novel oral anti-coagulant prescribed by cardiologists in 21 markets. In the U.S., it has a 52.1% of the total prescription share for novel oral anti-coagulants, 10 percentage points ahead of our primary competitor, Xarelto. Finally, we continue to review strategic options for our Consumer Healthcare business, which has delivered another solid quarter. We remain disciplined regarding our capital allocation. And at this time, we have not received an acceptable offer for the sale of this business. We will continue to manage this very strong business as we explore other alternatives, which could include everything from a full or partial separation of the business to ultimately deciding to retain the business. We continue to expect to make a decision during 2018. I would like to take a moment to thank all of the Consumer Health colleagues who have worked so hard in the last quarter to produce a strong 4% growth rate. Turning now to Pfizer Essential Health. While revenues for the quarter declined, due in large part to expected product LOEs and ongoing product supply shortages in the sterile injectable business, we once again saw strong operational growth both in emerging markets and in our biosimilars portfolio. Emerging markets revenue within the Essential Health business grew 12% operationally for the quarter to nearly $2 billion. China led the way, growing 26% operationally. Revenues from our biosimilars business grew 53% operationally in the quarter to $173 million. We expect to broaden our biosimilars portfolio in the U.S. by potentially bringing five biosimilars to the market in the next two years. Our sterile injectable shortages are primarily for products from the legacy Hospira portfolio. We expect our sterile injectable sales will be roughly flat year on year, and this is incorporated into our financial guidance. We continue with our comprehensive remediation plan to upgrade and modernize these facilities. And we expect additional capacity to be available in 2019. We continue to strengthen and advance our pipeline, which today is as strong as it's ever been. Let me touch on some of the more promising recent developments. In Oncology, we have a broad range of targeted compounds that represent potential near-term opportunities. The Phase 3 EMBRACA trial showed that our PARP inhibitor, talazoparib, significantly extended progression-free survival versus standard-of-care chemotherapy in patients with BRCA positive metastatic breast cancer. We are discussing the results with worldwide health authorities and anticipate filing this quarter. Lorlatinib was recently granted priority review by the U.S. FDA as a potential treatment for patients with ALK-positive metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer with a PDUFA date in August of this year. Dacomitinib received the same designation in April for EGFR-positive non-small-cell lung cancer with a PDUFA date in September of this year with the potential to broaden our reach to areas of lung cancer where there is great unmet need. In I-O, we continue to progress our development program for Bavencio with our partner Merck KGaA. Both in monotherapy in combinations with chemo and targeted Pfizer agents, including Inlyta, in first-line advanced renal cell carcinoma and talazoparib in multiple tumor types. In Inflammation and Immunology, we have built what we believe is a true leadership position with our JAK franchise. We recently started Phase 3 trials of our once-daily JAK-1 in atopic dermatitis. We currently have 10 ongoing selective immunokinase programs. In Vaccines, the Phase 3 study for our potential C.diff vaccine, where we have the potential to be first in class, has been enrolling well. Leveraging the success of Prevnar, we are in Phase 2 with our next generation pneumococcal vaccine candidate with the potential to cover 20 serotypes. We expect to see the proof of concept data later in the year and expect to begin Phase 3 in 2019. We also are currently in Phase 2 with our staphylococcus aureus vaccine. And we are in discussions with the FDA regarding expanding the study to become a Phase 3 pivotal study. In Rare Diseases, we recently announced a positive Phase 3 study readout for tafamidis for the treatment of TTR cardiomyopathy. And we expect a Phase 3 study readout for rivipansel in sickle cell later in the year. In Gene Therapy, we recently dosed our first patient using our investigational mini dose dystrophin gene therapy candidate for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. And early data for this trial are expected in the first half of 2019. And in Internal Medicine, we expect a Phase 3 readout for tanezumab in osteoarthritis later in the year. If positive, this could be the first in a new class of non-opioid treatments for this disease. Through 2022 we see the potential for approximately 25 to 30 approvals, of which up to 15 have the potential to be blockbusters, subject to some expected attrition. This presents an unprecedented opportunity to have a life-changing impact on a growing number of patients, while creating enhanced value for all our stakeholders. In summary, we continue to deliver on our strategy and believe we remain well-positioned to deliver new medicines to patients and increase value for our investors going forward. Most of our anchor brands are primed for continuous growth. Our pipeline is as deep and focused as it's ever been. Our ownership culture remains a key differentiator for us. And our strong balance sheet and disciplined approach to capital allocation will ensure we have the resources to invest in future growth opportunities. Looking ahead, we expect that a dramatic reduction of LOE impacts following the upcoming Lyrica LOE in the U.S. will unencumber the potential revenue growth of our key drivers, including the expected realization of our pipeline, and allow us to achieve an inflection point in our topline growth profile. Coupled with continued strong expense management, we expect this will enable us to continue to drive EPS growth at a rate that exceeds revenue growth. Now I will turn it over to Frank to provide details on the quarter and our outlook for 2018. Frank A. D'Amelio: Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I am reviewing today are included in our webcast. Now moving on to the financials. First quarter 2018 revenues were approximately $12.9 billion, which include the favorable impact of foreign exchange of $430 million, partially offset by an operational decline of $302 million. Our Innovative Health businesses recorded 3% operational revenue growth in the first quarter of 2018, driven primarily by Ibrance, Eliquis, and Xeljanz, which was partially offset by the loss of exclusivity of Viagra in the U.S. in December of 2017 and Enbrel in most developed Europe markets due to continued biosimilar competition. It's important to note that Viagra revenues generated in the U.S. and Canada, which were previously recorded in the Innovative Health business, are now reported in our Essential Health business at the beginning of 2018. Revenues for our Essential Health business in the first quarter decreased 9% operationally, primarily due to a 15% operational decline in the sterile injectables portfolio, primarily due to continued legacy Hospira product shortages in the U.S.; a 15% operational decrease from Peri-LOE products, primarily due to the expected declines in Lyrica in developed Europe and Pristiq in the U.S., all of which were partially offset by the inclusion of Viagra revenues in the U.S.; 12% operational growth in emerging markets; and 53% operational growth in biosimilars, mainly driven by Inflectra in developed Europe as well as certain channels in the U.S. I want to point out that in emerging markets, Pfizer's overall Essential Health revenues grew 12% operationally. First quarter reported diluted EPS was $0.59, compared with $0.51 in the year-ago quarter, primarily due to a lower effective tax rate, due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCGA (sic) [TCJA] (16:23), in late 2017; and higher other income, due to increased income from collaborations, out licensing arrangements, and sale of product rights; and unrealized net gains on equity securities, reflecting the adoption of a new accounting standard the first quarter of 2018, which were partially offset by lower revenues, primarily in our Essential Health business. First quarter reported diluted EPS was also favorably impacted by fewer shares outstanding. Adjusted diluted EPS for the first quarter was $0.77, versus $0.69 in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to the previously mentioned factors. I want to point out that diluted weighted average shares outstanding declined by 35 million shares versus the year-ago quarter, due primarily to our share repurchase program, reflecting the impact of our $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in February of 2017 and completed in May of 2017, to a lesser extent by shares that were repurchased during first quarter 2018, partially offset by dilution related to share based employee compensation programs. As I previously mentioned, foreign exchange positively impacted first quarter 2018 revenues by approximately $430 million and negatively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses, and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $349 million. As a result, foreign exchange favorably impacted first quarter 2018 adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.01 versus the year-ago quarter. As you can see, we reaffirmed all components of our full-year 2018 financial guidance. Moving on to key takeaways. We delivered solid financial results in the first quarter of 2018, with a 12% increase in adjusted diluted EPS versus the prior-year quarter. We reaffirmed all components of our 2018 financial guidance. We accomplished several key product and pipeline milestones. And we returned $8.1 billion to shareholders in the first quarter of 2018 through dividends and share repurchases. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2018 and beyond. Now I'll turn it back to Chuck. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Frank. Operator, can we please poll for questions? Thank you. Operator : Your first question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin : Thank you. Ian, this is for you as well as Frank. You've talked about an inflection point in growth post the Lyrica LOE, I think starting after 2019. While I'm not asking you for specific guidance, can you give us a sense for the magnitude of that change? Are you talking about sales going from sort of flattish where they have been for quite some time to sort of mid-single digit growth? And earnings, which have been sort of mid-single digit growth too, where can that go? And, Frank, assuming you don't do a large transaction, can you still drive bottom line leverage? Ian mentioned that you can. But your margins are already 40%. Can they get to 45% without a large deal? And then just lastly to you, Ian. Every CEO before you has done a major transaction to accelerate revenue and earnings growth. Just curious, because your messaging has shifted a lot on a quarter-by-quarter basis. What will your legacy be before you retire? I mean at one time you had said you aspired to get back to the innovative core. At other times you've talked about wanting to do a large transaction. So just was wondering if you could kind of share with us what you expect your legacy to be? Thanks very much. Ian C. Read: Thank you for that. Let me first of all address the starting growth question. And then I'll come back to the more mundane facts of legacy. We continue to believe that the combination of our late-stage pipeline, as you mentioned, the significant tapering of LOEs post the impact of Lyrica, plus the growth drivers of our pipeline, will give us a substantial inflection point, I believe moving our growth rates in revenue to mid-to-high single digits, and obviously our revenue being at least equal to that. If you look at our Innovative Health growth drivers today, we have Ibrance, Xtandi, Xeljanz, Eliquis. And we're participating so those products can continue to conform well, They have significant patent lives, and they have a significant extension of data readouts coming on those products. Our Essential Health business will expect to be growing at that period, having passed through the major impacts of the LOEs. We have our emerging market business, we have our biosimilars business, and plus we have our sterile injectables business, which we think will put past us any of the issues of manufacturing from the Hospira plants. So all in all, I am really looking forward to the growth rates that we will produce. And if you look over the four years, we have projected the potential for approximately 20 to 30 approvals, of which 15 have the potential to be blockbusters. I think we put out a list of those products. I mean I don't want to extend the answer too far, but it is an exciting list. We have in Vaccines, Clostridium difficile; we have Staph aureus; we have pneumococcal next gen in Rare Diseases; we have products in Duchenne's; we have rivipansel; we have tafamidis and tanezumab in pain. I probably think tafamidis was the most risky of those alternatives. And we are extremely pleased with the data from tafamidis. Inflammation, we have JAK-1, atopic dermatitis, JAK-3, TYK2/JAK-1, Xeljanz in psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis. I think we have about 10 potential therapies in our JAK kinase franchise. So I mean really exciting stuff. And Oncology, we continue to look at targeted cancer agents, Ibrance, intermediate high-risk breast cancer; Xtandi in non-metastatic; we've got PROSPER, EMBARK, and ARCHER. So I think that is what will drive a really robust top line growth. Now turning to this issue of legacy. I don't really think a lot about that. I think deals are done based on value to shareholders. As you say, we've looked at different strategies over the years. Our decision making changes when the facts change. Right now, I think \u2013 I would like to think that the legacy that when I do retire that I will leave to patients and to Pfizer is that of a extremely robust pipeline that's beginning to deliver and a really strong culture of ownership and doing the right thing for patients. With that, I'll hand it over to Frank. Frank A. D'Amelio: Yeah, and then, Jami, on operating leverage, let me just run some numbers for this year, and then I'll answer the question. So if you look at the midpoint of our revenue guidance for this year, if you look at the midpoint of our EPS guidance, compare that to last year, revenue is up 4%, adjusted EPS is up 11%. So clearly, the ability to continue to demonstrate operating leverage in terms of revenue, the top line to the bottom line. Going forward, I would leave our margins relatively where they are. If you look at our gross margin, look at operating margin, they're very strong, top quartile of the industry. I think for modeling purposes, we'd leave them where they are. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Frank. Can we move to the next question, please, operator? Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Bernstein. Timothy Minton Anderson : Thank you. If I could just go back to the pipeline and your level of excitement, you guys have a long list of products. And it's almost a laundry list. Some of those invariably will be smaller commercial opportunities, like PARP, maybe JAK imatinib, maybe a new ALK inhibitor. I'm hoping you can narrow the discussion down to maybe two or three of those products that you think will be the most commercially significant drivers of future growth, as you look forward over the next, call it, five years. And second question, kind of bringing up this old topic of splitting up the company. You've talked about robustness in the business and how both divisions, both Innovative and Essential, are in increasingly better shape. I know some companies have further digested the tax reform rules that came out before, and they've had a different view of what that means for them going forward. So my question to you on this is, is there any possibility of reconsidering splitting up the company over the next few years? Thank you. Ian C. Read: Tim, thank you for the question. I don't think it's a laundry list. I think all of those products we mentioned, either individually or grouped like the targeted Oncology therapies, have potentials to be blockbusters. It's difficult to pick out one specific product. But I would say when you look at the totality, I would focus on our vaccine franchise, especially C.difficile. I would look at the huge potential of tafamidis, I would look at tanezumab in pain. And then frankly, I think the Inflammation/Immunology franchise, taken as a whole, is probably the best in the industry. And we could get into all of the different indications and products there. But if you look at the depth and strength of our science in that area, I'm really excited about our ability to drive meaningful growth from that franchise. Vis-a-vis the tax law and the split potential, I'll ask Frank to make a few comments on that. Frank A. D'Amelio: Yeah, so on the tax law, obviously we've had more time to digest and analyze the new tax laws, tax reform. We're even more comfortable with the guidance we provided for the year, which is approximately 17% on the tax rate. On the split, what we've said previously on optionality is that we were taking it off the table for the foreseeable future. So from our perspective, no change. We never say never to anything. But right now, for the foreseeable future, we're all about executing on the business. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Frank and Ian for that. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Geoffrey Meacham : Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. I just have a few. Ian, with the recent win for tafamidis and the technology deals in the space, just wanted to see if Rare Disease is elevated at all in your strategic priority list. It's a good category. But Pfizer would have to add scale to have it really move the needle. And then just on the product side, just wondering if you guys have an update on the progress of Xtandi moving upstream to the M0 population. I know that was a big part of the original value proposition with the Medivation deal and just wanted to check on the progress thus far. Thank you. Ian C. Read: Well, thank you. I think we have critical mass in Rare Diseases. We've committed capital to that. We've committed capital to production. We have not only two possibilities in Duchenne's, we have sickle cell, we have tafamidis, we have tanezumab, we have gene therapy. I'm confident that we have the critical mass. And if assets become available that could be added to that as a bolt on that had significant value, we would act on that. But once again we've always been I think very disciplined in our allocation. And we haven't seen those opportunities as yet. I would ask Albert to talk about Xtandi and its movement into the early population. Albert Bourla : Absolutely. And also just to add in the Rare Disease, that it is a multibillion dollar business right now. We have four assets that they are in Phase 3. We are expecting readouts as we speak. Cardiomyopathy, it is the one that Ian spoke, but we have also rivipansel. And we have the gene therapy platform that we have already in clinic. Three different modality, hemophilia A, hemophilia B, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy, all in Rare Disease. Now let me speak about Xtandi and your question about earlier treatments. And I do believe, we do believe that moving Xtandi into earlier treatment settings represents a potential significant opportunity. In the short term, we are focused on the non-metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer indication, which is based on the positive results and filing acceptance that we got of the PROSPER study. As you know, we had priority review for that. We have a PDUFA date in July. And hopefully we will see this medicine grow to patients in the near term. Now in the medium term, we believe growth will potentially come from expanding the Xtandi indication into hormone sensitive prostate cancer. We have the EMBARK trial, but it is in non-metastatic hormone sensitive, and we have the ARCHES trial, which is in metastatic hormone sensitive. So both studies are progressing very nicely. They are definitely on their timeline. And we are very optimistic about their success. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Albert. Can we move to the next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank. Gregg Gilbert : Good morning. First, Ian, on Consumer, if timing is not right and, for whatever set of circumstances, you can't get a fair price for Consumer in the near term, how interested are you in doing something external to Pfizer, like a spinner JV, as opposed to retaining and likely needing to invest in it? And then perhaps, Albert, you can talk about the competitive threat to the Prevnar franchise that you see from Merck. When could you get your next gen Prevnar to market versus Merck's? And what's next on the legal front? Thanks. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Gregg. On the Consumer business it's a good asset. We said we were looking at strategic alternatives to see if there was a better owner. As I commented, we don't at this moment see value in the sale. We'll focus on running the business. We had a very good quarter. I'm very pleased with the way our Consumer colleagues have reacted and are working hard. We'll look during the year at potential spins or joint ventures. But you know, frankly, the business is a good business. And if we can't get value, we'll retain it, we'll invest in it. And it continues to be important to us in that sense. Albert? Albert Bourla : Thank you, Gregg. From what we know, Merck has a pediatric program for a 15-valent pneumococcal vaccine in Phase 2. And the adult program is awaiting start of Phase 3. This is what they have said so far, Merck officials. But let me talk to you about our program. We have entered the clinic with the next generation, 20-valent pneumococcal vaccine. And this is expected to include seven additional serotypes in addition to those covered by Prevnar 13. All seven significantly improve the coverage in the current dosage space. Our result from Phase I trial demonstrated that the vaccine was safe and it was well tolerable. But more importantly demonstrated that the induced functional immune responses that could kill all 20 serotypes. So these results supported advancement into Phase 2 that was initiated last year. And right now it is fully enrolled. So if everything goes as planned, we could start our Phase 3 trials in 2019. All in all, assuming regulatory success for both vaccines and not accounting for patent protection issues that we mentioned, we would anticipate launching in a competitive timeframe to Merck, a much broader spectrum of coverage quality. Charles E. Triano: All right. Thank you, Albert. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Umer Raffat : Hi. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I had two on R&D and one for Ian. Maybe starting out on R&D. On Bavencio, so it's my understanding that the half life is materially less than the competitor PD-1. So it's about three days for Bavencio; it's about 14 to 21 days for competitors. However, the dosing frequency of Bavencio is comparable to Opdivo. So my question is, just want to understand the thought process behind that dosing frequency, given the half-life difference? As well as whether you think that's played any role on efficacy in some of the trials we've seen lately? Secondly, on tafamidis, congrats on the data. And my question is, how do you see the competitive landscape versus Alnylam's patisiran, especially in light of the recent post-hoc analysis that Alnylam showed on cardiac outcomes? And about a 45% reduction is what they were seeing in the post-hoc basis. And then finally, Ian, there's been some investor commentary lately on whether your recent comments on not looking for transformative M&A is mainly aimed at controlling the price of the potential target, so that it meets the valuation thresholds when you do actually potentially revisit it in three to six months. How do you react to that? Thank you. Ian C. Read: Let me deal with that last question first. We continually look at all deals, as I said. We look for value for shareholders. I don't think we're that smart enough to be gaining anything to that extent. Frankly, we don't \u2013 I don't see that we need a transformative deal, nor do I see one at appropriate values right now in the marketplace. We'll continue to use our capital wisely. I believe at this moment in time, although things can always change, marketplaces can change, I believe the best investment we have now is in our own pipeline. So with that, I'll turn it over to Mikael to answer the half-life question, and then probably take the tafamidis question as well, as it's still in research phase. Mikael Dolsten : Thank you for that. Yeah, we did together with our partner Merck KGgA, substantial pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies. At the current dose, 10 mg/kg intravenously every two weeks, well should cover the PD-L1 target for blocking that receptor. You may have noted that we also have an aspect that the antibody has ADCC [antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity], which could be a unique property. And we have one study that tried to address whether it can be a positive differentiated property with an even more intense dosing regimen. Concerning tafamidis, we are, as Ian alluded to, extremely enthusiastic to share the positive results that was in a cardiomyopathy population. And as you know, the endpoint was all-cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalization. That study includes wild-type TTR and mutant TTR. For cardiomyopathy, it is to a major extent the wild-type and to minor extent patients having the mutant. So this is quite different from the other biotech companies using injectable that primarily were focused on polyneuropathy. Some of those polyneuropathy patients that have the mutant form may also have later in life cardiac symptoms. To the best of my knowledge, those were measured with more functional data, and there were no hard endpoints related to cardiovascular hospitalization or even more, of course, mortality data related to cardiac patients. And finally, to the best of my knowledge, there are no pivotal studies on wild-type patients outside of tafamidis, which is again, the major patients in United States and the Western world suffering from this difficult fatal disease. So we believe we are, to the best of our knowledge, years ahead of anyone else to have such interesting data set. And we also believe it's a disease that is not well-diagnosed and has substantial potential. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Mikael. We move to our next questioner, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason Gerberry from Bank of America. Jason M. Gerberry: Oh, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just quick question on Ibrance. As the share of growth shifts in the near to medium term to the ex-U.S. markets, just wondering if you can kind of talk us through the progression in those markets of sales uptick, given that you now have reimbursement in EU established and Japan is coming online. So can you talk us through the progression there? And do you think that ex-U.S. markets can ultimately one day be as big as the U.S.? And then just secondly, just on Eucrisa. Understand there's still maybe a fair amount of free product in the channel, so difficult to really gauge the product at this point. But could you provide a little bit of direction or commentary just around when we could start to see a bigger uptick in revenue generating scripts? Thanks. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Jason. I'll ask Albert to answer both of those good questions. Albert Bourla : Yes. Thank you, Jason. And I'm sure you've noticed we are very, very pleased with the progression of Ibrance in the international markets. We have very strong growth. It was in excess of 170% of growth of sales, so almost tripled. Volume has been higher than that. As of December, Ibrance made up 98% of the total plus packs sold in the EU5. And also we did progress a lot with reimbursement. Right now, Ibrance is reimbursed in all of EU5, finally, and in Japan, as you mentioned. And in total we have 25 markets that Ibrance is reimbursed right now outside of the U.S. So we expect to have a significant progress and growth acceleration in that part of the world. And coming back to your question on the U.S. I think first of all, let me make some comments on the U.S., and then I will compare it with the European markets, the ex-U.S. size of the markets. But in the U.S. we have seen everything that we predicted. CDK class share in the first line new starts continues to steadily grow, as we had predicted. It is now 69% from 58% at the end of last quarter. And Ibrance continues to hold the leadership position in first line, again as we had also predicted. It grew up the market share this quarter to 56% from 52%. In fact, the scripts grew much faster than the sales in the U.S. We've had 26% growth of scripts, we had 19% growth of sales. And mainly the gap is attributable to fluctuation of buying patterns. I think it's going to be back to normal situation in the months ahead. And also I want to remember that the growth opportunities in the U.S. have not been exhausted by any means. Right now, in the U.S., while the CDK market of first line new patients is 69% of the CDK, if you see across all lines of treatment, it is only 53%. So we believe that there is significant opportunity to grow the class. And of course Ibrance has now more than 90% of the class share right now. The size of it too. I think that when it comes to utilization, penetration, and volume of patients, yes, the European markets will do as well if not better than the U.S. market. Of course there is very different price point that needs to be factored when we try to assess the total market. Now a few comments on Eucrisa. The prescriptions were 90,000 this quarter and \u2013 94,000. And that was a growth compared to previous quarter of 6%. However, it was slower growth than we had in the fourth quarter, but we had all times peak of the growth. We had 55% growth in the fourth quarter of last year. And this slow down in growth is attributable to the year beginning effort, in which churn in the insurance market suppresses branded prescription demand, as patient adjust to changes in their insurance plans. This has been reported by other companies as well. And to give you a magnitude, we grew 6%, while the total atopic dermatitis was flat. Right now, we are focusing our efforts in Eucrisa in two areas. One, to make sure that to broaden trial and adoption rates. A lot of dermatologists are entrenched to use steroids right now. And also to improve access. And we have plans in place to do both. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Albert. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi. Andrew S. Baum: Thank you. A couple of questions, please. Firstly, Ian and Frank, on capital allocation, given your collective observations on some of your competitors premium biotech acquisition, together with your comments, Ian, about the pipeline strength and its under appreciation perhaps, should we expect further additional buybacks on top of what you've already committed to this year? Second, on U.S. biosimilars, and this feeds into your mature products business, do you expect a significant increase in the adoption of biosimilars in the U.S., driven by insurers taking on board biosimilars first, given the pressure from the FDA, HHS, as well as the vertical integration taking place? And finally, for Mikael, should we expect an interim for the PALLAS adjuvant trial for Ibrance in 2019? Many thanks. Ian C. Read: So on the biosimilars, Andrew, we continue to make progress in the U.S. with our own commercial efforts. But I believe that it will take an effort by the administration to move that market, given the substantial advantage the entrenched companies have over the rebating system. So I'm looking forward to activity from the administration on that. But that being said, we continue to look for a good growth in that area. And it will certainly accelerate post any action from the administration. PALLAS, Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : Yeah, we expect the PALLAS trial for intermediate and high-risk early breast cancer in adjuvant treatment to run until the primary completion date, which is in 2020 to have sufficient number events. We remain very encouraged about the translation for metastatic to early breast cancer and have very much confidence in the strengths of IBRANCE based on other new adjuvant studies of the same type of tumor that has been positive. Ian C. Read: Okay. So I would agree with you, Andrew. 100% of the pipeline is undervalued. I would ask Frank to make a quick comment on capital allocation. Frank A. D'Amelio: Yeah, so on capital allocation, Andrew, our priorities haven't changed. They remain dividends, share buybacks, investing in the business, and M&A where it makes sense. Specific to buybacks, to answer your question, in the first quarter we did $6.1 billion in share buybacks at an average price of $36.23. And just in terms of a little history, if you go back to 2010 we've repurchased $61.7 billion worth of our shares, 2.2 billion shares retired at an average price of $27.35. So it's been a very good trade. In terms of going forward, which is really what you asked me, we announced that $4 billion accelerated share repurchase on March 12 of this year. It'll take several months for that to complete. Once that completes, we'll assess where we are. And then we'll make a decision on whether or not to do anything further on buybacks. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Frank. Next question, please, operator? Operator : Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. David R. Risinger: Yeah, thanks very much. I just wanted to dig in a little bit deeper on the opportunity for Ibrance in early stage breast cancer. First, could you please discuss the NSABP's Ibrance PALLET trial? I understand that it's small. It's a neoadjuvant, and it's 14 weeks. But I was hoping that you could frame your expectations for that trial? And then, Mikael, I know that you commented on Ibrance in the adjuvant setting in response to the prior question. So if you could just comment about both of those trials, both PALLAS and PENELOPE-B, and your level of confidence in success in late 2020? Thank you. Ian C. Read: Albert, all yours. No, sorry, we need Mikael to answer it. Mikael Dolsten : Yeah. Thank you. First of all, on the PALLAS study, which we think \u2013 it's run by a collaborative organization, academic, but we think it will readout relatively soon and be reported in the fall. I have high confidence that we will see a very robust signal based on previous similar studies in the adjuvant, such as the study run by Washington University's of Dr. [Cynthia] Ma and [Dr. Matthew] Ellis that showed a very profound complete cell cycle arrest and also quite impressive responses, complete responses, in a neoadjuvant setting. And it's a very similar patient population to the PALLAS study that you referred to. And to study the primary endpoint, they used the very same Ki-67 proliferation marker. So I have a strong confidence in a good outcome of pilot based on previous science. And we think therefore that we should have a very optimistic view on PENELOPE [-B] and PALLAS event-driven, adjuvant trials to hopefully, for the benefit of patients, expand Ibrance into a population of early breast cancer that may be twice as big as the metastatic population. So we look forward to see those studies conclude. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Mikael. Next question, please, operator? Operator : Your next question comes from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Great. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Just a couple questions, one on the innovative side with Xeljanz. The product was a little bit less than what we had expected. I'm just wondering if there's been any impact seen on that product, given some of the concerns around thromboembolic disorders with baracitim (49:55), as that went through its review process. And maybe if you can also just frame what you see as the opportunity for UC ahead of that action date next month. And then on the biosimilar side, just a question on biosimilar Remicade. I just noticed it did have a little bit of a decline sequentially from last quarter in developed Europe, and I assume it was due to competition. But just wondering if you can give a little more clarity on what exactly is driving that. And if it is competition, is it driven by Biogen/Samsung? Or is it driven more by the fact that Celltrion has other distributors selling the product as well? Thanks so much. Ian C. Read: Thank you. Albert, if you could take both those questions? Albert Bourla : Yes. Xeljanz revenues were up this quarter 30% in the U.S. Particularly like you referred, the growth was 19%. However, the scripts grew 33%. So there is a sizable gap between the scripts and the sales. And most of that is attributable, as with Eucrisa, in buying patterns that, as I said, also other companies reported. But the fact that this quarter already we see that this is normalized in the months after the quarter. So there is no slowdown on scripts as a regard of any concern. And as we have repeatedly said, that we do not think that there is any correlation in Xeljanz with this type of side effects. Going to the UC, it is, as you know, under registration. The opportunity, it is large. In the G7, the market, it is approximately $5 billion, affects approximately 1.8 million of people. We are very encouraged by the efficacy and safety results of Xeljanz in the OPAL Study for psoriatic arthritis and OCTAVE study for UC. We had a very positive advisory committee. We have very positive interactions with regulators. And frankly, we expect that the product will be approved in the near future. Now, ulcers. I cannot comment on Remicade. But our self, we grew 53% globally and 39% versus last year. And we are very happy with how things are evolving in the international markets, frankly. Charles E. Triano: All right. Thank you, Albert. Albert Bourla : Our history is in the U.S., where there's disproportionately smaller penetration than whatever is happening in the rest of the world, because of some contracting practices. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Albert. Next question, please, operator? Operator : Your next question comes from John Boris from SunTrust. John T. Boris: Thanks for taking the questions, and congrats on your results. First one for both Ian and Mikael. If you look at your portfolio of assets and your pipeline, you certainly have the makings of a decent sized orphan disease platform. Certainly your hemophilia franchise through your Factor VIII and IX business, along with your gene therapy programs with Spark [Therapeutics], along with tafamidis and other assets, seems as though that might be going forward, a very important strategic area. So, Ian, just your thoughts around that and the build-out of that pipeline also, Mikael. Second question for Frank. On other income, was $250 million in the quarter, but you're guiding to only $400 million. That seems to be a little low. What are some of the pushes and pulls there? And then lastly, FDA has been pretty vocal on advancing new policies to try and stimulate more biosimilar development, with about a dozen policies that incrementally could move the ball in the direction to try and create more biosimilar competition. What are some of the policies and procedures that you think could move the needle in favor of biosimilars going forward? And then just any commentary on your Herceptin Complete Response Letter? And when you think you might resolve that? Thanks. Ian C. Read: Thank you. Mikael, why don't you talk a little bit about our orphan disease portfolio? I believe we're investing in it. I don't think there's any restrictions in our capital investment. If we see opportunities outside, we'll take them. But internally we have a lot of substrate to work with. Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : Thank you. Yeah. Basically, we are focused on hemophilia neuromuscular disease and with some interest also in metabolic rare disease. Hemophilia, as you know, we have a long history and successful presence in the marketplace treating hemophilia A and B. We are very excited about our hemophilia B program that concluded successfully based on gene therapy, is successfully proved for concept and is progressing in partnership with Spark towards pivotal studies. We have a hemophilia A, partnered with Sangamo [Therapeutics], where we make progress in dose escalation. And we also have a Pfizer monoclonal antibody against TFPI for weekly subcutaneous convenient delivery for all types of hemophilia, where we've seen some early encouraging sign. Also we think it's a really interesting portfolio. On the neuromuscular disease side, Ian alluded to that we started gene therapy for Duchenne's. And we also have a pivotal readout with a monoclonal antibody against myostatin in Duchenne's, which we look upon as a high-risk high-reward opportunity. And of course within cardiomyopathy with tafamidis, we look very much forward to share the data and to swiftly advance the regulatory dialogues. And finally, end of the year in sickle cell disease, another component of our hematology opportunity in Rare Disease, we have also likely year of the \u2013 end-of-the-year readout for rivipansel. And we are look forward with encouragement based on that mechanism has played out well in the Phase 2. As Ian alluded to, we think we are well-resourced with all modalities in immunotherapy and end-to-end capability, as well as non-in-therapy modalities. And we will continue to do internal as well as licensing flash bolt-on to accelerate. Ian C. Read: Thank you. Other income deductions, Frank? Frank A. D'Amelio: Yeah, so, John, other income for the quarter was actually about a $320 million good guy, income for the quarter. So then that relative to the 400 million for the year, really three major drivers there. One is we had some one-time milestone payments to the tune of about $115 million. We had $110 million in unrealized gains on equity securities. And we don't try to project those. And those could turn one way or the other going forward. And then the third big ticket item is net interest expense. Interest income for the quarter, about $75 million. Interest expense, about $315 million. You net that out, about $240 million per quarter in net interest expense going forward for the remainder of the year. When we put that together, we think it's prudent to leave the other income at approximately $400 million. Ian C. Read: Albert, biosimilars, including Herceptin Albert Bourla : Yes. Let me start with the first one was around the policy of biosimilars. Look, we are very encouraged by the words of FDA and other people in Trump's administration. We just wait now to translate these words into tangible actions that can reverse the situation. Keep in mind that the biosimilars penetration \u2013 let's take infliximab. In Europe, it's 56%. In the U.S., our share is 6%, so there is something wrong with that. Ian C. Read: But not in closed systems. Albert Bourla : Actually, thank you for raising that. You see in closed systems, we have 66% in this quarter. Half of our sales are coming in closed systems. Closed systems meaning when the provider is the same person with the person \u2013 who the payer. And when it comes to value, we always win. And this is what we want to see that prevails. Now back to your question about trastuzumab. We did receive, unexpectedly actually, a Complete Response Letter from the FDA. Basically FDA was asking additional technical information clarifications. We didn't think that something like that would come to a Complete Response Letter. I want to clarify that those questions were not related either to safety nor to clinical data submitted. And they had nothing to do with \u2013 pertaining to our manufacturing abilities. But nevertheless, at this times we do not anticipate that the FDA action will have any impact on our plans to launch of trastuzumab. We think that we will be able to respond to this queries and get it approved before our protected launch date. Charles E. Triano: All right. Thanks, Albert. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Christopher Schott : Good. Thanks very much for the questions. Just two here. Maybe first on the Essential Health business. Could we just get a little bit more color on the legacy Hospira shortages? I believe you said you expect the injectable business to be flat year over year, but the Q1 results were still showing some erosion. Could we just talk a little bit about how you see these issues resolving? How quickly you think you can recapture share once you're back at normalized capacity? And the second question was on tafamidis. Can you just comment on the size of the cardiomyopathy patient population you're going to be pursuing? And do you believe the ATTR-ACT data suggests potential for this product in polyneuropathy? And if so, do you have to run additional studies there? Or can you refile in that setting? Thanks very much. Ian C. Read: Albert, why don't you handle those questions, and ask Mikael to comment as you see fit? Albert Bourla : Yes. Thank you 9very much, Ian. Look in PEH, a general comment, as you know, we \u2013 the business declined 9%. But I think you see the legacy Pfizer, the decline was only 2%, despite the loss of exclusivities. Most of the decline came from the Hospira legacy, 38%, partly because of the divestment of the device businesses, but also because of supplies that we fail with our sterile injectables. We do believe that the revenues from this portfolio roughly will be flat this year compared to last year. I think we had the decline this quarter, likely we will see a decline next quarter as well. And then we'll see growth in the third and fourth quarter. So overall, we'll be roughly flat. We anticipate this situation. And we have incorporated into the guidance that Frank provided, the beginning of the year. And we continue our very comprehensive remediation plans to upgrade and modernize these facilities in Hospira. We are in constant contact with the FDA. And we have increased substantially our investments into this manufacturing site. So we believe that as I said we will be flat. And then next year, we will start providing much more capacity available that we do not have now. As regards to tafamidis, let me make a comment on the market opportunity, and then I will ask Mikael to help into the more scientific question. The TTR cardiomyopathy is a rare progressive disease. And it is a fatal disease. People that are diagnosed with this disease, they have a life expectancy of three to seven years unfortunately. It is almost like unfortunately a death sentence. The prevalence of the disease is currently unknown, but it is expected that less than 1% of the people are diagnosed in the U.S. And already, this number is several thousand. So we believe that by working towards improving awareness and diagnostic rates of this disease, we will be able to provide meaningful assistance to those people that they have virtually no options. Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : Thank you. That was terrific background of the disease. So I can only build on what Albert said. Its data suggests the disease is vastly underdiagnosed. And we've seen some recent external figures estimating that just in U.S., it may be more than 100,000 patients related to TTR cardiomyopathy. This is likely driven by the wild type, the senile systemic amyloidosis caused by the wild type, as its increase is dramatically \u2013 has contributed to cardiomyopathy with growing age in an aging population. And now with increasing availability of diagnostic tools and of course availability of drugs potentially pending regulatory dialogues, a drug like tafamidis, there would be large incentives to do more early diagnosis that will allow patients to be treated for longer time before they progress and have this dire prognosis that Albert alluded to. There's also the mutant form that can be diagnosed very easily earlier in life. But we do think there are opportunities to also diagnose wild type in a more efficient manner. So that's why we're excited about this, having this large data set on wild type TTR cardiomyopathy. And we look forward to the dialogues with regulators and potentially how to contribute to early diagnosis, awareness of the disease to help patients. Albert Bourla : And the population of our study, Mikael, included both types, right? Wild types and... Mikael Dolsten : It does. Of course initially, the patient group accessible will be mainly with academic medical centers, which is a fraction of the number I shared. But as awareness grows, the disease will be likely diagnosed at many cardiology clinics. Charles E. Triano: All right. Thank you, both, Albert and Mikael. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen. Steve Scala : Thank you. Ibrance Q1 EU sales were flat with that in Q3 of 2017. Given the negative sales in Q4, I would have expected a nice recovery. So can you speak to that specifically? And is price the explanation for this disparity? Second, what were Ibrance and Xeljanz stocking numbers in Q1? And then lastly, on tafamidis, sorry to ask again, but just to clarify prior answers. Based on the data you have and the data you'll present this year, can you get a broad label for patients with predominantly neurological manifestation and a broad label covering a range of disease severities? It sounds like the answer is yes on both, but please just confirm. Thank you very much. Ian C. Read: Mikael, could you give a brief comment on the potential avenues for diagnosis and labeling? Mikael Dolsten : Yeah, we certainly believe on the comprehensive data that we have an opportunity to discuss a broad label for cardiomyopathy. Concerning neuropathy, we do have earlier trials, smaller in nature. But it was sufficient for registration in Europe. And we do have registered to date, though, many patients in Europe that they're doing very well on tafamidis. And we will look at opportunity in dialogues with the various divisions at the FDA for an opportunity that would cover multiple patient population, as you alluded to. Ian C. Read: On the Ibrance question, when you are in a phase of looking for listings in Europe, it's very difficult to get a read on the total value of the products, as very often you sell under emergency protocols at a price that is not necessarily relevant to the final price you get or to the U.S. price, for that matter. So we see very robust uptake with physicians of Ibrance. And we see an impact of course on the revenue, as we adjust to the reimbursement levels of Ibrance that will give us sustained and a growing opportunity for a substantial patient number increase in Europe. So I think this is part of what we do when we negotiate for access. And we feel we have a very strong strategy around access and future growth in Europe. Albert, do you want to add anything to the questions? Albert Bourla : For Europe, I'd say you said it very well. And we think that the prices that we got represent good value. And they are in line with what usually products are priced in Europe. Ian C. Read: And the inventory levels of the movement in \u2013 can we \u2013 it's very difficult for us to measure that, because it's very \u2013 a lot of it's specialty. And we don't have a very strong control, whereas with the distributors in general, we know very well what inventory levels are. So by deduction, we know that the scripts were up. We know where the revenue was. We know that we don't believe it's a net pricing effect. So by difference, it has to be inventory movements. Albert Bourla : And just to add that our calculations reveal that most of the gap, it is because of inventory movement. Ian C. Read: Yes. Charles E. Triano: Great. Thank you. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO. Alex Arfaei : Okay. Good morning, folks. Thank you for taking the questions. First on Xeljanz. Roughly, what proportion of Xeljanz in the U.S. is coming from TNF-na\u00efve patients as opposed to TNF experienced? And a follow-up on biosimilars. It appears that the Europeans are becoming more aggressive in their adoption of biosimilars. Wondering if I could get your thoughts there. And could you comment on the implications of that both as a headwind for Xeljanz and a tailwind for your biosimilars pipeline? Specifically, would you be able to provide some expected launch timeframes for some of the key biosimilar products in Europe? Thank you. Ian C. Read: Albert, would you like to address this? Albert Bourla : Yes. On the Xeljanz question, we estimate that more than 50% of our patients comes from na\u00efve patients. And... Ian C. Read: And the other question, I think, the Xeljanz opportunities in Europe are just beginning. It's in the actual usage of the product. It's not that the majority is na\u00efve to TNFs, because the growth of the marketplace itself is slow. So it has to be people who've converted over from TNF to using Xeljanz. The important thing with Xeljanz is that it's a lot of usage in monotherapy, which we think allows us to distinguish ourselves from the TNFs as they go off patent. So I see a very aggressive growth rate for Xeljanz in Europe and a very aggressive growth rate for our biosimilars as well. Charles E. Triano: Thank you. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Tony Butler from Guggenheim Partners. Tony Butler : Thanks very much. Two brief questions. Mikael, given the outcome of the JAVELIN lung study, what's the position that you feel Pfizer will be in relative to lung as a histology for Bavencio or any other combination and/or combinations moving forward? And then second to that, does that actually change or does the outcome actually change your strategy or the focus from one of identifying patients, who may respond to a particular monotherapy, I-O monotherapy, or simply combinations for everybody? Is that strategy, is there a difference that may occur perhaps as a result of JAVELIN lung? Thanks. Ian C. Read: Mikael. And then perhaps Albert may want to add anything on the strategy or commercial strategy. Mikael Dolsten : Yeah, we've always been focusing on combinations as the way to go over the longer term. And over the next 18 months, we have six pivotal readouts across five tumor types, of which five of them are combinations and only one is monotherapy to first line lung, including first and second line ovarian, with chemo, renal, in light as a targeted therapy, gastric with Bavencio as maintenance off the chemo. Bladder with Bavencio as maintenance off the chemo. And the first line lung was designed very differently from the second line. It contains hierarchical readout for high PD-L1 and intermediate PD-L1. And a combined endpoint for PFS and overall survival. So I think we will be able to mitigate any impact or crossover from control group to either marketed PD agent that we recorded in the second line earlier. So we feel pretty good about this cohort of readouts in the next 18 months. And of course many earlier clinical studies that are not pivotal but will generate the good combination data. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Mikael. Charles E. Triano: Great. Thank you, Mikael. And, operator, if we can take one last question, please. Operator : Your final question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS. Marc Goodman : Yeah, just a continuation on the I-O. I was curious your thoughts, Mikael, about TMB as a biomarker? And how much development work you think should be put into that? And then just on Prevnar, just in the U.S. I know U.S., you can give us a little color on what's going on and how you think about the growth there. Thanks. Mikael Dolsten : Concerning TMB, we think it's interesting to explore additional biomarkers beyond PD-L1. To the best of my knowledge, I think PD-L1 is the biomarker right now that has solid data concerning both PFS and overall survival, while TMB is, at this stage, mainly reported PFS data and far less OS data. So I think we need more time to understand how TMB will fit into it. But obviously we think it's the way to go to have numerous ways to analyze high responders. But our strategy as I said previously will be to utilize those information pieces with drug combinations. Ian C. Read: Albert? Albert Bourla : Yes, on the Prevnar. First of all to say that the overall sales were slightly declined 3%. And as you mentioned, U.S. was the main driver of the decline with 12%. But I want also to emphasize the significant growth in emerging markets. We had 45% growth. And this is due to multiple factors. But the most important is we just launched in China, where we expect that we will have very good uptake. Now the specific information you asked for, the U.S. In the U.S. we've had a 12% decline. And this is a combination of both adult and pediatric. Pediatric actually declined 14%, but that was purely CDC purchasing patterns. This is common. CDC, when you have big governmental purchases, they can happen one month or the other, and that can affect your growth. So we think that the pediatric U.S. will grow eventually for the year. And the U.S. adult declined 7%. Actually, I think it is rather positive, the fact that now we are slowing down the declines as we are coming more to steady state of the adult penetrations. Charles E. Triano: Great. Thank you, Albert, and thank you, everybody, for your attention this morning. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Pfizer's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day everyone, and welcome to Pfizer's Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Charles E. Triano: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer's second quarter 2018 performance. I'm joined today by our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Albert Bourla, our Chief Operating Officer, Frank D'Amelio; our CFO; Mikael Dolston, President of Worldwide Research and Development; and Doug Lankler, General Counsel. The slides that will be presented on this call can be viewed on our website, pfizer.com/investors. Before we start, I would like to remind you that our discussion during this conference call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information regarding these factors is discussed under the Disclosure Notice section in the earnings press release we issued this morning as well as in Pfizer's 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements during this call speak only as of the original date of this call and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements. Discussions during the call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's Form 8-K dated today, July 31, 2018. Any non-GAAP measures presented are not and should not be viewed as substitutes for financial measures required by U.S. GAAP, have no standardized meaning proscribed by U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to the calculations of similar measures at other companies. We will now make prepared remarks and then will move to a question-and-answer session. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian? Ian C. Read: Thank you, Chuck, and good morning everyone. During my remarks, I will discuss the progress we are making within each of our businesses, the latest advancements within our R&D pipeline and some of the steps we are taking to prepare the company to accelerate top line growth in the future. In the second, quarter total company revenues were up 2% operationally, driven by the continued growth of key brands, biosimilars and emerging markets. These growth drivers were partially offset by the loss of exclusivity of Viagra in the U.S. in December 2017, a decline in U.S. legacy-established products and product supply shortages related to our legacy Hospira products. I'll begin with a few words about each of our businesses starting with Pfizer Innovative Health. This business had another solid quarter, growing its top line 5% operationally thanks to the continued strength of several of our biggest selling medicines. In the second quarter, global Ibrance revenues were up 19% operationally to just over $1 billion. This was driven by strong growth in international developed markets which represents our next avenue of growth potential for the brand. And to a lesser extent, in emerging markets and the U.S., Ibrance continues to hold a leadership position in first-line hormone receptor-positive HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer. Since its launch, approximately 12,000 physicians have prescribed Ibrance in the U.S. and more than 140,000 patients have been prescribed the medicine worldwide. The overall CDK class continues to grow within the eligible patient population, although penetration has decelerated to approximately 64% of eligible first-line newly started patients in the U.S. receiving CDK therapy. Within the CDK category, which now includes two competitors, Ibrance total prescription share is 91%. Xtandi's U.S. alliance revenue grew 21% to $171 million. We received good news earlier this month when the U.S. FDA approved a supplementary new drug application for Xtandi based on results from the Phase 3 PROSPER trial. The approval broadens the indication for Xtandi to now include men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. This makes Xtandi the first and only oral medication that is FDA approved for both non-metastatic and metastatic CRPC and the anticipated approval of this indication was a key factor in our evaluation of Medivation. Xeljanz continues its strong performance, with revenues increasing 37% operationally in the quarter to $463 million. We received several additional regulatory milestones since our last call. In May, the FDA approved Xeljanz for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. Days earlier, it was also approved in Japan for the same indication. In June, the European Commission approved Xeljanz in combination with Methotrexate for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis in adult patients. In addition, we recently received a positive opinion from the CHMP in Europe recommending marketing authorization for Xeljanz for adult patients with ulcerative colitis, and we look forward to the potential approval of this indication. For a broad array of indications, ease-of-use and a good tolerability profile, we see Xeljanz increasingly becoming a go-to product with rheumatologists and GI physicians. Worldwide, Pfizer's revenue for Eliquis were up 42% operationally to $889 million, driven by strong growth in the U.S. and the EU. In the U.S., Eliquis now makes up more than half of novel oral anticoagulant prescriptions, widening its market share lead in the quarter from 10% to 13 percentage points ahead of our primary competitors. Finally, we continue to review strategic options for our Consumer Healthcare business, which delivered another solid quarter. Turning now to Pfizer Essential Health. We once again saw strong operational growth in emerging markets and in our biosimilars portfolio. Overall Essential Health revenues for the quarter declined however, due in large part to the ongoing product supply shortages in the sterile injectable business, continuing product LOEs, namely Lyrica in developed Europe and a decline in the legacy established products portfolio in developed markets. Emerging markets revenue within the Essential Health business grew 10% operationally for the quarter to nearly $2 billion. China led the way, growing 24% operationally. Revenues from our biosimilars business grew 44% operationally in the quarter to $188 million. Our growth in biosimilars was driven primarily by Inflectra in certain channels in the U.S. as well as in developed Europe. We expect to broaden our biosimilars portfolio in the U.S. by potentially bringing five biosimilars to the market in the next two years. In our sterile injectables business, as stated in first quarter earnings, we expect to see improvements in the year-over-year comparisons during the third and fourth quarter. We continue to strengthen and advance our pipeline, which we believe has the largest and most promising array of late-stage prospects it is had in decades. Let me touch on some of our more promising recent developments. In rare diseases, following the positive top-line results from our Phase 3 study in patients with TTR cardiomyopathy, tafamidis received breakthrough therapy designation from the U.S. FDA and a similar designation from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. We see this as a potentially highly important break for these patients and we look forward to presenting the full study results in August at the European Society of Cardiology conference. In internal medicine, on July 18 we, along with our partner Eli Lilly, announced that a Phase 3 study evaluating subcutaneous administration of our investigational humanized monoclonal antibody tanezumab in patients with arthritis pain met all three co-primary endpoints. This study was a 16-week dose titration study evaluating tanezumab for the treatment of osteo pain. If approved, tanezumab would be the first in a new class of non-opioid treatments for this disease. In oncology we currently have four potential medicines under priority review at the FDA, lorlatinib, dacomitinib, talazoparib, and glasdegib. In inflammation and immunology, we have built what we believe is a true leadership position with our JAK franchise and currently have 10 ongoing selective immunokinase programs. We are continuing to recruit for our Phase 3 study for our JAK1 molecule in atopic dermatitis, for which we received a breakthrough designation by the FDA. We initiated a Phase 3 study of our own Xeljanz, our first JAK inhibitor in adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis. We initiated a Phase 1 study of a topical agent in patients with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis, and later this year we expect to share progress in our next generation JAK assets that has the potential to be a first-in-class treatment for alopecia areata, a disease for which there is no approved preventive therapy or cure. In vaccines we achieved proof of concept for our next generation multivalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine candidate with the potential to cover 20 serotypes, and we are currently planning our Phase 3 program. We have currently three gene therapy programs in clinical studies, the Factor IX collaborative program with Spark Therapeutics has started to enroll patients for Phase 3. This marks the first gene therapy Phase 3 program that Pfizer has initiated, and this remains an area of high interest to us. Our gene therapy program for Duchenne's muscular disease has started dosing. The first few patients in a Phase 1/2 trial and our collaboration with Sangamo is advancing the Phase 1/2 dose escalation study cohort. Through 2022, we continue to see the potential for approximately 25 to 30 approvals, of which up to 15 have the potential to be blockbusters subject to some expected attrition. The previously referenced approvals for Xeljanz and Xtandi represent the first two of these 15. Before I close, let me briefly recap the announcement we made on July 11 regarding the modifications we'll be making to our structure. Effective at the beginning of the company's 2019 fiscal year, Pfizer will have three businesses, a science-based innovative medicines business, which will now include biosimilars and a new hospital business unit for anti-infectives and sterile injectables, an off-patent branded and generic established medicines business operating with substantial autonomy, and a Consumer Healthcare business. This new structure represents a natural evolution for our business as we transition to a period post 2020 were we expect a higher and more sustained revenue growth profile. And given the growing importance of emerging markets to Pfizer's business, we see this new structure better positioning each business to accelerate its growth. In summary, we continue to deliver on our strategy and believe we remain well positioned to deliver new medicines for patients, enhance shareholder value and prepare the company for accelerating growth in the future. Our in-market products remain strong. Our late-stage pipeline contains several potential blockbusters. We remain prudent with regard to capital allocation, and our engagement with policymakers around the world continues to focus on creating an environment that maximizes a benefit for both innovators and patients. It's our job not only to discover and develop medicines and vaccines, but also to advocate for affordable access so they can help the maximum number of people who need them. As such, we will continue to work with the president on his blueprint for strengthening the healthcare system, providing more access and relieving the burden on patients at the point-of-sale. Now I will turn it over to Frank to provide details on the quarter and our revised financial outlook for 2018. Frank A. D'Amelio: Thanks, Ian. Good day everyone. As always, the charts I am reviewing today are included in our webcast. Now moving on to the financials. Second quarter 2018 revenues were approximately $13.5 billion, which includes the favorable impact of foreign exchange of $377 million and operational growth of $194 million. Our Innovative Health business recorded 5% operational revenue growth in the second quarter 2018, driven primarily by Eliquis, Ibrance and Xeljanz globally, Prevnar 13 primarily in emerging markets and the U.S., and Xtandi in the U.S., which were partially offset by the loss of exclusivity of Viagra in the U.S. in December of 2017 and Enbrel in most developed Europe markets due to continued biosimilar competition. I want to remind everyone that Viagra revenues generated in the U.S. and Canada shifted to the Essential Health business at the beginning of 2018. Revenues for our Essential Health business in the second quarter decreased 4% operationally, primarily due to a 12% operational decline in legacy established products portfolio in developed markets; a 17% operational decline in the sterile injectables portfolio in developed markets, primarily due to continued legacy Hospira product shortages in the U.S.; an 11% operational decrease in peri-LOE products in developed markets, primarily due to the expected declines in Lyrica in developed Europe, all of which were partially offset by the inclusion of Viagra revenues in the U.S. and Canada; 10% operational growth in emerging markets, reflecting growth across all portfolios; and 44% operational growth in biosimilars, mainly driven by Inflectra in certain channels in the U.S. and in developed Europe. Second quarter reported diluted EPS was $0.65 compared with $0.51 in the year-ago quarter primarily due to higher other income, due to unrealized net gains on equity securities reflecting the adoption of a new accounting standard in the first quarter of 2018; increased income from collaborations; out-licensing arrangements in the sale of asset rights; and lower charges for certain legal matters; as well as a lower effective tax rate due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA in late 2017; increased revenues and foreign exchange impacts; and fewer shares outstanding, all of which were partially offset by higher cost of sales. Adjusted diluted EPS for the second quarter was $0.81 versus $0.67 in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to the previously mentioned factors. I want to point out that diluted weighted average shares outstanding declined by 85 million shares versus the year-ago quarter, due primarily to our ongoing share repurchase program, reflecting the impact of shares that were repurchased during the first quarter 2018, partially offset by dilution related to share-based employee compensation programs. As I previously mentioned, foreign exchange positively impacted second quarter 2018 revenues by approximately $377 million and negatively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $228 million. As a result, foreign exchange favorably impacted second quarter 2018 adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.02 versus the year-ago quarter. We updated the following components of our 2018 financial guidance. Revenue guidance was updated solely to reflect recent unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates from mid April of 2018 to mid July of 2018. The adjusted R&D expenses guidance range was updated to reflect higher spend than previously anticipated in the second half of 2018 due to our late-stage development programs. Adjusted income in the first half of 2018, which was much higher than one half of our previous full-year expectation for this component due to nonrecurring items; consequently we updated our guidance primarily to include unrealized net gains on equity securities and one-time items such as milestone payments from certain collaborations and out-licensing arrangements, and the gain on the sale of certain asset rights in the first half of 2018. The effective tax rate on adjusted income guidance was updated to reflect the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. While this estimate will continue to be subject to further analysis, interpretation, clarification of the TCJA, we believe that this revised guidance will be sustainable beyond 2018. As a result of these updated components, we are raising our 2018 adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.05 to $2.95 to $3.05, the midpoint of which implies 13% growth compared with 2017. I want to point out that our 2018 financial guidance assumes no additional share repurchases. To date in 2018, we repurchased $6.1 billion of our shares. We expect the dilution related to share-based employee compensation programs to offset the reduction in shares associated with these share repurchases by approximately half. Finally, as of July 31 of 2018, we have $10.3 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. Moving onto key takeaways, we delivered strong financial results in the second quarter of 2018 with 2% operational revenue growth and a 21% increase in adjusted diluted EPS versus the prior-year quarter. We increased our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range, but we also lowered the midpoint of 2018 revenue guidance range solely to reflect recent unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates. We announced plans to begin operating under a new business structure beginning in 2019 and accomplished several key product and pipeline milestones. We returned $10.1 billion to shareholders in the first half of 2018 through dividends and share repurchases. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2018 and beyond. Now I'll turn it back to Chuck. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Frank and Ian, for those comments. Operator, if we could please poll for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank. Gregg Gilbert : Thanks, folks. I'll ask two. I want to start with a pipeline question on tafamidis, if I'm pronouncing that correctly. Can you talk about the potential for that asset in light of the low diagnosis rates there and what you plan to do to build that market? And then a bigger-picture strategic question, Ian and team, I'd like to better understand the decision you've made to reorganize the way you decided on and want to better understand whether it's tied to Albert digging in as COO and making decisions based on operational factors? Is it a realization that biosimilars will look more like brands than generics? Just some more color on what the new structure will achieve that the current one does not would be helpful. Thanks. Ian C. Read: Okay. Albert would you like to discuss tafamidis? I think it's a name that you'll very soon remember very clearly as you see its impact on patients. But Albert can talk to tafamidis. I'll make some opening comments on the reorganization and then Albert, continue to explain the reorganization. Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Ian, and thank you for your question, Gregg. Tafamidis is a medicine that met its primary endpoint, demonstrating statistical significant reduction, but also meaningful clinical reduction in the combination of all-cause mortality and frequency of cardiovascular related events. This is for a disease that it is rare, but it is rare because it's significantly underdiagnosed. Right now it is expected that less than 1% of the people suffering from this disease are diagnosed actually, and a big role in that plays the fact that, until now, there was no efficient treatment. We believe that the prevalence, which is unknown, it is quite large actually, and with a product that we're going to present the results in August in the congress in Munich, that offers significant treatment options. This market could become really large. Our efforts will focus on explaining to physicians about the treatment option but also helping them understand better the disease and increase the diagnosis rates. So more to be said after the August conference in Munich when we will announce the results. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Albert. So, Gregg, on the restructuring, this is something that Albert as Chief Operating Officer was reviewing in that role, discussed extensively with me. It basically represents I think a pivot in the company towards growth as we see the strength of our pipeline, the need to invest in our pipeline and the need to structure around growth drivers, certainly emphasized by the fact that the optionality construct, as we said the first quarter, we no longer saw as viable. So with that, I'd like Albert to explain a little bit why we are structured around growth and why this is good for the company. Albert Bourla : Yes. Thank you, Ian, and as Ian said, the previous decision not to separate PA agent, PA testing dependent corporations but also with the comprehensive U.S. tax reform now in place, and more importantly with an increased confidence in our pipeline, now the growth is in sight in combination with the lack of LOEs. So as Ian said, we decided to organize our businesses from the base of growth drivers which will provide better operational ability to manage this business. So a few words about those three segments. The first one, it is the cost segment of Pfizer, it's the fundamental 80% of our business and this is a science-based innovative medicines business. The fundamentals of growth in this area are very, very strong because we have an aging population, but it is increasing the demand for innovative medicines, but also science is in a position to deliver solutions right now. Frankly, Pfizer is a position to deliver strong solutions. We have made very public our release of 15 blockbusters that are expected to get registered in the next five years. So the fundamentals of growth are very strong. In addition to the five already existing business units, we added biosimilars under oncology and I&I and immunology. The reason is that first of all this is, as the rest of the business is, high risk, high reward, heavy in R&D investments business, the biosimilars, but even more importantly right now all of our biosimilars are either registered or about to be registered in the next 12 months, which means that they are all entering commercialization phase. By placing them under the oncology and immunology businesses, that both of them, they have very strong expertise in the commercial, in the scientific and in patient experience domains, we expect that the commercialization of these products will be very strong. The same comes with the hospital business unit that we are creating, putting underneath anti-infectives and sterile injectables. These are businesses that will grow. The sterile injectables is facing now some issues because of manufacturing supply considerations, but those will be resolved and the business will return into growth. And more, we have more than 100 research projects in this business. So that's why we created this business, to innovate. Now if we move to the established business, the established business also had very strong fundamentals of growth, but they are very different than the researched-based high-risk high-reward innovative business. The growth drivers in this business are urbanization. The growth drivers in this business, it is a middle class that is rising, particularly Asia, and provides access to hundreds of millions of people. If you see our Chinese business, this quarter the first half of the year is growing almost 25%. This means for the size of our business that we are generating in the first half approximately $500 million. If you extrapolate, you could expect something like $1 billion of growth into a business. Significant fundamentals. What you need to be successful in this business, it is to make sure that you have good awareness of the local markets. This is why we are placing an EOT (26:57) team member in China to be able to manage these opportunities. And you also require good autonomy, because this is a fast-moving business. This is why we are creating a company, like we are creating a division within Pfizer that will have relatively increased autonomy. And moving to the third business, we always had the consumer business, always was operated independently. We are increasing a little bit the independence of the business, because the fundamental growth drivers has nothing to do with our prescription medicines. It has to do with the growth of consumers, of consumer consumption and it has to do with the growing element of wellness that exists in the society. And we continue examining options of course as we said for this business, and we will make our decision by the end of the year. Charles E. Triano: Great. Thank you, Albert and Ian. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin : Thank you. I just have a couple questions. Ian, you guys have clearly been ahead of the industry in creating separate business units for reporting purposes, giving yourself optionality to spin if it made sense. And obviously it hadn't made sense, and we get that, and that's why you've decided to keep those businesses. But clearly with corporate simplification sweeping through the industry and companies clearly being rewarded for such actions, do you still feel that if conditions are right, do you believe that spinning off say the established business or the Essentials Health business is a positive, would be positive, would add value to your shareholders? Or do you believe that keeping a large company intact better serves your shareholders? That's my first question. And maybe, Albert, I'd love your take on that as well. And then, Frank, I had asked you this question on the last earnings call, not sure. The answer was what I think we were expecting to hear, but I'm going to give you a chance to answer it again. Assuming that you don't do a large mega deal, can you still drive bottom-line leverage post 2019, post your LOEs? Your margins are around 40%. Can they get to higher than that, 43%, 44%, 45%? I think on the last earnings call you were pretty definitive in saying no, but just want to make sure you understood my time horizon, which is beyond 2019. Thanks very much. Ian C. Read: Jami, thank you for the questions. So I undoubtedly believe that Pfizer has always organized itself in a way that was structurally prevalent for the market of that time and our objectives. I think this recent reorganization is around growth drivers. It does bring an element of simplification and I think it allows us to continue to evaluate our business segments to see if they're worth more inside Pfizer than outside of Pfizer. So we will continue to do that. We're very focused, have always been focused on shareholders return, not the size of the company. And so rest assured that we will, as these businesses continue to develop, look at opportunities to maximize their value. Albert do you want to add anything to that? Albert Bourla : Ian, you said it very well and the only thing that I will say is we're always examining options for our businesses. But right now the focus, particularly in the established business, is to stand it up as a successful emerging markets-based business. Ian C. Read: Right. Albert Bourla : And then all options are open once we do that. Ian C. Read: Good. Thank you. And, Frank, you want to answer Jami's beyond 2019 perspective. Frank A. D'Amelio: Yes. So, Jami, when I answered the question on the last call and I remember your question, I answered it for what I'll call the foreseeable future. And what I was thinking was really kind of through 2020 where we would see the impact of Lyrica, the Lyrica LOE. Beyond 2020, as we enter this period of growth, right, as we have this inflection point that we've talked about with LOEs declining materially, our in-line portfolio continuing to perform, our pipeline playing out in a positive way, then yes, we do have the ability to see leverage to the bottom line. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Frank. Thanks, Jami, for the question. Can we move on to the next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks very much. Just two questions. The first on Ibrance and just two parts here. First, U.S. growth appears to be flattening out. I think you talked about penetration in the 60s at this point. I guess, what can you do to drive further uptake in the market? And where do you think penetration can go over time on the U.S. side? The second part of the question is on the flip side, ex-U.S., seems like it's gaining momentum here. Maybe just update in terms of where we stand for penetration on the ex-U.S. core markets. The final question for Ian, talk a little bit more about the president's blueprint for reducing drug costs and potential changes to rebate structures. I know there's a lot of uncertainty of how this is going to play out. But how likely do you think it is that we're going to see changes to the current industry pricing structure? And how do you think about that and prepare for any changes from a Pfizer perspective? Thank you. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Chris. I'll let Albert discuss Ibrance and then I'll come back to your question on the evolving pricing and our market access situation in the U.S. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Ian. And Chris, again, thanks for your question. For Ibrance we are very, very pleased with the performance. We had 19% operational growth if you compare it to last quarter, the same quarter of last year and 10% sequentially versus the first quarter of this year. And let me start by addressing the international market, and I will go to the U.S. Very, very strong performance in international markets. The sales are up almost 125% and this is driven predominantly by volume. We had very strong uptake in all the European markets that we have launched and we have just launched in Japan and we see the same trends over there, very strong uptake of the brand. In fact, and important, I found it intriguing statistic it is that as of March, 96% of the total packs that were sold have been sold in the EU5, in the five European markets, were Ibrance. Although, over there the reimbursement didn't come with big disparities between us and competition. Now let's move into the U.S. In the U.S. the growth was 3% sequential versus the previous quarter. So obviously we have a deceleration here of the growth. The growth deceleration has nothing to do with us losing market share. Actually, our market share remains strong, remains stable and is actually a 10% increase. The deceleration has to do with the fact that the overall CDK market is decelerating because right now the low hanging fruit has been already been harvest and what remains, it is late adopters. They need more time to be convinced to prescribe the new class. We do believe though that the class will grow and we have strong evidence for that, the fact that when you see the overall survivor class in metastatic breast cancer, is in the 60s, as you mentioned, Chris. But if you see the new starts, it is already in the 70s, which means that we have a tendency to see over time we'll see the 60, 70. And what we do with that, we continue our D2C advertising. We continue to be able to communicate to the broad patient population about the benefits of CDK. But also we are working with currently prescribing physicians to increase usage and to increase the scripts that they progress. So growth in the U.S. I think in the short term will come from expanding the usage or the prescription habits of physicians already prescribing. But in the midterm of course, and this is by far the biggest growth opportunity, we are expecting to come into the earlier settings with a few pivotal studies currently running, as you know. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Albert. On the present blueprint, I mean we have submitted comments which I believe are public record. Pharma has submitted comments. Overall, we're very supportive of the blueprint. I think the president is trying to maintain a market-based system in the United States which is positive. Probably one of the largest changes, which I think would be overall positive for the industry, is the secretary's intention to remove the Safe Harbor for discounts so as to eliminate rebates. At the moment in time, about 40% of pharmaceutical prices are subsidies to the rest of the health care system. We realize some 58% of our list price. The rest goes to subsidize profitability of PBMs, insurance companies and frankly premiums for those that are healthy. This is not a sustainable position, and so removal of the rebates I believe will be very beneficial to patients and our industry, especially those companies who are launching, those companies who are launching new products over the next five years or so. With the removal of the rebates, we will remove the sort of what we call the rebate trap, whereby access is denied to innovative products because of a strong position of another product with its rebates. That example would be Xeljanz's slow penetration but steady into its market, given the situation of rebates of bigger competitors. I think the president is focused on improving through trade agreement the free riding that occurs on American consumers and research. He wants to promote value-driven healthcare by linking payments to performance. He's focusing on improving the efficacy of the FDA and I think that's going well so far. And he intends to reform the 340B program, which I believe is important. This is completely distorted compared to what congress had originally intended for that program. So overall, I suppose we see more focus on net prices, rebates going away and the blueprint being implemented, which is I believe is positive for patients and positive for innovative companies. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Ian. Next question please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Umer Raffat : Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. Ian, sorry I was just listening to your answer just now. Can you just clarify, do you expect U.S. to not have a rebate system anymore? And then also on that same note, if the price increases in future are limited to low single digits, do you think that impacts your expectation for mid-single digit top-line growth for the overall company? And a quick one on R&D if I may as well. One of the key trials for Ibrance, the PALLAS trial in adjuvant setting, can you confirm it has both low and medium risk patients along with the high-risk patients? And I ask because Novartis recently terminated a Phase 3 trial which had a hydrogenase mix of risk status across the trial. So I'm just curious if you think that introduces a layer of risk in that trial or not? Thank you. Ian C. Read: Okay. On the rebates, I do believe that the intention of the administration is to remove the Safe Harbor for rebates. Today, I would believe we're going to go to a marketplace where we don't have rebates. I don't know the speed of that, but I do believe the administration has been focused on that because that will reduce pharmaceutical prices at the point-of-sale and very positively by removing the 40% subsidy that goes to the rest of the healthcare system and putting it back on reducing pharmaceutical prices at the point-of-sale. So we will be focusing on net price increases and you would expect them to fluctuate around healthcare inflation. As new data comes available, you may see different value equations for products that in general are around health care inflation and I don't see that as any obstacle to us growing to middle to high single digits as our growth will be coming from innovative products creating new markets. So, and as I said before, I think the removal of the rebate trap will be advantageous to Xeljanz and be advantageous to our biosimilars programs. Would you like to answer the Ibrance question please, Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : Yeah. Thank you. With two large Phase 3 adjuvant early breast cancer trials, one is in registration, PALLAS has built intermediate and high-risk early breast cancer treatment duration up to two years. We also have the PENELOPE-B trial with high-risk adjuvant early breast cancer setting. We are very confident in our CDK and Ibrance leadership and I think the particular compelling part of Ibrance for adjuvant therapy which may be different to some other CDK is the great tolerability and the limited need for monitoring of liver EKG or difficult tolerability with G.I. So that really makes, I think, Ibrance a unique, attractive drug for a trial like PALLAS. We look forward to the outcome of that trial. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Mikael. Next question please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. So the first one I guess is for Ian and then one on the R&D side. So for Ian, just on the new structure, I'm curious regarding business development and if this new structure in any way impacts your views around how you would pursue deals? Specifically, are you looking for deals that might be more targeted to one of the three segments? Or could a larger, overarching deal still be something of interest? And then second question, more on the pipeline on the immunology side, you mentioned, I think you said, 10 unique programs in immunology but obviously it's a very competitive space now with a lot of players. So I'm wondering if you could maybe just frame the two or three opportunities maybe in the pipeline that you're most excited about out of all of the various kinases that you have in development and when we'll see some of the key data for those assets to help us better assess those opportunities. Thanks. Ian C. Read: Okay. Let me answer the structure as it relates to the type of deals and then Mikael will answer your questions on the pipeline, Vamil. So you know our view of BD hasn't changed much in the last couple of years. We view BD as an enabler of our strategy, not a strategy in itself, and our compass for any deal has always been generating value for Pfizer shareholders. Specifically, at this time, regarding a large or transformative deal, I don't believe we need such a deal to drive the growth of this company. I would be and I think our leadership team is united on this view, we'd be far better off focusing on developing our pipeline, investing in our pipeline, bringing these products to market, growing these products, than undertaking a large deal. A large deal is always available to us, but the chance of developing this pipeline is unique in this moment. It requires more research, more focus and as I say, any large deal is always available to a company with our balance sheet and size. So we would be looking at, if we were doing business development and we continue to look at the market for business development, more in single deals, things around late Phase 2, early Phase 3, something that can continue to boost our pipeline in sort of five-plus years. So that would be our focus right now. As I said, never say never, situations change, valuations change, but at this moment that is our thinking around BD and it links to this new structure with its focus on growth in all segments of the business. Mikael, would like to answer the question? Mikael Dolsten : Yeah. So thank you for your interest in the JAK franchise. And first, we think Pfizer is well positioned for sustained and growing leadership. We have Xeljanz now already used in three indications, RA, UC and PSA, and are conducting additional pivotal studies in ankylosing spondylitis. We have now 10 Phase 2 and 3 studies running with new generation of JAKs and five different NME JAK-related drugs in clinical studies. For the specific examples, JAK1 is in Phase 3 for atopic dermatitis. We are very excited about the JAK1 drug class, with rapid onset of action, with strong efficacy on eczema skin clearance and pruritus, itching, which has really the potential to be differentiated from the first marketed biological in atopic dermatitis. The second would be, we have a novel JAK that we'll present first-in-class data in alopecia areata later this fall. This has the possibility to be swiftly followed by a pivotal study, pending regulatory dialogues. This novel JAK represents a new treatment option possibility for alopecia and other autoimmune diseases with similar mechanisms such as impetigo. And we have three different assets in rheumatology in Phase 2 studies. Readouts from those will guide future potential pivotal study design. We're also planning to expand our presence in ulcerative colitis where we have Xeljanz and are running several studies in Crohn's disease with new generation of JAKs specifically tailored for such diseases. Charles E. Triano: Great. Thanks, Mikael. Next question, please, operator? Operator : Your next question comes from John Boris from SunTrust. John T. Boris: Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the results. Ian, since you did have an opportunity to speak with the president on pricing, did he indicate anything about the timing for implementation of the new plan on rebates? Is that something we'd see before the midterms or after the midterms? Second question has to do with the increase in R&D investment that Mikael was able to secure. What are the programs that you're going to be allocating that several hundred million dollars behind? And then third question has to do with gene therapy and your strategy behind your portfolio of gene therapy assets, most notably the Factor VIII/IX program and the neuroscience program in Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy. Can you articulate what your strategy there is in gene therapy? Do you want to grow that organically or potentially do some tuck-ins around that area? And do you have the adequate manufacturing capabilities to be able to produce enough product for the areas that you've targeted? Thanks. Ian C. Read: Hey, John. Thank you for the questions. My conversations with the president were centered around his blueprint and the actions he wants to take in those blueprints. I didn't obviously \u2013 you don't get definitive dates out of an administration. But I think I would say I see a huge sense of urgency on the part of the administration to act on the rebate part of the middlemen where they see that the subsidy that pharmaceuticals is delivering to the rest of the healthcare system is unsustainable and needs to be corrected. So I expect the administration to act on that with as much urgency as they can. With regard to the gene therapy, I mean we have made a substantial investment in manufacturing in gene therapy. The plan is, we'll come online within the next couple years, about $300 million to date. We've committed to that. We're committed to gene therapy. We have the gene therapy that Mikael had just mentioned. We would look to tuck-ins if they were available. That's part of our view on buying intellectual property that has within the next five years launch potential. And we're committed to this area and we think we have a strong franchise. We certainly are not going to buy gene therapy that we think is way overpriced, but we will buy gene therapy that we think has value. On the U.S. R&D, I'll really ask Mikael and Albert to comment on specific programs, but I would say that most of it is focused on ensuring that those 15 products get launched and in development spend. Albert, do you want to make a comment here? Albert Bourla : You're exactly right and that Mikael can give more details, but we are focused on new Phase 3 starts. We are focusing on the next generation pneumococcal vaccine that it is about to start. We are focusing on JAK1 atopic dermatitis Phase 3. That has already been started. We are focusing on starting Phase 3 studies with other JAKs right now. Mikael? In gene therapy that we just spoke, we are having three clinical programs that we are scaling up right now. Mikael Dolsten : I think you said it very well. We have a growing Phase 3 registration portfolio where all areas are contributing. Indeed, the pace of pipeline today is close to 100 clinical projects, of which more than 40%, 4-0, are in Phase 3 registration, and we're geared up to deliver up to 15 blockbuster potentials over the next five years as well as preparing for the next wave of even stronger productivity going from 2023 and onward. Thank you. Ian C. Read: Thanks, Mikael. Okay. I'd just add to that, that we also have trials that are extremely large in the vaccine, 20, where we're entering into Phase 3, and we tend to be very competitive there and also in our vaccine for (50:31) which is \u2013 and for C. diff. Now C. diff is a large trial. We are the leader in that category. One of our competitors withdrew from developing their products. This is a significant disease burden. We need to invest. We need to make sure we get to the events and expand the cohorts. So we're putting a lot of money into vaccine trials as well. Mikael Dolsten : And many Phase 3 are coming right now, so it's a good time for R&D pipeline. Charles E. Triano: Great. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets. Alex Arfaei : Great. Thank you very much. Ian, a follow-up on your comments on the administration's blueprint and planned changes to rebates. Obviously per your comments, under the current structure there are billions of dollars at stake and probably thousands of jobs, so there will be pushback to this. I'm just wondering, are you still confident that the administration will pursue this with urgency? And also, do you believe the changes will be limited to the government business or will it also extend to the commercial side as well? Then a follow-up on tanezumab, if I may. You're obviously looking at rapidly progressing OA in a much more systematic way than you did in the prior trials. So given that, are you using the same definition for RPOA? And given the methodology differences, is it appropriate to compare the rates in the new trial to the prior trials? Thank you very much. Ian C. Read: Thank you. Look, you know, reform of systems is unpredictable. I believe that the administration is focused on rebate reform. I believe that initially their reforms will be focused on the public sector where they have the authority to take the rebates out of the Safe Harbor, but I believe that will extend to the commercial business very, very quickly as I can't really see a bifurcated system where half the system is on net price and the other is on a rebate. It's just the transparency won't allow that. So I would see rebates going away and the system accommodating itself to negotiations on value and net price. But as I said, this is a political decision, and you have one person's view and we'll have to see. But I do think it's a priority for the administration. Mikael, would you want to talk about Phase 1? Mikael Dolsten : Yeah. Thank you. First, I just wanted to say that we are really pleased with the readout of the recent tanezumab OA 1056 study which showed positive outcomes for tanezumab compared to placebo in all three primary, co-primary or pain physical function in patients' global assessment. And the drug was well-tolerated in general with less than 1% patient discontinuing therapy. Now concerning rapidly progressing away, despite this, OA study was conducted in a more advanced patient population were patients have already failed other therapies. The rate of RPOA rapidly progressing away in the treatment group was less than 1.5%, which we think is a similar ballpark back run rate to what's been seen in other large OA studies. The decent profile of tanezumab will be partly supported by the readouts next year, and overall we believe that tanezumab has the potential to offer a valuable treatment alternative for pain patients that are currently poorly managed by a variety of treatment alternatives, such as opioids and NSAIDs. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Mikael. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi. Andrew S. Baum: Thank you. Just one question please. The culture and cost base of an optimal established product business I would imagine is very different from a business which is buried within its pharma company. To what extent do you think the restructure could realize significant improvement of the cost structures, whether it's optimizing the growth? And then beading on from that, would you be giving guidance for each of the individual business units, revenue and/or EBIT? Thank you. Ian C. Read: We will not be giving guidance for the individual units. We'll be giving guidance for the stock ticker of Pfizer. But I believe this is about more about getting the right focus and the right management and positioning our headquarters of this new BU or positioning the leader that's that way in China. I think it will lead to simplification, will lead to savings in our expense base. But that is not a primary motivation for doing this. It's more about getting focus of management around key sectors. Albert, would you like to add to that? Albert Bourla : I think you said it very well, Ian. And I would add that indeed it is different, the cost structure of a business in aggregate. It is not likely innovative, but just heavy in R&D. That business will not. But also it's not like a generic business, because this is business. It is a growing in the emerging markets business, where it has significant field force presence, and this is how we are driving our growth. And this is why I think we have a competitive advantage to be able to lead in that space, exactly because we are very well entrenched into the physicians and the prescription base of these markets. Frank A. D'Amelio: The only thing I would add is that it's a business where we've taken significant savings already. Charles E. Triano: Thank you. And thanks, Andrew, for the question. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Louise Chen from Cantor. Louise Chen : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I had a few on your pipeline. So first on tanezumab, could you comment on what you think the approvability of your drug would be despite some of the safety concerns? And then secondly on tafamidis, just curious how you distinguish your product from others that are potentially in development. And then the last one is just on the JAKs, the alopecia areata opportunity, could you size what that market opportunity might be and what you think the right pathways are for a JAK product to deal with alopecia areata? Thanks. Ian C. Read: Okay. Why don't we have Albert talk about the size of the market for alopecia areata and then we'll have pipeline answers by Mikael. Albert Bourla : We think it is a significant market, because this is a market that is that it is extremely emotional for people. We've done extensive market research with patients. And one of the things that it was very indicative for me, it is in our clinical studies. We are enrolling faster than anything I have seen so far, which is an indication of how much patients they consider what a very big medical need. With that I will ask Mikael to comment on all the R&D questions. Mikael Dolsten : Yeah. First on tanezumab, I'm real excited about the way forward for tanezumab supported by the positive primary endpoint that I spoke to in the doses we have selected, the convenient substitute cutaneous administration and good tolerability. Of course, all approvals are pending final readout and regulatory dialogues, but what makes me excited is that there is a real scarcity in new pain drug classes and pain patients, which has a real impact on the life quality needs new drug classes. And you are obviously aware of the challenge we have as a nation with extended and excess use of opioids. And tanezumab offers for patients that are not eligible or well tolerating or willing to take opioids, or progress on opioids, NSAIDs, are really I think attractive alternative. And we look forward to detail the benefit risk profile as all studies read out next year. Ian C. Read: So, Louise, just adding to Mikael's and my detail on those comments, I do think we see the alopecia areata and the clinical indications around that mechanism of action to be a blockbuster status. So where I can do forecasts, I would consider that to be a blockbuster. And I just want to correct something on the gene therapy plant, it'll be ready to produce at industrial scale in early 2019. Mikael Dolsten : Thank you, Ian. And finally on tafamidis, what is distinct in that trial, Albert alluded to earlier that we are studying the cardiomyopathy indication which has the majority of patients wild-type excess production of TTR and a smaller proportion of patients are mutant. We have recorded a really great tolerability profile and we'll share that outcome in more details of what was a positive study including all-cause mortality and severe related hospitalization. But to the very best of my knowledge, this is the only pivotal study available that have outcome data and includes the most prominent patient population, the wild-type. To run such a study takes more than four years, so we think that tafamidis will have an opportunity pending regulatory dialogue, to be a real first-in-class drug for severe patient needs and Albert spoke to how we hope to grow the diagnostic rate and lead indication of patients and have likelihood to be the only drug for many years that have such a study on this patient group with real hard endpoints. Charles E. Triano: All right. Thanks, Mikael. Thanks, Louise, for the question. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Dave Risinger from Morgan Stanley. David R. Risinger: Yes. Thank you. So I have two questions. Ian, if you could just help us better understand how the U.S. pricing system might evolve. Currently, the largest percentage of the U.S. drug market is the commercial market which is employer driven, private coverage where the employers and the insurers dictate patient co-pays, et cetera. So, I was hoping that you might be able to help us better understand HHS initiatives to impact rebates in the private sector for out-of-pocket costs in the private sector since that's the majority of the market and the majority of profits for the industry. And then second, with respect to the reorg, are there cost efficiency opportunities? Maybe, Frank, you could comment on whether this yields cost-efficiency opportunities at all to help offset the Lyrica patent cliff pressure starting next year? Thank you. Ian C. Read: Well, thank you for the question, Dave. U.S. pricing, I accept that it's companies, that companies and PBMs that set the co-pays and set the structure by which commercial companies pay, there's a system that's opaque in many ways to the end user and to the payer for that matter. So I think that if you have the public sector with clarity on what net price is, then I think you'll see that the private sector will not ignore the net prices that are occurring in the public sector, so I think it will effectively force transparency into the private sector as well. And I would see a situation where patients are paying their co-pays and their coinsurance over net price and not list price, and so I think it's very positive for the health of the pharmaceutical market. Of course, you may see that rebates in the commercial sector hold on for longer than we expect and we'll have to see exactly how the administration does in fact take away the rebates in the public sector, so there's a lot of uncertainty. So what you're getting is basically a simplified view from my perspective of saying that if the administration is determined to take rebates out and they can act in the public sector, I would expect that transparency to push the private sector to remove rebates and would be pricing over net price. So I think it's very positive for the pharmaceutical industry and for patients. Frank A. D'Amelio: So, Dave, on your question about the reorg and potential cost efficiency opportunities, the way we think about this, the way I think about this is whenever there's a reorganization like this, it gives us an opportunity to review our processes, to review our operations, and in particular to see if there's opportunities to simplify what we do, how we do it. So yeah, I think there's clearly some opportunities to simplify parts of the business. That simplification could generate some synergies, but our current thinking is we would take those synergies and reinvest those and in particular in areas where we could double down and accelerate on our pipeline to get those products that everyone's been talking to, to market as fast as possible. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Frank. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason Gerberry from Bank of America. Jason M. Gerberry: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Two questions for me, just first on tafamidis, one of the pushbacks we get from investors is, can Pfizer launch a drug in rare orphan disease and really build the market out just based on limited track record. So my question to you is, as we think about this market that's largely driven by patients with wild-type cardiomyopathy, just trying to understand. My understanding is the only non-invasive diagnostic is an imaging technique that's not really widely used amongst cardiologists. So can you just talk about, do you just think a new drug drives awareness and that imaging technique would, I don't know, gain broader utilization? Or just how do you ultimately envision the treatment rate expanding? And then a quick one just on Xeljanz, 2019 formulary negotiations, I imagine you guys have some view there. With the Lilly product coming in at a bigger discount, I'm just kind of curious if you're anticipating any impact from a gross-to-net perspective assuming the current system holds next year. Thanks. Ian C. Read: Well on Xeljanz, I think our marketplace is clearly replacing injectable TNF factors and that would be the structure of the pricing. I don't think we're going to be particularly concerned about the pricing of a product that comes in with a, what I would classify as not as strong a label as Xeljanz. So I think we'll leave it at that on that one. And then other question was, Mikael, on tafamidis? Mikael Dolsten : Yeah, thank you very much. I think although TTR cardiomyopathy is a rare disease and we spoke about the opportunity to really support early diagnosis of more and more patients, we need to recognize, it is often ending up being managed by cardiologists. And of course, that's a patient and customer group, the cardiologists, where we have years and years of experience and are likely one of the leaders in having the right dialogues and ways to communicate and influence with information of relevance. Specifically, there are non-invasive scintigraphy techniques that can define the amyloidosis of the heart related to TTR. We are working on algorithms that can help to increase probability that someone has TTR cardiomyopathy and not heart failure and vice versa. And we think combination of improved trials in the clinic scintigraphy and also just by offsets in the scin that proves the position of amyloid will be increasingly common and simple ways to increase diagnosis. And of course, as Albert spoke, as there is a drug, there is an incentive to increase awareness, diagnostic rate and we look really forward to work with physicians and patients to make a drug like this, pending regulatory dialogues, a potential new treatment alternative that may change the lives of many of those patients that today have a very limited life expectancy. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Mikael, and operator, if we could take our last question please. Operator : Your final question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Geoff Meacham : Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Ian or Albert, you guys have a lot of new product cycles coming in Innovative that should drive growth. I know you've said a spinoff of Essential isn't a strategic priority, but does a more aggressive pace of divesting later cycle or say underperforming franchises make sense? I'm just thinking about what you can do to drive faster growth that may involve shrinking the revenue base. And then for Mikael, for talazoparib, the PARP class has been less dynamic for investors than originally thought. Maybe you can speak to how you view differentiation and how aggressive you could be when looking at combinations in I-O? And is this a strategic priority for you guys? Thank you. Ian C. Read: So, Geoff, thank you for the questions. I think what we said was that the previous construct we didn't believe would produce value, the optionality construct we had previously that we were reorganizing around growth factors, that our priority was standing up the new construct of the established products unit with a leader working out of China and that we would continue to look at all alternatives to maximize value, all our different business units to Pfizer. So I hope that answers your question on that and, Mikael, would you like to discuss the other issues? Mikael Dolsten : We are increasingly excited about the opportunity with talazoparib. It's a really potent PARP inhibitor, and we think it's a unique way of binding and trap the DNA process of replication. May play out as we learn more of it in the clinic to the higher end of efficacy in this drug class and that's really what we are keeping an eye on. Specifically, we think we also have some unique trials that are based on drug combinations that we have initiated. We have a tissue-agnostic study, EMBRACA, in then mutated cancers across many solid tumors which can be a really pioneering approach for patients that have these mutations and allow, in a tissue-agnostic manner, patients to get a combination of talazoparib and avelumab. It's really based upon that such patients are likely to respond stronger to I-O plus PARP blockade. We also initiated very recently avelumab/talazoparib ovarian front-line in high-risk patient Phase 3 study which we think has a unique design and it's a tumor that is likely to have potential to respond to both of these agents in a favorable manner. We really look forward to that study. And finally, you may know, we have Xtandi and talazoparib combination in DDR positive castration-resistant prostate cancer. So we're building up a quite leading focus, talazoparib portfolio of indications and near-term of course, that EMBRACA data for breast cancer patients with the BRCA mutations have an action date for potential approval December this year. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Mikael, and thanks to everybody on the call today for your attention. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Pfizer second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to Pfizer's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Charles E. Triano: Good morning and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer's third quarter 2018 performance. I'm joined today by our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Albert Bourla, our Chief Operating Officer; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Angela Hwang, Group President, Pfizer Essential Health; John Young, Group President, Pfizer Innovative Health; and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel. The slides that will be presented on this call can be viewed on our website, pfizer.com/investors. Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussion during this call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information regarding these factors is discussed under the Disclosure Notice section in the earnings press release we issued this morning as well as in Pfizer's 2017 annual report on Form 10-K. The forward-looking statements during this call speak only as of the original date of this call. And we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements. During our call, we will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's Form 8-K dated today, October 30, 2018. Any non-GAAP measures presented are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for financial measures required by U.S. GAAP, have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP, and may not be comparable to the calculations of similar measures at other companies. Ian, Albert, and Frank will now make prepared remarks, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian? Ian C. Read: Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. During my remarks, I will discuss the progress we are making within each of our businesses and the latest advancements within our R&D pipeline. I will then ask Albert to discuss some of the steps we are taking to prepare the company to accelerate top line growth in the future. In the third quarter, total company revenues were up 2% operationally, driven by a continued strength of key brands, biosimilars, and emerging markets. These growth drivers were partially offset by the loss of exclusivity of Viagra in the U.S. in December 2017, a decline in U.S. Legacy Established Products, driven by industry-wide pricing challenges, as well as product supply shortages and associated inventory reduction related to our legacy Hospira products. I'll begin with a few words about each of our businesses, starting with Pfizer Innovative Health. This business had another solid quarter, growing its top line 5% operationally, thanks to the continued strength of several of our biggest selling medicines. We remain very pleased with the performance of Ibrance, which has solidified its leadership position in the CDK 4/6 inhibitor class in the U.S., holding at just under a 90% share in terms of new prescription volume. Our current growth driver for Ibrance remains the international markets, particularly across Europe and Japan. And we had another quarter of solid growth there. For Xtandi, alliance revenues in the U.S. were up 5% over the second quarter and a 20% year-over-year growth. We are seeing an increased number of urologists prescribing it. There are positive early indicators with our PROSPER launch in the U.S. following the July approval, which made Xtandi the first and only FDA approved oral medication for both nonmetastatic and metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. And the European Commission has very recently approved Xtandi for the treatment of adult men with high risk nonmetastatic castration resistant prostate cancer, based on the PROSPER study data. Eliquis continues to perform well. Pfizer's revenues for Eliquis were up 36% operationally to nearly $900 million. And it continues to maintain a strong leadership position in the NOAC class. Eliquis also overtook wore Warfarin to become the number one in OAC total brand, total prescription share in the U.S. Xeljanz also continues to perform well with revenue up 26% operationally. This was bolstered by continued growth in rheumatoid arthritis revenues and some early contributions from the drug's recent expansion into psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis. Xeljanz scripts were up 31% compared with the third quarter of 2017. The main reason for the disconnect this quarter between volume growth and revenue growth in the U.S. market is that higher prescription demand was partially offset by a one-time year-to-date true-up in the quarter for access payments with one customer. Sales of Prevnar 13 were up 12% in the U.S., largely due to the timing of government purchases. Sales were up 14% operationally in the emerging markets, driven by growth in the pediatric business, strong Gavi performance, and the 2017 launch in China. Finally, our Consumer Healthcare business posted strong growth internationally, while U.S. revenues were down slightly due to the LOE impact of Nexium 24HR, we continue to review options and expect a decision regarding strategic alternatives for this business will be made by the end of the calendar year. Turning now to Pfizer Essential Health. We once again saw strong operational growth in emerging markets and in biosimilars. Overall, Essential Health revenues for the quarter declined, however, due in large part to the ongoing product supply shortages in the sterile injectable business, continuing product LOEs, namely Lyrica in developed Europe, and a decline in the Legacy Established Products portfolio in developed markets. Emerging markets revenue within the Essential Health business grew 11% operationally for the quarter, primarily reflecting growth across the Legacy Established Products and sterile injectable pharmaceuticals portfolio in China. Revenues from our biosimilars business grew 46% operationally in developed markets during the quarter, driven primarily by continued growth for Inflectra in certain U.S. channels as well as in developed Europe. We continue to bring new biosimilars to the market and began shipping Nivestim, a biosimilar to Neupogen. to wholesalers in the U.S. at the end of September. In our U.S. sterile injectables business, manufacturing supply constraints continue to impact our top line. We expect these issues to be significantly improved by the end of 2019. And we continue to expect this business to be a solid growth contributor in the future. We continue to strengthen and advance our R&D pipeline. Let me touch on some of our more promising recent developments. In Rare Diseases, our tafamidis Phase 3 ATTR-ACT study results were very positive. The data showed that tafamidis significantly reduced a combination of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations in patients with ATTR-CM. Given the nature of this disease, the exact prevalence is currently unknown, though we estimate less than 1% of the patients have been diagnosed. There currently are no approved treatments for ATTR-CM, making it a tremendously underserved market. Tafamidis holds the fast track and breakthrough therapy designations. And we plan a rolling submission for ATTR-CM with a formal NDA being submitted during the current quarter. In Internal Medicine, along with our partners Eli Lilly, recently presented positive results for our tanezumab Study 1056 at the American College of Rheumatology Annual Meeting. This was the first readout of the tanezumab global clinical development program. Additional Phase 3 readouts, which will more fully characterize tanezumab's clinical profile, are expected in the first half of 2019. In Oncology, the FDA recently approved two of our innovative medicines. In September, we received approval for Vizimpro, or dacomitinib, for first line treatment of patients with EGFR mutated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Earlier this month, we received approval for Talzenna, or talazoparib, for the treatment of the most common types of a rare-to-treat breast cancer. Two other Oncology candidates, lorlatinib and glasdegib, are under priority review with the FDA. We expect to receive decisions for both before the end of the year. We also recently presented at ESMO Phase 3 data for Bavencio plus Inlyta for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. We're excited about this potential opportunity. And we've been discussing these interim results with regulators to determine an appropriate path forward. We are also encouraged by other recent data reinforcing Inlyta as the TKI of choice in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor for this condition. In Inflammation and Immunology, two of our JAK inhibitors have received breakthrough designations this year, our JAK1 inhibitor for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis and our JAK3 inhibitor for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe alopecia areata, an immune disease that currently has no approved treatments. The JAK1 candidate is now being studied across four Phase 3 trials that are actively recruiting. The JAK3 candidate has been advanced to Phase 2b/3 trial, which will start in the upcoming months for alopecia areata. In Vaccines, we announced in September that our 20-valiant pneumococcal conjugate vaccine candidate has received breakthrough therapy designation from the U.S.A. FDA. We expect to start Phase 3 trials in a few months. Our Phase 3 Clover study in C. Difficile continues to enroll ahead of schedule and is now 88% enrolled with more than 14,000 subjects. We believe we remain positioned to have a potential first-in-class vaccine for this infection. We are advancing a Phase 2 tetravalent vaccine candidate for Staphylococcus aureus with fast track designation. And we are in discussions with the FDA to potentially expand the study to become a Phase 3 pivotal study. Overall, we continue to see the potential for approximately 25 to 30 approvals through 2022, of which up to half have the potential to be blockbusters. We're also working to ensure these medicines will be launched in an environment where they can help the maximum number of people who need them. We continue to work with the President on his blueprint for strengthening the health care system, providing more access, and relieving the burden on patients at the point of sale. For example, we recently responded to the administration's request for information on reviving the competitive acquisition program in Medicare Part B. We are supportive of developing a market-based alternative to the current buy and bill system, one that includes voluntary participation by physicians and robust competition facilitated by many vendors, not just one or two PDMs (13:07). In summary, we continue to deliver on our strategy and believe we remain well positioned to deliver new medicines for patients, prepare the company for accelerated growth in the future, and create enhanced shareholder value. In fact, we have continued to repurchase our shares over the past few months, as we believe our shares remain undervalued. Earlier this month, we announced that Albert Bourla will succeed me as CEO on January 1. Albert's extensive knowledge of our business, firm grasp of the issues, and deep caring for patients will help Pfizer continue to build on the outstanding foundations we have put in place. And I am confident that he is putting in place a structure and leadership team that will maximize the company's growth opportunities. Now I will turn it over to Albert, who will share some thoughts about what he will be focusing on when he assumes the role of CEO. Albert? Albert Bourla : Thank you, Ian, and good morning, everyone. After prolonged periods of revenue decline and then stability, due to significant and unprecedented loss of exclusivity impacts, Pfizer is preparing for what we expect to be an era of sustained growth, following the impact of the Lyrica LOE that will negatively impact our growth in the next two years. We now have a wide range of opportunities to continue to grow our core brands and a strong, deep R&D pipeline that has become a competitive advantage. Taken together, this provides us with important breadth both in terms of in-market and future opportunities. We are working quickly to make the natural adjustments that are needed when a company pivots to grow. And we have already begun this evolution. As you know, back in the summer we announced that we will be organizing the company into three businesses. We believe each will be well positioned to take advantage of new growth opportunities, driven by the evolving and unique dynamics of their individual markets. Our science-based Innovative Medicines business will be our primary and most substantial business. We believe our growth prospects in this segment are strong. And Pfizer is well positioned to deliver several potential new breakthrough innovative medicines in the next five years. In order to maximize this unique opportunity, we need to make the right capital allocation decisions to drive both scientific and commercial innovation. As our pipeline matures, with the progression of current and the initiation of new pivotal trials, we will need to increase our R&D investments. And as our pipeline potentially delivers new commercialization opportunities, we will need to increase our investments in new market creation activities. To partially offset these incremental cost increases, we will generate cost reduction opportunities, particularly in indirect SI&A. We are taking steps to simplify the organization, increase spans of control, and reduce organizational layers. By doing so, we expect not only to generate partially offsetting savings, but, more importantly, to reduce bureaucracy and expedite decision making. We believe that our Established Medicines business, which will include the majority of our off-patent solid oral dose legacy brands, has the potential to generate sustainable modest revenue growth. Urbanization in emerging markets, particularly in Asia, is creating additional access opportunities for these medicines for hundreds of millions of people. As the leading pharmaceutical company in Asia, and particularly in China, we believe we are well positioned to be a leader in this significant and rapidly growing market. We currently are focused on standing up this organization, enhancing its autonomy, and positioning to operate as a true stand-alone division within Pfizer. Finally, with an increasing focus on healthy living, patients are seeking wellness and prevention solutions that are easier to access over the counter. With a strong portfolio of global brands that span health and wellness, our Consumer Healthcare business is well positioned to continue its growth. As Ian said, we continue exploring options for this business, and we expect to make a decision by year-end. Earlier this month, we announced changes to the executive leadership team. These adjustments were designed to create a more effective structure that further strengthens our ability to deliver important medicines and vaccines to patients. As a result of a smooth and very thoughtful succession process, when we transition leadership on January 1, we will have in place a clear strategy, a new organization, and a strong executive team. Today, we believe that we have the best pipeline in our history. To ensure we capitalize this incredible opportunity, we must remain highly focused on successful execution. In this context, I would reiterate that we continue not to see the need for any large-scale M&A activity at this time. Under Ian's leadership, we have set the right course. As a result, we have an opportunity over the next 5 to 10 years to have a profound impact on patients and global health, with the benefits of this impact extending to shareholders and other stakeholders. I look forward to working with my mentor Ian in his new capacity as Executive Chairman, with the board, and with my leadership team to lead Pfizer in this new era and, of course, to working more closely with all of you in my new role. Now I will turn it over to Frank to provide details on the quarterly financials and our financial outlook for 2018. Frank A. D'Amelio: Thanks, Albert. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I'm going to be reviewing today are included in our webcast. Now moving on to the financials. Third quarter 2018 revenues were approximately $13.3 billion, which reflects operational growth of $243 million or 2%, and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, $113 million or 1%. Our Innovative Health business recorded 5% operational revenue growth in the third quarter, driven primarily by Eliquis and Xeljanz globally, Ibrance in international markets, and Prevnar 13 and Xtandi in the U.S., all of which were partially offset by the loss of exclusivity of Viagra in the U.S. in December of 2017 and decreased revenues for Enbrel in most developed Europe markets, mainly due to continued biosimilar competition. Revenues for our Essential Health business in the third quarter decreased 4% operationally, primarily due to a 14% operational decline in Legacy Established Products portfolio in developed markets, driven by industry-wide pricing challenges in the U.S. and generic competition, and a 9% operational decline in the sterile injectables portfolio in developed markets, primarily due to continued legacy Hospira product shortages in the U.S., all of which were partially offset mainly by the inclusion of Viagra revenues in the U.S. and Canada, 11% operational growth in emerging markets, primarily reflecting growth in the Legacy Established Products and sterile injectables portfolios in China, and a 46% operational growth in biosimilars in developed markets, mainly driven by Inflectra in certain channels in the U.S. and in developed Europe. Third quarter reported diluted EPS was $0.69, compared with $0.47 in the year-ago quarter, primarily due to a lower effective tax rate, higher other income, and higher revenues. Adjusted diluted EPS for the third quarter was $0.78 versus $0.67 in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to a lower effective tax rate, higher revenues, higher other income, and foreign exchange. I want to point out that diluted weighted average shares outstanding declined by 54 million shares versus the year-ago quarter, due primarily to our ongoing share repurchase program, reflecting the impact of shares repurchased during 2018, partially offset by dilution related to share-based employee compensation programs. As I previously mentioned, foreign exchange negatively impacted third quarter 2018 revenues by approximately $113 million and positively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses, and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $236 million. As a result, foreign exchange favorably impacted third quarter 2018 adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.01 versus the year-ago quarter. As you can see, we narrowed our 2018 revenue guidance range to $53 billion to $53.7 billion, reducing the midpoint by $650 million, which was largely related to lower-than-anticipated Essential Health revenues, primarily due to continued legacy Hospira sterile injectable product shortages in the U.S. and recent unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates. In addition, we now expect adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues to be in the range of 20.8% to 21.3%, adjusted SI&A expenses to be in the range of $14 billion to $14.5 billion, adjusted other income to be approximately $1.3 billion, and the adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.98 to $3.02 per share, the midpoint of which hasn't changed, implying 13% growth year over year. This guidance assumes anticipated share repurchases of approximately $12 billion in 2018, of which $9 billion has been completed to date. As of today, we have $7.4 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. Our 2018 guidance for R&D expenses and effective tax rate on adjusted income did not change. We continue to expect R&D expenses to be in the range of $7.7 billion and $8.1 billion, and the effective tax rate to be approximately 16%. Turning to other income, I'd like to provide some additional commentary. First, the increase in guidance was mainly due to two factors, increased income from collaborations, licensing agreements, and milestone payments; and to a lesser extent, further realized gains on equity securities through the end of the third quarter 2018. It's important to note that other income will continue to be highly variable this year because of the new mark-to-market accounting changes for potential gains and losses on our equity ownership of ICU Medical and Allergene (25:11). I also want to remind you that our current guidance for other income does not include a forecast for any further potential changes in value for our unrealized gains and losses on equity investments for the remainder of the year. Looking forward to 2019, I want to give you the core components of other income deductions that we could reasonably estimate at this time to provide an anticipated baseline prior to the inclusion of newer one-time factors, such as market-to-market gains or losses. Interest expense of approximately $1.5 billion, interest income of approximately $300 million, pension credit and other items of approximately $500 million, and royalty income from products such as Xtandi, neratinib and Prezista, as well as dividend income from our ViiV partnership, which are running at a combined annual rate of approximately $700 million. At this point, the puts and takes of these core components net to a roughly flat starting point for 2019 versus our original expectations of $400 million for 2018. As has been our practice, we will provide our 2019 annual guidance in conjunction with our fourth quarter financial results. Moving on to key takeaways. We delivered solid financial results in the third quarter of 2018 with 2% operational revenue growth and a 16% increase in adjusted diluted EPS versus the prior-year quarter. We updated and narrowed certain components of our 2018 financial guidance. The midpoint of our adjusted diluted EPS range has not changed. We accomplished several key product and pipeline milestones. We returned $15 billion to shareholders as of October 30, 2018, through dividends and share repurchases. And we expect to return approximately $20 billion directly to shareholders this year. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2018 and beyond. Now I'll turn it back to Chuck. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Frank. Operator, at this point can we please poll for questions? Operator : Your first question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO. Alex Arfaei : Oh, great. Thank you very much. Folks, you've now repeatedly mentioned steady growth prospects after 2020. I think you have characterized it as mid-single digits growth on the revenue side. What are the key growth drivers of that from your perspective? And I'm specifically interested in the ones that you think are not well appreciated by the Street, given your stock's current strong performance. And then on tafamidis, our research suggests that we're starting to see more centers using this new nonbiopsy test for diagnosing patients. Given that reimbursement doesn't seem to be a barrier, I'm just wondering what are your expectations about potential improvement in the diagnosis rate? Do you see it as gradually improvement or \u2013 improving, or could we actually see a step-wise increase, given that doctors have a very good reason to actually identify these patients now? Thank you. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Alex. I'll ask Albert to answer the question on the growth drivers post-2020. And then perhaps John will answer the question on tafamidis. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Alex. And as you know, beginning of the new financial year we have reorganized our company into three distinct business units, and each one of them has distinct growth drivers. So let me give you some idea of them. In our primary and fundamental Innovative Medicines business, it is very clear that the driving forces are an aging population and our introduction of significant innovation. We have, as you know, 15 potential blockbusters in five years. And they are \u2013 the ones that excite me the most, if I can pick just a few examples, we do have in Xtandi already launched the PROSPER and are expecting to present result for ARCHES, and which is another metastatic setting. We are very excited in immuno-oncology with our combinations with Inlyta and Bavencio. We are excited that we have launched, or we are expected to launch, four new molecular entities by the end of the year in oncology. Although they are smaller in size collectively, they inform (29:43) a blockbuster. In our vaccines, we are very excited to continue working on Staph. aureus and our Clostridium difficile vaccines, as well as our next generation pneumococcal vaccines. In inflammation, we have launched new indications for Xeljanz, particularly I think exciting, it is the UC indication that we have just launched. And we have pivotal studies that are running in what I think is one of the best JAK portfolio in the industry. And of course, in the rare diseases, we are about to launch tafamidis. And in internal medicines we will hopefully launch, pending the data, tanezumab. So as you can see, there is significant of strength to drive the growth in this type of a business. When it comes to the Established Medicines business, over there also we believe that we can have sustainable, modest low growth, but the drivers are very different over urbanization. At this time, right now, you see we have already 24% growth in China. This means $700 million we have generated more or less in nine months. So the growth potential over there is substantial. And we will continue investing, particularly by relocating our management team and providing autonomy to this business to operate from China. And last but not least, our Consumer business will continue growing based on the trends that existed with consumers. Ian C. Read: John? Thank you, Albert. John D. Young: Thanks for the question, Alex. So let me just say we're obviously very excited about the opportunity that Vyndaqel presents to help patients. And the process of educating cardiologists on our data is underway. ATTR-CM is significantly underdiagnosed. There's only about 1% of cases today detected prior to death. So it's a highly underdiagnosed disease. Given that there are no approved treatment options today, the education of physicians and patients on what we would think of as red-flag symptoms and availability of the treatment itself will obviously play a big role improving disease awareness. And changes to treatment guidelines should also drive utilization over time. To your point, diagnosing ATTR-CM has evolved significantly in recent years. Patients previously required a biopsy to confirm diagnosis. But now it's become much easier to diagnose patients using a non-invasive imaging technology called scintigraphy. There are around about 15,000 machines and 32 centers of excellence in the U.S. already using this technology. Training is not burdensome. And that is going to be a real focus of our activities as we bring this medicine to patients and to physicians sometime next year. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, John. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Hi. Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. So first one I guess is for Ian and Albert. Congrats, Albert, by the way on the new appointment. So the last quarter, Ian, you had mentioned you believed the administration has the intention of removing safe harbor for rebates. And that we're moving to a marketplace where we won't have rebates over time. Over the last few weeks and months it feels like more of the commentary has been focused on potentially point of sale rebates and also obviously the reform around Part B. So I'm just wondering if you remain as confident as you were three months ago on the U.S. moving away from a system that's based on rebates? And then my second question is just on Ibrance. And I know there's a lot of excitement and potential around the adjuvant opportunity if we look out a few years. But the growth in the midterm I think could be a little bit more challenging. So I'm just wondering if you can give us some perspective on what's going to drive that product over the next couple years before we get the additional data in the adjuvant setting. Thanks so much. Ian C. Read: Well, thank you, Vamil. I mean I think we're still waiting the guidance to come out from Secretary [Alex] Azar on the rebate situation. I do believe it continues to be a point of interest for the administration. It is the most effective way that the administration can lower prices for patients at the point of purchase. I mean, discounts at the point of sale are also effective. They achieve the same thing. The mechanisms of achieving this lowering of prices for the patient could be varied. I still think the administration is focused on that. The new Part B rule, or the new part \u2013 suggested rule in Part B is \u2013 I don't think it's in the best interest of patients to effectively enforce price controls from abroad into the U.S. And would hope that the administration would reconsider its position on that. And in general, I still expect to see activity between now and the end of the year on rebates. With that, I'll pass it over to John to talk about Ibrance. John D. Young: Okay. Thanks for the question, Vamil. So in terms of the growth trajectory for Ibrance, we have always viewed it as having three main phases. Phase 1 was obviously the U.S. launch and maximizing the market opportunity there. Since launch in the U.S., we have entrenched Ibrance as the new standard of care. We've treated over 90,000 patients. So significant progress in the U.S. Phase 2 has obviously been the international launch with particular focus in Europe and Japan. And I'm very pleased with the progress that we've made here since establishing reimbursement in the E.U. last year. Over 69,000 patients have already been prescribed Ibrance. And we continue to view that as being a growth driver for Ibrance over the years ahead. The third phase to your point is yet to come, and that really represents the adjuvant or early breast cancer opportunity. And that could address a population roughly double the size of the current metastatic population. We're still a few years away from potentially entering this phase of growth, should our clinical trials be successful. But we are very excited and positive about the opportunity that that potentially represents for Ibrance in its life cycle. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, John. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks so much for the questions. Just my first one was, based on some of the investment needs you highlighted in the opening comments, should we be thinking about margin erosion for Pfizer in 2019 and 2020 as Lyrica goes away? Or could some of those cost cuts offset those pressures? And then maybe longer term, is it fair to think about operating margin expansion returning in 2021 and beyond? My second question was just on a higher level. Can you talk a little bit about the growth of both your sterile injectable and biosimilar businesses going forward, as we think about those moving over into the Innovative portfolio going forward? Thank you. Ian C. Read: Okay. Thank you, Chris. I'll ask Frank to address the margin question. And then Angela to talk about the growth prospects of sterile injectables and biosimilars. Frank A. D'Amelio: So, Chris, on the operating margin going forward, the way to think about this is, once we clear the Lyrica LOE, so think about that as the base year being 2020 when we get the full year effect of Lyrica LOE, beyond that we clearly believe there's an opportunity to expand our margins. We've talked about at that point the revenue growth in the mid-single digits. And ultimately, we've been able to demonstrate over the years, we grow the top line X, we'll grow the bottom line more than X. So from my perspective, once we get past the Lyrica LOE, clear opportunity to expand our margin performance in the P&L. Between now and then, clearly with the Lyrica LOE, we'll have to work our way through this. We'll give guidance for 2019 on our next call relative to the specifics by line item. But beyond the Lyrica LOE, clearly we're optimistic about our ability to expand margins. Ian C. Read: Angela, please. Angela Hwang : Thanks for the question, Chris. I'm going to talk a little bit just about our prospect in growth in terms of sterile injectables and then just talk a little bit about biosimilars as well. We see the global sterile injectables market as being a very attractive market. It's large, it's growing, it has high barriers to entry due to the complexity of manufacturing. And for that reason, we are very focused on our remediation efforts as a critical success factor in this market. We are confident about our remediation plans. We expect our supply to improve significantly towards the end of 2019, after which we see this business as being a significant growth contributor to Pfizer. So we remain committed to this business. And we see a tremendous amount of potential and growth prospect here. Likewise, with biosimilars, we see tremendous growth potential. You've seen that over this quarter, we grew 40% with our biosimilars portfolio, growth in Europe as well as in the U.S. Our U.S. growth currently has seen some great progress in closed systems, in regional plans, as well as in Medicare. However, in the commercial plans, that is where we continue to be challenged with growth due to J&J's exclusionary contracting. So we remain focused on working with our customers and payers to see the long-term savings benefits that can be derived from the use of biosimilars over short-term rebates. However, our portfolio is changing in that we are now venturing from just Inflectra alone to entering the oncology biosimilar space, where we see very different dynamics here and are also excited about this growth. This is a market that has already seen the entrance of biosimilars in the form of filgrastim. And there has already been really good uptake of filgrastim in the U.S. We see different dynamics in that the treatment \u2013 the duration of treatment is shorter, therefore you're going to get new patients cycling through faster. That is going to enable payers and customers to transition patients from the originator molecule to biosimilars much more quickly, thereby allowing them to benefit from the savings. So we're excited about our entrance into oncology biosimilars and look forward to not just this launch, but to realizing the five next biosimilars that we have in our pipeline. Charles E. Triano: Great. Thank you, Angela. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin : Thank you. First, I just want to say, Ian, it's been a real pleasure to work with you and learning from you over the years and in terms of all the value you've been able to unlock from the Wyeth acquisition and then some. A question for you, Albert. The message today is that large-scale deals seem off the table. But with the biotech tape (40:48) coming under pressure, some of your key growth drivers looking like they're flattening out, and with your strong balance sheet and your higher P/E multiple since early last summer, it would seem to me that you have a lot more options today than you did six months ago. Can you define what those options look like in your mind? And if a large-scale deal is off the table \u2013 how do you define a large-scale deal? I mean, I would assume that back in 2009 when you bought Wyeth, a $60 billion or $66 billion deal, that was a large-scale deal. But today, you're a much bigger company. It's a completely different market. That may not be considered a large-scale deal. So if you could please define what you mean by that. And then, secondly, if you could talk about what sort of options that you see for your Essentials (sic) [Essential] Health business. Thanks very much. Ian C. Read: Hey, Jami, thank you much for those kind comments. I'll then pass it over to Albert to answer the meats of your question. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Jami. Look, a $64 billion acquisition, it is a large M&A for any standards. But you are right, but for us, we have the ability and the balance sheet to execute basically whatever we would like to execute, if we see the value to customers. The way that we see right now large M&As is not based on our ability to execute or not. It is based on how destructive they could be by integrating them. And this is the main concern right now. We are going to enter into a period of growth post 2020. And we need to make sure that we execute right now on our pipeline, we execute right now on our commercial launches and market preparations. And a large M&A typically comes with big integration plans, but distracts operations during this integration. And this is what we would like to avoid. Obviously, there are opportunities over there with biotechs that are going down, although price are going down for a reason usually. But the truth is that as we are looking in our capital allocation, we are planning to scan the market for both opportunities that will not bring the destruction, operational destruction that a large M&A could bring, but could enhance our growth trajectory or our pipeline. Now on the second question on the \u2013 basically you're asking on the optionality, obviously external separation in the form that we had contemplated in the past is off the table because as you said and as you know, we are going to operate from the beginning of this financial year with a new operational construct. That being said, we constantly look our businesses and all parts of our businesses for fit internally and we will continue doing that. As I said, let me tell you where we are right now. On the Innovative business, it is very clear that the focus is executing the pipeline and the new launches. In the Consumer Healthcare business, we already said that we are examining options to separate or not this business. And we will come to a decision by year-end. In our newly-established Established Medicines business, the focus right now is to stand up this business. We need to make sure that we segregate it from Pfizer by providing them substantial autonomy. We need to make sure that we relocate the leadership to China where most of the growth is coming. And this is right now where we are. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Albert. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from John Boris from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. John T. Boris: Thanks for taking the questions, and Albert, thanks for the great overview. First question for Ian, just on pricing. I know you've indicated that you're going to obviously be pausing on taking any price increases through the end of this year. Just your thoughts on how you will attack pricing going into next year. A question for Frank. What was the contribution of price and volume in the quarter? And then on Xtandi, can you just give the split of sales that are in the metastatic versus nonmetastatic segment? And what is the risk that if a generic ZYTIGA launches at a significant discounts, if there's two approved but potentially 10 entrants and pricing possibly eroding there, what the impact might be on Xtandi going forward? Thanks. Ian C. Read: Okay. John, thank you for that three-part question. I'm going to address the pricing, and then we'll have Frank do your price versus volume. And then John will answer your question on \u2013 the questions you raise about Xtandi. Look, our pricing \u2013 I don't think our pricing situation has changed. We remain \u2013 our pricing philosophy is to price to the value of the product and price inside a competitive marketplace. I expect that like most industries, we will look at our pricing situation in January and take decisions based on what the competitive set is and what our value proposition is in the new marketplace. I have at this moment in time no different view about how we will take price our increases as we did last year. So with that, Frank, do you want to talk about pricing volume right now? Frank A. D'Amelio: Sure. So, John, global basis price was minus 2%, volume was plus 4%, so operationally plus 2%. We were up $243 million operationally in revenue. FX was a minus 1%, $113 million. So net-net we reported plus 1%, $130 million in revenue. And just a little color commentary on that minus 2% on price. If you look over the last 10 years, on average, that price number has been plus or minus low-single digits. So we're still in that range of plus or minus low-single digits. Ian C. Read: John? John D. Young: Okay. Thanks for the question, John. So we're still in the very early days following the nonmetastatic CRPC approval. And contributions from that indication were relatively modest in quarter three. We expect the full impact of this opportunity will take a couple of years to realize, as much of the value from this indication is built through patient accumulation and the longer duration of therapy given its earlier stage of use. We're continuing to leverage our relationships with urologists as we launch the indication. And we've seen a very encouraging uptick in our new-to-brand trends since the PROSPER approval. So we're very positive about the opportunity that this represents. In relation to your question about generic ZYTIGA, we generally don't expect generic ZYTIGA to impact our business in a meaningful way. Market share erosion historically comes from the branded version of the same compound rather than a therapeutic substitution. And Xtandi now has different indications than ZYTIGA for metastatic and nonmetastatic CRPC. We believe these agents are not likely to be viewed by physicians as interchangeable or substitutable. And ACP preference is not expected to be negatively impacted by the generic availability of a ZYTIGA. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, John. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen. Steve Scala : Thank you. I have a few. First, relative to pneumococcal vaccines, what was your conclusion from the recent ACIP meeting? And will you have data on the 20-valent vaccine by their next meeting in February? So that's the first question. Second, can you quantify the non-cash gain for Cerevel and its creation that was in Q3 other income? And then lastly, how does Pfizer foresee Bavencio's prospects in first line renal cell carcinoma given the recent news from competitors? Thank you. Ian C. Read: Okay. Thank you. We'll ask John to take two of the three questions, and then Frank will take the noncash question. John? John D. Young: All right. So thanks for the question, Steve. So the ACIP obviously met last week. And their \u2013 purpose of their review was looking at the adult recommendation for adults 65 and over in the U.S. It's important to state that this is relatively early in their process. The next stage for ACIP is to grade the data and then vote on the continuation of the 65-plus healthy age recommendation, which according to the CDC is likely to happen sometime in 2019. Our belief is that given the effectiveness shown by Prevnar 13 in preventing vaccine-type community-acquired pneumonia in adults 65 and over, we continue to support a broad recommendation of 65-plus. And that direct vaccination remains the only sure form of protection against persistent vaccine type IPD and pneumonia. We will obviously continue to work with the CDC to generate data and communicate the burden of impact of pneumococcal disease. And in relation to your question about Prevnar 20, obviously as you know, we've sort of indicated that we have received a positive breakthrough designation from the FDA. And we expect to start Phase 3 studies within the next few months. But we don't anticipate that we'll be submitting data on Prevnar 20, PCV20, to the ACIP for their forthcoming meeting. In relation to your question about the prospects that we see in the immuno-therapy space, we are really very encouraged. We've always said that we believe that the true value of I-O is to be expected in effective combinations. And the results of our first Phase 3 I-O combination study support that view. So the JAVELIN Renal 101 trial that you're referring to, that combined Bavencio with Inlyta in previously untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma, demonstrated that the combination provided superior progression-free survival compared with Sutent. The Bavencio and Inlyta combination demonstrated positive results across a broad RCC patient population in the first line setting, regardless of the prognostic risk group or PDL expression. And I think I would just add that obviously we noted the positive Inlyta and Keytruda results in RCC. And we think that that emphasizes the growing importance of Inlyta as a gold standard TKI inhibitor in the management of RCC. Frank A. D'Amelio: And then, Steve, on your question on the non-cash gain. The gain was $343 million and it was in GAAP results only. It was not included in adjusted results. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Frank. Operator, next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Umer Raffat : Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. I guess, Ian, Albert, for both of you, so when the price increases were rolled back earlier this summer, there's an expectation that price increases could be instituted again in January, if no concrete steps are taken on rebate. So I guess my question is, are you planning on putting them back on in January, your price increases? And has there been any dialogue or are you expecting any pushback from the administration when that happens? So that's first. And then on tafamidis, my question really is, so you've mentioned 1% diagnosis. You've also mentioned it's a blockbuster opportunity. My question really is, do you see this as a $1 billion opportunity or as a $5 billion opportunity? Just trying to put book ends around how big this could be from your perspective, given all the investor debate around that. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Umer. Well, on pricing, what I'm trying to indicate is that we did voluntarily agree to defer price increases until the blueprint was implemented over the end of this year. We've been working with the President on parts of the blueprint. And I expect our approach by the end of year will be, what I would characterize as business as normal. We price to the marketplace. We price competitively, and we will make those decisions towards the end of the year and early in January. So thanks for your question on that. And then we'll turn to the scope of standards. John D. Young: So thanks for the question, Umer. Obviously as you know, we don't give forecasts for inducing \u2013 or individual products. Let me just sort of underscore what I mentioned already, that we're incredibly excited about the opportunity. Any time you have positive clinical data that demonstrates significant reduction in mortality and hospitalization in a patient population that doesn't have access to any alternative treatments, that has to be a significant opportunity. Clearly as we said, highly underdiagnosed at the moment. Our focus is going to be sort of really making sure that we can accelerate the knowledge around how to diagnose appropriately and sharing our clinical data with physicians. So we're very excited about the opportunity that presents. Certainly, it's premature for us to begin to frame the size of our revenue opportunity particularly. But we'll make sure that our expectations are obviously going to be part of our 2019 guidance when we give that in the first quarter next year. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, John. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald. Louise Chen : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I had a few on the pipeline. So first question here is on tanezumab. Would you expect to see a potential imbalance in RPOA in the chronic low back pain indication? And why or why not? And then secondly for the ATTR-CM indication, how big do you think that population actually is, now that there is better diagnosis? And the last question I had was on your DMD gene therapy program. What kind of data are you going to report next year? And what do you think the competitive advantages of your product are as it relates to promoter vector in gene and how do you think about this opportunity versus looking at CRISPR for DMD? Thank you. Ian C. Read: Well, I think we'll ask Mikael to answer your first and last question. The one in the middle, we'll refer back to what has been substantially answered already by John. And I believe we will give our indications of the \u2013 in our guidance in the first quarter about what we expect from tafamidis. Clearly, it's a substantial opportunity, but one that we're not ready yet to talk about until we give our guidance next year. Mikael Dolsten : Thank you for your interest in tanezumab. And let me just punctuate that we were really excited about the data from our first study that showed that more than 50% of the patients got a 50% or greater reduction in OA pain and about 35% reported a 70% or greater improvement in pain. So these are real great benefits for patients. Now concerning chronic lower back pain, those patients are generally younger. Most of them do not as advanced OA as a typical OA pain population. And we, in general, have excluded patients that have severe OA in the chronic low back pain, because we're using a higher dose for that study. And we do not anticipate that there would be a major impact of rapidly progressing OA in that patient population. Concerning DMD, we have a very, I think, strong DMD gene test set that we're using with a unique gene expression capsid and also our capsid has certain unique features that we think will optimize its delivery to mass zones. And we have started treating patients and a part of a dose escalation, but thus far we are pleased to see the tolerability of the gene therapy product. And initial oxidations are encouraging. And we look forward to continuing this study. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Mikael. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. David R. Risinger: Thanks very much. And, Ian, let me add my congratulations and best wishes to you after a very successful career and value creation at Pfizer. My two questions are, could you please discuss your discussions with commercial payers to evolve rebate contracts in the commercial sector? And then, second, going back to the high level, Albert, I'm hoping that you could rearticulate the purpose of the new operational construct and the incremental value that you expect to drive potentially, including additional strategic action. You had referenced the separation decision, and I just wanted to get a little bit clearer picture on the opportunity you see for additional value creation. Thank you. Ian C. Read: Well, thank you for your comment, David. I appreciate them. On the discussions with payers, I would say there has been, outside of our walls, limited discussion with payers. Obviously, there are different positions between the PBMs and insurers and ourselves as through \u2013 regarding the effectiveness of the passing on of rebates to the point-of-sale or to the patient. We've done a lot of internal work looking at it and understanding how we'd operationalize it. But really, there's not a lot of discussions we can have outside of our four walls until we see what the rule looks like when it's published. That being said, I continue to think it's a very effective way of taking pricing pressures away from the patient, especially not exposing to list price. I'll pass it over to Albert for his further comments. Albert Bourla : David, the reason why we organized this Pfizer into all these businesses is because we believe that they have different growth drivers. And we believe that the main value contributor for a corporation like Pfizer, it is topline growth. So with this reorganization, we tried to maximize the opportunities and upgrade the talent that each one of them has, for example, by focusing our efforts on innovative business in this pipeline, focusing our efforts on innovative business into creating new markets, because a lot of our products and future portfolio are coming to new market, because they are addressing unmet medical needs. This is crucial. When it comes to the Established Medicines, the way that we describe this business, it is off-patent iconic brands like the Lipitors, like the Viagras, like the Celebrex of the world. So we are not transferring over there everything that it is off patent. But those brands that they have significant growth potential, presence and potential in particularly parts of the world. These are not brands that we expect to grow in developed Europe or the U.S. But these are brands that we are growing, And we are expected to continue growing in China. In fact, to be able to enhance this opportunity, we are relocating a senior management team in China to be able to manage this opportunity, including a new member of the executive team. So this is the growth strategy over there, plan to explore China as a whole in terms of the contribution to pharmaceutical innovation. And in terms of our Consumer business was always operating as an autonomous business. We are enhancing its autonomy, particularly around manufacturing issues this year. And we continue examining options. My reference to Jami's question before around, we never \u2013 we always examine options for our business, and particularly your interest on the established business. As I said, right now, the important thing it is to stand up this business. It is \u2013 before examining options for a business, you need to make sure that operationally is \u2013 it's doing very well. And this is the focus. Ian C. Read: Thank you, Albert. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, Albert. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Geoff Meacham : Great. Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Albert, you mentioned simplifying the organizational structure and not having an appetite for bigger deals. But \u2013 and I know you still have to finalize the strategy. But are you comfortable with the number of therapeutic areas in Innovative? Is the creation of Cerevel a strategy that you think could be a blueprint for other categories that are less of a priority? And the second question, just on the recent drug pricing proposal. And I recognize that most of the drivers for Pfizer today are more Part D than B. I know you don't want to give specifics, but how do you guys view the delta between the U.S. and O-U.S. net pricing? Are there methodologies that you think make more sense to make comparisons easier? Thank you. Ian C. Read: Well, Geoff, I'll answer the pricing one. I don't think it makes sense to make the comparison to start with, because what you're doing is you're importing one country's industrial policy in pre-writing into a country that's based on innovation. So number one, I don't think \u2013 but to regards how the government may or may not create baskets and reference pricing, however it starts out, it always continues to get worse as the only intention of that type of reference pricing is to drive down the cost to the government. And it's not interested in ensuring the best treatments get to patients. So overall, I think we \u2013 hopefully the rule will be revised and reconsidered. With that, pass it over to Albert. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Ian, and thank you for your question. I mean it's a very, very good question, like all the questions that have been asked today. I think the fact that we narrow our area of focus is a very big part of our efforts last year and contributor to the higher R&D productivity. It is not only relevant to us in general. It is just that this consumer industry, companies that they are focusing on smaller number of therapeutic areas. They have in general much higher returns to shareholders. As we said, obviously Pfizer is a very big name and can apply with one machine from one end, it meets multiple. So and this is the question, what is the right balance? I think right now we do have the right balance. We are focusing on six therapeutic areas that they are enough to pump our growth in the years to come. And also they are a small number relatively so that we can build something with expertise in each one of them. To your question, if we will employ this new, innovative type of partnerships, the answer is yes. And actually, the difference in the last two exits from, if I can call it like that, from us, it was related with (1:05:27) and neuroscience was different than the way that we did it in the past by just exiting or selling the asset. We do participate in the space, but we do participate in partnership with people that they have the focus and the expertise to drive much higher results there. And we will continue doing so if we have this opportunity. Charles E. Triano: Great. Thank you, Albert. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question is from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Timothy Minton Anderson : Thank you. A couple of questions. On Ibrance, PALOMA-3 was published. It did not show an overall survival benefit. And I'm wondering if you think that potentially creates any hurdles, reimbursement or access, in ex-U.S. markets specifically? And related to that, I wonder if that raises a question about the two adjuvant trials that are running. I know it's a different but related endpoint of DFS, so I'm curious to get your thoughts. Wondering if that could show, for example, a nonstatistically significant trend only. And then a second question is on biosimilars. And really looking for any guidance you can give on operating margins. So directionally, if you look out at your long-term forecast, what are you expecting versus today? As volumes grow, you would get a scale benefit, and that should help. But an offset on the negative side could be more price erosion over time as there are more entrants per molecule. So how do those future margins in your forecast compare to today's margins? And how can you describe today's margins relative to, let's say, the branded business or the rest of the Pfizer business? Thank you. Ian C. Read: So, Tim, on the biosimilars, we still continue to model that along the lines of a sterile injectable market, high barriers to entry, high cost to produce a biosimilar. I think we've seen some players repricing (1:07:37) and the European prices have been much as we see the sterile injectables in Europe, that have a lower price there. Initially, I think that regulatory body isn't as focused on the need for quality or focused on ensuring there is money to produce the next wave of innovative biosimilars. I think the U.S. market will continue to be similar to sterile injectables. And if society wants a vibrant biosimilar market going forward, given the upfront cost to produce biosimilars, I do think the market has to react very similar to sterile injectable margins and the stickiness of hard-to-make products in that marketplace. With that, I'll pass it over to John to answer the Ibrance question. John D. Young: Okay. So thanks for the question, Tim. So let me just say in relation to the PALOMA overall survival data that we presented recently, although the difference didn't reach prespecified threshold for a statistical significance, there was a highly clinically relevant numerical improvement in overall survival of nearly seven months with Ibrance plus fulvestrant compared to placebo plus fulvestrant. So overall survival was 34.9 months, compared to 28 months. I think we were actually very encouraged that that analysis was very consistent with the improvement previously demonstrated in the primary endpoint for DFS in PALOMA-3. And we will obviously be engaging with payers across Europe and elsewhere in relation to sharing these data. But we remain very confident in the clinical profile and the effectiveness of Ibrance for patients who we've now demonstrated in a variety of settings for metastatic breast cancer. In terms of your question about whether we see risk in our early breast cancer trials, we really don't see any read-across from these data, other than the fact that we obviously have seen very positive response clinically in patients with metastatic breast cancer. And we see no reason to change our perspective that this is not only a very significant and important opportunity for patients and for Pfizer, but actually about the potential profile for Ibrance in that indication. Charles E. Triano: Thank you, John. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi. Andrew S. Baum: Thank you. Three, please. In reference to Xtandi, is there an argument to be made for launching an authorized generic for government plans in order to increase patient affordability, particularly for the nonlist patients? Number one. Number two, just focusing on the anticipated move to net pricing for Medicare, I'd be very interested in Albert and Ian's view how long they think the commercial book of business will cling to rebates given economic incentives before migrating to net pricing, if indeed that does take place in government plans. And then finally, for Angela, just given the pivot towards China on the Established Medicines business, could you give us some granularity about what is driving the growth in China over the last nine months? Many thanks. Ian C. Read: Okay. Andrew, on your innovative idea of launching an authorized generic, it's an unusual suggestion given that we have a product with an extended patent period and we're dealing with the access challenges through mechanisms such as contributing to foundations that allow patients who cannot afford the medicine to access it. And we also have our own not-paid-for prescription program as well. So I think the complexities of running an authorized generic alongside a branded when both are patent protected are too substantial. And then on a net pricing, if we get to net pricing, which \u2013 or the removal of rebates or rebates going to the patient, I would expect that the commercial book of business would move reasonably quickly to the same system. I can't see us maintaining a dual system there. And then I'll pass it to Angela for the \u2013 on why is China doing so well within your leadership? Angela Hwang : Thank you. Thank you, Ian. So we have had tremendous success in China this year. And I would narrow that down to two portfolios. First, our cardiovascular portfolio and second, our anti-infective portfolio. I think in both of those what we're seeing are some favorable, I think, epidemiology that stems from low diagnosis, low treatment, and the ability for our products to have a prominent market share in the treatment of those diseases. So if I think about Lipitor, and Norvasc, sulperazone (1:12:46) as three of those key products, each one of those have grown tremendously through this year through expansion. And not only is this expansion I think from a sort of getting more patients treated, but we also have had a very focused effort on geographical expansion. So moving beyond the large cities into smaller cities, into county hospitals. So I think it's a combination of the continued high patient demand, coupled with our geographical expansion that is leading us to continued success and rapid growth that we're seeing in our portfolio. Ian C. Read: Thank you. And just to punctuate that, I think that the untapped volume in China, given its size and given the narrow segment of society we sell to, is colossal and a good hedge against any pricing pressures. I would expect to see a robust volume response to any ongoing pricing pressures. Charles E. Triano: Thank you. And, operator, can we take our final question, please. Operator : Your final question comes from Jason Gerberry from Bank of America. Jason M. Gerberry: Oh, hey, thanks for squeezing me in. Just a couple on tanezumab. So just kind of curious as we think about these upcoming Phase 3 readouts next year, just your thoughts on the importance of providing doctors with a roadmap to monitor and prevent these bone disorders from leading to joint replacement. And so my first part of that question is on the recent Phase 3 data, are you confident that if physicians diagnose type 1 RPOA, they could diagnose, stop treatment, and potentially stop symptom progression there? And then my second part of that question is just that, there were no cases of osteonecrosis. I know that going back to 2010, 2012, during the period of the clinical hold, you guys and FDA had a little bit of a difference regarding diagnosis of osteonecrosis versus RPOA. So just wondering if you're confident you're on the same page with the FDA there. Thanks. Ian C. Read: Mikael, could you answer that? Mikael Dolsten : Yeah, we're excited about tanezumab. And we obviously look forward to the significant study readout we have coming next year. I think we've got a good first feel for again confirming the encouraged efficacy that we're seeing in this first study in a patient group that was in urgent need of new medication and had failed to get the benefit or were intolerable to current available medication. When it comes to management of rapidly progressing OA, I wanted just to say that we had 1.3% of that, the majority of it was actually of Type 1, which is more of a mild change in the joint space narrowing. And we had a smaller fraction that was of Type 2 with that much more deterioration of the joint. I think, yeah, these are structural changes that occur also in the natural scope of osteoarthritis with a growing aging patient population and can be easily managed by physicians according to medical practice. And we look upon the overall benefit risk as very encouraging for these new treatment options that opportunities in a difficult situation where opioids have caused an unfortunate situation for many patient groups. Of course, as we get the entire readout of the tanezumab OA and CBT, we will work with reviewing data, dialogues with regulators, and assuming that the drug will continue to show this promising benefit, we will obviously as always when Pfizer provide new medicines, have proper educational and implementation programs to make sure physicians and patients can use the drug in the most effective way. Charles E. Triano: Thanks, Mikael. Ian C. Read: Thanks, Mikael. Before we close, I'd just like to say to the analyst community, I expect this to be my last call for Pfizer on the analysts call. I'd like to thank you all over the years for great questions and keeping management focused on shareholder value. Thank you very much.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Charles Triano : Good morning and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer's fourth quarter and full year 2018 performance, and 2019 financial guidance and business outlook. I'm joined today by our CEO, Albert Bourla; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Angela Hwang, Group President, Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group; John Young, our Chief Business Officer; and Doug Lankler, General Counsel. Slides that will be presented on this call can be viewed on our website, pfizer.com/investors. We'll see here that Slide 3 covers our legal disclosures. Albert and Frank will now make prepared remarks, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Albert Bourla. Albert? Albert Bourla : Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. During my remarks, I will speak about our performance for the year, the continued advancement of our pipeline, and the strategy we have put in place to return Pfizer to a period of sustained growth, following the impact of the Lyrica LOE that will negatively impact our growth in both 2019 and 2020. Frank will then provide details regarding the fourth quarter and our 2019 financial guidance. Pfizer had another solid year in 2018. Revenues for the year were up 2% approximate. We saw continued growth in several of our biggest selling medicines and vaccines in emerging markets and in biosimilars. These increases were partially offset by the $1.7 billion in LOE impacts as well as decreases in the Legacy Established Products portfolio in developed markets and in our Sterile Injectables portfolio, primarily due to continued legacy Hospira product shortages in the U.S. I will begin with a few words regarding the performance of each of our businesses, starting with Pfizer Innovative Health. This business had another strong year, growing its top-line 6% operationally, thanks to the continued strength of several key brands, including: Ibrance, Eliquis and Xeljanz globally; and Prevenar 13 primarily in emerging markets. I would also remind you that Viagra transferred from PIH to PEH at the beginning of 2018. So if you exclude Viagra from the calculation, the growth would have been 9% operationally. For full year 2018, Ibrance revenues were $4.1 billion, which represented an increase of 32% operationally, while approximately 50% of eligible U.S. patients are kept in a CDK inhibitor in combination with endocrine therapy. Many are still receiving endocrine monotherapy or chemotherapy. We continue to educate the oncology community about the benefits of Ibrance therapy. We remain confident in Ibrance's leadership in the class. They're based on the strength of our data, significant first-mover advantage, and most importantly, the continued positive patient experience with more than 100,000 patients prescribed the medicine worldwide since its launch. Our current growth driver for Ibrance remains outside of the U.S., particularly in developed Europe and Japan. And we had another quarter of solid growth here. Ibrance has achieved reimbursement in the majority of international developed markets, and despite increasing competition has maintained greater than 90% of total CDK class volume in these key markets. For Xtandi, our alliance revenues in the U.S. were up 18% for the full year. And when combined with our royalty income on ex-U.S. sales totaled nearly $1 billion in 2018. We are continuing to see an increased number of urologists prescribing Xtandi. And our launch of the expanded indication in nonmetastatic prostate cancer in the U.S., following the July approval, made it the first and only FDA approved oral medication for both, nonmetastatic and metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. We continued to see growth in Xtandi throughout this year. And we remain focused on demonstrating the value of moving Xtandi into earlier treatment settings. In December, along with our alliance partner, Astellas, we announced that the Phase 3 ARCHES trial evaluating Xtandi plus ADT in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer met its primary endpoint, significantly improving radiographic progression-free survival versus ADT alone. These data further differentiate Xtandi from the competition, both branded and generic. We are engaging global health authorities in discussions regarding the potential of an expanded indication for Xtandi. And we remain confident that Xtandi will be one of the pillars of our oncology portfolio for years to come. For this year, Xeljanz had a tremendous performance with revenues increasing 33% operationally to $1.8 billion. Our fourth quarter results continued a pattern of extremely strong performance for Xeljanz with scripts up 35% compared with the prior year quarter. This was driven by continued growth in rheumatoid arthritis prescriptions, as well as increased contributions from the drug's recent expansion into psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis. We look forward to these new indications becoming even more meaningful contributors in 2019, particularly in ulcerative colitis. Eliquis had another strong year, with alliance revenue and direct sales growing 35% operationally to $3.4 billion. Lastly, our Consumer Healthcare business grew 3% operationally for the year, with revenues totaling $3.6 billion. In December, we entered into a definitive agreement with GSK, under which we have agreed to create a new consumer healthcare joint venture. We expect the transaction to close in the second half of 2019, subject of course to customary closing conditions including GSK shareholder approval and required regulatory approvals. Turning now to Pfizer Essential Health, while revenues for the year declined, we once again saw strong operational growth both in emerging markets and in our biosimilars portfolio. Emerging markets revenue for the business grew 11% operationally for the year, to $7.8 billion. Some of the biggest growth drivers in emerging markets were : Lipitor, up 19% operationally; Norvasc, up also 19% operationally; and Sterile Injectables, up 13% operationally. Our biosimilars business grew 41% operationally in 2018 to approximate [Technical Difficulty]. We received FDA approvals for 2 biosimilars in 2018 and we see the potential for up to 4 additional approvals in 2019. PEH growth in emerging markets in biosimilars was more than offset by lower revenues for our Legacy Established Products portfolio in developed markets and product supply shortages in the Sterile Injectables business. In the U.S. Sterile Injectables business, manufacturing supply constraints continue to impact our top-line. We expect these issues to be significantly improved by the end of 2019, and continue to expect this business to be a solid growth contributor in the future. As you are aware, as of the start of our 2019 fiscal year, Pfizer is now organized into three businesses : Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group, a science-based innovative medicines business, led by Angela Hwang; Upjohn, an off-patent branded and generic medicines business, headquartered in China and led by Michael Goettler that is bringing 20 of our most iconic brands to more than 100 markets around the world; and our Consumer Healthcare business, led by Chris Slager, which is preparing to become part of the joint venture I mentioned earlier. Now let me turn my attention to our R&D pipeline. This year we saw a wave of new approvals from our pipeline including four targeted cancer agents over the last four months of 2018. In total, we received seven key approvals in 2018, panning both new molecular entities and line extensions, which will allow us to serve a broader patient population. In terms of the recent news, let me touch on some of the key milestones we have achieved since our third quarter call. In rare disease, FDA accepted our NDA filings for tafamidis for the treatment of ATTR-cardiomyopathy with a PDUFA date in July. As a reminder, we estimate less than 1% of ATTR-cardiomyopathy patients have been diagnosed. And currently, there are no approved treatments for this disease, making it an incredibly underserved market. In Oncology, we have several promising developments. We received FDA approvals for Lorbrena, a third-generation ALK inhibitor for lung cancer, and for Daurismo for acute myeloid leukemia. In the Oncology biosimilar space, we received a positive CHMP opinion for Zirabev, a potential biosimilar to Avastin. We have initiated clinical studies for a second cancer vaccine applicable in major solid tumor types, and we advanced a second CDK inhibitor for Ibrance-resistant cancer into clinical studies. In Vaccines, we've started a Phase 3 trial for our next generation 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for adults 18 and older. In Inflammation & Immunology, our JAK3 inhibitor for moderate-to-severe alopecia areata started a pivotal Phase 2b/3 trial. In Internal Medicine, Pfizer and our partner Eli Lilly announced this morning positive top line results from a Phase 3 study evaluating tanezumab 2.5 milligram or 5 milligram in patients with moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis pain. Looking ahead, we see the potential in 2019 for several inflection points that will further advance our pipeline. These include potential U.S. approvals for a combination of Bavencio and Inlyta for first line renal cell carcinoma as well as for up to four biosimilars, trastuzumab, bevacizumab, rituximab and adalimumab, which when taken together represent a potential blockbuster opportunity for Pfizer. We also expect Phase 3 readouts for rivipansel in sickle cell disease and for our JAK1 in atopic dermatitis as well as further Phase 3 readouts for tanezumab, which has the potential to address the serious unmet needs of the more than 27 million Americans living with osteoarthritis and more than 33 million suffering chronic low back pain. Thanks to these achievements and expected milestones, we believe we are extremely well-positioned, but what we expect to become an era of sustained top line growth with leverage to the bottom line growth rate, following the impact of the Lyrica LOE. We view this as a significant opportunity, because three very positive trends are intersecting at the same time. First, macro trends such as an aging population and a rising middle class in emerging markets increasing the number of people seeking access to both innovative and established medicines. Second, the continued advancement of what we believe is the best pipeline in our history with good breadth and strong innovation. And finally, after Lyrica, we expect to enjoy the benefits of a dramatic abatement in LOEs until the second half of the next decade. Our job now is to stay the course, take the steps necessary to pivot to growth. Our strategy for doing so can be summed up in three words : innovating for growth. This means, we must advance both scientific innovation that significantly improves current standards of care and commercial innovation that addresses patient access and affordability issues. Deliver these innovations, we have taken steps to ensure, we have the right organizational structure in place and that our resources are focused in the right areas. We improve operational effectiveness and create capacity for value creating work. We have reorganized our operations to simplify them. We are initiating an enterprise-wide digital effort to speed up drug development, enhance patient and physician experiences and access and leverage technology in robotics to simplify and automate our processes. And we are significantly reallocating capital across the enterprise by investing more aggressively in profitable growth drivers and reducing resources in areas of lower strategic importance. This includes significant planned reductions in indirect SI&A spending, much of which will be reallocated to R&D. And within R&D, the entire increase in spending would be project related with overhead costs actually anticipated to come down. In addition, of course, to all of this, we have the financial flexibility to continue to undertake additional shareholder-friendly capital allocation initiatives. We see a growing dividend as an important part of our investment thesis. We also have the ability to deploy capital as appropriate in other areas, whether that would be share repurchases or business development initiatives. At the current time, we are focusing on smaller tuck-in type acquisitions and licensing opportunities for mid-stage compounds. Of course, our business isn't without its challenges. Most significantly, we need to ensure that our innovation and risk-taking is rewarded in the marketplace, while doing all we can to ensure affordable access for patients. At this end, we continue to work with governments, policymakers, payers, and other players in the health care ecosystem to advocate for pro-innovation policies that benefit patients, our company, and our industry as a whole. All the steps we are taking are designed to enable us to achieve our purpose of delivering breakthroughs that change patients' lives. In summary, we see our improved growth profile and more clearly into focus, and we believe we remain well-positioned to deliver new medicines for patients with further company for accelerated growth in the future and create enhanced shareholder value. I will now turn it over to Frank to provide details on the quarter and our outlook for 2019. Frank? Frank D'Amelio: Thanks, Albert. Good day, everyone. As always the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast. Now moving onto the financials. Fourth quarter 2018 revenues were approximately $14 billion, which reflects operational growth of $657 million or 5% and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, $383 million or 3%. Our Innovative Health business recorded 10% operational revenue growth in fourth quarter 2018 driven primarily by Ibrance, International Markets, Eliquis and Xeljanz globally and Prevnar 13 in the emerging markets, all of which were partially offset by the loss of exclusivity of Viagra in the U.S. in December of 2017 and the resulting shift in reporting of Viagra revenues in the U.S. and Canada to the Essential Health business at the beginning of 2018. And decreased revenues for Enbrel in most developed European markets mainly due to continued biosimilar competition. Revenues for our Essential Health business in the fourth quarter decreased 3% operationally primarily due to 13% operational decline in the Legacy Established Products portfolio in developed markets driven mainly by industry-wide pricing challenges in the U.S. and generic competition, a 14% operational decline in the Sterile Injectables portfolio in developed markets, primarily due to increased competition across the portfolio and continued legacy Hospira product shortages in the U.S. And a 10% operational decline in the Peri-LOE Products portfolio in developed markets mainly as a result of expected declines in Lyrica in developed Europe and Pristiq. All of which were partially offset by the addition of Viagra revenues from the U.S. and Canada that were previously recorded in the IH business, a 10% operational growth in emerging markets, primarily reflecting growth across the LEP and SIP portfolios in China and operational growth of 31% from Biosimilars in developed marks primarily from Inflectra in certain channels in the U.S. In the fourth quarter, we recorded $0.07 loss per share compared to earnings per share of $2.02 in the year-ago quarter, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of the non-recurrence of a $10.7 billion benefit recorded in fourth quarter 2017 to reflect the December 2017 enactment of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act. Higher asset impairment charges primarily associated with generic sterile injectable products acquired in connection with Pfizer's 2015 acquisition of Hospira and higher restructuring implementation cost, partially offset by the non-recurrence of net losses on early retirement of debt recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 as well as higher revenues in fourth quarter of 2018 compared to last year. Adjusted diluted EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.64 versus $0.62 in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher revenues and lower SI&A expenses. I want to point out, the diluted weighted-average shares outstanding declined by 152 million shares versus the year ago quarter due primarily to our ongoing share repurchase program reflecting the impact of shares repurchased during 2018, partially offset by dilution related to share-based employee compensation programs. As I previously mentioned, foreign exchange negatively impacted fourth quarter 2018 revenues by approximately $383 million and positively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $408 million. As a result, foreign exchange had a negligible impact on adjusted diluted EPS compared to the year ago quarter. You can see on this chart, we've met or exceeded all components of our 2018 financial guidance. Turning now to our 2019 guidance, I first like to note that our guidance reflects the full year contribution of revenue and expenses from Consumer Healthcare. Our revenue guidance of $52 billion to $54 billion reflects an anticipated $2.6 billion headwind from products that have recently lost or are expected to lose marketing exclusivity shortly, including LOE for Lyrica in the U.S. in June 2019, as well as an anticipated $900 million negative impact from unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar compared to actual FX rates from 2018, partially offset by continued strong growth expected from key product franchises including Ibrance, Eliquis, Xeljanz and Xtandi as well as contributions from newly launched products and indications. Moving on to other elements of our 2019 financial guidance, compared with 2018 actual results, the midpoints of these ranges imply higher adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues resulting primarily from the anticipated LOE of Lyrica in U.S., lower adjusted SI&A expenses, reflecting a 3% to 4% increase in direct spend for product marketing promotion, being offset by a reduction in indirect spend and higher R&D expenses to support our late-stage and emerging early-stage pipelines. In addition, we anticipate significantly lower adjusted other income this year compared to 2018. As I highlighted on our third quarter earnings call, we expected the core components of other income, net interest income and expense, income from royalties and the ViiV joint venture as well as our pension credit to net to approximately flat or zero. We have since refined our forecast and are now estimating approximately $100 million of income for 2019. This is approximately $1.2 billion less than 2018 adjusted other income, which included $586 million of net gains on equity investments as well as $464 million of income from collaborations, out-licensing arrangements and the sale of compound rights. In 2019 and forward, we will exclude gains or losses on equity investments from adjusted results because of their inherent volatility and because we do not believe they reflect the results of our core business. As we report our quarterly results in 2019, the 2018 adjusted results will be presented excluding these gains. While income from collaborations, out-licensing arrangements, and the sale of compound rights will remain in adjusted results, our guidance does not assume any potential future milestone income until it is actually recorded. We expect our effective tax rate on adjusted income to be approximately 16%, which we believe is sustainable for the foreseeable future. We expect 2019 adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.82 to $2.92. As I just mentioned, this range now excludes gains and losses on equity investments, which favorably impacted 2018 adjusted diluted EPS by $0.08. This range also reflects an anticipated $0.06 negative impact from changes in foreign exchange rates and expected share repurchases of approximately $9 billion in 2019. Now I want to highlight how our 2019 guidance compares to 2018 revenue and adjusted diluted EPS. The midpoint of our 2019 revenue guidance, excluding the anticipated $900 million negative impact from foreign exchange implies flat to a slightly improved operational performance compared to 2018, despite facing an anticipated $2.6 billion of LOE headwinds this year, which is $900 million more than 2018. On adjusted diluted EPS, the midpoint of our 2019 guidance, excluding the anticipated $0.06 negative impact from foreign exchange also implies comparable operational performance compared to 2018 after removing the $0.08 gain on equity investments. I want to highlight that despite the significant challenges of the Lyrica LOE this year, we expect our 2019 operational performance for revenues and adjusted diluted EPS excluding foreign exchange to be comparable with 2018. Moving onto key takeaways, we delivered strong Q4 2018 financial results with 5% operational revenue growth and 3% adjusted diluted EPS growth compared to year-ago quarter. Our 2019 financial guidance ranges imply comparable operational performance for revenues and adjusted diluted EPS when excluding the impact of foreign exchange and 2018 net gains on equity investments despite the anticipated loss of market exclusivity in the U.S. for Lyrica on June 30, 2019. We accomplished multiple product and pipeline milestones since our previous quarterly update and we returned $20.2 billion to shareholders in 2018 through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2019 and beyond. Now, I'll turn it back to Chuck. Charles Triano : Thank you, Frank, and thank you, everybody. Operator, can we please poll for questions now? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen. Steve Scala : Thank you very much, and congratulations on a strong 2018 and a solid 2019 outlook. Couple of questions. First, to clarify, has Bavencio plus Inlyta been filed in first-line renal cell? And if yes, was this based on the PFS data? Or was OS met since ESMO? And if only PFS, then how will the regulators view this, given the Keytruda plus Inlyta achieve both PFS and OS? So that's the first question. Second question is, can you craft an expectation for us for the Tafamidis rollout? Will this be more like a traditional cardiovascular rollout, which can be sluggish, or more like a novel orphan drug filling an unmet need which can be much more rapid? Thank you very much. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Steve. I think maybe John can answer the Bavencio/Inlyta question. John Young : Yeah, thanks for the question, Steve. So, we obviously only confirm filing when it's formally - a filing is formally been received by the FDA. So all I can say at this point in time is that we're in the filing phase for that study and that indication. Albert Bourla : Yeah. Thank you, John. And, Angela, maybe you can speak a little bit about the Tafamidis rollout plans. Angela Hwang : Sure. So we're really excited about the potential launch of Tafamidis for ATTR-cardiomyopathy. We do see this as a rare disease. But it is a severely under-diagnosed rare disease, particularly because there is no treatment today and diagnosis involves the use of invasive heart biopsies. We know that from autopsy data that there are about probably 100,000 potential patients in the U.S., the prevalence of this disease. But we also know that only about 1% of these patients are diagnosed today in the U.S. So really from a launch perspective, diagnosis is going to be a key focus of our launch plans. And in this regard, diagnosis and market development is a key area for Pfizer. It's a key area of expertise for Pfizer. Let's just take example, the diagnosis of the ALK mutation for Xalkori in non-small cell lung cancer. At the launch of Xalkori, the diagnosis right here was about 1%. But we know that today it has reached diagnosis rates of 80% to 90%. So we have a strong record of success in developing new markets across not just the ALK example, but many therapeutic areas. But the one thing we've also learned from this is that it does take time. So our launch is going to be focused on a number of factors, first, in creating suspicion for this disease by both cardiologists as well as patients through education around the symptoms of cardiomyopathy. In parallel, we also want to increase the utilization of non-invasive scintigraphy versus heart biopsy as a means of diagnosis. We know that there are about 15,000 scintigraphy machines in the U.S. today. And these machines are already being used routinely to diagnose other cardiac diseases. So we know that this is a routine procedure and it is already reimbursed. So when we look in totality, what we see for Tafamidis is the following. We have excellent data. We have compelling patient benefits. We have deep expertise and commercial footprint in cardiology. We also have a track record of success in creating new markets. And we plan to bring all of this to bear in diagnosing and treating the cardiomyopathy patient. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Angela. And needless to say that for both Bavencio and Inlyta, and Tafamidis, we are really very excited about the future based on the strength of the data of both studies. Charles Triano : Thank you. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Umer Raffat : Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. First, just wanted to - since this has been such a topical thing, your commentary on large M&A, maybe for the broader audience, can you reiterate your thoughts? Would be very curious what your preferences are on large versus mid, and how you define smaller acquisitions in terms of dollars. Second, just quickly on R&D, on Tafamidis, my question I guess is there wasn't a free acid - or couldn't you have developed a free acid form for 20 milligram also? And I ask because presumably that could have helped with the European pricing structures given your existing 20 milligram approval there. And finally, Frank, just your thoughts on absolute SG&A and R&D dollar changes in the next 5-year timeframe, just mostly trying to understand your thoughts on operating margin evolution post-Lyrica. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much, Umer. I will recap my thoughts on M&A, and then Mikael can deal with the R&D question about Tafamidis. Look, as we have said consistently, and we started saying that from the second quarter last year and the third quarter last year, and now we are repeating in the fourth quarter earnings call. Business development is not a strategy. It is a way to execute your strategy. And our strategy has been very clear. Our strategy is to reach top-line growth through the introduction of breakthrough medicines, and we sounded, as I said in my comments, into innovating for growth. And we believe that right now we are very well positioned to achieve this strategy, because of the combination of, one, virtually LOE-free period after the Lyrica LOE until 2025, the mid of the decade, and also, the introduction of a great pipeline, what we think is the greatest pipeline ever. So with that in mind, when we have enough time to play, what we need to do is, is to make sure that we maximize the chances of achieving the potential for those new launches are expecting to bring. And this means that execution is extremely important. Right now, execution can make the difference. And large M&A, it's not that we'll not add right now matching our growth profile, but it could take - derail us from execution, because a large M&A requires thousands of people to work together to just integrate the two companies. That been said, first of all, we never say never, so we are examining all opportunities. And also, we do plan to deploy capital to enhance our growth profile. It's just that this time, the capital that we plan to deploy has a very different, slightly different direction and focus than before. Before, we were trying to do revenues now or soon. This was more or less the focus of our M&A dogma. And this is exactly what we needed at that time. We were dealing with lack of revenue growth and we needed to bring either pieces that could enhance the strategy to break the company at that time or we could bring revenue streams that will enhance the growth profile that was actually very bad at the time. Right now, the dogma is changing, and it is how can we bring assets to enhance even further our pipeline to make our growth sustained. And because we have a very strong R&D machine that right now I fully trust their ability to choose assets and also develop them. This is why our strategy is to deploy capital towards this direction. As I said though, we never say never, and of course, we will never lose our flexibility to deploy capital if we see the opportunities in the best way to achieve our premise. And with that, I will ask Mikael to comment. Mikael Dolsten : So thank you for your question. We have under breakthrough designation moved Tafamidis registration and the 20 milligram formulation for once-a-day administration was to unused in the clinical studies. And it has priority review and Albert pointed out potential FDA action date in July. We have also filed a 61-milligram formulation that we think is a very convenient alternative that is under standard review as expected and would potentially be approved in the fall. This would offer patients the very best choices for a therapy that has just really strong dataset and the consistency in cardiomyopathy. And also I would ask Frank to comment on the question about SI&A and R&D expenses. Frank D'Amelio: Yeah. So if you think about SI&A, just - we've printed about $14.2 billion in 2018. We guided to $13.5 billion to $14.5 billion, so the midpoint is $14 billion, couple of hundred million lower than what we showed in 2018 on actuals. And we actually swung a few hundred million from indirect SI&A to direct our SI&A. So our SI&A, as we're working our way through Lyrica patent cliff. So think about that will take place in 2019, 2020, we remain tough on SI&A. On R&D, as you look at our R&D, we guided $7.8 billion to $8.3 billion. We spent about $8 billion last year. We'll watch the R&D number, but given how our late stage pipeline, we expect that to grow, we think R&D will continue to grow. Once we get past the Lyrica LOE, beginning at 2021 with 2020 as a base, we expect that top line to grow into mid-single-digit. And we will make sure, we leverage that relative to the bottom line, get operating leverage margin and margin expansion, so that revenues are growing at a rate that's more than the expenses. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much. And I see, Mikael, you want to make a comment? Mikael Dolsten : I just wanted to make sure since you had this keen formulation interest, Umer, that the 61 milligram free acid formulation is equivalent to the 80 milligram top dose that we used in the clinical trial. So that would be a single tablet as an alternative and potential available latest for pending review. There is no difference in dose. It is just the dosage form. Albert Bourla : Perfect. Umer Raffat : Thank you. Charles Triano : Next question, please, operator? Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Schott from J.P. Morgan. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks very much for the questions. So I just two here. The first was on tanezumab. Can you just talk about the profile that you see emerging from these first two studies, I guess, specifically on RPOA type 2 and this case of osteonecrosis. I just want to understand, you've had some dialogue that you're starting these studies, it's on acceptable levels of these signals. Can you just confirm that what you're seeing so far is below what you think is an acceptable threshold in terms of safety? And then my second question was about Xtandi and key drivers going forward. And here, I guess, you see the traction you'd hope to see the label expansion and you expect any impact as you think about generic for Zytiga, Eliquis on 2019? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Chris. Let's have John start with the tanezumab - answer the tanezumab question and then maybe Mikael can jump in. And then Angela, can you please take the Xtandi question. John Young : Okay. Thanks for the question, Chris. So let me just sort of context just by saying from a review of the two studies that readout to date, we continue to believe that tanezumab has the potential to offer a new non-opioid treatment for sustained efficacy for moderate-to-severe OA, osteoarthritis and chronic lower back pain patients. We're not receiving adequate relief or can tolerate other analgesics and also for cancer pain patients, and those are the patient populations in our pivotal studies. We also see that tanezumab has the potential to address serious high unmet need for those patients. We estimate that there are around 27 million Americans living with osteoarthritis, 33 million patients living with chronic lower back pain. Many of those patients fail to achieve adequate pain relief despite treatment with various types of pain medications. Additionally, we also know that the misuse of an addiction to opioids leads to more than 150 deaths every day in the United States. It's estimated that 21% to 29% of patients prescribed opioids for chronic pain misuse them and 8% to 12% develop an opioid use disorder. So we remain encouraged by the emerging and clinical profile for tanezumab although we recognized that many questions still need to be answered. Last year, we saw a data from one Phase 3 OA study, which was study 1056. That population represented about 10% of the total number of patients in our Phase 3 program, which overall includes six Phase 3 studies and around 7,000 patients in osteoarthritis, chronic lower back pain and cancer pain. So today's study, we announced earlier on today, we shared top line results from our second Phase 3 OA study, which is 1057. And that population represents another 12% of the total number of patients in our Phase 3 program. So in summary, I would say we continue to see datasets readout. We have more than three quarters of the total number of patients in our Phase 3 program still to readout although the profile unit's emerging and that's to say there are many questions that we still need to answer about the profile of the product. Overall, we remain very positive. Mikael, maybe you can add specific answer to Chris' question. Mikael Dolsten : Thank you, John. That was a terrific overview of why we are excited about this new emerging potential pain drug class for patient in great need for new opportunities to treat difficult disease. With 1057 study, it was as we have projected and believe to expect RPOA in low-single-digit percent. In 1057, it was just above 2% versus 1056 above 1%. This is the range that we have assumed we'll come out in these trials. And, of course, now thousand patients, we have RPOA at 1.7%. Within the RPOA, I just wanted to punctuate that the majority of them are of type one, the milder case, with only joint narrowing - joint space narrowing and infrequent symptomatology and only one-third of them about - are tied with more significant radiological changes. Finally, we had one case of osteonecrosis, which is in line with our expectation that is going to be a rare event. We have now more than thousands patients in osteoarthritis treated with tanezumab, which gives us quite good opportunity to see an emerging drug profile with robust efficacy and as expected adverse event profile that for these patient type seems to me provide really favorable benefit to risk given the alternative treatments are few and would offer a way for us to treat difficult pain, avoiding abuse dependencies such as with opioid. And let me just conclude and say please remember that the type of patients in 1057 and 56 have been through at least three different classes of analgesics and on average had OA for more than six years, and have reported already with significant impact on their ability to function in everyday life. So for them, it's certainly is an important opportunity to treat their disease. And let me conclude with remind you that total joint replacement was similar across placebo in tanezumab treated, again, an important finding for us. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much, Mikael. And Angela, key drivers of growth for Xtandi, please? Angela Hwang : So let me begin by talking a little bit about how well Xtandi did in 2018 and how pleased we are with its performance, but also very optimistic about its future. As you heard Albert say, it is - Xtandi is one of the pillars of our Oncology business. So full year 2018, we grew 18%. Q4 versus Q4 2017, we grew 12%. And then if you include royalty revenues, Xtandi actually achieved over $1 billion in 2018. But when we step back and take a look at its growth strategy, I would describe it as follows : first, it's our base business in metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer. This was our first indication. And our growth strategy here has been focused on driving uptake among urologists. And we're really pleased with the progress that we've seen here. Today, more than 30% of our new scripts are written by urologists and we're continuing to see market share growth in this segment. The second segment and growth segment is the non-metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer segment, and this is the PROSPER data. And we've seen very positive trends here as well since the launch of PROSPER in July of 2018. Just in 6 months, our market share is quadruple that of Erleada, or if you look at it a different way it is equivalent to the combination of chemo use and Erleada combined. You may not see it on total sales yet, but that's because the new patients are coming into therapy - new patients are coming every day. So you may not see the full impact of this pool of patients which is still accumulating, so it will take time to realize. Finally, and the last opportunity, and the one that we're really excited about, is in the hormone-sensitive prostate cancer patient population, because this is where the duration of therapy will be the longest. In here, there are two patient segments. The first is based off of our ARCHES data. It's the metastatic hormone-sensitive patient. And there are about 38,000 new patients coming in a year. As you know, the results of ARCHES were announced in December. And it will be pressed at ASCO in February. We look forward to our discussions with the FDA to potentially support an expanded indication for Xtandi here. The second segment of growth is going to be in the non-metastatic hormone-sensitive patient. In here, there are about 30,000 new patients a year. This is being studied in the EMBARK trial, which will read out next year. So in totality, we believe that we have excellent data and we also have the potential for new indications. And this will enable Pfizer to make significant impact on patients' lives, but importantly, to change the standard of care for prostate cancer. You also asked the question on the impact of generic Zytiga. And here, we expect the Zytiga generics to have a minimal impact on our business. Typically, generic impact is greatest with the originator brand. In this instance, Xtandi also has indications that are different from Zytiga. And in addition to that, our dosing frequency is different. We also are - we also don't have the requirement for steroid co-administration and we also have differences in monitoring requirements. So I think that all of these will stand well in terms of making switching less likely and for the impact on Xtandi to be minimal as we expect. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Angela. And as I said before for the Bavencio, Inlyta and Tafamidis products, equally excited by Tanezumab and the Xtandi, particularly with the new indications that are coming. Charles Triano : Thank you, all. Next question please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets. Alex Arfaei : Great. Thank you very much. First on Xeljanz, you obviously have strong momentum there. You have a formidable competitor coming, expected this year. They have a lot of rebates leverage. You have for JAKs coming, TNF biosimilars, TYK2, obviously, a lot of activity in this market, so I'm just wondering how you're thinking about the commercial dynamics in major immunology markets. And then a follow-up in emerging markets, obviously very strong performance for your legacy products like in cardiovascular disease, Lipitor and so on. I'm just wondering how sustainable is that in your view. Thank you very much. Albert Bourla : Yes, on Xeljanz, I will ask Angela to comment. But just to make an initial comment, but Xeljanz already has this year $1.8 billion. So Xeljanz already have crossed the threshold. But it is quite important to be able to be stopped by exclusionary practices that maybe leaders can have in contracting. But I will ask Angela to comment on the growth prospects of Xeljanz in 2019 and beyond. Angela Hwang : Sure. So first of all, just beginning with 2018, as Albert said, I mean, tremendous growth that we've seen in Xeljanz, 37% growth Q4 over last year Q4, and particularly in the U.S., really strong double-digit growth, about 26%. What we're seeing here in Xeljanz, and I'll start with the U.S. is really the mobilization of all of the indications for Xeljanz. We see strong uptake for Xeljanz in rheumatoid arthritis and really a great experience, and I think in comfort by rheumatologists in prescribing Xeljanz. So just as an example, about 53% of U.S. patients now are using Xeljanz without Methotrexate as monotherapy, which is just great progress in terms of, I think, demonstrating the confidence that rheumatologists have with Xeljanz. But what we also saw towards the end of last year was the launches of PsA and UC. And another example here of the growth that we've experienced in terms of the Q4 volume growth, a third of that volume growth came from these two new indications. And just as another example of why we're excited about these new indications, in UC specifically our early data shows that we've also recently surpassed Simponi in terms of new patient market share. So I think in the U.S., we continue to see a tremendous growth, possible across all of these indications. And as you know, we have other indications that are part of our lifecycle management that we will be continuing to work on. Globally, we have launched RA, UC, as well as PsA. But what we are in the middle of is gaining reimbursement for these new indications. We're encouraged by recent signs from payers of the acceptance of Xeljanz in these new indications such as the nice approval that we got in 2018 for both UC and the PsA indications. The net-net when we sort of bring together all of these indications, RA, which is our base business, but now tagging on UC and PsA, we see between both of these two new indications a market that's approximately $10 billion large. And I think over time with reimbursement, but also the increased comfort level and experience that rheumatologists, gastroenterologists will have with prescribing Xeljanz, we expect to see continued and strong growth from this franchise. I think you asked a question about competitors as well. And certainly this is a class that is hugely competitive. But I think that Pfizer's long experience and I think track record of success in JAK science as well as our deep entrenched commercial footprint in rheumatology and now in gastroenterology will stand us well as we deal with this increased competition. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Thank you, Angela. And I will ask Frank to give us some numbers and comment on emerging markets. Just an initial comment from my side, but emerging markets is and will continue to be a key strength for us and the key pillar of growth, and particularly in the context of the new organization. Let's not forget that a very big part of the emerging markets business has become part of the Upjohn group. And this was exactly engineered, so that we would be able to maximize the growth and particularly in areas like Asia and particularly China, but they have the biggest potential. But, Frank, why don't you give us some numbers to color the picture? Frank D'Amelio: Sure. So, Alex, emerging markets for the quarter, $3.3 billion in sales for the year, $12.65 billion in sales, each up 13% on an operational basis, strong performance; China for the quarter and the year, more than 20% growth. So you asked what do we expect growing forward. We believe we could continue to grow emerging markets in the low-double-digits on going forward basis. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Charles Triano : Next question please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes is from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Vamil Divan : Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. So a couple if I could. So, one, just around 2019 guidance, can you just elaborate a little bit more what you're assuming in terms of net price increases in the U.S. into the guidance? And maybe just with all the discussions on a DC, are there any significant changes that you're assuming may take place in the 2019 timeframe? And then, just the second one is more on the oncology side. Any update around when we might see some of the adjuvant breast cancer data from Ibrance? I know that's a key part of the next, sort of part of the growth story for that franchise. So maybe you can share anything there. And then, similarly with Bavencio, we did some work around the immuno-oncology adjuvant opportunity. And then it doesn't look like there's a lot of work being done with Bavencio there. Maybe you can comment on any adjuvant opportunity for that product. Thanks. Albert Bourla : Right, on 2019 guidance and the pricing I will ask again Frank to run us on the numbers. Frank D'Amelio: Sure. So, Vamil, in terms price, in the U.S. for 2019, we assume net price will be flat and worldwide we're assuming price that's in the negative low-single-digits, so minus low-single-digits and U.S. flat. Albert Bourla : And I just want to make a comment here that it's very clear, that pricing is not going to be a growth driver for us now and I think in the future. It's very clear. So this is all included in our guidance, and it is also included in our projections for mid-single-digit growth, post the Lyrica LOE for the 5 years. And that will come from breakthrough medicines and based on volume rather than in price increases. And with that, the Oncology question about Ibrance. Let me pass it to Angela, please. Angela Hwang : Sure. So we're really excited about the adjuvant opportunity. And as you said, it is the third part of our growth strategy, so very important part of our growth story for Ibrance, but also for Oncology in general. The two studies, PENELOPE-B and PALLAS, all the studies that we are looking forward to. Both of them are going well and have recruited faster than expected. And these studies are important, because they give us the potential to double the number of patients that are eligible for Ibrance. But we have to remember that these studies are event-driven and based on our projections should read out sometime next year. So I think more to come on that as we progress through the clinical trials. Then I think you had a second question on\u2026 Albert Bourla : Bavencio, I think John maybe you can take it, and then you can add Angela. Angela Hwang : Okay. John Young : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Vamil. So we are obviously continuing our effort with the execution of the avelumab development program. It includes 30 ongoing studies, seven of which are potentially registration enabling, involving more than 9,000 patients across 15 tumor types. I think it's always important when we talk about IO to say that we have always recognized believe that the real value of IO is expected to be in effective combinations. And we believe that solid preclinical science, we are in a good position to be competitive in a number of tumor types, it really underpins our development strategy. One example of that, I think, Albert's already commented on is the JAVELIN Renal 101 trial, combined by Bavencio with Inlyta in previously untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma patients. And the combination provides a superior progression survival compared to Sutent. There are two additional immunotherapy Phase 3 studies ongoing, including axitinib with pembrolizumab in first line renal cell carcinoma, which study is a sponsored by MSD and also enzalutamide, and atezolizumab and CRPC, which is sponsored by Genentech and Roche. But I think, in terms of the wider development program, which is kind of where you're driving, we're currently testing up to 10 Pfizer combinations with checkpoint inhibitors including five targeted Pfizer therapies. We also have a number of studies combining avelumab and talazoparib across the range of indications. So that really speaks to just the way that we see Bavencio as being potentially valuable therapy in some important areas of high unmet need for patients, where we believe combinations could really advance standard of care. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Charles Triano : Thank you. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Timothy Anderson : Thank you. I have a few questions. I don't want to put your cart before the horse on this, but 2020 consensus has earnings growth being nearly flat. There are a variety of pushes and pulls. You're launching new products. You have some strong growing inline brands, but you still have Lyrica LOE spilling over into 2020. I'm wondering if you can comment on how you kind of view where consensus sits on the earnings line. Is 2020 likely to be a flattish year as well? Second question is on this other income deductions line. I'm just wondering why the change in heart and how you account for the impact of unrealized and realized gains and losses. Why different in 2019 versus 2018? Was that at the advice of your accountants or the IRS or someone else? And then last question on the JAK1 inhibitor for atopic dermatitis, and you have a Phase 3 reading out in 2019. Can we assume you'll need two Phase 3s for approval in that indication and would the second one readout if it does require to? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Why - Frank, why don't you deal with the question about the consensus and the OID. And then Mikael can discuss the JAK1 Phase 3 study. Frank D'Amelio: So first, Tim, on the OID question, that was my decision in terms of taking the gain or loss on equity securities, equity investments out of adjustment income. New accounting was put in place in the beginning of 2018 in terms of realizing or booking gains and unrealized gains into results. The amount of - the size of the gains in 2018 surprised us quite frankly, introduced a lot of volatility into our numbers. So I decided at the beginning of 1/1/2019, we will take that out. By the way, please note, I actually think that if we left it in, that the probability of that being a good guy is much higher than if it were a bad guy to our 2019 results. But I thought the best thing to do was to take it out, because there's introducing a level of volatility that isn't part of our core business. So we removed it for that reason. But we tried to show that on the guidance that we provided to you all in our release at the bottom of Page #2. Then in terms of the 2020 numbers, I won't comment on consensus, obviously, in terms of our rhythm of the numbers. For job one is we got to deliver on what we've just said in 2019. 2020 we will still have the challenge of the Lyrica LOE. We'll get the full year effect of that in 2020, so we'll have to work our way through that relative to the business. Obviously, we'll do everything we can to work our way through that relative to earnings Albert Bourla : Thank you, Frank. Mikael, what about JAK1, how many Phase 3 studies we need? Mikael Dolsten : So I would say like this, we think it's very large opportunity for the JAK1 in atopic dermatitis. And we're very excited about the profile, as you remember, from our Phase 2 studies that this drug class seems to have real rapid activity both in clearing skin eczema and in pruritus itching. We have actually two trials reading out in 2019, one in May and one in September range. Give or take with sometime as these trials can conclude. And we actually have significant program here to potential establish this as a very significant product, with also trials reading out in 2020 including a comparator trial to [dupixend] [ph] and I think particular area is to look at the rapid onset of JAK versus biologicals. There is a mechanism of action started to provide additional insight and also 52 weeks longer term study. So it's a very comprehensive data package. But please look out for our 2019 data readout that will tell us the initial outcome of this exciting new drug classes. Albert Bourla : The strength of your profile as it will emerge. Thank you, Mikael. Charles Triano : Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald. Louise Chen : Hi, thanks for taking my question. First question, I had was on tanezumab. Do you think the RPOA and the other safety imbalances are a result of the drug or the patient population? And then second question I had was if you could provide any sort of efficacy data with respect to the two arms? Or if you can't, how does it compare to what we saw on the 16-week data? And then last question I had was just on your leverage as you move past these LOEs, what kind of leverage can we assume to the bottom line and how much better will it be than what we see now? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Mikael, can you please deal with the tanezumab question, please? Mikael Dolsten : Yeah. I mean, certainly we know from historical trials that patient with advanced OA are more likely to develop RPOA than patients with chronic lower back pain that in general have healthier joints. That's number one. Number two about tanezumab relationship to this, I think we will get a better understanding as we see this year, the comparator trial with NSAIDs for OA and with opioids in chronic lower back pain. That will allow us to understand the incidence of RPOA on different treatment. But please let me just underline, each drug class has its profile. And of course opioid, as you know, which is the major comparator for us in chronic lower back pain are associated with a range of very difficult side effects including fatal outcome for tens of thousands of Americans every year, very different from low-single-digit orthopedic injury that we have discussed. And let me even remind you that NSAIDs, which in general has been not a very effective on advanced OA or of course associated with gastro intestinal risks of bleeding and also been associated with cardiovascular risk. So overall, we think that tanezumab represents a new emerging drug class with a very interesting efficacy and we will learn more about exact tolerability safety profile later this year, but we remain a very positive about this offering for patient pending of course finalization of studies and potential regulatory process. Albert Bourla : Thank you, thank you, Mikael. And as regards to the leverage to the bottom line, let me ask the master of levers, Frank D'Amelio, to comment. Frank D'Amelio: So Louise, here's how I think about this and to kind of connect back to Tim's question. We need to work our way through 2019. We need to work our way through 2020, work our way through the Lyrica LOE and the major impact of the Lyrica LOE in those two periods. We get to 2021, LOEs decline materially. Our pipelines kicking in, our online products are kicking in, our emerging markets are continuing to grow. That's where we see this inflection point in terms of the rhythm of the business, the rhythm of the numbers. We think we can grow that top line mid-single-digits, so approximately 5%. We think, clearly, we can grow the top line, when we grow the top line mid-single-digits, we can clearly grow the bottom line more than mid-single-digits. Hopefully our actions over the years have demonstrated our ability to do that. So that's how I think about this in terms of rhythm of the business. Albert Bourla : Well said, Frank. Charles Triano : Thanks, everybody. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. David Risinger : Yes. Thanks very much. Just to follow up on 2020. So obviously the patent expiration of Lyrica annualizes in June of 2020. So do you think that Pfizer can return to revenue growth in the second half of 2020 after that annualizes, Frank? Or are there other factors that would preclude a return to growth in that second half period? And then with respect to Ibrance, I was just hoping for some perspective on what we should expect for U.S. sales in 2019 relative to 2018. Obviously sales have been flattening out according to the IMS data, but should we be expecting U.S. sales to be flat in 2019 versus 2018 or could they be down slightly due to competition gaining share? Any color would be helpful. Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you. And obviously, we do not provide guidance for the year after and also we do not comment - provide guidance on individual products, particularly on an individual region of an individual product. But I will ask Frank to give some color on the 2020 and what happens after the second quarter, and then of course Angela to give at least the dynamics of the market. Frank D'Amelio: So Dave, I'll do my best to try to answer this, but to Albert's point, trying to provide 2020 guidance and breaking it down into quarters and halves is extremely difficult. What I would say is this; there will still be material LOE impacts from Lyrica in 2020. So we still view 2020 as a challenging year. I think the real pivot point, the real inflection point become 2021 using 2020 as the base year. That's where I think we can really show some major league progress on the top line and then dropping that to the bottom. Albert Bourla : I'm going into quarter after quarter, of course, just to something that we don't want to speculate now. And Angela? Angela Hwang : So I think as we think about Ibrance in the U.S., certainly we have been very pleased with the performance of Ibrance to date. I mean, just really strong growth quarter-over-quarter or even full year over full year. But the way we look at it in the three phases of growth is how we think about its growth prospects. So Phase 1 is this U.S. launch in metastatic breast cancer, which includes our growth of the CDK class as well as our own leadership of that class. And in this regard, being that we had such rapid uptick initially, we have now reached a 50% class share, which we are very pleased with, though we know that this is the point that we will need to continue to expand on in order to generate further growth. But certainly, the fact that we've been able to treat 95,000 patients in the U.S. with metastatic breast cancer is very positive for us. And then the other phase of our growth is our international launches, which really began in 2018. And here we've exceeded our expectations as well. We have treated more than 85,000 patients' ex-U.S. through the launches in Japan, in the EU, in China and Brazil towards the end of last year. So I think in 2019, that's going to be another focus area of growth for us. And then Phase 3, we talked about already a little bit earlier which is our adjuvant population, which is coming up. But maybe just sort of coming back to the U.S. and specifically where the growth is coming from, we do see the class growth at 50% as one that - as one where, additional opportunities can be found. And I think that what we are now focused on is breaking the entrenchment with the single agent endocrine therapy, which will then allow us to grow the CDK class. But we also clear about what it is that we need to do here. So just as an example, we know that 25% of our key accounts have more than 40% share in the single agent endocrine therapy. So we're really focused on targeting our HCP education very carefully in this area. We also know that educating a newly diagnosed HR positive, HER2 negative patients about the significant clinical benefits of adding Ibrance in first line therapy is an important aspect of our work. And here we know that the data show that in the first line setting, when you add Ibrance to endocrine therapy, you achieved a longer progression free survival of about 12 months. So we think that this is really important information for patients to have. So when you look at the totality of our data, our access, our strong leadership position, but also the strategy that we have, we believe that we can really make a difference from a patient impact perspective, and we see great potential for growth for Ibrance. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Charles Triano : Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason Gerberry from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jason Gerberry : Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my questions. I guess just - I'm not sure that you'll be able to answer this, but just on tanezumab. Was there any sort of dose response with respect to the RPOA rates? I believe in the prior study at ACR, there was a bit of a dose-related response. So I was just curious to what extent you can comment on that. And then also just with the RPOA, did - I know, there was an additional dose that was provided in this trial versus prior trials, so just sort of curious if the inclusion of an additional dose if events were skewed early or late in the treatment period? And then one housekeeping item, do you expect to be in the market for Rituxan, at time of market formation, which is I think the Street's thinking around mid to second half of 2019. Thanks. Albert Bourla : Michael, you want to take the tanezumab question? Mikael Dolsten : Yeah. Thank you for the interest in the product. And as we've said previously we were very pleased with readout of 1057 and 1056 more than thousand patients with robust efficacy we reported on the 5 milligram across all three primer end point and two of them on 2.5 milligram. We have not seen on these two doses any difference in the tolerability or safety profile and feel that we understand the profile very well. And we're also pleased to report that total joint replacement was similar versus placebo. So I think that speaks to the strengths of the dataset we have. And we look forward to share data in more details at the upcoming conference and report out additional studies this year. Albert Bourla : Yes, very nice, interesting tanezumab overview. Angela, about the biosimilar Rituxan? Angela Hwang : So our plans are on track. And we are planning to launch Rituxan in 2019. And we look forward to receiving the approvals and then planning for our launch. Charles Triano : Great. Thank you, Angela. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Geoff Meacham : Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Sorry to ask another one on the 2019-2020 growth profile. But, Albert, is there willingness to be more active on commercial stage M&A, just the change of growth profile until 2021, even divesting lower growth franchises? I'm trying to see how proactive Pfizer will be versus just waiting until after the Lyrica LOE. And then another one on biosimilars, there's obviously lots of launches coming up, including Rituxan. How will the strategy evolve from a pricing and access perspective? And what are the main lessons you guys have learned so far from Inflectra just of late that can help accelerate the launches? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Angela will answer in a moment the biosimilars question about our - that you asked, pricing and what is our strategy there. But, look, on 2019 and 2020, as I said, we will be proactive. But proactive doesn't mean that our focus it is how to change the profile of 2019. Proactive means how we're going to enhance the growth profile of Pfizer in the pivotal moment of this company after the June-July of 2020 or in 2021 we'll see it as a full year. So in the commercial space, again, we are looking for opportunities with our - to deploy capital that will help. But the direction right now, it is to enhance our growth profile and not to dilute it. And the direction right now, it is not to disturb operationally the business in this very critical phase that we are trying to get the pipeline through the finish line, prepare the markets commercially, and then launch the products. And this is the focus really. Angela, what about biosimilars? Angela Hwang : So we are looking forward to the launch of 3 additional oncology biosimilars in our portfolio in 2019. And I think that what we've learned about the biosimilar market is that it is a - we believe in it from a potential perspective and from a growth perspective. What we're also seeing are differences in the EU and in the U.S. So in the EU, we see a very rapid uptake and actually great acceptance of biosimilars. And if I just use Infliximab molecule as an example, the Infliximab biosimilars are about 65% of the total molecule. And we've seen rapid uptake and great acceptance by customers, by payers. We see a market that I think is evolving and developing in the U.S. And I think that our experience with Infliximab in the U.S. really is not a great analogy for what might be to come with our new oncology biosimilars, just because they're just very different dynamics in the I&I space compared to the oncology space. The big difference in the I&I space is in the U.S. is the exclusionary contracting from J&J, which is really prevented and been a great impediment to our ability to grow the I&I biosimilar. Rebates rather than net price has really driven I think formulary access. And that has been a great barrier to our ability to grow. However, we see different dynamics in the oncology space. And that is because oncology drugs are shorter in duration of therapy, so that allows new patients to turn over faster. And it will make it easier for the physicians to initiate new patient on oncology biosimilars. And we believe that this will enable customers to benefit from the cost savings that they can derive from biosimilars much more quickly than what you might see in the I&I space where the duration of therapy is very long. It's a long chronic disease. So we are excited about the upcoming launches of our oncology biosimilars and we expect our entire biosimilar portfolio to be a strong contributor to growth to Pfizer in 2019. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Angela. Geoff Meacham : Great. Thanks for the insights. Charles Triano : And we'll take our last question, please, operator. Operator : Your final question comes from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Seamus Fernandez : Hi, thanks very much for the question. So my question really was on tanezumab. I know there's been a lot of questions around the safety side. But the low dose didn't separate from placebo on one of the co-primary endpoints. And just wanted to understand a little bit better how you guys are feeling about the differences in this particular patient population to really give you strong conviction that the assumed benefit of efficacy of this novel mechanism are going to be sustained. Albert Bourla : Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : Thank you. First, let me point out that the 5-milligram dose in 1056 and 1057 performed very well, consistent, robust on all three primary endpoint in both of the studies. The 2.5 milligram performed with statistical significance in 1056 on all three primary endpoints. And on the two most important, it was positive pain and physical function. It was positive on overall assessment of OA at several time point, but narrowly missed at 24-week. Often what happens in this type of trials in pain is that you may have variability in placebo response at various time points that is likely to influence. But please note that numerically we are still pleased with the response to 2.5 milligram at all-time point. And we think we have 2 doses that offer so far robust, consistent efficacy in a very advanced patient population and we feel that we consistently have reported the tolerability and safety profile. So we look forward to conclude the trials with another osteoarthritis later this spring and a chronic lower back pain. And so far, we are very pleased with tanezumab. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael, and just thank you, everyone, for your great questions. I was very pleased to see that the majority of the focus right now is on our pipeline. And I think you're right. This is where it should be. And we are looking forward for an equally great 2019 as we had in 2018. Chuck? Charles Triano : Great. Thank you, everybody, for your attention this morning. This will end the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude Pfizer's fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day everyone, and welcome to Pfizer's First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir. Chuck Triano : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer's first quarter 2019 performance and 2019 financial guidance. I am joined today by our CEO, Albert Bourla; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten President of Worldwide Research and Development; Angela Hwang; Group President, Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group; John Young, our Chief Commercial Officer;and Doug Lankler General Counsel. The slides that will be presented on this call were posted to our Web site earlier this morning and are available at Pfizer.com/investors. We'll see here that slide three covers our legal disclosures. Albert and Frank will now make prepared remarks and then we'll move to a question-and-answer session. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Albert Bourla. Albert? Albert Bourla : Thank you, Chuck, and good morning everyone. It's been a busy and productive first few months as CEO. I've had the pleasure of meeting with many of you to discuss Pfizer's long-term growth prospects. I have also met with thousands of colleagues from around the world. All of them are committed to driving sustainable growth through scientific and commercial innovation, all in creating capital allocation and a renewed focus on our purpose, breakthroughs that change patient's life. I'm pleased to report that we began the year with a strong first quarter. Revenues were up 5% operationally companywide. This was driven by 8% volume growth, offset by net pricing decline of 3%. If we look at our Biopharmaceuticals Groups, which represented 70% of our revenue base this quarter, we generated a strong 11% volume growth, and realized a net pricing decline of 3%. We saw volume growth in several key brands, emerging markets and biosimilars, and we got our Upjohn business up and running. Let's begin with our result also from the Biopharmaceuticals Group. This business grew its top line 7% operationally, due primarily to the continued strength of several key brands, including Eliquis, Ibrance, Prevnar 13, and Xeljanz. Eliquis had a strong start to the year, growing its revenues by 36% operationally in the quarter. Eliquis continues to extend its leadership in many major geographies around the world, and in the U.S. we achieved an all-time high prescription served  for the brand this quarter. We remain pleased with the performance of Ibrance. Global revenues in the first quarter increased 25% operationally to $1.1 billion. As you know, the Ibrance growth story is now predominantly in international markets, where we saw 107% operational growth in the quarter. This was driven by continued strong uptake in developed Europe, Japan, and certain emerging markets. In the U.S., we saw 2% growth which reflected continued moderating volumes in approved metastatic breast cancer indications. Frank D'Amelio: Thanks, Albert. Good day everyone. As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast. Now moving on to the financials, first quarter 2019 revenues were approximately $13.1 billion, which reflects operational growth of $664 million or 5%. And the unfavorable impact the foreign exchange of $453 million or 4%. Our biopharmaceuticals Group business recorded 7% operational revenue growth in the first quarter, driven primarily by Eliquis and Xeljanz globally, Ibrance primarily in international markets, and Prevnar 13 and emerging markets in the U.S., all of which were partially offset by the clients in our hospital and rare disease businesses. Revenues for our Upjohn business in the first quarter increased 1% operationally, primarily due to 25% operational growth and emerging markets, driven by strong value driven operational growth in China, primarily from Lipitor, Norvasc, and Celebrex partially offset by a 9% operational decline in developed markets primarily driven by lower revenues for Viagra and Upjohn's authorized generic for Viagra in the U.S. due to increased recent generic competition; Lyrica, primarily due to lower volumes in the U.S. and wholesaler de-stocking in advance of anticipated generic competition, beginning June 30, and in developed Europe from continued generic competition, and Greenstone Upjohn's authorized generic subsidiary, primarily due to industry wide pricing challenges in the U.S. Revenues of our consumer healthcare business declined 2% operationally reflecting an 8% decline in the U.S. partially offset by 4% operational growth in international markets. Chuck Triano : Thank you, Frank and Albert for you prepared remarks. At this point, we would like to move to our Q&A session please. Operator? Operator :  Your first question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Tim Anderson : Thank you. A couple of questions please. On your 20-valent Prevnar follow-on, I am hoping you can talk about when you expect that to move in the pediatrics? It's your largest product Prevnar 13. It's a race between you and Merck to come up with a new and improved version of Prevnar 13. You guys are the incumbent, yet you are not yet in phase 3 in peds, and Merck is. I am wondering if that potentially foretells if there is some sort of formulation problems with your product in peds. So asking for assurances that there are. Second question is on Ibrance and just the longer term international opportunity if you look at major cancer drug precedent in the past by their companies, lot of the times those product sell more outside the U.S. eventually than they do in the U.S. Wondering if that could happen here with Ibrance in the CDK 4/6 class because that's not how it's being modeled, or has there been too money price concessions made such that it's not really achievable? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Tim, thank you very much. Both excellent questions; I will ask Mikael to address the question on our 20-valent compared to 15-valent from the Merck? And then Angela will answer the question about Ibrance. So that, Mike? Mikael Dolsten : Yes, thank you. We are very pleased with our 2-valent pnuemo next generation vaccine that covers the certain stereotypes of Prevnar 13 plus seven new ones. These seven new ones were careful selected to make sure we have a broad coverage of emerging invasive pneumococcal disease strains associated with high case fatality rates and antibiotic-resistance in some cases combined with meningitis. We communicated our adult data at the ECCMID Conference recently which showed a compelling profile which also of course was linked to the breakthrough designation by FDA. We are moving with good and robust pace forward in the pediatric settings. As you know, in the pediatric settings, we have multiple immunization as well as a boost as is the current regimen for use of conjugate vaccines which is different from the adult trial that are fast as it's only one immunization. We look forward to read out from the infant trial need to of this year in phase 2 proof-of-concept study, and pending review those data sets, we look forward to interaction with regulatory agency and swift moving forward into a potential pivotal start. We are very pleased with the formulation. It was very well-tolerated this far and think we have included all experiences from decades of pneumococcal work into our plan. Albert Bourla : And I would like also to remind that we have a very strong patent portfolios on Prevnar. Angela, would you like to address the question with Ibrance please? Angela Hwang : Thank you. Ibrance revenue growth continues to be very strong ex-U.S. And you heard Albert mentioned in his opening remarks that currently we are growing at 107% in Q1 of 2019. We believe this growth to be sustainable as we see that there is still significant room to grow in this CDK class as well as our own market share. Just as an example in the EU 5 this CDK class is currently 35% of all first-line new patient starts while we have 86% Ibrance class share. In Japan, as an example, this CDK class is only 21% first-line new patient starts and a 100% of the Ibrance class share. So while we are continuing build our Japan and EU business, we will also intensely focus on our launches in the emerging markets. So far, we have seen 122% operational growth year-on-year in the emerging markets, and led by double digit growth that we are seeing in Argentina, India, Saudi Arabia as an example. We have launches coming up both in Brazil and China which we are very excited about, and we expect these to be very strong contributors to our 2019 growth trajectory. So, in view of the three big  phases of growth of Ibrance, the first being the U.S., which is where we began with our first indication. Now in our international launches which are moving beyond the developed markets to the emerging markets. And then the anticipation of our adjuvant indications to come with Ibrance, we continue to be extremely optimistic, and I feel very positive about the growth trajectory of Ibrance. Albert Bourla : Great. Thanks, Angela. Next question please, Operator? Operator : Your next question comes from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Vamil Divan : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. The first on extending the sales there were a little lighter than we thought and just wondering if there is any onetime item. The prescription trend also seemed a little lower last quarter than what we were seeing in the past. So, comments there. And then just maybe outlook for that product longer term, I know you have expanded label and new indications coming, so just so you could frame how you see that longer term? And then second on the DMD data you mentioned coming in June. It's interesting a lot of focus on that even though it's pretty early day. So maybe if you could just sort of help sort of frame expectations around that in terms of what we will actually see and what we should be expecting going into just so people sort of have appropriate expectations given that it is such early data. Thanks. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much, Vamil. Angela, I think you can cover the Xtandi question, and then, John, if you can please discuss the DMD data on ? Angela Hwang : Thank you. Well, we have seen very strong prescriber adoption of Xtandi across all of our indications. I think that this demonstrates the confidence that prescribers have with Xtandi. Year-on-year urologists have prescribed -- prescribing has grown 45%. And oncology prescribing has grown 20%. We are also pleased with the uptake of Xtandi in non-metastatic CRPC. This is our PROSPER trial. Even though this was launched just eight months ago, its market share is already equivalent to our metastatic indication which was launched seven years ago. And this market share is more than doubled that of a leader in non-metastatic CRPC. We have yet to realize the full potential of PROSPER, because the impact of patient accumulation and the longer days of therapy are still to come, and just as a reminder, the days of therapy for the PROSPER trial is 18 months. This quarter, as you say, the U.S. net revenue did lag behind total patient demand. But this was due to some gross to net adjustments, some inventory differences, and our free drug program. But we continue to believe in the strong growth potential of all of our indications, and we look forward to our indication from both the ARCHES and the EMBARK Trials, which will continue to drive growth through expansion into new patient segments and offer longer  days of therapy. So we need to stay the course with our strategies, and we believe the impact from PROSPER as well as our new indications will drive future growth, change the standard of care, and meet high patient unmet needs. John Young : . : Albert Bourla : Thank you, John. It's a devastating disease, and we all hope that the solution that we are working and others, but the solution that we are working would be really transformational. Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Schott from J.P. Morgan. Chris Schott : Thanks very much. Just two bigger picture questions, I guess, the first one with the progress you've been seeing on the pipeline, can you just update us in terms of where you see business development fitting into the longer term view and strategy for the company. I guess, specifically, I think you have been clear that larger deals are off the table for now, but when we think about bolt-ons, what type of size of deal could that encompass and what are the latest priorities in terms of commercial stage assets versus clinical assets et cetera? And my second question with the Upjohn division, do you believe it would be possible to eventually separate and spin this division from the rest of Pfizer and if so what are the factors and kind of data points we need to be watching that would make that type of separation something that would be possible at the time? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Yes. With the business development, I will ask John to comment and you have heard our comments that we plan to invest significantly in business development. It's a little bit different, the way that we plan to do it right now. Before we were targeting revenues, now or soon -- right now, the focus, it is how to -- and because this is what we needed at the time. And now our growth, I think organically is going to be robust post 2020. So what we are looking for, it is to enhance even further our pipeline. So, as regards the direction in how we are selecting clinical, John, can you please make a comment? John has the responsibility of managing this strategic area for us. John Young : All right. Thanks, Albert, and thanks Chris for the question. So I wouldn't repeat what Albert has already said about the reorientation of our focus of  opportunities to really strengthening our pipeline with clinical stage assets. I think, if you were to look into the future, I think you'll see us continue to be very active in business development, but I think with our focus generally on earlier to mid stage opportunities where clinical risk may be higher as data is less mature, but we believe that the opportunity for value creation is greater. And the risk, importantly, of operational disruption to the pipeline, internal pipeline, which is obviously maturing, we believe, very nicely, is going to be lower. Certainly, in terms of what size we consider to be a bolt-on, generally, we don't comment specifically on size. I think you would say that assets that are in the range of a few billion dollars, we would consider to be bolt-on acquisitions, and that's really complements our pipeline. So we are very excited about the opportunities that we have and that's something that's particularly we're going to be focused on over the months ahead. Albert Bourla : Thank you, John, and maybe I can provide some color to your question about Upjohn. It's a good question and I received a lot this question and I understand the reasons. Right now, as I said nothing is changed other than Upjohn performed very well in the first quarter. It's always said that our focus it is to make sure that we strength up this business in that way, that will operate affected and the fact remains that in the very new lean construct with the management relocated in China where most of the opportunities are as evident from the first quarter also where most of the challenges we're come as we know that there are some reforms that the Chinese government taking into this business. So right now, it's very, very pleased with the way that the whole thing has evolved. If we think that we could separate the down their hope, yes, it is a possibility, but this is not what it is, in my mind right now. First, we need to make sure, but we have a strong stand-alone business. So we are working to make sure that of the rates absorb as a subsidiary within a company. Chuck Triano : Great, thank you, Albert, and John. Next question please, Operator? Operator : Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Geoff Meacham : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. Mike and Albert, just wanted to see if you had any additional color on the recent add long-term data, just in particular the RPOA rates and I know you're awaiting FDA feedback. But would you view the totality of the data so far or the unmet need is still warranting filing at this point. And then another one on BD somewhat, so on the gene therapy front, you guys are obviously progressing a number of programs hemophilia DMD, but a lot of BD activity in this area. Recently, so the question has the decision to buy versus build, or partner change for Pfizer over time, it seemed like post the Bamboo deal you guys have a working platform that really could add multiple indications quickly I just wasn't sure what the, what the strategy is there. Thank you. Albert Bourla : Right. I will ask Mikael and John to comment on Tanezumab. So John, why don't you start and then maybe Mikael can give a little bit of scientific information? John Young : Yes. So look, thanks for the question, Geoff. Obviously we've released fairly significant commentary on the study in our press release. I wouldn't comment on that, but I think, let me just say for Tanezumab we are continuing to analyze the clinical profile based on the ongoing Phase 3 development program in both OE and chronic lower back pain. That includes in totality five Phase 3 studies and nearly 7,000 patients and we plan to review the totality of the data with regulatory authorities and we'll assess potential next steps for Tanezumab and as we engage with regulators will be in a position to provide an update in the coming months. Mikael Dolsten : It was very well-summarized John and of course it's a very large data sets from these recent Phase 3 and previous Phase 3. So it's a real opportunity to put together to tell it date together with our partner, Lilly, and have a discussion with regulatory agencies about that data set and paying landscape. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael, and then maybe I can give you an answer to your question about gene therapy, it is yes, as you said gene therapy is an area but of significant focus for us in this scenario that we started much earlier and our strategy was to combine our clinical expertise and said they're therapeutic areas together with biotech expertise as they were developing specific projects and very early we realized that in this category the bottleneck is going to be manufactured. This is why Pfizer embarked into significant investments to build a platform in manufacturing, which is progressing very, very well. As we look to the future, we plan to the box we grow our platform organically for projects that we're developing and indirectly through the licensing and partnership that we are going to make and actually the last partners, but we announced was in the gene therapy field for the Wilson disease, which is a lever disorder. We believe actually that exactly because of our track record of having successful partnerships, but also because we have built a significant manufacturing capability, we will become a partner of choice for Biotech that will see that the combination will unlock value for that. Chuck Triano : Great. Thanks for those responses, we move on to the next question please. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi. Andrew Baum : Thank you. Couple of questions please, firstly, you referenced these pending ACIP review for Prevnar 13, given the replacement there tight risks that we've seen because the pediatric vaccination. I know that your numbers and guidance includes those hedge their recommendation. What's your level of confidence and is high, which seems to be exactly why it is high given the meeting has been scheduled to discuss that. And then second, in reference to adequate. Could you talk to what you see is the likely impact on realized pricing and volumes for Eliquis sales within your Medicaid book of business assuming rebate reform takes place the administration that seems to be pushing for the beginning of 2020 many time. Albert Bourla : All right, why don't you Angela answer the ACIP question? Angela Hwang : So, our adult PCV13 vaccination program has been extremely effective and it's difficult for me to speculate on the ACIP vote because that's coming up in June. But I do want to emphasize that Pfizer strongly supports the continuation of the current adult vaccination program. This is because there are actually important serotypes such as serotypes 3 and serotypes 19A that still have not reached acceptable protection levels. So keeping the current recommendation will prevent numerous individual cases of pneumonia, hospitalizations and other outpatient treatments. Direct vaccination is important because they are also underserved populations still in our country where the disease risk is high. And just to give you a couple of examples, those that are living in rural communities, have 50% less coverage than those that live in suburban areas or there is a 24 point gap among the low socioeconomic adults. I think you've also seen through the recent news reports the importance of direct vaccination for adults as well as for public health and we also looking forward to the filing of our next generation pneumococcal vaccine, where we received FDA breakthrough to exit designation. We expect to file this by the end of 2020 and so it underscores the importance of an interrupted adult vaccination program. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Andrew, you asked us about the Eliquis and how we think this will perform in the Medicare population particularly given price and volume. First of all, I would say that Eliquis had the phenomenal performance I think I'm seeking highly about the profile of this product. But 36% growth is really something that we feel - make us feel very proud and actually in the U.S., the growth was even stronger 38% but the U.S., it's part of the business, right. So it is a very, very well diversified geographically. And I think that the pricing pressures, the growth is coming predominantly those 38% from volume, and all our strategies it is how to make sure that the diagnosis rates are more accurate and people and physicians understand the profile of the products that they can make the right choices when they choose to prescribe a medicine like about. So given that everything is the predominant growth with this volume, I think very good about the growth prospects of this product going forward. Chuck Triano : Thanks. Albert and Angela, can we move to our next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Umer Raffat : Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. I wanted to focus on two broad topics. First on Ibrance adjuvant can you quantify for us how large an opportunity you think that is? And given the significance of it, I have to ask, is there an interim this summer. And secondly on DMD gene therapy, my question is, do you think you have a best-in-class asset and I ask partially because I don't see this asset listed in your 15 blockbusters, by 2022 which should theoretically be a very realistic possibility even if the pivotal where to start in early 2020, so just wanted to reconcile both of those. Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Angela, I think you can deal with the Ibrance market potential and also let me, let me say that, on the studies, yes, there is an interim analysis, as with all studies, but the studies are designed to come to full completion. So we expect that the studies will be completed and we expect that this completion will happen next year although it is event-driven, so we'll need to see how events will evolve. But Angela, let's speak about the commercial opportunity, and then John, maybe you can give the clarification about DMD because what we have is 15 and 5, it was not the gene therapy molecule. Please. Angela Hwang : So, we have the two Phase 3 studies ongoing in the high risk early breast cancer population, the first is the PENELOPE, which enroll patients with high risk early breast cancer previously treated with the neo-adjuvant therapy and then we have PALLAS which enrolled patients with the high risk early breast cancer stage 2 and 3, we're optimistic about both of these studies because of the ability to meet unmet need but also to your question more directly if successful we will have the ability from both of these programs to double the number of patients that are eligible for this. John Young : Yes, and thanks for the question about DMD again, obviously the 15 and 5 or up to 15 and 5 portfolio reflected the portfolio that we had at that time and cleanly one of the sort of good things in our industry is the portfolio is never static and so I think as we begin to see data readout from our DMD gene therapy program, the profile of that medicine will become clear to us and to clinicians and to importantly to patients. So we would really see this having the potential to be an additional complement to that portfolio that we described last year. So I think it's obviously premature for anybody to disgrave the relative profile of respective or other comparative gene therapy assets, the data is still emerging, it's still and relatively small patient numbers and obviously for us and other players in this field, we will see the totality of data that emerges over the months and years ahead. But we feel cautiously optimistic about the program as I mentioned in my comments earlier on, we look forward to presenting some clinical data from that later on this year. Chuck Triano : Thank you, John and Angela for the background. Next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald. Chuck Triano : I don't think we can hear you, if you are asking a question maybe you are in mute. Louise Chen : Hold on, un-mute the phone. Can you hear me, okay now? Chuck Triano : Very well. Louise Chen : Okay, sorry about that. Okay, so thanks for taking my questions, I have a few here. So first question I had was on Tanezumab, just curious how the recent data impacting thinking with respect to the CLBP and cancer pain indications and then secondly on Tafamidis, how do you expect the initial launch to go if you do get approval this year, what is your anticipation for adoption, payer coverage, physician and patient awareness and then last question is on your business development comments, just curious if you have any interest in primary care or you more focused on specialized medicine? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you. John, what about Tanezumab? John Young : Yes, thanks for the question Louise. I mean I think we probably covered that mostly in our comments or later on. So we obviously issued fairly detailed press releases as each of our Phase 3 studies readout and I think what do I just say in overall is we're going to look at the totality of the data from all of our Phase 3 studies, we have round about 7000 patients worth of data, we're still on the process of analyzing the clinical profile and understanding its potential value across different indications. Our next step is obviously most importantly going to be to discuss that data with regulators and we will be in a better position to be able to provide you with an update on this. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Angela, very exciting news for Tafamidis potential launch, so tell us\u2026 Angela Hwang : Yes, we are very excited about Tafamidis and that's because it's a transformative therapy for ATTR-CM and today it treats a fatal and a rare disease where there are no therapies and no alternatives but it also addresses a large burden on the healthcare system because of the complications and the hospitalizations that arise from this disease. We do see this so as a rare disease, so approximately 100,000 patients in the U.S. But as you know today it is severely under diagnosed, we estimate approximately a less than 1% diagnosis rate because of the lack of treatment and the use of invasive heart biopsies to drive the diagnosis. So, as you can see diagnosis is going to be key to growing this market. At launch therefore we're going to be focused on creating suspicion of this disease by cardiologists and patients through educating them around the signs and symptoms of cardiomyopathy. We also need to increase the utilization of non-invasive methods such as scintigraphy and integrity versus a heart biopsy for diagnosis. So as you can see, this will all take time because we need to educate both physicians and patients on these red flag symptoms. We need to drive the utilization of scintigraphy and we also need to advocate for the changes in treatment guidelines which will help to drive both diagnosis and treatment. But as Pfizer, we are confident about our capability to build this market because we have a track record of success in creating new markets. And just to bring up an example from Xalkori, you may recall that at the time of launch of Xalkori the diagnosis rate of the ALK mutation was only 1%. But today it is 80% to 93%. So Tafamidis has excellent data, it has a compelling patient benefit. Pfizer has deep expertise and a commercial footprint in cardiology. So we look forward to bringing all of these capabilities to bear in launching this important medication to the patients who need it. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Angela and maybe I can make some comments about your question Louise about if we would be interested to all sort in license Primary Care potential candidates and medicines and the answer is of course yes. But let me be clear and specific what we mean. We have specific criteria what we are interested in licensing in, so it's not just the blind segment we have given to people go and license things. But those criteria involve the potential medicines it'll be breakthroughs. It's to be significant science that can create significant improvement in current standards of care. And they need to be within the areas of expertise of Pfizer, so that we can add value to it, just to go on without doing licensing. But we can add value. And we have six areas of expertise right now that they are all from that aspect from my perspective, they are treated equally. Those are areas that we know we have the best science in the world that they can make fewer mistakes as we're selecting products. And this is where we have the scientific expertise to develop potential in licensing assets in the best possible way because the development path plays a key role in unlocking the value of a molecule and primary care is definitely one of the areas of significant expertise or funds from the long way that goes way back but also in the current days as we are having some of the best scientific programs running in evolving diseases and other primary care conditions in our research centers. So the answer is yes, and the criteria that we are going to implement I hope I made that clear. Chuck Triano : Great, thank you, Albert. Next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from Jason Gerberry from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jason Gerberry : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess it's firstly coming back to the Tafamidis launch. Can you give us a sense of what you view as maybe the best analogs for driving this diagnosis and treatment rate above this 1% level. I guess on the one hand it looks like there's a largely an educational element to this with a lot of these patients basically sitting in the cardiologist office just not diagnosed but you also have a drug that's pretty easy to dose no monitoring. So I'm just kind of curious, if there are any analogs that you guys have thought about. I wouldn't think that's Xalkori would be the greatest analog but correct me if I'm wrong. And then secondly on DMD gene therapy, it sounds like you haven't dosed any patients at the intermediate dose, I was curious sort of the rationale for having an intermediate dose, was that more of a safety consideration or just seeing the above normal expression levels achieved with separate program had a lower dose than your high dose was the decision ultimately to just have the optionality around a lower dose? Thanks. Chuck Triano : Thank you. Angela, why don't you deal again with Tafamidis question. There is a lot of interest in this product and they understand why. Angela Hwang : Yes, sure. So actually we do think that Xalkori is a great analog for what we see coming up for diagnosis in both Tafamidis and cardiomyopathy. You know, today this is a disease, where the symptoms, and the signs and symptoms are, easily, I guess it could be confused with heart failure. So I think the ability for us to be able to find diagnostic approaches that will help us to really identify and to isolate who, specifically the cardiomyopathy patients are going to be really important. I think that there are some symptomatic, some symptomatic attributes that we plan to be educating around at the time of launch. But really, what we need is the ability to leverage technology such as integrity as an alternative to what exists today, which is a hard biopsy, which is extremely invasive. And I think that the ability to use scintigraphy will allow us to more readily diagnose these patients, I think the qualitative attributes some symptoms will allow us to create suspicion around what the right pool of patients might be. But the definitive diagnosis really needs to come with scintigraphy. There are 15,000 scintigraphy machines within cardiology offices today and 32 centers of excellence. So I think that this effort around education and awareness building is going to be key to both bring patients to the doctors' offices, but also to highlight the importance of these symptoms to prescribers and then to eventually diagnose and to treat. So as we said, I think we have deep expertise and capabilities in doing this, but that you can imagine with a disease that is so undiagnosed and up till now has had no therapeutic options. This is going to take time for us to really educate and to bring you know the full benefit of tafamidis to be bear. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Angela. And Mikael please, if you can comment on dosing strategy with a DMD development program, and maybe you can provide any color you would like about this breakthrough medicine? Mikael Dolsten : Thank you very much. Yes, we worked with our bamboo colleagues and carefully designing these 89 vectors that contains muscle relevant to specific promote for expression of the transgene. And the protocol was designed intentionally based on our experience of many gene therapy programs to allow some flexibility, which was the basis for dosing at one into through 14 and swing into the 14 to gain experience, of course a reasonable dose range in what would be the expression of the transgene -- ability and clinical performance for young boys that as Albert alluded to earlier, we're aiming to a transformative outcome. Now, we look forward to share data at the PPMD meeting in Orlando this late June. We think it is a good meeting for that purpose is one of the largest Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy gathering where both key scientists attend and patient representative. As you know, these types of devastating rare disease, you work very closely with the leading scientist and patient groups. So, we look forward to be there and share data set as John alluded to earlier. Jason Gerberry : Thank you very much, Mike. Albert Bourla : Right. Thank you for that background also. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets. Alex Arfaei : Good morning and thank you. A couple of follow-up questions on Tafamidis, congratulations on the approval in Japan; it was faster than we expected. We focus a lot on the U.S. market, but could you also comment on the ex U.S. opportunity families, and following up on the diagnosis rate commentary, my understanding was that you were also working on blood tests to make diagnosis even easier. Could you give us an update on those efforts as well as your potential launch readiness in case of earlier approval in the U.S.? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Alex. Angela again, you have the ex U.S. support through this and the testing? Angela Hwang : Right. So, yes, with the Japan launch was very recent. And I think that the opportunity there sets us up well, for the kind of launches that we expect to see around the world, as you say, it's not just the U.S., it's Japan, it's also rest of world. In terms of rest of world, I think the findings have been submitted and unable to comment on those for now because we are still awaiting for commentary from the regulatory agencies, but I think that my general comment about Tafamidis is really one that I mentioned earlier, which is the critical aspect of this is diagnosis. It really is a rare disease. It is severely under diagnosed today because of the lack of options. And so, critical to our ability to drive Tafamidis growth anywhere in the world, is the ability for us to be able to find the patients and then be able to screen them and to be able to diagnose them and then send them on to treatment. So I see that these trends are pretty consistent wherever we are around the world. Albert Bourla : Mikael is a great physician, but you are as well. Can you please comment a little bit on the diagnosis opportunities for this tafamidis? Mikael Dolsten : Yes, I want yes to punctuate that. The growing availability of scintigraphy technician based, makes it increasingly easy to get the diagnose off the suspicion often raised by clinical symptoms, and echocardiogram. We all seem parallel and looking at potential future blood markers. But right now, I think there should be no really hindrance to fast and easy diagnosis based on clinical sign scintigraphy. And in addition, we have made work on diagnostic algorithms, including artificial intelligence today which advise on typical algorithms that makes a hard cardiomyopathy, more likely to be TTR related, than unrelated. Alex Arfaei : It's amazing how many -- how much work is happening right now in this field, and particularly how AI also can help identify potential people that potentially could suffer from this disease. And we had multiple discussions with payors well and a lot of them, they're having high interest to exploit this opportunity. Because when we say 1% is diagnosis, we don't mean that the 99% they just don't treat it. Usually all of these patients are presented with heart failure symptoms, and they are treated for the wrong reason. And they're going, of course, because the doctor haven't identified that this is the real cause of their cardiac issues, and then they treat it and fail and fail, and then eventually, there's a fatal event. So payers are highly interested diagnosis disease, I think, but as Angela said, this is the key. And we know how to do it very well. But it will take time to pick up these diagnosis rates, but we will do. Chuck Triano : Great. Thanks for that context as well. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Navin Jacob from UBS. Navin Jacob : Hi, Navin Jacob, UBS. Thanks for taking the questions. A few, if I may a interesting slide on your treatments beyond up to 15 and 5, 2 in particular stood out the Oral GLP-1 and the HER2 ADC. Could you provide any context for how far along those assets are particularly the oral GLP-1, is it -- are those Phase 2 assets, Phase 1 assets, any color would be helpful. And then, I'll add to the questions on tafamidis. With regards to your pair discussions, are most of those related to traditional contracts or are you exploring outcomes based contracting? And if so, to what extent is that do you think outcomes-based contracting is will be a broad mandate or is it more of a experimental type of situation. And then finally, if you have any color on resolution of the sterile injectable manufacturing issues, is the resolution still expected for end of 2019? Thank you very much. Chuck Triano : Thank you very much. Mikael, let's start with you, and with the Beyond 15 in 5? Mikael Dolsten : Yes, I really appreciate your interest in the Beyond 15 in 5, which of course covered in next period Beyond 22 of the up to 15 in 5. So for the oral GLP, that's been an area where we have deployed some unique chemistry. And I'm very pleased to say that we are right now concluding a Phase 1b trial in diabetic patients and I've seen some very encouraging performance of that drug related to control of diabetes and bodyweight and we look forward to share those and we'll swiftly move into a larger Phase 2 trial for diabetes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only true small molecule that have come this far and shown this promise in PK and pharmacodynamic favorable effects. The next generation or ADC is based on site directed conjugation of adjuvant inhibitor and has been going through dose escalation and showed promising signs of activity. We continue to optimize dose and expect to go into Phase 2 expansion cohort relatively soon including potential combination with P21 agents. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Michael. Let me give you a very brief comment on Tafamidis and then I will ask Frank to take the manufacturing question. On Tafamidis, as you know breakthroughs requires a breakthrough approach is also commercial and we believe that we want to, we believe that Tafamidis is also suitable product given that we have a strong clinical outcomes data for value based agreements. So we are discussing and with multiple base it's too early to comment because also we are in the middle of the year and usually contract starts from the beginning of the year. Nevertheless there is significant interest and discussions between ourselves and payers on agreements that will really value that the product brings to patients. So Frank, on manufacturing? Frank D'Amelio: On the manufacturing, yes we do plan on having significant improvements implemented by the end of 2019. But please also know along the way we've already implemented numerous preventive and corrective actions and we've seen a nice improvement in our overall supply to-date. Albert Bourla : Okay. And I want to say Frank is always a man of few words and a lot of factions. I'm very, very pleased with the way that under Frank's leadership and the new leadership business we are progressing on addressing the issues with manufacturing. Chuck Triano : Thank you. Can we take next question please, Operator? Operator : Your next question comes from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Seamus Fernandez : Thanks very much for the question. So just a couple of quick ones, can you just help us understand the number that you guys printed on EUCRISA this quarter as well as the sales for Xeljanz. What were the main impacts on both of those products? And then just a second question if you guys wouldn't mind again this is a bit related to Xeljanz. Can you help us understand how differentiated the products in the dermatology Phase 3 clinical trials whether it be in alopecia or in atopic dermatitis. How differentiated those are from Xeljanz and perhaps from some of the other programs in development? Thanks so much. Albert Bourla : Right. Angela, why don't you hit quickly the decrease in Xeljanz's question and then you can leave time to Michael who is very passionate about the JAK portfolio to speak about it? Angela Hwang : Okay, great. So let me start with some comments on Xeljanz. So as you can see Xeljanz had a 34% operational growth globally. In the U.S. Xeljanz grew 18% but actually the scripts grew 37%. So if you look at some of the Q1 effects some of that is due to higher rebating and favorable channel mix and reauthorizations for patients that change insurance. And this is pretty typical of what we see every quarter. So I think we're really encouraged by the strong volume growth that we've continued to see in the U.S. and around the world for Xeljanz and it's all three of our indications strong growth from RA, exciting new launches for both PSA and UC and we're beginning to see some very, very strong market shares for UC as well coming out of the gate. For EUCRISA, specifically the number of EUCRISA patients in the U.S. for the first quarter was actually up more than 80,000 patients, so that's a 55% increase compared to where we were last year at this time. However, you do see revenues down slightly in Q1 and this is because despite the increased demand, we were negatively impacted by higher rebates in the U.S. So we need to continue to work on improving our formulary position and continuing to drive growth of EUCRISA in segments both in the U.S. as well as ex-U.S. Albert Bourla : Michael? Mikael Dolsten : , : For alopecia, it's a different type of underlying mechanism where we deal with cytotoxic cells destroying the hair follicles and the X3  selective inhibitor is what we thought would be the best. And that was what we nicely recorded as a very effective agent in our Phase 2 trial. And it also has a very clean profile, the most well-tolerated agent we have seen so far. So we look forward certainly to the Phase 2b pivotal study, and we also started with  with this X3 inhibitor. ,: For alopecia, it's a different type of underlying mechanism where we deal with cytotoxic cells destroying the hair follicles and the X3  selective inhibitor is what we thought would be the best.

Operator : Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. David Risinger : Yes, thanks very much. So first I'm hoping that you can talk about your expectations for organic revenue growth prospects for your Upjohn division relative to the 1% that you printed in the first quarter. I just don't have a sense for how we should think about that, whether that will grow or since you put Lyrica in there, that it's about to decline. So if you could help us understand the growth prospects for Upjohn, that would be helpful. Second, with respect to your patents that could potentially be blocking Merck's 15-valent launch in coming years, could you please talk about those patents and your level of conviction that Merck cannot launch and then just a final tidbit what are your planned biosimilar launches in the U.S. in the second half of this year? Thank you. Albert Bourla : So let me start with Upjohn and obviously Doug can cover the Merck patent situation and then Angela you can speak a little bit about the biosimilars. Our expectations for Upjohn in this year, of course, is going to be a decline, because they would be seriously affected by the loss of patent of Lyrica that will happen in the middle of the year. And that will affect their growth also next year, because they will have to face full-year LOE, which would be next year with only half a year LOE which is this year. Following that, I see Upjohn as a very stable to low -- single-digit growth on the top line, and much higher on the bottom line, and leverage bottom-line growth, but of course, that will be post 2020 period where the impact of Lyrica will be absorbed. Doug? Doug Lankler : So we were pleased that the patent trial and appeal board denied Merck's IPR petitions on two of our U.S. patents covering compositions of pneumococcal vaccines. These patents stand is valid and will not expire until 2026. We believe that these patents and others in our portfolio present freedom to operate issues for Merck in its development of a 15-valent pneumococcal vaccine. Albert Bourla : Very clear. Angela Hwang : . : Albert Bourla : Thank you, Angela. Chuck Triano : Thank you, and Operator, if we could take our last question, please. Operator : Your final question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen. Kathy Miner : Thank you. This is actually Kathy Miner on for Steve. Just a question on Bavencio please, we had been expecting Bavencio Phase 3 data in second line bladder this year, is this still possible. And secondly is there any chance for an interim on the JAVELIN Lung 100 this year and what is the PDL1 cut off for that trial? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Two questions Mikael for you. Mikael Dolsten : Yes. So, thank you for showing interest in our Bavencio portfolio. So we expect late this year or possibly early next year as you know these store event driven trials that we will conclude the bladder, it's actually a first line trials so it's quite an interesting trial where we have Bavencio as maintenance therapy of the chemo, we'll also have PDL 1 high expression trial in line, which if positive could be the second PDX available for monotherapy and PDL 1 are in line and then we have a guest weak first line also post-chemo patients in maintenance for Bavencio, so, quite nice remaining cohort and we look forward to review the data coming out of this. Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael. And I think this concludes the Q&A session. But just I wanted to say, that I found this session very productive. I'm very pleased that the vast majority of the questions with the minus one or two, maybe we're focused on our pipeline and we're focused on  new launch products. And I don't remember any other sessions but frankly didn't receive any finance question, which is what happened today. I think this is exactly how science-based company when the results for the quarter are good, should be discussed in our earnings call. I'm very pleased about that. We continue to believe that Pfizer's position in the market is strong. We have great products, we have a strong R&D and marketing skills, prudent capital allocation and perhaps most important, a clear path towards sustainable growth. Thank you very much and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Pfizer's first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day everyone and welcome to Pfizer's Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir. Chuck Triano : Good morning and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer's second quarter 2019 performance and our updated 2019 financial guidance. We appreciate your flexibility today. I know it's been a busy morning for everyone. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. During my remarks, I will discuss the progress we are making in the business, the latest advancements within our R&D pipeline, and our ongoing work to advocate for policies that support affordable access for patients. But before I address these topics, I would like to make a few comments regarding our recent activities to reshape our company including the agreement we announced this morning. We have been very busy. We recently completed the Therachon acquisition. We expect to close the Array acquisition very soon. We are about to create the joint venture with GSK for our consumer business and we just announced the proposed agreement with Mylan for our Upjohn business. When all these actions are complete, Pfizer will be a smaller, more focused, science-based company with a singular focus on innovative pharma. We believe we will be in a position where our pipeline will be able to move the needle even more dramatically in terms of our long-term growth prospects. In fact, we see our growth profile improving in three ways. We expect our five-year revenue CAGR to be higher than it otherwise would have been. We see the growth starting earlier because the Lyrica LOE cliff will go away. And given our smaller size, we believe the growth will be more sustainable. We also will still have the financial flexibility to continue to invest in growth while returning capital to our investors. These are deliberate steps we are taking to make Pfizer a very different company and one that is even better equipped to fulfill our purpose; breakthroughs that change patients' lives. Frank D'Amelio: Thanks, Albert. Good day, everyone. The charts I'm reviewing today are available on our website. Now moving on to the financials. Second quarter 2019 revenues were approximately $13.3 billion, which reflects operational revenue growth of $324 million or 2% and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $527 million or 4%. Our Biopharmaceuticals Group business recorded 6% operational revenue growth in the second quarter 2019, driven primarily by Ibrance, Eliquis and Xeljanz globally and by 12% operational growth in emerging markets, led by 26% operational growth in China; partially offset primarily by Enbrel internationally, primarily due to biosimilar competition in developed Europe, and the unfavorable impact of timing of purchases made by governments in certain emerging markets, and Prevnar 13 in the U.S., primarily reflecting lower government purchases for pediatric indication and continued revenue decline for the adult indication due to a declining catch-up opportunity, compared to the prior year quarter; and the hospital business in developed markets, primarily due to expected negative impact of generic competition and product supply shortages. Revenues for our Upjohn business in the second quarter decreased 7% operationally... Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this is the operator. We are experiencing technical difficulty. Please remain on the line, and your call will resume momentarily. Chuck Triano : Okay, folks, I think we're back. We had some technical difficulties. Apologize for that. I think at this point, we'll have Frank pick up just before where he left-off. Frank D'Amelio: Yeah. And so, I'll start -- I'll try to connect the dots. So, as Albert stated earlier, revenues for Upjohn in China increased 13% operationally in the first half of 2019, and are expected to grow by low to mid-single digits operationally for the full year. And the 9% decline for Upjohn in the U.S. primarily driven by lower revenues for Viagra resulting from increased generic competition and Lyrica reflecting volume declines due to wholesaler destocking in advance of anticipated multi-source generic competition, that was expected to begin on July 1, but instead began on July 19. Revenues of our Consumer Healthcare business increased 1% operationally, reflecting 4% operational growth in international markets, primarily offset by a 2% decline in the U.S. In the second quarter, we reported GAAP earnings per share of $0.89, a $0.24 increase compared to the year-ago quarter, which was primarily due to the favorable impact of lower income tax due to an IRS audit settlement, higher revenues on an operational basis, lower acquisition-related costs and fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by lower net gains in equity securities and foreign exchange. Adjusted diluted EPS for the second quarter was $0.80 versus $0.77 in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher revenues on an operational basis, lower cost of sales and lower weighted average shares outstanding, partially and primarily offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange as well as lower other income. Finally, diluted weighted average shares outstanding declined by approximately $280 million shares to $5.67 billion versus the year-ago quarter, primarily due to Pfizer's ongoing share repurchase program, reflecting the impact of share repurchases during 2018 and in the first quarter 2019, which was partially offset by dilution related to share-based employee compensation programs. As I previously mentioned, foreign exchange negatively impacted second quarter, revenues by approximately $527 million and positively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $310 million. Consequently, foreign exchange had a $0.03 per share negative impact on adjusted diluted EPS compared to the year-ago quarter. Moving on to 2019 financial guidance. We updated certain components of our 2019 financial guidance primarily to reflect the anticipated August 1, 2019 formation of the Consumer Healthcare joint venture with GSK and the pending Array acquisition. As a result, our guidance now reflects revenues and expenses associated with the Consumer Healthcare business through July 31, 2019 but now excludes revenues and expenses from Consumer Healthcare from August 1st, through the end of the year. Guidance now includes Pfizer's pro-rata share of the consumer JV's anticipated earnings, which will be recorded on a quarterly basis in other income/deducts with a one-quarter lag. As a result, guidance for adjusted other income/deducts and adjusted diluted EPS reflects Pfizer's share of only two months of earnings from the JV for the third quarter which will be recorded by Pfizer in the fourth quarter 2019. Therefore, on a net basis for the remainder of the year, the consumer JV is expected to have a $0.03 negative impact on adjusted diluted EPS, representing the foregone PCS earnings, contribution from August through the end of the year, partially offset by the two months of equity income from the JV. Our guidance update also incorporates the expected impact from the anticipated near-term completion of the Array acquisition, and to a much lesser extent the Therachon acquisition which closed earlier this month. These transactions are expected to modestly increase our adjusted R&D expense, and increase our net interest expense within our other adjusted income/deducts line resulting in an anticipated $0.04 negative impact on adjusted diluted EPS. Importantly, our guidance update absorbs the anticipated net impact of various other drivers, some of which are expected to have a favorable impact on our financial results offset by other drivers that negatively impact our outlook for 2019. On the favorable side, we now expect greater contributions in 2019 from certain biopharma products, primarily within our Oncology and internal medicine businesses than we previously anticipated, and our Upjohn business benefited from the delayed entry of generic competition for Lyrica in the U.S. which is expected to begin on July 1 but did not start until July 19. However, we expect this operational upside to our forecast to be offset by foreign exchange, and other recent product developments for Prevnar and Xeljanz. On foreign exchange, we had originally anticipated in January that FX would have an unfavorable impact on revenue of approximately $900 million and $0.06 on adjusted diluted EPS compared to foreign exchange rates from 2018. We now anticipate that foreign exchange will have a $1.2 billion unfavorable impact on revenue and $0.08 on adjusted diluted EPS for the year based on actual exchange rates in the first half of the year and mid-July FX rates for the remainder of 2019. So foreign exchange is expected to have an incremental negative impact of approximately $350 million on revenue and $0.02 negative impact on EPS compared to our January guidance. On an operational basis the ACIP's provisional recommendation to the pneumococcal vaccination guidelines for Prevnar 13 in adults in the U.S. as well as the recent revision of the Xeljanz U.S. prescribing information have negatively impacted our outlook for both products for the remainder of 2019. In summary, our guidance update slowly reflects pending business development activity and absorbs the various operational puts and takes that we have seen so far this year as well as the incremental negative impact of foreign exchange. Finally, as a reminder, our financial guidance for adjusted diluted EPS reflects share repurchases totaling $8.9 billion completed in the first quarter, which we expect will be offset by about half from dilution related to share-based employee compensation programs. Moving on to key takeaways. In the second quarter, we delivered solid financial results with 2% operational revenue growth, 4% adjusted diluted EPS growth and 6% operational revenue growth in our Biopharmaceuticals Group compared with the year-ago quarter. This keeps us on track to deliver solid financial performance in 2019. We updated our 2019 financial guidance based on the anticipated near-term completions of the Consumer Healthcare joint venture with GSK and the Array BioPharma acquisition and the completed Therachon acquisition. We accomplished multiple product and pipeline milestones since our previous quarterly update and we returned $12.9 billion to shareholders during the first half of 2019 through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2019 and beyond. Now, I'll turn it back to Chuck. Chuck Triano : Good. Thank you, Frank and Albert. And sorry about the technical glitch. Evidently, we didn't have unlimited talk time on our calling plan, I would guess. But with that, let's turn it to start the Q&A. Operator :  Your first question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen. Steve Scala : Thank you. I have two. It looks like 2020 pro forma EPS for Pfizer alone could be about $2.10. Is that a reasonable estimate at this juncture? So that's the first question. Second Albert, you had been steadfast that a major transaction was unlikely while Pfizer was in the midst of several important launches. I'm just wondering, what changed and what does this tell us about the outlook for the new products \u2013 thank you \u2013 meaning the Upjohn transaction? Thank you. Albert Bourla : All right. Let me cover this one, and then I will ask Frank to comment on the EPS. And frankly, nothing has \u2013 we always said that the internal separation of Upjohn was a significant theme in the value creation thesis when we announced it's great. I mean, Upjohn has a significant business model. They remain in Pfizer. And the substantial autonomy was essential for its success. That was always the thesis. And we said that, we will not explore options before we spend after this business, because we want to focus right now on spending up this business. But I have to tell you that we substantially completed the internal Upjohn organization separation earlier this month. That involves multiple things including legal entities. We have a new organization but it is already operational worldwide. It is fully staffed. The Shanghai headquarters is already up and running. And the business it performed according to our expectations actually a little bit better. So we always look of course to maximize value of the business. When we assessed the potential of combining these two companies, we quickly saw the potential to create value for shareholders in excess of what could be created if the businesses will remain as such. Now, that doesn't create any disruption to our main biopharmaceutical business because it's already separate business, but continues to operate as separate business as it does. It's going to have a little bit of disruption in Upjohn as we integrate, but all of that we took into consideration when we saw how much bigger value we can create for our shareholders by combining those two businesses. Frank, on the EPS? Frank D'Amelio: So Steve, what we did is we gave some -- I'll call it preliminary financial numbers for 2020. We covered revenue. We covered EBT as a percentage of revenue operating cash flow and we obviously made some comments about -- I made some comments about the dividend. We did that obviously to be helpful. In terms of specific EPS numbers, we'll do what we typically do which is we'll provide EPS guidance for 2020 on our fourth quarter earnings call as we've done in prior years. Chuck Triano : Thank you, Frank. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Tim Anderson : Thank you. If I could just go back to split. So splitting up first contemplated in early 2011, then in 2017 you guys kind of called it off. And one of the reasons for that was the valuation and spec pharma went down. That was kind of viewed as the comp for established products. And I think on a sum of the parts basis you guys are worried you wouldn't unlock value. --: Second question is just the emerging markets part of Upjohn I think is about $4 billion or 40% of total Upjohn revenues. Does this disrupt the corporate footprint in emerging markets that was a pretty sizable business that's a scale business as well? And was there any contemplation on keeping the emerging market part within the parent Pfizer company? Albert Bourla : Yes. Thank you, Tim. Look as you said the scenario split in the company was put to bed earlier on. And that scenario was mainly a scenario to take advantage of the multiples at the time so it was kind of a financial engineering. But it didn't work and will not work in Pfizer. This is why we moved away from this strategy. What we tried to do is to create operational value, value that is creating by putting similar things together. And the first step we did was to create Upjohn because Upjohn had very different characteristics from the previous established products. It was basically carefully selected assets that was trying to get advantage of the very positive demographics that were happening in Asia and particularly in China in terms of the types of volume creation. And that was something that we completed internally and we always knew that autonomous operation having them run almost like a company within a company was going to create value. So that's the first step But when we assessed the complementarity of the Upjohn business together with Mylan we understood that then we can create a substantially better bigger company. So this is the reason why we said that Upjohn instead of keeping it inside which is very different than the established products it in all aspects very different portfolio very different size, very different everything is now going to create significant value by putting together with Mylan. Now as regards the emerging markets not at all. Let's start with China and then I will take it to the emerging markets in general. Upjohn -- let's start with Upjohn. As part of the new company now we have a strong pipeline we didn't have before and they'll have a strong pipeline to put through the great commercial infrastructure in China to fuel the growth. Now let\u2019s see China? The remaining -- the Biopharmaceutical Pfizer's presence in China. The remaining Pfizer it is almost half of the $5 billion that we have right now in China. So the size will be significant. And then you can see the growth prospects of this business is growing 26% in the second quarter. So it's doing very well. But we are even more excited about the futures growth of this business. We maintain all our R&D and free force capabilities in China, by the way all of that are completely segregated right now. And in addition -- with Upjohn I mean -- and in addition we are expecting to file up to 19 new products in the next few years in China. So that's very significant. Now let's move to in general the emerging markets in the remaining. The size of emerging markets currently in the Biopharmaceutical businesses is almost 20% of the total business. And if you see the growth trajectory of this business is growing almost triple the rate than the remaining of the Biopharmaceutical business. So with this transaction we do not reduce the scale or the growth prospects at all of the main Pfizer into emerging markets. Chuck Triano : Great. Thank you, Albert of that. Move to our next question please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe for the Biopharma business you guided to five year growth rate at the high end of mid-single digits. So just wondering any meaningful differences there in your projections versus consensus? And then Albert would welcome any additional perspective on the proposed Senate drug pricing legislation and maybe your Part D exposure on a pro forma basis? Thanks. Albert Bourla : Yes. Thank you very much and very good questions. First of all, on the first we never comment on other people's projections. I know that this is your job to do projections, but we have our internal. So Frank, you want to make a comment Frank D'Amelio: Sure. Albert Bourla : \u2026on that and then I will take the second question. Frank D'Amelio: Sure. So I can comment on the revenue and obviously to Albert's point we'll talk about our numbers -- I'll talk about our numbers. So from my perspective the 5-year CAGR -- revenue growth CAGR will improve. We've said previously mid-single digits. Now we're saying high mid-single digits. We'll see the growth faster. The reason we'll see the growth faster is immediately upon close Lyrica LOE goes to Upjohn so we won't have that. We believe the growth will be more sustainable because it's on a smaller base. And then most importantly, we will leverage that growth to the bottom-line as we always do. So that's how we think about the revenue. Albert Bourla : Yes. So let me make some comments about the Senate. As you know, last week there was a markup in the Senate Finance Committee. We cannot support this bill as written and it's not only us but in general the pharma has expressed their frustration. Obviously, there are some provisions of the proposed bill that we do support and we believe will help lower spending on prescription drugs. And -- such as instituting out-of-pocket caps for patients or improving incentives for biosimilars utilization. These are very positive things in the bill. However, we believe that none of these in -- for none of these the bill goes far enough. We would expect that they would do much more to incentivize biosimilars and we would expect that they could do much more to create relief on patients. Also the bill while it generates savings for the health care system, it does it with punitive measures for the industry and does not distribute the savings to patients. And thus does very little to fix the issue as a result of high out-of-pocket costs for them. This is the fundamental issue right now in the political life and this is the fundamental issue of the pharmaceuticals business. More there -- on that needs to be addressed. Now we are working very productively with the administration and we are working very productively with senators and we plan to do it with also -- to continue to make it with Senator Grassley and Wyland and Senate members from both sides of the aisle to see how we can improve this proposal. And also we noted that in the Senate bill there was the unanimous support -- almost unanimous support to introduce a comprehensive rebate reform into this bill. This is very, very positive and I believe that will be one of the very meaningful tools that the Senate Committee has in their hands to reduce out-of-pocket costs. Now as regards what will be the size of the impact it's very early to calculate because our experience is that typically these things are changing dramatically between markup and then what comes to the floor and then eventually what is becoming a bill. So I would rather stay on the basic principles that the bill is punitive for the pharma, but more importantly doesn't distribute all of the savings that is created for the patients. Chuck Triano : Right. Thanks for the perspective, Albert. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Umer Raffat : Hi. Sorry about that. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to touch upon a couple of things, if I may. First, as we think about the China pricing concerns, the question that I've been toying with is Lipitor and Norvasc were down 27% or so this quarter. We've seen some evidence online that the tenders in China could be as high as 70% price drop. So, is the price drop done on Lipitor and Norvasc or are we expecting more? And then, the same theme over to the antibiotics business as well, because presumably the 7 plus 4 initiative could expand to antibiotics, and your thoughts on China business as it relates to antibiotics? Thank you very much. Albert Bourla : Yes. And I think Michael gave a very good overview of the situation in China in a previous call, but I can give you also a summary. I think the -- right now, the value -- the volume-based procurement will expand from 11 cities to more cities, and that will affect the price. So, I think that the prices will go down. At the same time, we see that there is tremendous volume opportunity of going up. So, as a result, we think that eventually the business will be the base as these close to 31 cities, but there will be continued growth for the high-quality branded products, because the Chinese healthcare system, including physicians and patients, they place a lot of value in the brand equity of this drug. So, that has been calculated in all our numbers, but were included for China, and you saw it in the previous presentation. And that will continue. By the way, our antibiotics, they are in Pfizer -- in the remaining Pfizer, they're not part of our Upjohn it's part of Sterling injectables, and they're not at QC, so they are not affected at all by that. So far, as regard the trajectory for our business in China. From the rebates business, we think because of the volumes, after all this price hit the significant volume expansion, we will continue seeing volume growth -- revenues growth in China. Chuck Triano : Thank you, Albert. Next question please, operator. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks very much. Just on the margin side of the story. As we think about high to mid-single-digit growth for the Pfizer Biopharma business, can you just elaborate on what that looks like in terms of the magnitude of margin expansion and pre-tax growth we can think about for Pfizer over time? I guess trying to get to the question here, is there areas you still need to ramp investment on that core innovative business? Or can we think about much of the top line growth over the next few years, falling largely to the bottom line? My second question, which is coming back to Tafamidis, and just the launch dynamics on that product. Just any early color of how we should -- how you're thinking about the coming quarters, and the type of ramp that we should be thinking about as that product gets off the ground? Thanks so much. Albert Bourla : Frank, would you like to comment how we see margins evolving in joint company? Frank D'Amelio: Sure. So Chris, I talked about in my prepared remarks, margins -- IBT margins, I talked about in the mid-30s. The reason I did that was because we're shifting income from above the line to below the line with things like the consumer joint venture, think about above other income to in other income. So, we used IBT, as I'll call it, the benchmark to use going forward as a percentage of revenues, so mid-30s. But, we fully expect as our revenues grow for us to leverage that to the bottom line. I think we've demonstrated that over the years, we will continue to do that going forward. So, yes, as our revenues grow, we expect margin expansion to the bottom line then obviously to not only to IBT but obviously to the EPS line as well. Chuck Triano : Yeah. Chris, I can just -- just to clarify. IBT as income before tax, I'm not sure how common that phrase is used. But for us, as operating income, plus other income and that's the IBT, that Frank's been referencing. Frank D'Amelio: Thanks, Chuck. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Frank. Angela, why don't you give some color on Tafamidis please? Angela Hwang : Great, thanks. And thanks for the question, Chris. So let me share with you what we're seeing, on our side in terms of the performance of Tafamidis. We are releasing some nice positive leading indicators, for this launch. And let me walk you through sort of the funnel of patients. And how we're seeing things play out. First of all, we have approximately 3,000 ATTR-CM patients that we've already diagnosed. And these are patients outside of the 900 that you heard Albert talk about in his opening comments, that were part of an early access program as well as clinical trial supply. So of these 3,000, about 1,400 of them have been prescribed Vyndaqel. And of those 1,400, 500 have actually received the medicine. And so, what we have here now are about 900 patients that are in process of clearing the access and reimbursement sort of logistics via prior authorizations that will then ultimately enable them to get the prescription. And so I also would maybe like to mention that, so far, we're seeing the prior authorization process improve pretty much on a daily basis. And only 16 patients, 1-6, have received some sort of rejection. And even those rejections could simply be just due to documentation purposes. So hopefully that lays out for you, where the patient flow is coming from. And how we're seeing patients get onto the drug. But also say that, we're very pleased with what we've seen so far. And what we're seeing both in terms of diagnosis as well as the process for patients to actually get their drug. Chuck Triano : Great, thank you, Angela. Next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi. Andrew Baum : Thank you. A couple of questions please. First, we are living in a very active M&A environment thinking of AbbVie, Bristol, Takeda and so on and so forth. Your new structure will leave you a smaller company, but you will have the $12 billion additional cash from the Mylan transaction. How are you thinking about deploying your balance sheet? And whether there is a need to reconfigure the recent historic stance of shying away from larger-scale, M&A? So that's the first question. And then the second, more of a housekeeping question. Inlyta is an increasingly important drug as you called out in relation to the renal cell approvals. Do you have a crystal line patent which would take you out until 2030? You list the basic patents in your annual report which is 25. What is your confidence that, in the fact you may be able to derive cash flows in the U.S. all the way out to 2030 using that second patent? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much, Andrew. Let me make a comment on BT, and then, I will ask Frank to comment on the capital structure of the new company. And then Angela you will answer the Inlyta. So, as I said before, nothing is changing with this deal, in the way that we see business development for Pfizer going forward. You will see Pfizer to be active in BD continues to be active in BD. And as we have said, preferably that will be on bolt-on opportunities, that would be on early to mid-stage opportunities, where maybe there is higher risk as you know, but the value creation is further greater. And the risk of operational disruption is perhaps lower. So, we have this philosophy before and continue having it. Regarding large-scale M&A, as we said, we'll never say never and -- but right now the opportunity we have to advance our pipeline is unique. And I still do not see the need to do a large deal right now, because that can only create disruptions. With that, I would like to ask Frank to give a more general overview on the capital structure. Frank D'Amelio: Sure. So, Andrew, you mentioned the $12 billion of cash that we're going to receive from the transaction. Our intention is to pay down debt with that $12 billion of cash. That solidifies what's already a really strong balance sheet. We continue to have -- we expect to continue to have a solid credit rating. And then as you mentioned, we'll also generate $11 billion to $12 billion in operating cash flow post-close. Obviously, from that we will pay the dividend. And we said we will keep our shareholders whole on the dividend. We get the importance of the dividend. Obviously, CapEx investing in the business and then the remainder will be looking at relative to share repurchases and to business development. Chuck Triano : Angela, do you want to comment on the patent? Angela Hwang : Sure, just quickly. Our main composition of matter patent takes us up to 2025. But of course, because of the value of the product we will continue to pursue other patents. And so, we'll see and to be determined where that takes us. Chuck Triano : Okay. Thank you. Next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from Jason Gerberry from Bank of America. Jason Gerberry : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just coming back to the top line growth target of high mid-single-digits, could you just walk us through your assumptions? Does that include the success -- clinical success for Ibrance adjuvant as well as status quo in the pneumococcal vaccine space? And then your comment on, Vyndaqel the 3,000 patients, so I think that's about 1,400 additional patients versus what were out there maybe diagnosed and on dexlinosol. Is that I mean sort of you're already seeing the impact of cardiologist testing and diagnosing TTR cardiomyopathy? Just trying to get a sense of what's driving that increase in the diagnosed and treated patient pool? Albert Bourla : Thank you, Jason. Let me first clear the question about what's included in our projections of high end of mid-single-digit growth. And the way we always do it, it is with risk adjustment. There is nothing that is fully baked in. We have a very big pipeline. And we have particularly a very big Phase III portfolio. And all of them they are appropriately risk-adjusted, so there's nothing that it is assumed a success over there or failure per se. The fact that, we have the risks spread in many, many assets. Because, as you know we have submitted everything in time, this is what gives us a lot of confidence, that the risk adjustments are accurate. With that I will ask Angela to comment. Angela Hwang : On the diagnosis, so what we're seeing from a diagnosis perspective and what's helping us are the following : I think first of all, we're seeing some good use of PYP scintigraphy, which is the non-invasive method for identifying and diagnosing ATTR-CM and a good -- a high utilization of that as a non-invasive mechanism. But also in terms of where the diagnoses coming from, we're seeing a good spread between the centers of excellence, between specialty cardiology, as well as general cardiology. So I think that the education efforts that we have ongoing about the signs and symptoms of ATTR-CM has as creates suspicion around them. It's happening across all different aspects of cardiology, whether it's in academic centers or in the community. And I think that this is why I was saying that we have some really positive leading indicators of this launch and it's going according to plan. Albert Bourla : Great. Thank you very much, Angela. Next question please operator. Operator : The next question comes from Louise Chen from Cantor. Louise Chen : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. My first question is as you trim down to these core assets that higher end of the mid single-digit range, is that organic growth or does that include M&A? And then I wanted to ask you also on Array. The Anchor CRC and the Adjuvant setting how do you think about those opportunities in light of the BEACON data that you've seen so far? And then my last question is on your DMD product. Do some of the safety issues that came up in your Phase 1 study change your view about the market opportunity? What doses of the hospitalizations occur and was it due to promoter or AAV9? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you very, very much Louise. Let me first take out of the way the first one which is an easy. We do not include any M&A in our projections. When we speak about high end of mid single-digit growth, we mean organically. Now Mikael, can you please comment on Array and DMD? Mikael Dolsten : Yeah. So on Array, we are very excited about overall opportunity for the team. And as you know recently in May, there was communicated both very convincing updated data from the Columbus melanoma trial. The data from the second and third-line BEACON trial, which was received I think extremely well about the strong data including survival response rate of the triplet. ,: As you know the Array also has a large number of partner program that will continue to advance in development and grow as products that provide a third leg of future opportunity, plus R&D engine that will be added to our pipeline pending close of the deal. On the DMD, we presented at the parent project muscular dystrophy conference recently an update of our trial. And we continue to be optimistic about the field in general and as well looking at our aggregator safety data as well as data on muscle fiber distribution mini-dystrophin concentration and the early data we reported on NorthStar Ambulatory Assessment and creatine kinase as a muscle health marker. We think the integrated data set are sufficiently encouraging to support the continued development of the investigational therapy. And as Albert alluded to in his introductory remarks our manufacturing including large-scale 2,000-liter bioprocessors are on track, as we continue the trial to support a potential pivotal study June next year. Albert Bourla : Great. Thank you so much answering Mikael. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. David Risinger : Yes. Thanks very much. I have a couple questions. First, could you please comment on the innovative business in China excluding Upjohn? What is your revenue run rate in China excluding Upjohn? Second, with respect to Ibrance adjuvant readouts, could you please update us on the timing? And then third, with respect to U.S. biosimilars, could you update us on the expected launches in coming months? And if you have any specific timing that would be helpful. Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much. I will cover the innovative business in China, and then I will ask Angela to cover biosimilars and the question about Ibrance. Our innovative business in China, it is approximately in the first half of the year half the size of the business. So it is in the north of $2 billion I think for the full year. If you extrapolate it is around $5 billion. The business is extremely healthy. It's growing right now 26% in this quarter and the growth we expect to maintain or accelerate. We are maintaining the capabilities of the innovative business compared to the capabilities of the Upjohn have been already segregated at once. There's very little connectivity, which is mainly in enabling function systems, et cetera, but in terms of marketing, management, research and development, manufacturing all of that are already separated. The Biopharmaceutical business has many more resources than the Upjohn, because it's a much more demanding business, and we plan to maintain them all. And you need to know that we have a very strong research organization in China, but also we plan to maintain and enhance. As regards to the outlook of this business in China, we plan to launch approximately to introduce 19 new products in the next few years. So, let me take it back to Angela and also Angela if you want to make some comments about the innovative business in China, feel free, but also cover the biosimilars and the Ibrance question. Angela Hwang : Sure. Sure. So, just to follow what Albert was saying, we have a strong portfolio of innovative products in China. In 2018, we have -- we saw the other listings on the NRDL of very important Oncology products. And in this year 2019, we are continuing to look forward to driving growth through the continued listing of other notable products such as Ibrance and Xeljanz, which is coming up in 2019. So, hope that just gives you a flavor of the types of launch activities that we're looking forward to and what we see as the drivers of growth. To your second question, which I think was about Ibrance adjuvant, those -- in that regard, we're looking forward to the two trials PENELOPE as well as PALLAS, both in the high-risk early breast cancer patients. Both of these trials, if successful will allow us to double the number of patients that we can put on Ibrance. And because these are event-driven trials, I think we've spoken about these before, we expect to report to you when the recruitment and when the numbers of patients have been finalized. But that looks like approximately sort of middle of the year next year is what we're anticipating, so more to come on that one. And then your final question was about -- yes, biosimilars. So, as you can see to-date, all three of our monoclonal antibody biosimilars have now been approved by the FDA. So we're really pleased with that. That's a major regulatory milestone that we have accomplished. And now, we look forward to the launches. That will be coming up in short order. I don't -- I can't really give you exact dates, because as you know, there's just many things that go -- or many considerations that get factored into when a biosimilar can get launched. But I think that commensurate with the successes we've seen in these approvals, we are very much gearing up and looking forward to the launches coming up soon. Chuck Triano : Great. Thanks Angela. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from David Maris from Wells Fargo. David Maris : Hi, just a simple one. The opioid litigation, can you give us an update on whether or not the opioid products are going with the Upjohn business or are they remaining with Pfizer? Thank you. Doug Lankler : Yes. So it's Doug Lankler. Thanks for the question. So, Upjohn has no opioid liabilities, so -- and Pfizer has a very, very small amount of them as well. But Upjohn doesn't have any, so nothing will be going in the opioid area to the new business. Chuck Triano : Okay. Great. Thanks Doug. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Mani Foroohar from SBC Leerink. Mani Foroohar : Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to dive in a little more detail on tafamidis' and I have a follow-up after that. You've commented on 500 commercial patients, 900 on compassionate use in clinical trial, which would imply an incremental 1,600 patients outside of those two buckets to get to the 3,000 number of diagnoses that you've hopefully given to us. My question is the breakout of that population. Of the 500 commercial patients are zero or some other number from the -- of the EAP. If zero of the patient -- if zero EAP patients are in that 500 commercial, are all 400 of the EAP patients that were on EAP in December 2018 in the 900 population you disclosed today, if all 400 of those EAP patients are in that 900, when if ever will they get -- will they become commercial patients generating revenue? And then beyond that for the other 1,600 diagnosed patients, but not yet in either those two buckets, can we think about time... Albert Bourla : I think we lost Mani. Operator : Your next question will come from Navin Jacob from Senior Research Analyst. Albert Bourla : Before we do that, I know we lost Mani, but let me ask Angela to answer at least the part of the question that we were able to listen to. Angela Hwang : Okay. Great. So, just to pick up on the numbers, the 1,400 patients -- commercial patients that I referred that have been prescribed tafamidis have nothing to do with the early access program. So, the early access program has 700 patients. And of those 700 patients, 25 have already been transitioned over into commercial, but I'm not counting that as part of the 500. So that's a separate stream. So, if you think just purely newly diagnosed commercial patients who came on Vyndaqel for the first time as commercial patients that's the 500. There's a different stream that we need to follow for the 700 early access program getting commercialized or getting moved into commercial product. And like I said, there's 25 of those. And that's a different process that we have to work through with our clinical trial size in order to transition them, so that's they move at a slightly different pace with a different process, but we anticipate that over the next several months, all of these patients will need to be moved over. Albert Bourla : Great. Thank you. Angela. Chuck Triano : Thank you, Angela. Next question? If we can take our last question please, operator. Operator : Your final question will come from the line of Navin Jacob from Senior Research Analyst. Navin Jacob : Hi, sorry, Navin from UBS. Thanks for taking my question. On tafamidis -- sorry if I missed this, but Angela, is there's any color around how much usage you're getting in sort of the pure cardiomyopathy market versus any usage in the mixed phenotype market that would be great. And then just on Xeljanz, any color on just given the label change, how you're now sort of thinking about the UC market opportunity, any color on peak outlook there would be helpful? Thank you. Angela Hwang : Sure. So as you can tell, we have 500 patients that have received drug even though we've diagnosed a great deal more. So at this point it's a little difficult because we don't have enough numbers to be able to be exact with you in terms of how many are the hereditary type and how many are the wild type. But just order of magnitude of all the ATTR-CM patients that exist 90% of them are going to be wild type, meaning very little are hereditary. So I would anticipate that as we are diagnosing these patients that that distribution would apply. But I don't have definitive numbers on that quite yet. In terms of UC, so here how we're looking at it, which is that if we look at how our UC scripts are being generated today, most of them are coming from second line use, a second line after anti-TNF. So where the new label is going is in fact where -- that's in fact how our business is operating today. A large majority of our patients are our second line after anti-TNF. So I think that this is one where we're going to have to monitor. I think as you can imagine that there is just an incredible and a significant education effort that needs to go on now with our physicians. And I think as a result of that education method we'll get a better feel of how they are looking at UC second line. But certainly this is very much aligned with how we're doing business today anyway. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much Angela. And let me make some final comments to give the highlights of the business and I want to see it from the Pfizer shareholders as well what the Pfizer shareholder is receiving. So first of all, our shareholders will receive 57% of a new created company. The new company will be stronger will have a great scale, great diversification, great R&D and much more focused. And, of course, it will have a great capital structure. We believe that Mylan's equity is right now significantly undervalued. Five months ago their stock was $32, which is more than $73 than were Friday's close. We have done a lot of due diligence as a responsibility for our shareholders and we feel comfortable with what we have seen. We do not believe the issues were related to the underlying business of the undervaluation of their stock. In fact, we discovered they have done a very good job with their pipeline and they have diversified the result -- their business. Also discovered that they have a very credible cost to control -- their cost. They soon were related to uncertainties around strategic direction around governance, around shareholder friendliness, and to believe that this transaction checks all boxes. This results in a materially less leverage company, robust cash flows, which facilitates payment of an attractive dividend, redomeciles company back to the U.S. in the most shareholder friendly jurisdiction, which is Delaware. And we do that with no meaningful dissynergy impacts. So there will be no tax dissynergies. And, of course, we have a strong performing governance. Now this is what our shareholders received from us. In addition they will receive a 57% on the value of synergies of this combination will create, and of course they will receive $12 billion in cash. But what is more important for our shareholders, it is what -- how the remaining company Pfizer will look like. The company will be singularly focused on innovative biopharma with valuable growth assets in a strong pipeline. Our product portfolio and pipeline will more easily move the needle in terms of growth impact given the smaller size, which will also make the growth more sustainable. We anticipate remaining Pfizer's revenue CAGR on a five-year basis will improve to the high end of mid-single-digit and this will happen the moment that we close the transaction. We also as I said believe that the growth will be much more sustainable, given the small size and given the fact that the size goes down but all the growth assets and all the R&D remains in the main company. And finally we will continue, of course, to have a very strong balance sheet with a solid credit rating. We believe that when you see this transaction in the context of the previous three -- actually all transactions are closing in this week or next week, which is the Therachon acquisition, we expect to close very soon the Array acquisition, we expect to close very soon the formation of the JV and we announced today this create a very different Pfizer that will be in the leadership of growth profile in top and much more bottom line. So thank you for all your questions and have a nice afternoon. Chuck Triano : Thank you everybody. This will conclude our call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude Pfizer's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Chuck Triano : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer\u2019s third quarter 2019 performance and updated 2019 financial guidance. I\u2019m joined today by our CEO, Albert Bourla; Frank D\u2019Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Angela Hwang, Group President, Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group; John Young, our Chief Business Officer; and Doug Lankler, General Counsel. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. During my remarks, I will discuss our quarterly business performance, latest updates from our pipeline and our plans for Pfizer following the anticipated completion of the Upjohn-Mylan combination, which we continue to expect to care in meet 2020. During the quarter, we delivered a strong performance highlighted by 9% operational revenue growth in our Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group, which will be the business that remains at Pfizer following the anticipate closing of the Upjohn transaction. We also saw revenue impacted by two expected events, the July loss of exclusivity in the U.S. for Lyrica and the July 31 completion of the Consumer Healthcare joint venture transaction with GSK. For biopharmaceuticals, once again, these groups outstanding growth was driven primarily by strong performance from our key growth drivers. This include Ibrance, Xtandi, Xeljanz, Eliquis, Vyndaqel end Inlyta, as well as 15% operational growth in emerging markets including 42% operational growth in China. Our biopharmaceutical business in China generated higher revenues this quarter than the Upjohn business in the country. Our oncology business was particularly strong up 30% operationally compared with a year ago quarter. Global revenues for Ibrance were up 27% operationally in the quarter to $1.3 billion. We saw strong revenue growth in both U.S. and international markets. We believe the continued growth in the U.S. is the result of our efforts to target specific physicians who had not been prescribing CDK inhibitors or had prescribed them to only a small set of patients. For Xtandi, the alliance revenues in the U.S. grew 25% to $225 million. In August, the FDA granted Xtandi priority review designation for the treatment of men with metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer with a PDUFA date in December. If approved, this represents get another potential growth driver for the brand. Inlyta revenues increased 98% operationally to $139 million. This included 240% growth in the U.S. or Inlyta has benefited from recent FDA approvals for the combination of Inlyta plus BAVENCIO and Inlyta plus KEYTRUDA in first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma patients. Frank D\u2019Amelio: Thanks, Albert. Good day everyone. The charts I\u2019m reviewing today are available on our website. Now moving on to business performance. Our Biopharmaceuticals Group business recorded 9% operational revenue growth in the third quarter of 2019 driven primarily by Ibrance globally, which recorded revenues of nearly $1.3 billion and operational increase of 27%. This was composed of 48% operational growth in international markets and 18% growth in the U.S. Xeljanz globally up 40% operationally, primarily driven by 34% growth in the U.S. as well as 61% operational growth in international markets. Eliquis globally of 20% operationally, the hospital business up 9% operationally in emerging markets in the U.S., primarily driven by continued growth from anti-infective products in China in the November 2018 U.S. launch of Panzyga. Chuck Triano : Thank you, Albert and Frank for the prepared comments. Operator, can we please move to the Q&A session. Operator :  Your first question comes from Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Chris Schott : Great, thanks very much for the questions. I guess just two here. First, I know you\u2019re not giving 2020 guidance at this point, but relative to your initial 2020 comments made with Upjohn, maybe just give us any \u2013 just flavor in terms of business trends or any franchises that are performing ahead or behind maybe some of the initial expectations? And my second question was about kind of the next wave of pipeline opportunities. It \u2013 because it seems to me, when I hear the enthusiasm you have about that pipeline, that there is a bit of a disconnect between Street expectations and Pfizer expectations on the pipeline. So when you look at that portfolio, are there assets in particular where you see a particular \u2013 a gap relative to, I guess, what we\u2019re thinking versus your expectations as we kind of focus in on some of these updates over the next few years? Thanks so much. Albert Bourla : Well, thank you, Chris. Let me try to speak a little bit about your question on guidance of next year, and then I will ask also Frank to help me on that, and then we\u2019ll ask Mikael Dolsten to speak about pipeline. Let me start with the 2020 guidance. We don\u2019t give guidance up before our Board approves our operating plan. And this every year happens in the mid of December of 2000 \u2013 of every year. And usually, we do it in the next earnings call that happen in January. This year, in the mid of the year, in July, because of the transaction, we had to provide some financial targets for Upjohn. As a result, we felt that it\u2019s going to be awkward if we do not give also some financial targets for the RemainCo in 2020. But of course, we did that with a lot of unknowns and with great distance from the year of 2020. So we were appropriately cautious, I would say. Since then, a lot of things happened and happened in the areas that wanted to see how things could perform. For example, we were not certain how the ACIP recommendation for Prevnar would affect the adult business. We were not certain how the label for Xeljanz \u2013 in the black box that we received, in the change in the label for Xeljanz, how that would affect the prescription habits of physicians. We were not sure how Ibrance effort that started in the beginning of this year to increase the market size rather than focus on increasing our own markets are offering, and \u2013 but have given very good results in the second quarter. We\u2019ll continue as we go into the third quarter. We were not certain how the newly approved Inlyta compared to BAVENCIO together with BAVENCIO and together with KEYTRUDA indication will transform into performance into the market. And we were not certain how Xtandi new indications will perform and also how the new product, which is our Vyndaqel in cardiomyopathy, eventually will do. As a fact of the matter, all six of them did much better than what we were expecting. And this is extremely, extremely positive, of course. We are not going provide now a guidance for next year, but definitely, things have improved compared to what we thought in the second quarter. Moving to Upjohn. Also, the same sentiment. We have provided $7.5 billion to $8 billion for next year, and we have said that we\u2019ve spent way significantly lower than what Upjohn is doing now because we wanted to make sure that we incorporate the impact predominantly in China of the volume-based procurement system. And for the same reasons, we said that the second half of this year will be lower and \u2013 but we\u2019ll try our growth in China in general to be low to single digits growth for China \u2013 digits for China. In fact, we\u2019re upgrading that now. And we are saying that for this year, our growth will be mid to high digits growth in China portion of the Upjohn business. And again, we are not going to provide guidance for 2020 for Upjohn, but we will do that together with the total company in \u2013 after our Board approves in mid-December. But we have updated the guidance for this year obviously because of the very good results for the third quarter. Frank, anything to add to that, please? Frank D\u2019Amelio: I would just add two things. One, our current expectations is we would provide guidance for 2020 like we typically do on our fourth quarter earnings call. But the only other thing I would add is \u2013 but please understand that we intend to improve upon the 2020 numbers that we\u2019ve previously issued that we talked about that we\u2019re appropriately cautious for the reasons that Albert discussed. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Now from the financials, let\u2019s go to things that are driving the financials, which is our \u2013 strength of our pipeline. So Mikael Dolsten, please go ahead. Mikael Dolsten : Thank you, Albert. So let me say a few words. First, we have a large and strong pipeline with  projects from Phase 1 through registration, and the uptick is contribution from all of our five therapeutic areas. And it is driven by multiple science franchises and not dependent on one or two vulnerable compounds. Number two, our R&D productivity have improved consistently over the last two years. Let me exemplify with our Phase 2 success rates have now been exceeding 40% for a number of years well above the benchmark. We estimate that earlier between 2018 and 2022, 25 to 30 approvals from 2018 to year-to-date, we\u2019re already at 11. Within that approval wave, let me exemplify our focus on the 15 in five strategy to deliver blockbuster approvals. And within that cohort as you have seen, we have had really good progress. And both Phase 2 and Phase 3 success rates are high and robust in also this most valuable compound. Now I wanted to conclude and give you more of near-term opportunities for our pipeline. So between now and 2020, you may want to remember the metrics, 15 plus 10 plus 5 plus 5. 15 relates to 15 POC readouts, up to 15 POC readouts; 10 to \u2013 10 Phase 3 starts; and then 5 for 5 Phase 3 readout and 5 key approvals. Let me give you a few examples on the POCs that you can keep an eye on. We have five different POC \u2013 up to five different POC readouts in our JAK franchise, including indications across topical \u2013 atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, vitiligo and also psoriatic arthritis for an oral drug. We have a strong momentum in our gene therapy platform. Albert mentioned in his introduction our factor-18 therapy where we are expecting soon a POC readout and have started to enroll for baseline characteristics in Phase 3. We are progressing well with our DMD gene therapy, and we have reached proof of concept for our tissue factor pathway inhibitor monoclonal antibody. We\u2019re also going to strengthen our hemophilia and the Phase 3 plans are underway. In internal medicine, I want to punctuate the angiopoietin-L3 deal pending close that we expect to have a POC readout early next year. Our vaccine franchise also has a number of intriguing data sets to be shared. Obviously, the P&G pediatric  RSV maternal Phase 2 data next year followed by Phase 3 start pending data. And also, in our meningococcal pentavalent vaccine, we have actually reached very promising Phase 2 readout and are reviewing them to be shared for a potential Phase 3 start. Finally, in our Oncology franchise, we have the readout next year expected for our ENCORE BRAF/MEK fast line. We have data coming from our next-generation CDKs and from a HER2 breast cancer ADC. So as you can see, I exemplified some out of the many POC readouts coming from now to next year and just punctuate that, of course, late-stage pipeline to which you are more familiar with, major interesting things in 2020. High on everyone\u2019s agenda is the Ibrance early breast cancer, which we strongly look forward to, and I feel encouraged and optimistic about the Xeljanz, ankylosing spondylitis, JAK1 in the comparator atopic dermatitis studies that is the final data set for them, moving to potential submission. And of course, the P&G adult. And I\u2019m sorry for \u2013 it\u2019s somewhat lengthy, but it actually reflected the many exciting things to happen from now to end of 2020. Chris Schott : Thank you, Mikael. Chuck Triano : Great, thank you. Can we move to the next question please, operator? Operator : Your next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Umer Raffat : Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions and congrats on a quarter. I want to touch upon three things today, if I may. First, Albert, there\u2019s been a lot of investor questions on whether Pfizer could potentially be interested in M&A to recover the EPS dilution because of Upjohn. I just wanted to ask where you shake out on that, the first one. Secondly, on Upjohn, I noticed there was a S-4 filed yesterday where Pfizer\u2019s internal forecast was that Upjohn stays at $7.8 billion to $8 billion post 2020, even though there would have been a Lyrica patent expiry worth $800 million in Japan, and even though China, 4 plus in would have intensified. So my question is what\u2019s driving this potential $1.5 billion to $2 billion worth of revenue shortfall to keep Upjohn stable at close to $8 billion post 2020? And finally, on tafamidis. It\u2019s very encouraging to see you\u2019re already at 4,800 patients. And my question is, is it inconceivable that Pfizer could hit more than 40,000 patients diagnosed at peak? Thank you very much. Albert Bourla : Excellent questions, Umer. So let me start with the M&A. Frank can cover the Upjohn forecast. And then of course, Angela will speak about tafamidis. On the M&A strategy, look, since the July of 2018, when I \u2013 as Chief Operating Officer of that time, I think I related this strategy going forward on several items including M&A strategy. We are very consistent. Right now we are poised for organic growth. Our organic growth, we forecast to be, on a five years CAGR, 6%. I know the average expectation is even higher. This number, even this 6% of us, compared to the analyst expectations likely will position \u2013 it\u2019s not likely, it\u2019s positioning us compared to the data and our peer set, let\u2019s say, the top 10 to 15 companies in the industry, they\u2019ll be the second largest in terms \u2013 the second fastest-growing company in the next five years with a 6% in terms of rate. And actually, there are a lot of this in terms of producing growth dollars because we are going to \u2013 of course, of our size, of course. So any efforts that we\u2019re going to do, I\u2019m not going to jeopardize that. So we are not \u2013 the name of the game for us, I can say this many times, it is top line growth. And M&A of scale, they have the tendency. One, very difficult to find someone that will not be accretive given that we are the second fastest in our growth. And secondly, it is very instructive operationally. And we can always do in a large M&A, but we have a very clear window of opportunity now to get it right, with our pipeline, to get it right with our launches. As you can see, we are doing very well. I don\u2019t want to put that at risk. Our business development strategy will continue to be bolt-on that will have a focus on R&D. And when I speak about R&D, again, as I said before, I want to be very clear. We are looking for Phase 2 assets, ready Phase 2, ready Phase 3 assets that \u2013 like the ones that we did in the last fall. These are development activities that will provide revenues at the post 2026, 2027 period, when we start filling again some of the LOEs. And we want to make sure that the 6% growth is sustainable over the decade, the whole decade rather than only for the first six, seven years of this decade. So this is our strategy, and we are not looking for a large M&A right now. And with that, I will move to Frank to speak a little bit about the Upjohn projections and what we had in our Board presentation, which I think is pretty much in line with what we gave as guidance for next year. Frank D\u2019Amelio: Yes. So for so Upjohn, the 2020 revenue number that we put out there was $7.5 billion to $8 billion. By the way, that number reflected the Lyrica LOE and it reflected the China VBP. In fact, we anticipated the expansion of the China VBP in that number in terms of expansion going from 11 cities, 12 provinces, 50% share to 70% share, that, that range anticipated the impact of VBP in China. So a couple of comments on how do we get to the rhythm of the numbers that you alluded to. So first, think about this quarter. Upjohn in China this quarter-to-quarter grew 2%. How did it grow 2%? It basically was able to mitigate the impact of the procurement program with geographic expansion within the country. We believe that that\u2019s an opportunity that continues on a going-forward basis. We also believe that there\u2019s opportunities for that business in Emerging Markets outside of China and continuing opportunities for that business and the rest of the world, given the breadth of the portfolio is going to have, and quite frankly, the pipeline that the new company has on a going-forward basis. So that\u2019s why you get to the numbers that were put into the S-4. Albert Bourla : And then, Angela, please, about tafamidis. Angela Hwang : So thanks for the question. Certainly, we are extremely pleased with the diagnosis rates of ATTR-CM that we have seen to date, which is about 4% to 5%. But even with that, it\u2019s important to remember that it is still a severely underdiagnosed disease, and we have a long way to go in terms of achieving what we believe and our patients deserve. There are two aspects of this diagnosis. The first is suspicion or suspecting the disease, and the second is the ability to detect the disease. As you know, because we\u2019ve spoken about this over the last several quarters, we have been intensely focused on our educational efforts to help physicians suspect the disease. And this has been helped by the recently published red flag symptoms, which make it easier for physicians to see the possible clinical symptoms of ATTR-CM and helping them to drive suspicion of this disease. From there, we have been educating around the use of the scintigraphy as a noninvasive means to diagnose ATTR-CM. And we\u2019re pleased to see that to date, about 90% of our diagnosis is now being driven through scintigraphy. Scintigraphy, as you know, is a well-established imaging technique, and it\u2019s widely available across the U.S. in cardiology practices. Actually, we estimate about 15,000 of these diseases are available in cardiology practices throughout the country. And we\u2019re seeing then this willingness and the readiness of physicians to adopt ATTR-CM diagnosis through this mechanism. I know that benchmarks that we have quoted in the past show that a diagnosis rate of about 30% to 50% is what most rare diseases have achieved up until now, and that is what drove our peak estimate. However, we are learning a tremendous amount every single day about this particular disease about what it takes to diagnose it. And certainly, we are focused on making sure that we can do better than that for our patients. Umer Raffat : Great. Chuck Triano : Thank you, Angela. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. David Risinger : Yes. Thanks very much. I have two questions. First, could you just update us on the timing of the Ibrance adjuvant interim efficacy look? And second, I was hoping you could speak to the gross margin upside in the quarter in a little bit more detail and comment on the sustainability of strong gross margins. Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Very interesting questions, David. I think, again, Mikael can provide an update on the timing of Ibrance. And of course, for margins, the master of margins improvements, Mr. Frank D\u2019Amelio. Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : Yes. As \u2013 we tell in general not to be specific about interim analysis in any programs. We expect the program to run to completion in 2020. There is an interim analysis a little bit earlier in 2020, but, most likely, it will run to completion. And we remain optimistic about the outcome of the study based on Ibrance\u2019s very strong performance, more recently event supported by real world evidence data that was very favorable towards different aspects of progression-free survival and also robust on overall survival actually having hazard ration of less than 0.6, which probably is the strongest hazard ratio provided so far. And we will update that hazard ratio as the study matures. Thank you very much. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael. Frank D\u2019Amelio: So Dave, I\u2019ll answer the gross margin question. I think I\u2019ll also just add in even though you didn\u2019t ask a little bit about operating margins, too. So on gross margins, let\u2019s do it based on cost of sales. If you look at our cost of sales year-over-year, Q3 2018, 20.1%; Q3 2019 19.4%. So directionally correct, right? Down on a year-over-year basis. What drove the improvement? Really a couple of things. One is some cost improvements that we were able to implement in our global supply chain organization. Obviously, our manufacturing plants and the like. And then secondly, we have some very favorable product mix, right? If you look at where our revenue growth was, alliance revenues were up 18% year-over-year. Ibrance grew. So \u2013 and then Vyndaqel. So we had some very favorable product mix. If you look at our operating margin for the quarter, high 30s, approximately 30%. So if you look at the trending and then you think about going forward, one key on that operating margin rhythm will be the revenue growth. So obviously, we\u2019re saying now that we think 6% operational revenue growth going forward, that will clearly help our operating margins on a going-forward basis relative to what we have said back in July because we\u2019ll leverage that to the bottom line. And so I mentioned earlier, clearly, our intent is to improve upon the numbers that we provided previously that we\u2019re cautious, appropriately cautious back in July. So net-net, we think we can improve upon the numbers we provided, and we\u2019ll give you all an update on that when we give our 2020 guidance. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Frank. Next question please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Tim Anderson : Thank you. A couple of questions. On your revenue guidance of a five-year CAGR of 6%, consensus is not at that level, and I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s any big areas that jump out at you specifically as being mis-modeled by the analyst community in as much as you\u2019ve looked at that sort of thing. And then on abrocitinib, your JAK inhibitor, you\u2019re running a trial called JADE compare head-to-head versus Dupixent, always bold to take on a product head-to-head. It looks like this trial should be reading out in December of this year, so coming up. I\u2019m wondering, what we should realistically expect from that, both in terms of efficacy and safety? It seems that at least on safety and tolerability, it almost can\u2019t look as good as Dupi because it\u2019s a small molecule JAK inhibitor, but maybe you can kind of tell us what you expect that trial will show. Albert Bourla : Yes. I think the \u2013 again, the R&D question, I think, will go to Mikael. Just a brief comment, but, look, we speak about our numbers, right? And the 6% that we\u2019re providing for our numbers, we are very, very comfortable with this number. We want to make sure that we say what we do and we do what we say. So I don\u2019t want to jeopardize that. So I\u2019m giving numbers that we feel very comfortable that we will achieve. I have seen a lot of reports of analysts that they are having higher numbers than that. That\u2019s why I referred to that. I\u2019m going to check what is the consensus on that. But as I said, I don\u2019t want to comment on other people\u2019s. You are going do your job and we are doing our job. We feel very comfortable on the 6%. Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : Yes. Thank you very much for shedding light on the compare study. So we are very excited about that study as it concludes our potential filing material, including then aggregate safety data. It is a head-to-head against Dupixent \u2013 dupilumab Dupixent, and we felt that it\u2019s an important trial in the sense we expect both drugs to show tolerability and safety that are favorable. We expect abrocitinib, based on current historical comparison, to do very well on efficacy on clearance of skin. And we have specifically an endpoint on itch relief, pruritus reduction, which is one of the critical, most patient-friendly, centered endpoints. And we expect, and I believe that abrocitinib would outperform Dupixent in a very clinical, meaningful manner as it has a strong, fast onset. And data available, although not head-to-head, showed that the JAK1 class not just performed better clinically so far, and head-to-head is the reason why we wanted to document that hypothesis, but there is also science behind it. It inhibits the Interleukin-31 that is a major itch mediator, which is not covered by Dupixent. So I hope that gave you some insight into our integers. Frank D\u2019Amelio: And Tim, it\u2019s Frank. I just wanted to add to what Albert said. Remember, when the new company is formed between our Upjohn business and Mylan, RemainCo, our new Pfizer, is our Pfizer biopharma business. Our biopharma business this quarter grew 9%, the last couple of quarters grew 6%, 7%. So that approximately 6% that Albert gave, we\u2019ve been printing now literally for the last few quarters. And remember, when Newco was formed, new Pfizer, RemainCo keeps all of the growth drivers that we currently talk about on this call. So that portfolio, the momentum of that portfolio carries into the new Pfizer. Albert Bourla : Very good points, Frank. Frank D\u2019Amelio: Thank you. We move to our next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen. Steve Scala : Thank you. I have a couple. First, for Mikael, the press release says that after three doses in infants, the safety of 20-valent pneumococcal vaccine is similar to Prevnar 13, but you don\u2019t say the efficacy is similar after three doses in terms of immune response due to 13 valents that they have in common. Can you comment on that point and the response to the additional seven valents? I know Prevnar 13 is a four-dose regimen, but you must have data after three doses. So that\u2019s the first question. Second question for Frank. Should something draconian come out of Washington that overnight cut revenue by 10%, a 20% reduction in operating expenses would appear required to protect the bottom line. Could a 20% reduction in operating expenses be delivered? And if yes, would it take 6 months, 12 months or would it take much longer? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : Yes. We shared data on three immunizations. And it was a descriptive study, not powered for efficacy, but I \u2013 my take at this was, as in the press release, we had very robust rise in immune titer against all 20 serotypes. And at this stage, they look very similar to the PCV13 when you look at totality of data. And the immune titers also are supplemented by functional antibody responses that we\u2019re now obtaining that, again, look very robust for the PCV20 across all serotypes. I wanted also to say that increasingly available epidemiology data strengthened the notion that the PCV20 has a very broad coverage, far exceeding PCV15 developed by a competitor, where do you look at the infant population, the adult population, U.S. or European major countries and whether you look at IPD and CAP. So we\u2019re very pleased with emerging data and increased insights into epidemiology that indicates this vaccine has the potential to provide the broadest ever coverage for a pneumococcal disease. Frank D\u2019Amelio: And then, Steve, if there was some draconian action that resulted in a 10% impact on our revenue, which is a big number, then clearly we would have to revisit our cost structure. I mean, how could we not? In terms of how much we could do it, how quickly we would do it, quite frankly, we\u2019d have to work our way through that. But the short answer is we would clearly review our cost structure, every element of the cost structure, by the way, which we do all the time anyway, and then see what we have to do to deal with \u2013 quite frankly, what the model is \u2013 what the business model is going forward. A 10% decline in our revenues is a change in our business model. And then we\u2019d have to obviously look at that in terms of how we run our business on a going-forward basis. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Frank. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Navin Jacob from UBS. Navin Jacob : Hi. Two questions if I may. Number one on Hospira, as you have stabilized that business in the manufacturing capabilities there. Wondering if you could help us understand to what extent there have been \u201clost revenues\u201d over the last two years that would \u2013 that you may have been able to have if Hospira had been at full capacity and that basically, what I\u2019m asking is, how much do you think you can recover going forward for Hospira and how quickly could that growth be achieved? And then on the C. difficile vaccine, I think the Phase 3 was supposed to read out in 2020, but I think you just went through an interim analysis in the DSMB or the monitoring board suggested to expand that study, wondering when the readout for that Phase 3 will be now? Thank you very much. Albert Bourla : Right. I think, Angela can answer the Hospira questions to say something for us, the manufacturing issues and the supply for Hospira created, I would say a lot of trust with our customer. This is for me the most important, okay. And that\u2019s why we took it very seriously and we were very transparent with them and we created also a hospital business unit, because this is mostly hospital products, so that can be very customer focused only on the hospitals, so that we can make sure that we had the relations, that we had before and make them very strong. And I have to say that we were very successful and what the customers appreciate the most was across products. Obviously there is business that we lost and we hope that we will recover most of it. Angela, what do you think? Angela Hwang : Sure. I think the way I would think about the future growth of the hospital business unit and even Hospira would be in the following way. I think there is a portion of the revenue that was lost as a result of the supply issues that we would recover. There is a portion that we wouldn\u2019t recover, but that isn\u2019t \u2013 I guess that\u2019s not the only source of growth, I think the way to think about growth also is what we\u2019re doing to continue to diversify that portfolio and to bring in new launches. You hear Frank talk about Panzyga, as one of those and in our pipeline and in our portfolio today, our continuous launches, both from a presentation and a device perspective as well as from the molecule perspective. I think the other element of the hospital business unit that we also need to consider is the strong anti-infective portfolio that is part of that business unit. Those are sterile injectables and in that unit \u2013 in that portion of the business are a number of new launches that began a couple of years ago and are now launching globally. So that\u2019s how I would think about growth in that portfolio, is that it\u2019s not dependent purely on the replacement or the regaining of business. A portion of it is, but much more of it is dependent on new ventures and new spaces that we are venturing into. Albert Bourla : Yes, Michael. Mikael Dolsten : On the C. diff, yes, we were pleased with the aspect that safety and tolerability with regard as favorable at the interim analysis and clearly the futility analysis indicated that the study should continue. While we tried to target the high-risk patients for C. diff infection by looking at increased risk for contact with healthcare community or recent use of antibiotics, we are of course pioneers in this area of developing a vaccine for this urgent need for preventing what can be fatal C. diff infections. So we\u2019ll use all our insights to learn today to make sure that we can continue and expand enrollment to follow the advice from the monitoring committee to make sure we can conclude this study as soon as possible. And of course, there is an urgency with 450,000 C. diff infections every year in U.S. and close to 30,000 of this and we\u2019ll do everything possible to accelerate the readout of the study and get the events. We clearly do accumulated events, although somewhat slower than we initially hoped, but rest assure that we will do everything we can to make sure the readout is coming as soon as possible and we will later update you with more firm aspects of that. Chuck Triano : Thanks Michael. Next question please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi. Andrew Baum : Thank you. Your portfolio is heavily exposed to high list price, heavy Part B expose drugs. I\u2019m obviously thinking about Ibrance, Inlyta, Xtandi so on and so forth. You mentioned \u2013 you welcomed the proposal to cap out of pocket spends under Medicare Part B, but within the same Finance Committee proposal, there is also an obligation for you to funds catastrophic coverage to the tune of 20% and even larger contribution from the plan sponsor. So my question is what is your comfort level with that part of the proposal and to what extent do you think, particularly in crowded classes like the CDK 4/6, the obligation on the plan providers to fund catastrophic coverage is going to further increased price competition in the segment? And then the second question, if I quickly, historically in veiled against some of your competitors for basically holding Xeljanz into very treatment refractory settings, given sufficient of that rebate power, I\u2019m thinking particularly of Humira, what\u2019s your confidence level that you\u2019re going to be able to secure favorable market positions with JAKs, given drugs like Dupixent are going to be generating significant rebates for the PBMs in the commercial book of business by the time you hit the market? Many thanks. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much. Let me try to answer your question about the out of pocket and all these reforms in the Medicare that have been proposed. And then I will ask Angela to speak about Xeljanz. When it comes to price reforms there are things that we agree and are things that we do not agree. But I would tell you that we are fanatically in favor of reducing out-of-pocket cost for patients. Because right now the fundamental issue that drives this polarization in the political environment around healthcare, it is a real problem and the problem is that the Americans are paying for their medicines. Like if they are nothing short, although they are having insurance, when they go to collect them from the counter of the pharmacist. This is not happening with the hospital, this is not happening with diagnostics, this is not happening with other medical intervention, at least to the degree, what was happening with medicines and this is why that drug pricing is so high in the debate, although they represents only 10%, 12% of the total healthcare cost. So that needs to be addressed. Now the way that the Senate for example is proposing for aggressive or even worse through the house, they are going to increase the contribution of the pharmaceutical companies and of course this will help. But this is \u2013 the list of my problems overall, because at least what hurts us helps the patients. My issue with this bill, it is that a lot of other measures, but they\u2019re suggesting that hurt us even more. They are not moving the savings to the patients, which is the fundamental issue that, right now, society is dealing with and this is our efforts here. I believe, that it is to the benefit of the industry, it is to the benefit of innovation, it is to the benefit of patients, it is to the benefit of the healthcare system to reduce the out-of-pocket expenses, either with a rebate reform or if that\u2019s not on the picture right now by reducing the \u2013 by implementing a cap for out-of-pocket, it is of paramount importance, even if you have to pay for it. And Xeljanz, Angela. Angela Hwang : So it is true that when we look back the Xeljanz access has been challenging through time, but certainly we over the last several years have worked hard with our payers as well as our PBMs as well as amassing, I think some really strong scientific and patient experience and evidence behind Xeljanz, that is creating momentum for this particular product. The I&I category generally is one that is the most heavily rebated and I think that we have demonstrated our ability to be a real solution in this space of great unmet need. And as evidenced just compared to last year this time, we now have 32 million more incremental lives in Medicare and commercial channels that have gained unrestricted access, and specifically in fact just this past May we gained an additional 8 million lives. So I think that this is sort of good evidence to show how we are working hand-in-hand with our payers as well as our PBMs to bring the totality of our data and our experience to bear. I\u2019m filling an area of great unmet need. Chuck Triano : Great. Thanks, Angela. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn : Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Albert, you mentioned a few of your upcoming biosimilar launches, just wondering if you can help frame for us, the potential size of the opportunity as you think about the long-term there and maybe walk through some of the remaining hurdles in terms of establishing a robust biosimilars market in the U.S. And then Angela, just wondering any more color you can provide on the extended dynamics in terms of either share among the different segments or maybe mix of the prescriber base? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Let me speak a little bit about \u2013 generally about biosimilars, and then I will ask Angela to answer the second question and also specifics in the biosimilars potential of what we are going through. I think in the U.S., unlike other countries there is a problem with the system and the system is that there is \u2013 the fundamental issue that there is this rebate trough, but payers overall they do see the benefit of using biosimilar solution of what physicians would like to prescribe and that the FDA, saying that has similar efficacy and safety, and it is much cheaper. Although they want to do that, they are trapped and they cannot because they are going to lose the benefits or the rebates that the originator is offering. And I think, frankly, that unless we resolve this big issue, we will never be able to see tremendous progress on biosimilars. So this is something, I think, that the political world is understanding. This is something that we are very vocal about it. This is something that we are discussing constantly with payers, who they want to move to new solutions, but they cannot. And I think that there is positive momentum on that, but still I agree, to be able to see transformational change in the penetration of biosimilars, so the health care system can see real lives. Significant savings can only happen if we find a solution to that. We have also suggested other measures like the savings should be served by providers, et cetera, et cetera, but I think that\u2019s the fundamental one. Now all biosimilars are not the same because \u2013 and not all markets are the same. Whether you have closed systems like the Kaiser, for example, the penetration of biosimilars is very, very high because they can see the benefit of doing something like that. But when you have intermediates being involved but then big rebates in play, it\u2019s very difficult for them to do. And also, oncology is very different. Also, biosimilars from I&I are very similar because the I&I, they are giving for very extensive period of time, so you need to switch. New patients aren\u2019t coming very often. Oncology is very different because it\u2019s more limited the period that they are \u2013 that therapists use. And then the patients are coming much more often \u2013 New patients are coming much more often in higher proportion. But, Angela, maybe you want to add into that, and then also provide an answer to the second question. Angela Hwang : Sure. I think Albert has said, much of it and maybe what I can add is the following. I think within the context of the fact that the U.S. dynamics are very different from the European dynamics, where you see a much greater adoption of biosimilars, what we have seen with our supportive care biosimilar, which is Retacrit, is that we\u2019ve seen some nice growth there. To date, it has a 16% market share, which is the highest that we\u2019ve seen of any biosimilar here in the U.S. and I think that that tells us \u2013 and that\u2019s given us the opportunity to learn about what it will take to launch oncology biosimilars as well as what we can expect in this particular space. So I think with the three biosimilars coming within \u2013 one after the other December, January, February of end of this year, we look forward to driving the growth of this portfolio of biosimilars in an area of high unmet need for patients. As it pertains to Xtandi, you do see a tremendous growth here this quarter. We had a great quarter growing 25% year-over-year, and I think that this is evidence of the great confidence that our prescribers, both neurologists and medical oncologists, are having with Xtandi. We have leading market share at 37% branded in a growing class and the plus as well has been one that has grown 3 points from last quarter to this quarter. So when we look at our sources of patients for Xtandi, they come in two forms. First, it\u2019s the non-metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, where we continue to see increases, both in total patients as well as new patient starts since the PROSPER approval. And just as a measure of PROSPER, urologists are generally the prescribers in an earlier disease setting, and here urology prescribing is growing at 44%. And so we\u2019re continuing to see the proportion of our business from PROSPER growth very positively. Also to remember that these patients are earlier in terms of their course of disease and therefore have higher days of therapy. So this will drive the prescriptions and the revenues. In metastatic CRPC, castrate-resistant prostate cancer, which is still the majority of our business. Our new patient share continues to increase there too. And here, we not only have the number one share of voice with oncologists, but our prescribing with oncology \u2013 medical oncology continues to grow significantly as well in this quarter at 21%. And so when you bring all of this together and you add into that the approval and/or the positive Phase 3 results we got from Ezimet and the submissions that we have for additional indications in both the non-metastatic, the hormone-sensitive setting as well as additional data from the inbox study. I think that what we have in Xtandi is a uniquely positioned NHT that is going to be able to treat multiple indications in both hormone-sensitive as well as castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Chuck Triano : Excellent, thanks Angela. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald. Louise Chen : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. So my first question is that in consensus there is a meaningful step up in Ibrance sales through 2023. And do you think you can grow Ibrance double digits without an adjuvant or neoadjuvant approval? And then second question I had is on abrocitinib, based on the safety data that you\u2019ve seen thus far, is there a chance that you will not get a black box warning like other JAK15 in the industry? And then last question I had was if you could give an update on your DMD program, where you stand today, the competitiveness of your program versus some of the other ones out there, based on the data that you\u2019ve seen thus far? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Yes. A quick answer on the Ibrance, and then I think abrocitinib and DMD will be covered by Mikael. Again, in the spirit that I don\u2019t want to comment what is the analysts expectations, I know what they are, and they\u2019re our expectations. And we are projecting that we will grow Ibrance to double digit, and, therefore, also expecting that we will receive the \u2013 that we will have, let\u2019s say, a positive PALACE study, which is the main study that is driving expansion of prescriptions and drivers. So, of course, everything is risk-adjusted in our projections. And some will be positive, some will be negative, but the 6% that we are taking because the ratio on all of that is not based on one or two, but is based on risk adjustment of multiple. So we are feeling very comfortable that, overall, we will not say bad because if another fails, another one would succeed. And that one will derisk the revenue. So we\u2019ll be much higher. Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : Yes. So starting with abrocitinib. I think it\u2019s a good question, you raised here that each JAK inhibitor are different and we designed our JAK inhibitors for optimal use depending on the condition, and it\u2019s hard for me to express a strong view here on the potential black box as it\u2019s really the decision of the FDA. I can only say that we have so far seen a very good safety profile and we have not seen any cardiovascular signals at all with this drug. And as you\u2019ve seen in our reported trials, efficacy has been very persuasive and strong. So we look forward to finalize the program, generate the compare data that could show potential advantages with faster onset versus standard of care Dupixent and then have a dialog with FDA. The DMD program, we are continuing dosing patients and we reported at the PPMD Conference that we had transduced more than 70% of the muscle fibers and expressed mean dystrophin at 30% of normal that we think is in the range that where you should see benefit. Interestingly, we also shared with you, using the North Star Ambulatory Activity Scale that we had two patients, where we saw a benefit in increased performance. And please remember, these patients were older than patient reported by other players in the field, and older patients are the harder is to show benefit as the natural history is to decline. So we are concluding, we hope to start in a relative short time frame and pending final data set, we are preparing for start of Phase 3 next year. And hope certainly that these type of therapy can transform patients\u2019 lives for these poor boys. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Michael. And operator, can we take our last question please. Operator : Your final question comes from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Geoff Meacham : Good morning, guys, thanks for the question. Just had a few. Angela for Vyndaqel, I just want to get a little bit more detail on the rollout in the U.S. Obviously, I know it\u2019s early, but from the field, how would you characterize reimbursement and access and other commercial lessons to be learned from the EU? And then, Albert, just to put a finer point on your comments for long-term growth and deals. I mean, when you look at the LOE starting in 2026, you mentioned the pipeline readouts as a clearly an offset, but can that or smaller tuck-in deals be enough to still get you to growth over the course of the decade? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Angela? Angela Hwang : Great. So from a reimbursement perspective, I think that we are seeing things pan out exactly as we thought. As you know, the large majority of our patients would be Medicare patients because the \u2013 just the age and the prevalence of the disease in this particular population. But currently, we\u2019re seeing about 80% of our patients in the Medicare bucket, about 12% in the commercial lives bucket and then of the remainder in Medicaid and others. And so anticipating that this would be sort of how the patient \u2013 I guess the patient mix would look. We created at the launch of Vyndaqel, a number of programs to support the reimbursement of Vyndaqel. And, so for example, in the commercial patients, we have a co-pay card, a co-pay assistance program. For all patients, we have a bridge program to ensure that patients can receive access to Vyndaqel, while they\u2019re waiting for their reimbursement decisions. And for Medicare patients, we\u2019re exploring \u2013 we\u2019re in the process of exploring a number of ways that we can help lower co-pay costs for Medicare patients including working with payers on innovative contracting approaches, which will then help to lower their co-pay. And then of course there is always a portion of patients that are on our free drug program. But I think all in all, what we\u2019re learning from these early days in the market, is that the solutions that we have are definitely supporting our patients in the way that they need, and then not to forget, we still have the support from the Pfizer\u2019s patient hub as well as a number of specialty pharmacies and hospitals that actually provide our patients with all the support they need to clear that prior authorizations. And I think that this service has been hugely helpful in helping us to clear prior auths and get our patients on drug as soon as possible. Albert Bourla : And Geoff, to your question about if we believe that this growth going to be sustainable in the post 25, 26 period? The answer is yes. Look, it is normal for companies, who have LOEs. What is abnormal is not to have LOEs, but it is normal for companies to have LOEs and ourselves, we will come back to normality, actually not even in 26. 26 is a very small number of LOEs. From 27, we are coming back to normal LOEs as a percentage of sales. And then this we need to with everything that we know right now, normal in 27. So this is 8 years from now, right. So I feel very comfortable, but we will have enough time and we have a pipeline that is very diversified and we have a strategy that is doubled down only to develop substrate that will deliver on that. So when the Company\u2019s on normality, we\u2019ll be able to continue growing at the same rate that we are growing right now. So I think that\u2019s the end, right? It\u2019s like, unfortunately, we don\u2019t have time. We exceeded our time. So I want to thank you all for joining us today. I liked a lot this call. There were fewer questions on financials because they were stellar, of course. And we devoted most of the time to the pipeline, which is exactly what we want to do, and to the growth drivers of the business, which is exactly what an earnings call of a successful pharmaceuticals company should look like. Now as we move toward the expected close of the Upjohn-Mylan transaction next year, I expect that both businesses will be significantly strengthened. We expect Pfizer to remain positioned to deliver top and bottom line growth, that it\u2019s among the industry leaders. And you know us. We want to be the leader, so we will aim for that. And by bringing together Mylan\u2019s growth products into Upjohn\u2019s growth markets, we are creating the leading off-patent drug company with a strong financial profile and true global reach. All these reasons, it is an exciting time for our company, and we will remain highly focused on executing against these strategies. So thank you very much. Have a great rest of the day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude Pfizer\u2019s third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to Pfizer's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Chuck Triano : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer's fourth quarter and full year 2019 performance and 2020 financial guidance. I'm joined today by our CEO, and Chairman Albert Bourla; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Angela Hwang, Group President, Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group; John Young, our Chief Business Officer; and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. This morning I will speak about our performance for the year, the continued advancement of our pipeline and the steps we're taking to position Pfizer for accelerated growth following the expected separation of Upjohn from Pfizer later this year. Frank will then provide details regarding our fourth quarter performance and our 2020 financial guidance. 2019 was a productive and transformational year for Pfizer, which we generated solid full year financial results. These results were highlighted by exceptional 8% operational revenue growth for the year and the 9% in the fourth quarter for our Biopharma business, which will become the new Pfizer following the expected separation of Upjohn. Once again, our Biopharmaceutical group, outstanding growth was driven primarily by the continued strong performance from all our key growth drivers. This includes Ibrance, Xtandi, Eliquis, Xeljanz, Vyndaqel among others. Biopharma also generated 14% operational growth in emerging markets in 2019. I would point out that Biopharma's 2019 growth came from volume increases, not pricing. In fact pricing had the negative 2% impact in Biopharma's results. For full year 2019 global Ibrance revenues increased 23% operationally to become a nearly $5 billion a year product. In the US Ibrance realized robust growth and retained its strong leadership position in the syndicate class with a nearly 90% sale. Ibrance performance outside of the US was also very strong, and we still see significant opportunities in countries where the use of CDK inhibitors has not yet reached the levels seen in the US. Overall Ibrance is approved in more than 90 countries is the number one prescribed CDK 4/6 inhibitor globally and has reached more than 250,000 patients. For Xtandi alliance revenues in the US were up 20% for the full year, and when combined with our royalty income on ex-US sales totaled nearly $1.2 billion in 2019. Xtandi is the leading brand in novel hormone therapy in an increasingly competitive but growing class with 37% market share in total prescriptions. The vast year over year growth was due to continued uptake of the non-metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer indication as well as prescriber confidence in recognition of Xtandi's strong data gross CRTC. Frank D'Amelio: Thanks, Albert. Good day everyone. Now moving on to the financials, fourth quarter 2019 revenues were $12.7 billion down 8% operationally versus the year ago quarter. Excluding the impact of the Consumer Healthcare business revenue was down 1% operationally. Our Biopharmaceuticals Group business revenues were $10.5 billion up 9% operationally versus the year ago quarter with strong operational growth in Ibrance, Eliquis, Xeljanz and Vyndaqel and a second straight quarter of operational growth for our hospital business, including our sterile injectables. Revenues for our Upjohn business in the fourth quarter decreased 32% operationally to $2.2 billion with the primary year-over-year impact again being a generic competition for Lyrica in the US that began in July of 2019. Excluding the unfavorable impact of Lyrica in the US and other recent product losses of exclusivity, fourth quarter 2019 revenues for Upjohn declined 6% operationally. I know Upjohn's business in China has been an area of focus and fourth quarter revenues for Upjohn declined 1% operationally. We saw the expected revenue declines for Lipitor and Norvasc in provinces where the volume based procurement program has been implemented and these declines were mostly offset by operational growth from products, not impacted by the VBP program, including Celebrex and Viagra. Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was favorably impacted by the July completion of the Consumer Healthcare joint venture transaction with GSK partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange and the Lyrica loss of exclusivity. In the fourth quarter, we recorded a $0.06 loss per share on a GAAP basis, which primarily due to a $2.6 billion asset impairment charge for Eucrisa and restructuring purchase accounting and legal charges. Adjusted diluted EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.55 versus $0.63 in the year ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower revenues again, mainly due to the Lyrica LOE in the US and higher operating expenses. Chuck Triano : Thanks Frank and Albert for those remarks. At this time operator, can we please poll for questions. Operator :  Your first question comes from Randall Stanicky from RBC Capital Markets. Randall Stanicky : Great. Thanks, guys, for the questions. I've two, one for Albert and one for Angela. Albert a couple weeks ago, you called out $4.5 billion in enabling cost within SI&A  with an opportunity to simplify. So how do we think about the cost savings opportunity after you close Upjohn in terms of number one, how much incremental cost savings do you see beyond was built into the 37% margin? And then number two, how much of that could hit back half 2020 versus 2021. And then I have a follow-up after that for Angela. Albert Bourla : Okay. I think you should, - how can he ask question to Angela, she can get back, okay. So indeed we have this year approximately $14.3 billion of SI&A and front we were on the number in more details. And as I said 4.5 approximately is what we call enabling funds. So these are sanctions like finance, legal facilities that we are facilitating and enabling the core functions of our business to perform. Core functions I mean are discovering the products, manufacturing that is making them happen and commercial but it is making them available to the patients. We do believe that this $4.5 billion actually have approximately 10,000 people can be improved. And we have plans to dissolve. In the current guidance and to comment there is part, a small part of that, cost opportunity saving, already incorporated and in 2021, will be about to get back, so Frank. Frank D'Amelio: So Randall just let me run the number which is if you look at 2019 actual SI&A for example, we spent about $14 billion as a company. Obviously that $4.5 billion that Albert alluded to in that $14 billion. If you look at our 2020 guidance for SI&A the range is $12 billion to $13 billion, midpoints $12.5 billion. $12.5 billion from $14 billion is a decline of $1.5 billion, roughly half of that is consumer. Because, we went from consolidating consumer to equity accounting on consumer once the deal closed in July 31, 2019. The remaining half is really operational savings across the company, including part of the - including some of the $4.5 billion that Albert alluded to. And that obviously help contribute to the IBT as a percentage of revenue, improving from 35 - from the mid-30s to 37%. And then to Albert's point, obviously, what we're doing now is working on further improvements that would obviously positively impact the SI&A, and that would flow to the bottom line. Chuck Triano : Great, thanks Albert and Frank. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Schott from JP Morgan. Chris Schott : Great, thanks very much for the question. Just had three quick product ones. The first was on Vyndaqel. Seems like a nice step up in all your patient metrics seems like, although it's basically doubled or tripled from 3Q. Can you help bridge those figures with the sequential sales ramp we saw which wasn't quite as dramatic? The second question was on Ibrance. Just elaboration there in terms of what drove the revised timelines for PALACE. And have you taken another interim look at the data at this point. And then finally on tanezumab. Just an update in terms of what the status and outlook is for that product at this point? Thanks so much. Albert Bourla : Very good. Thank you very much. I will ask Angela to address the Vyndaqel and tanezumab questions. And then I will say a few words about Ibrance. And maybe I will ask Mikael to chime in, please. Angela Hwang : So thanks for the question. And certainly we are pleased with the increased diagnosis prescription as well as the numbers of patients that are receiving Vyndaqel. As you said, our diagnosis now is up to about 9%. The ability for patients to receive prescriptions up to about 64% of those that are diagnosed and those that are receiving medications are around 35% of those that are diagnosed. So every quarter since we've been reporting this, we've been seeing some nice increases. So, we certainly pleased with that. I think in terms just the sort of the commensurate alignment with the actual net sales numbers, I think that there are obviously there - every single day there is a dynamic situation. And the number and the proportion of patients, whether they are Medicare and commercial lives, those are changing. And so the gross to net of those are going to affect I think, what you see on a net sales basis. So, I think that, we are watching and really focused on driving diagnosis and ensuring that as many patients can get on these drugs as possible. And we're starting to see some really nice pickup. But I think that is still a very dynamic situation because we're really relatively new in this process. So we'll continue to monitor and should expect to see some, quarter to quarter changes in terms of net sales. Albert Bourla : And obviously the new patients that are contributing disproportionately because they are in fewer months of treatment in terms of sales. Angela Hwang : Right. And then your second question was on tanezumab. So we're really pleased that in December of 2019, we completed our U.S. submission of tanezumab. And we are also pursuing regulatory submissions in the EU and in Japan. This submission was done in close collaboration with the FDA and it includes the 2.5 milligrams in moderate to severe osteoarthritis patients. So at this moment in time we're waiting acceptance of this filing, but we see significant potential of tanezumab and osteoarthritis. So we're really excited about this filing. And particularly because we're in a time where non-opioid solutions are very, very much needed for these patients. If you look at the market potential today, there are about 27 million Americans that suffer from osteoarthritis and 11 million of those have moderate to severe OA. 80% of those 11 million people have tried and failed three or more analgesics. So that tells us that there is just a huge amount of unmet need in this patient population. Patients are cycling through a number of pain, pain medications. And there just is an incredible need for new options. And this is where we think tanezumab can really fill an unmet need. It has the potential to become the first in class non-opioid treatment for these patients. And we eagerly await the acceptance of this file from the FDA. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Now let me address the question on Ibrance. The expected completion of the study slept a little bit few weeks actually. It was at the end of the '19, excuse me the end of '20 and now it's moved into the very beginning of '21. The only reason of this is that the events are not coming at the pace that we had forecasted, didn't expect it. So, now that means people are not progressing into their disease. I don't think we can draw any conclusions, if that means good news or bad news, I think it's just facts of the data. We don't know if the people aren't progressing equally in the two arms or they're progressing in the treatment. That remains to be seen when we unblind the date. As regards your question, if there was an interim analysis, there was not an interim analysis. So we haven't seen any interim analysis. There will be an interim analysis, but we do not expect that the most likely scenario is that the study will continue when this interim analysis comes. The study was designed to come to full completion. And the criteria that we have set to stop for efficacy in the interim study are very, very high. So it's not impossible, but this will happen. But most likely scenario, it is that as we had planned that the study will come to completion. At the end of it, this is what will happen. But we are very - we still remain very, very encouraged and optimistic about Ibrance. Of course, it's a Phase 3, you never know what will be. But all the signs behind it is supporting that we could have a positive outcome. And I will ask actually, Mikael, to make a few comments on the science and to what does this mean? Mikael Dolsten : I guess punctuate, a few things that Albert described so well. Four aspect of why we are, very excited and optimistic about the science and clinical data to predict a potential positive outcome for the discuss PALACE study. As you know, first of all that the CDK 4/6 inhibitor Ibrance convert with estrogen receptor drugs to stop cancer cells or breast cancer cells to divide. We've shown that in the  2 and 3 studies, and more recently we reported that we could reproduce a data direction in real world evidence based on real world data from  and other databases. And this noteworthy including also overall survival data, again, showing in medical practice importance of these drugs. Three, the pilot study that looked at the ability publicity Ibrance to stop dividing of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer showed that this mechanism was very well operating in a powerful way. And finally, let me remind you that other agents that act on estrogen receptor positive breast cancers and convert with the power cycling such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors, all were initially developed in metastatic cancer and did very well in element treatment in early breast cancer. So these four observations in adults, make us continue to be excited and very optimistic. And as Albert alluded to relatively small change in projected trial is based on a trial that actually started 4.5 years ago. And it is quite common that in the final 12 months or so, minor changes in enrollment rate, and process planning for study reports can affect trial. But we'd all obvious, you can hear, we remain encouraged enthusiasts about what Ibrance can offer for element treatment to breast cancer. Chuck Triano : Right. Thanks for the helpful context, Mikael. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just two product ones for me; I was wondering, if you can talk about Ibrance rest of world dynamics, any specific headwinds this quarter? And how to think about the trajectory into this year? And then for Xeljanz, I was wondering if you can give us a split of sales by indication and if you're seeing any impact in RA from the launch of AbbVie's RINVOQ on either share price? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you very, very much. So, Angela? Angela Hwang : Sure. So, first of all, Ibrance. We continue to see good growth and strong growth ex-U.S., but probably 2 factors that are tempering the net sales, as you saw in Q4. The first is pricing and that continues to be something that we work hard at especially in the EU to gain access for our products in Europe. And the second is class growth. So you look at the class growth of the CDK class through the quarters that has increased but over the last quarter it has tempered. And it's sort of sitting at around a 35% as CDK class growth right now, cross share. But within that the Ibrance still has a very, very high product share in the 80's. So I think its pointing out to us the fact that there is still opportunity for us to grow and growing the CDK class is going to be an area of tremendous focus for us ex US in 2020 and beyond. Your second question was around Xeljanz. And so Xeljanz again we continue to see excellent growth in Xeljanz. In fact, despite the fact that you only see this sort of 1% net sales growth in Q4 I will point out that globally full year we had 29% growth of Xeljanz which is one of the highest of all of our core brands here at Pfizer our entire portfolio. Q4 we saw 23% prescription growth and this prescription growth was driven by extremely strong performance in rheumatoid arthritis which really was not impacted by the label changes. And we still continue to see strong growth in ulcerative colitis even though here was the biggest label change, and so physicians did have to adjust the way that they were prescribing Xeljanz. But we expect this growth to continue because we have excellent momentum and confidence in prescribing from our physicians. We have significant unmet need and we have greatly improved access. And this access is in fact what drove the 1% net sales in Q4. There was - in Q4 of '18 we saw an inventory build at the end of the year which didn't happen in Q4 of '19. So that was one of the reasons that affected our Q4 performance in '19. And then also more importantly throughout the course of 2019 we gained significant access. In fact we added 59 million incremental lives through contracting. And it's because of the timing of when these contracts were signed or renewed that drove the subsequent impact of rebates. And this sort of came to ahead and sort of disproportionately affected us in Q4 of '19. So I think stepping back we're really pleased with the access that we do have in Xeljanz. And since it was launched eight years ago this is the most favorable access situation that we ever had which is very important when it comes to ability to compete with RINVOQ. You asked the question around RINVOQ, just to sort of put into prospective I think that we're excited about having another competitor help drive the growth of the Jack class in all of our indications. That being said Xeljanz still enjoys a lion, a leading market share especially in RA where we have more than 15% of the market share of the entire class. Albert Bourla : Great, thank you very much Angela. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Umer Raffat : Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. First, Albert, if I may, what you hearing on a possible upcoming rule on IPI? There is a lot of press that companies have been notified by White House. I was curious what you know about it and is there something we should be very concerned about? Mikael one quick one for you on the DMD gene therapy for a minute, you mentioned there is a proof of concept coming. My question is have there been additional protocol driven positive enrollment. And I asked because recall when the first SA when the kidney injury happened the trial was paused and I'm curious has anything like that happened again. And then finally, Frank maybe just quickly on SI&A line. I know little higher than consensus but technically year-over-year versus 4Q18 it was not much higher, but I also realized Q418 has some consumer, maybe you could tell us about your holiday party. Thank you very much. Albert Bourla : Alright, so let me start with the IPI, we have not received any notification on that. So there is not news from our side other than what we read, don't know with respect. So, Mikael. Mikael Dolsten : Yeah. Just to remind you, we shared at the PPMD conference meet of last year update on six patients dosed with our DMD gene therapy that showed encouraging data on expression muscle fibers amounted micro dystrophin. And on some of the patients we had also an opportunity to report the encouraging trends on functional outcomes. We have dosed additional patients since then. And we continue to get experience on efficacy and safety and clinical management that are incorporated in the procedures how we manage these patients going forward. We plan to conclude Phase 2 this spring. And based on current data and insights, we are planning to start Phase 3, of course, pending regulatory dialogues later this year, as indicated in Albert's opening remarks. Albert Bourla : All right, Frank, maybe you want to tell us about the holiday party, I was not being aware. Frank D'Amelio: Sure. Yes, I wasn't invited either. Some of you who was in the party. Let me run the numbers and I'll explain what happened. So for the quarter, SI&A was about $4.1 billion, it was up about 4% operationally $100 million give or take from the prior year quarter. What really drove that was increased investment behind some of our brands, some of oncology products, some of our launch products like Vyndaqel, and some increased investment in emerging markets. But it was really investment in terms of being part of supporting our brands. Albert Bourla : Yeah, thank you, Mikael. And just to make a comment, we are very, very diligent in that way that we allocate capital. And we are - when we have opportunities to put in promotional money so we can have a very strong stock, we do it. And we take those money usually, by being very diligent in the way that we control the indirect expense. I have been very clear, about indirect is a very clear distinction in our mind. So when it comes to things, that there are overheads and things that they are not affecting directly, the business results, we are very, very tough. And when it comes to areas that the investments can affect business results, we are creative and generous. So that's what you saw here. Frank D'Amelio: And these are clearly direct expenses. Albert Bourla : And these are all direct expense. The same by the way, although you didn't ask comes to R&D. Right now we are increasing R&D investments. But we are increasing R&D investments only for programs only for projects, we are not increasing infrastructure, not increasing the research centers. At large we maintain a very strong presence there and we keep that very strong. But what is driving the increase R&D it is more Phase 3 or Phase 2 studies, is very clear. Chuck Triano : Right. Thank you. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. David Risinger : Yes, thanks very much. So, I have three questions, please. First, Albert, could you discuss why Pfizer decided not to repurchase shares in 2020? And then maybe Frank, you can comment about - comment on how we should think about the EPS implications when we consider your guidance relative to consensus, which had assumed some share repurchase? Second, regarding the opportunity to rationalize the $4.5 billion in costs, can you just give us a sense for what percentage reduction is reasonable to assume a few years out, I was guessing maybe 20%, but I just don't know what's reasonable? And then third, regarding the transfer of $600 million in revenue to Upjohn, does that change the economics that Pfizer will receive as part of the exit to Mylan? Thanks. Albert Bourla : Yes. And I think basically all questions can be answered by Frank, I will just make some introductory comments. The reason why, capital allocation, we are allocating right now money to increase the dividend and also to invest in our business or the OpEx to modernize our facility or the CapEx to modernize our facilities. The reason why we don't do right now share repurchases is because we want to make sure that we maintain very strong, hard power to invest in the business. The past was a very different Pfizer, the past of the last decade had to deal with declining of revenues, constant declining of revenues. And we had to do what you had to do, even if it was financial engineering, with purchasing back ourselves. We couldn't invest them and create higher value. Now is a very different situation. We are a very different company, the company is going to have best-in-class top line growth revenue story, starting from nothing the separation of Upjohn in the middle of the year from the expected separation of Upjohn in the middle of the year. And we do not need, we can organically grow EPS, as you can see all our predictions on EPS this year are organically no share repurchases. But you can use the capital to invest in goods Phase 2, Phase 3 assets that could build our pipeline. So this is the strategy behind it. Now let me ask Frank to run the numbers. Frank D'Amelio: So David, all I'll do is I don't want to duplicate anything, Albert said. I'll just add a couple of things on the share repurchases. One, we also announced the dividend increase in December. So obviously, we continue to deploy capital in the area of dividends, which we think is important to our investment thesis. And that's something obviously as we go forward, we'll continue to look at. And then obviously, our 2020 guidance assumes no repurchases. So when you look at the improvement, which was material in terms of the midpoint, versus what we did back in July, none of that is coming from share repurchases. Let me ask you another couple of questions, on the $600 million transfer to Upjohn and does that change any economics? Let me kind of - let me give some context on this, which is one nothing's been decided yet. We are still in negotiations with Mylan on those two businesses and whether or not they will transfer to Beatrice upon close. If we don't come to an agreement, those businesses would remain with new Pfizer. And so we're still in negotiations. And so in terms of the economics, I'd say more to come still to be determined. And if and when we complete that, obviously, I'll be in a better position to answer that. On the $4.5 billion of indirect spend. And, directionally, what do we think we can do there? I don't want to give a specific percentage because we're still working our way through the process. But I think I alluded to this earlier, which is we've already made some nice headway. I think we can make additional headway that additional headway would show up in SI&A. And obviously our intent would be for that to show up in the IVT's percentage of revenue line. So that's what we're going to do. Our intent is to improve upon those numbers. And as we work our way through the process and as we have more to report we'll make sure we do so. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Frank. And just a comment on the reasons why we transfer those business to Upjohn. Both of these businesses, first of all, they fit more under Upjohn in terms of the dynamics that they have. So they can be managed much better. And secondly, I think they fit very nicely with Mylan. Because one it is the EpiPen predominantly business that Mylan is - but right now is set between the Mylan. We are providing for them. And the second it is the partnership that we have with Mylan that was established years back and with generics in Japan. So both of them fit much better in . And that's the reason why we separated. And also that will allow you to have in case that this happened a much more cleaner view of growth trajectory of the company. Because now you know exactly what would be the P&L of the remaining company. Chuck Triano : Thank you. Next question, please operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Louise Chen from Cantor. Louise Chen : Hi, thanks for taking my questions here. So I had a few. My first question is a 6%, approximately 6% five years sales CAGR for standalone Pfizer, the new Pfizer still hold? Second question I had is how much of a priority is M&A for you under the new Pfizer? And what kind of size of deals or types of deals are you most interested in? And last question I have is on the PCV data set that's coming through. You and a competitor also have a whole set of PCV data. I'm just curious how you see that landscape evolving over time. Thank you. Albert Bourla : Yeah, thank you very, very much, Louise. Let me start with a 6% CAGR. If it still holds up, some of them still holds. So it's actually as you can see if anything else, this business was projecting five years. All the words 25 actually CAGR also 6%. This year performed 8%, 9% for the quarter and we are projecting 8% for 2020. So definitely we are on good - let's say the way to achieve that. As regards the M&A. Yes, the M&A is a very important part of our strategy. And as I just alluded before, this is why also we are not diluting our firepower with stock purchase right now. Because we do believe that we can create significant value with the right strategic moves. Now, we never say never to anything, but strategically we've have made very clear that we are not interesting for a big M&A that will have cost synergies as value driver. Because first of all that will be like diluted in our top line growth. I don't think there are many companies that they can have this type of growth trajectory that we have the next few years. Secondly it could be destructive. Because having a big M&A means that the thousands of people will have to work on integrations rather than supporting all these products that we just saw that they're growing 20s and 30s. And also all this pipeline that is coming up. So this - we never say never but this is not our strategy. Our strategy for M&A it is to be able to have Phase 2, Phase 3 programs priority Phase 2 Phase 3, which could be become potential medicines in the period '25, '26, '27, '28 so that we can augment our internal pipeline and be able to maintain the 6% growth for the long term, actually, for the very, very long term because it's right now five years I would say it's so long term. And the other thing that I want to emphasize is that the 6% CAGR, it is risk adjusted. I repeat, it is a risk adjusted. That means that in our projections, we are adjusting all the non-read studies right now appropriate. Now, if all the Phase 3 goals and the right way and they are all successful, it's not going to be 6%, it is going to be double this will be 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%. Now, if everything fails, also will not be 6% will be very low. But if statistics works and the studies, let's say at 50% more or less are successful. That means that we will achieve 6%. That's why I want to emphasize that there is no binary event in our projections. Binary event would be if that 6% was dependent or two or three major regards that if they could go one way or another could affect. Right now they are dependent on 15, 16, 17 blockbusters. And then many other but they're much small. So then Frank may be something to add to that before I asked Mikael to comment on PCV data. Frank D'Amelio: Louise the only thing I wanted to add just to punctuate everything Albert said is and why are we focusing on Phase 2b, Phase 3 is because the Eloise really start to kick in in 2027. So if you think about it, we're in January of 2020, we literally have eight years to work our way through this problem. And by the way, given that kind of a timeframe, given the breath and strength of our pipeline, given our balance sheet, our capacity, obviously we feel confident we will be able to solve. Albert Bourla : Mikael. Mikael Dolsten : Yeah. I'm pleased that you asked about our pluma next generation. So as you know, we have adult and pediatric studies ongoing. The adult study has been given breakthrough designation in 2018 September based on our incarnating Phase 2 data, and we expect very soon to report Phase 3 outcome of the adult piece of the 20 trial. And obviously we are optimistic about that outcome based on the Phase 2 and the breakthrough designation. On the pediatric we have now accumulated further past for those data of the PCV 20 Phase 2 study. These data from the first does further substantiate the positive data reported in the press release of to those adults. And we expect initiation of Phase 2 Phase 3 soon for the infant vaccine, pending discussions with regulators. The full data set will be presented at the major vaccine related conference likely mid of this year. Now, Albert commented also in his introduction very nicely on the improved relative coverage of the PCV 20 from us versus a potential competitor . And he mentioned 33% better coverage for adults and 42% better coverage in the US for infants. Obviously, very important, significant, better coverage. I just want you to punctuate when you look in the top European market, similar that improved coverage in adults is actually 60% to 100%; in infants 80% to 200%. This is all for invasive pneumococcal disease. Also in US We have analyzed for community acquired pneumonia, where we see substantial better coverage for the 20 versus a potential 50 inhibitor. So all in all you can see, we look forward to data sets advancing the program and think it would be the premier 20 valence and premier pneumococcal vaccine for patients. Thank you. Chuck Triano : Next question, please. Operator? Operator : The next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen. Steve Scala : Thank you. I have a few questions. An increase in the dividend was mentioned twice. But it sounds as though Upjohn will be spun not split, in which case the dividend will be reduced. So I'm wondering if you could clarify the dividend comment. And I assume the 2020 EPS guidance implies a spin not a split. Secondly, on the ever abrocitinib versus Dupixent study, given the fact that it is completed, Mikael, I'm wondering if the data met the very positive portrayal you provided on the Q3 call, which included superior it's released to Dupixent. And then lastly, will the proof of concept DMD data be presented at the March 31 meeting? Thank you very much. Albert Bourla : Now, thank you very much Steve very good question. So, Frank, why don't you clarify once more the dividend? Frank D'Amelio: Sure. So Steve, in terms of the guidance, you're right, it assumes a spin, not a split. And then in terms of the dividend, you said, I think you said in your question, it'd be a reduction. I don't see it that way. What we've said is the sum of  dividend and our dividend would equal the current dividend that a Pfizer should receive today. So I don't see a reduction in the dividend. The dividend income will be kept hold. I think we've been very clear about that all along? Albert Bourla : And we will continue growing? Maybe not at the same pace which we do right now it's $0.02 per quarter but we continue growing. Frank D'Amelio: And Steve, I can quickly run the numbers for you if you'd like. Just so you think what  has said is their first full year of about $4 billion of free cash flow, they pay about 25% of that in the dividend. So that's a billion. Total  will have about 1.2 billion shares, you put the 1 billion over 1.2 billion shares, it's about $0.8. The exchange ratio is 1.2 billion. You put 100 shares of Pfizer you get 12 shares of  assuming a spin. That's roughly $10 a share. We would reduce our dividend on an annual basis by that $10 but the sum of our dividend plus that $10 and - that $0.10 I'm sorry - thank you. Would equal what the Pfizer you all gets today. In my thing, it's $10. $10 - not 10 cents. Albert Bourla : Abrocitinib? Mikael Dolsten : Yeah. So, thank you for your interest in abrocitinib. And, we believe that it's going to be a new drug class for such a prevalent disease that affects 10s of millions of Americans atopic dermatitis. And where an oral alternative seems to be a real patient and physician preference. We will soon report out the data from the important compared study. So I haven't actually seen the data. So I can only punctuate a little bit what we discussed at earlier investor meetings that the historical comparison between abrocitinib and Dupixent suggests that we should expect to see a similar or better impact and clear in skin. And particularly as Albert alluded to in his introduction, there is an important key secondary endpoint, looking at each itch relief starting with a readout already of two weeks and then following the study through the 12 to 16 weeks. And, historical data suggests that we should be very optimistic about abrocitinib outperforming biological, such as Dupixent on itch relief at earlier time points and provide the potential benefit of early onset of relief for disease. Now, we have to wait for the data to be able to, obviously be absolutely confident in that outcome. But this is what I believe and look forward very much to see the data come shortly. Albert Bourla : And on the DMD question? Mikael Dolsten : Yeah, we are finalizing I think the program for the R&D date. So I can't be absolutely promise you, but I think it's likely that such an interesting program as the DMD gene therapy will be one of the potential agenda items. And obviously, we would like to then share updates from increased number of patients over a longer time period. So please welcome and take a front row seat. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much to both. And by the way, Frank as always was right. It's $10 for 12 shares for Mylan. Chuck Triano : All right. So we'll move on to our next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Geoff Meacham : Good morning, guys. Thanks so much for the question. Just have a couple, Mikael, on gene therapy platform with the advancement of hemophilia A and B, as well as DMD into Phase 3. What's the capacity to add additional indications to the portfolio? I mean, you guys have been successful partnering, but at this point, it does seem like you could expand the platform organically in a material way. And then for Angela on Xtandi, I just wanted to get your perspective on the inroads you've made in M0 prostate patients. And what you think could represent a tipping point commercially, especially given that generic XYTIGA available in the U.S.? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : Yes. So Geoff, we are enthusiasts for the gene therapy platform. And what is particularly I think, a strategic advantage for us is the end to end capability from discovery, clinical manufacturing. And of course, that capability also linked to important external partners. That gives us capacity to advance increasing number of internal as well as partner programs. And we have an option for the Wilson disease program that, could in a relatively near term future be available for clinical studies. And we expect from internal and external initiative to aspire to about bringing one new gene therapy into the clinic every year or so for the next period to come. And we think that should build up a very comprehensive gene therapy portfolio. There's the three programs you alluded to of course, the frontier for us, with Factor 9 that we hope to be the first company bringing that over the finish line in Phase 3 now and to start the additional two Phase 3s for we may what we think we have a best-in-class profile so far. And then we already spoke about DMD. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much. Angela. Angela Hwang : Sure. So in terms of the M0 the non-metastatic CRPC, I mean, what we're seeing here is, just tremendous growth and tremendous performance. Just broadly speaking, in terms of Xtandi we had a great quarter. We grew 29% and this was driven by two things. One was actually a demand across both metastatic as well as non-metastatic, but also what we saw was the continued expansion of the actual class, the novel hormone therapies, and in this class, Xtandi has the lion's share. We have about 35% share right now. So first of all to answer your question, vis-\u00e0-vis generic XYTIGA, we really don't see a competition from a generic versus brand in this instance. I think the competition XYTIGA is really amongst generics XYTIGA versus branded XYTIGA whereas what we're seeing here is a clear uptick in Xtandi and specifically from the prosper trial in this M0 population, as you say, we are continuing to see it, as I've talked about in all the previous quarters, really, really significant and very confident uptake in urology prescribing. And we do believe that this is underpinnings the growth of our non-metastatic population, and the fact that these are patients also earlier in their disease is helpful in driving our growth in this population. I'll also mention that just from a market share perspective, though the non-metastatic the M0 population has Xtandi or leader as well as new Becca . Xtandi by far in a way has the leading market share in this segment and has been from the time that it was launched. Chuck Triano : Right. Thank you, Angela. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Tim Anderson : Thank you, a couple of questions. One is on Prevnar in China. So sales have been ramping up there. But the regulatory authorities recently approved a domestically produced 13-valent product. And the CEO of that companies who just have capacity that's on the 10s of millions of doses and who knows if that's true or not. But I'm wondering if you can give some perspective on how you see competitive dynamics in a situation like this going forward, not only in China, where our domestic producer could potentially benefit from favoritism, but also if that company were to take their product into other markets outside of China at a different price point. I think a lot of investors assume vaccines are durable forever. But I'm wondering if this sort of thing could be disruptive and how you take the sort of potential competition into your forecast. Second question is on M&A. So any M&A that you may engage with in 2020? Should we assume at least during this first six month window, while you still have Upjohn that is probably put on hold? And the last question on Vyndaqel, might there be a low hanging fruit phenomenon where we see an initial nice uptake, but then it kind of flattens out suddenly or do you expect this will be continued strong linear growth? Albert Bourla : Thank you very much. I will give a quick answer to your M&A question Tim and then Angela can deal with revenue time and that growth. Well, I mean, I know the answer is no, absolutely not. We are very actively looking to invest capital on value creation opportunities. And I assume that we will have several of them in the first half of 2020 before the close of the deal. Again, across the lines that I have described, exactly what we're doing, we want to make sure that we sustain the growth beyond 2027 when the  will have some impact. Angela, what about the Prevnar China? Angela Hwang : Sure. So, we acknowledge that there is a new competitor in the form of  in the PCV13. However, I want to recognize that there are some differences here, though it is a 13-valent vaccine. Low vaccine, vaccine is made with a different conjugate and this conjugate technology being an older technology, so quite different from what we see in PCV13. That being said, it is a competitor. However, if you sort of step back and look at the opportunity that we have in pneumococcal vaccinations there are approximately $14 million new births every year in China. And today, only over maybe 1% of those infants are being vaccinated. So regardless of the volumes that  might have available, I think the opportunity between us is just much larger than that. And we have a tremendous amount of untapped potential in the marketplace. And we are confident that with the quality, the reliability, as well as the tremendous experience that Pfizer has had globally with PCV 13 but also the tremendous success that we've had in China specifically for PCV 13 that our growth will continue and this is what we expect. We have a very robust footprint. You know - as you know, the vaccines and it will be the same for  PCV 13. This is an out of pocket market and it will be the same for the both of us. So this is where we'll be competing, which is why having a robust promotional engine and having a footprint of representatives that can really be available to support patients and caregivers at the points of vaccinations is really important. And I think in this regard, we have demonstrated great expertise and ability to grow this market. So that's how we see it we acknowledge the competition, but we can continue to see tremendous potential. Albert Bourla : What about Vyndaqel? Angela Hwang : Alright. So in terms of Vyndaqel, yes, of course, in the year of launch, one might expect to see a little bit of a bolus, a number of patients who have been identified and are awaiting diagnosis and treatment. That being said, we are confident of what we've learned in the marketplace in our first year of launch. We are confident that, we have the right set of tools for helping physicians to suspect the patients that might have ATTR CM. We have mobilized education around using noninvasive methods like scintigraphy to diagnose patients. And we've also mobilized a patient support hub to help patients receive their medications. So I think doing more of that, as well as continuing to think about new methods to help diagnose and treat patients such as using artificial intelligence and increased number of tools. All of that will continue to support our ability to drive the important and rapid diagnosis of patients as well as their treatment. Chuck Triano : Right. Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi. Andrew Baum : Thank you. Couple of questions, please. Firstly On your pending oncology vaccines rollouts in the US, given the challenges, it starts with vascular penetration. Could you talk to your expectations, particularly with these two drugs, there should be an economic incentive for payers given the posture. But yet there's issues in patients who already own an established inhibitor biosimilar to switch - an inhibitor brand to switch to biosimilar. So if you could give some kind of senses, how much penetration and how quickly, you make specs that would be super helpful. And then second, in terms of tafamidis, Angela, you kindly gave some penetration figures at the beginning, which I was struggling to keep up with and write down but just more broadly, could you outline how large you think the untapped patient population really is here, and how far Pfizer is along in establishing that market? Many thanks. Albert Bourla : Angela, lot of questions for you today. Please go ahead. Angela Hwang : Okay. Sure. All right. So I think firstly we see the dynamics in oncology biosimilars being very different from that of what we saw in for inflammation in the form of Inflectra. So to your point about how will the dynamics change here and how quickly can payers as well as providers capture their savings, it's going to be much quicker. This is the use of oncology biosimilars are much more rapid, like you see more patients cycling through treatment times are much shorter. So that's going to enable payers and providers to capture savings much more quickly, which is a very different dynamic that you see in Inflectra where it's a chronic treatment and patients are on their treatment for a very long time. So I think that's one big difference. The second is that there is already a some - we already have some precedents. We saw this with eradicate where after a year of being in the market, though I know it's a supportive care in oncology, we already have 20% market share. This is still far cry from what we see in Europe where there is much more rapid uptake that I think that it's a signal indicator of the difference you see in the various biosimilar markets. And we also have some early signals from competitor biosimilar that have already and some good market share in oncology biosimilars. So I think that we have some good indicator that this is going to be different. I think the benefit that we see here is that we have a portfolio of three oncology biosimilars all coming out around the similar time, like around now. And I think what we have, we have a robust pricing strategy discount to the lack of the originator as well as I think strong relationships and networks built with both providers and payers that give us confidence that this will be an area of high growth for Pfizer. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Angela. Albert Bourla : And then your question was around tafamidis. Sorry can you just repeat that again? Andrew Baum : The untapped population? Angela Hwang : Got you. So as we've said in previous calls, we do believe that this is a rare disease and that in the U.S there will be about a 100,000 patients in total, globally, 500 but in the US a 100. To date we have diagnosed 9,000 patients so that lead us to 9% of the population that we have diagnosed. So while this may feel like very significant progress on the time that we have launched and it is I think you can also see that we have a long, long way to go to finding all one and 100,000 of these patients. And what I spoke early about in terms of the education, in terms of how we suspect the disease, how you diagnose the disease and then very quickly gaining access of our patients and benefit from treatment of the disease these are all three levers that we are intensely focused on. Chuck Triano : Great. Thank you, next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Navin Jacob from UBS. Navin Jacob : Hello. Thanks for taking my questions, couple if I may. Just on biosimilars following up with Angela, your comment about strong growth continuing on for the biosimilar. So wondering if you could give any color around how we should think about the trajectory over the next couple of years. Is this a doubling or tripling of that now almost billion dollar business? And also would love to understand how you're thinking about the tale of each of the individual asset. Are you seeing - should we be thinking of this as a ramp that goes up for a few years and then eventually starts tailing off like others generics or do you see the stabilizing and having a sustainable tail? And then just on Vyndaqel, you received positive CHP opinion in the EU in December. Given that Vyndaqel is already approved in the polyneuropathy indication wondering how we should be thinking about the price with the addition of the cardiomyopathy indication, is there any chance for moving that around? And then how we think about the ramp in the EU relative to the US? Thank you so much. Angela Hwang : Sure. I will start with the last one first. So you're right we just received EU approval for Vyndaqel. And as you know there is a time lag between approval and then reimbursement in each of the countries. So all I can say is right now we are in active negotiations with the countries in terms of determining the price of Vyndaqel as well as its reimbursement. You referred to the fact that we already have the 20 milligram approval polyneuropathy in Europe and we recognized that. That being said we have first of all, ATTR CM is a completely different indication, the trials that were conducted as well as the significant mortality benefits that would be demonstrated in our clinical trials, at ATTR CM are completely different. And we have the clinical data to demonstrate the great patient benefit that we have in ATTRCM. And so that's the basis about discussions with each of the countries in Europe for reimbursement. Your second question was around Vyndaqel growth and sort of the pace of it. I think the way to think about it is the following. We have through analogues seen that only 30% to 50% of all rare diseases are ever diagnosed. But of course, we believe that based on the mortality data that we have and the patient benefit that can be derived, that it is critical that we beat that or at least meet that. And so that's what we're intensely focused on. We have 10% of our patients with 9% in the U.S. diagnosed today, we have a long way to go. And that's what we need to do. Your last question\u2026? Navin Jacob : What's the rhythm on the biosimilars? You know, we've had strong growth 22% this year for the year, what can we expect going forward? Angela Hwang : That's right. So I think in terms of the biosimilars again, this is an area of growth that we can anticipate. We have three biosimilars now in oncology plus the two that we had in supportive care. And so we look forward to this being a significant growth contributor to oncology portfolio not just from a growth percentage perspective but also from a revenue based perspective. Mikael Dolsten : Yeah. I just wanted to add that Vyndaqel cardiomyopathy has a positive EU recommendation. So we expect the approval to come soon. And that links very nicely to the really helpful outline you did Angela. Angela Hwang : Thanks Mikael. Chuck Triano : And if we could take our last question, please, operator. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Mani Foroohar from SVB Leerink Mani Foroohar : Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. A couple little ones on the rare disease side; in terms of tafamidis we saw pretty attractive growth OUS. including some markets that don't necessarily have the cardiomyopathy indication yet. Is that some follow-on benefit in polyneuropathy from the increased promotional efforts in cardiomyopathy in Europe and elsewhere? As a second question, given the expansion of patient opportunity in the polyneuropathy in the US, how do you think about the opportunity to pursue a supplemental NDA or similar strategy in the US, based on the real world evidence guidelines laid out previously by the FDA or would that require a separate study? And then finally, on the gene therapy side, obviously pretty interesting data hemophilia at ASH moving forward in a couple Phase 3s now, how do you think about that market in a universe where you have multiple therapies within curative intent in gene therapy, alongside a number of fairly robust chronic therapies? Who are the patients who should receive an irreversible intervention in terms of gene therapy? And who do you think deserve more appropriate for chronic therapy such as your own benefits? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Yeah, I think I will ask Mikael to start with gene therapy and then I shall go with this great polyneuropathy that we have and how they fit together, Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : Yeah, thank you very much. What I think is unique in our hemophilia portfolio. First, of course, we have a legacy being one of the pioneers for intervenes deliver of Factor VIII and Factor IX so we have a platform and experience on the business in R&D side. And as you so nicely alluded to, we also shared with our partners Sangamo some very much best-in-class data recently on the Factor VIII gene therapy. Our current portfolio has Factor VIII and Factor IX gene therapy plus our TFPI antibody that has like  an opportunity to provide a substitute alternative, but actually TFPI can be applicable for both Factor VIII and Factor IX deficiency. So the way we see it develop is that, I think physicians will look at gene therapies that have durability and good tolerability. And that has really been the hallmark for the strategies when we developed Factor VIII and Factor IX best-in-class profile, because there are alternatives for these patients. So once they see the data for drugs, the treatments that are approved, that have durability, and really good outcomes, which I think has been so far what we have seen with our gene therapies those will be the one that can be adopted, because there are alternatives that have less convenience, but will, at least until strong data is available to be used. You know, for patients that are early in their disease diagnosed at earlier age, I think this would be a very important treatment as it saves them from the bleedings, breakthrough bleedings that appear on lifelong treatment with infuse spin factor. And particularly for patients that are at early age that are physically active it is important to have a solution for sure. So I think these would be tremendously important patient populations. But the availability of subcutaneous agents with supplement and also allow for patients that may have antibodies to the gene therapies to use them until sufficient number of gene therapies available that there is always one for each patient. And finally, let's bring it together. I think what's unique with us is the entire portfolio that can address these patients and we look really much forward to the year around 2021 and '22 when we see this portfolio coming into registration phase. I think that was the main piece here. Albert Bourla : Yeah. And then Angela may be on Vyndaqel have seen some uptick in markets, that cardiomyopathy was not approved. What's going on there? And about supplement and filing on polyneuropathy? Angela Hwang : Yeah. In terms of polyneuropathy in the U.S., this is something that we're continuing to explore with the FDA. So, - Albert Bourla : This isn't going be made yet. But we're in discussions. Angela Hwang : That's right, exactly. And then, in terms of the upticks in polyneuropathy, I mean I'm not sure that it's a cardiomyopathy effect. As you know, we are improved. It's an approved indication for us, ex-U.S. So we continue to actively promote it. And it's probably as a result of those activities. Albert Bourla : Yeah, we will have as we said approval for indication. And this is what I would think we will see material impact on Vyndaqel in cardiomyopathy in these patients we are not right now, we are just promoting of course the indications but we have registered over there, so we don't do anything outside that. Albert Bourla : All right, I think this concludes more or less our call. Just I wanted to make some comments because really, I feel that an exciting point in Pfizer's history. And if you take a big picture view, over the last decade we have changed and refocused our approach to R&D, we have improved dramatically its productivity. And we have developed the best pipeline we ever had. And one of the best I believe in the industry. If you've seen 2019, it was a year, but we took deliberate and thoughtful steps to strengthen each one of our businesses and eventually spread the current Pfizer into a new smaller, high growth profile enterprise that will remain powerhouse in marketing but also has been converted to the powerhouse of science. Following the expected close of the Upjohn and Mylan transaction later this year, of course we will be a very different company. And we will focus on continuing to execute our strategy. This includes, we will continue the commercial momentum and preparing our new product launches. You have all asked a lot of questions about those products that are keeping surprising with our growth profile. And also, you've seen what we are taking seriously and we are investing in new launches. We are continue advancing our internal pipeline, and will augment it with mid stages R&D programs through targeted bolt on business development opportunities. As I referenced before, we should continue seeing these type of activities in the first and second half of this year. Of course, we are working very intensively to set up Upjohn to be in a strong position when it combines with Mylan to become Viatris and create a formidable company. And of course, we will continue leading the conversation in Washington. As we walk to address the affordability challenge facing patients. These are the areas that we are focusing for next year. Once again, we look forward to sharing more pipeline updates during our Investor Day on March 31. Have a great rest of your day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude Pfizer's fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to Pfizer\u2019s First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Chuck Triano : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today to review Pfizer's first quarter 2020 financial results, our reaffirmed full year 2020 financial guidance, Pfizer's role in helping find solutions for the COVID-19 pandemic as well as other relevant business topics. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. During my remarks, I will discuss the first quarter business performance as well as recent milestones from our pipeline. However, I want to start with a few thoughts about the COVID-19 pandemic and Pfizer's role in helping find solution. It goes without saying that this is an extraordinarily, difficult and unprecedented time for everyone. The public health challenges posed by COVID-19 have impacted almost every aspect of our lives. As one of the world's largest biopharmaceuticals companies, our role in this crisis is dual. On the one hand, we are focused on maintaining the continuous supply of our medicines and vaccines to patients around the globe, while protecting the safety and wellbeing of all our colleagues of course. On the other hand, we are working with experts, both within and outside Pfizer to bring our expertise, capital and resources to help contribute potential medical solutions to this pandemic. Let me share a few examples of what we are doing on this front. With the burden on hospitals happening around the globe and expected to increase, the continued supply of our medicines and vaccines is now more critical than ever. I'm pleased to say that the Pfizer global supply team has done an outstanding job, keeping our manufacturing sites and related distribution channels operational, without significant supply disruptions. In terms of finding medical solutions for the pandemic, we are collaborating with industry partners and academic institutions to develop potential novel approaches to prevent and treat COVID-19. We aim to leave no stone unturned and we have made advances on multiple fronts. Regarding prevention, we recently announced that Pfizer and the German biotech company, BioNTech have entered into a global collaboration agreement to co-develop the potential first-in-class mRNA-based coronavirus vaccine program aimed at preventing COVID-19 infection. Last week, we received the regulatory approval from German authority Paul-Ehrlich-Institut to commence the first clinical trial for our COVID-19 vaccine candidates in Germany and the first patient has already been dosed. Frank D\u2019Amelio: Thanks, Albert. Good day, everyone. Before I walk you through our results for the quarter, I want to comment on the current global pandemic, which is impacting nearly every industry around the world. Despite the challenges inherent in operating in this environment, the fundamentals of our business continue to be strong and our outlook for the future of the Company remains bright. We continue to have a strong balance sheet and favorable credit rating, which we expect to allow us to access the capital markets as needed, which was demonstrated in late March with the issuance of a $1.25 billion sustainability bond, the first of its kind in our industry. On the supply side, all 49 of our manufacturing facilities remain operational, and we have not seen a significant disruption in our supply chain as a result of the pandemic. To ensure the safety of our manufacturing colleagues while they perform this critical work, we have put in place enhanced safety measures at all of our plants, including investing in protective equipment, staggering shifts so that fewer colleagues are present at once, restricting site access to only essential workers and requiring colleagues to log their contacts while on site. I want to acknowledge how proud I am of the way our colleagues, many of whom are on the frontlines in this fight, have responded to this crisis with courage and passion from those who are working around the clock on potential treatments or vaccines for COVID-19 to those who continue to operate on manufacturing and supply chain to ensure patients can have the medicines they need. This is in times like these that the strength of our culture and of our people really shines. Now, onto the financials. First quarter 2020 revenues were $12 billion, down 7% operationally versus the year ago quarter. Of course, most of this decline is due to the fact that we no longer report revenues for our consumer healthcare business. Excluding this impact, revenues were down 1% operationally. As Albert already explained in detail, our biopharma revenues grew 12% operationally this quarter, driven by strength across multiple products with approximately 1 percentage point of that growth attributable to the net impact of COVID-19 on product sales. Upjohn revenues declined 37% operationally, driven by generic competition for Lyrica in the U.S. and declining sales of Lipitor and Norvasc in China due to implementation and nationwide expansion of the volume-based procurement program. Importantly, both of these negative drivers were anticipated in our previous Upjohn guidance. For total Company, adjusted SI&A expenses in the quarter were down 16% operationally, approximately half of that decline was due to the fact that we no longer report expenses for the consumer healthcare business. The remainder of the decrease was driven by reductions in field force, advertising and promotional expenses, due to the LOE of Lyrica in the U.S. and lowest selling expenses for Lipitor and Norvasc in China, due to volume based procurement, as well as lower indirect SI&A spending associated with corporate-enabling functions. Both reported and adjusted diluted EPS for the first quarter were down compared to the year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower revenues, mainly driven by the loss of exclusivity for Lyrica in the U.S., partially offset by lower SI&A expenses. Finally, foreign exchange had a negative impact of $134 million or 1% on first quarter 2020 revenues and $0.02 negative impact on adjusted diluted EPS compared to the year-ago quarter. Before walking you through our guidance updates in detail, I want to acknowledge that no one currently knows exactly how and in what timeframe the COVID-19 pandemic will progress and eventually come to its resolution. Given those uncertainties along with our desire to be as transparent as possible, we are providing on this chart the key COVID-19 related assumptions that are reflected in today's guidance update. In summary, our financial guidance reflects our expectation that most healthcare systems around the world will begin to resume their normal functions in the second half of 2020, including in-person doctor visits, new-to-brand prescription trends, sales force activities and clinical trial enrollment. The guidance also assumes we will be able to continue to operate our manufacturing and supply chain without material disruption, and that we will continue to invest in potential treatments and vaccines against COVID-19 throughout 2020. With that, let's take a look at our guidance. Consistent with last quarter, we are providing three sets of financial guidance. As a reminder, those three steps of guidance are as follows : Total Company, which reflects our current construct of the biopharma and Upjohn businesses and excludes any impact from the pending Upjohn combination with Mylan; Two, New Pfizer, which is a full year pro forma view that reflects the impact of the pending Viatris transaction by removing Upjohn and including $12 billion in cash proceeds from up Upjohn to New Pfizer and other transaction-related factors, such as transitional service agreement revenue; and three, Upjohn as a standalone business. Let me remind you that the Upjohn guidance includes the Meridian business and our collaboration with Mylan in Japan, as we discussed last quarter. All of these scenarios continue to be based on a full year of revenues and expenses in 2020. Beginning with total Company, as Albert mentioned, we are reaffirming our guidance ranges for both revenue and adjusted diluted EPS, despite absorbing incremental negative impacts due to foreign exchange fluctuations, since mid-January of approximately $600 million on revenue and $0.04 on adjusted diluted EPS. Moving down the income statement, we lowered our cost of sales as a percentage of revenue guidance range by 0.4 percentage points to reflect favorability, resulting from changes in product mix and other efficiencies. For selling information and administrative expenses, we are lowering our guidance range by $500 million. This reflects incremental cost savings opportunities, primarily related to indirect SI&A spending, as well as actual and anticipated spending reductions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemics, and as Albert already spoke about the $500 million upward revision to our R&D expense range. Finally, our guidance continues to anticipate no share repurchases in 2020. Moving on to financial guidance for New Pfizer and Upjohn. Despite absorbing negative incremental impacts on revenues to the changes in foreign exchange rate since mid-January of approximately $500 million for New Pfizer and $100 million for Upjohn, we are reaffirming the fiscal year 2020 revenue guidance ranges for both pro forma companies. Additionally, we are reaffirming the guidance ranges for adjusted IBT margin and adjusted diluted EPS for New Pfizer, as well as adjusted EBITDA for Upjohn. The only change to the guidance we gave in New Pfizer is a $1 billion reduction in the range for operating cash flow, driven entirely by $1.25 billion voluntary U.S. pension contribution, which we plan to make in the second half of 2020. Moving on to key takeaways. In the first quarter of 2020, our Company performed well in a challenging environment, driven by strong revenue growth from our biopharma business. We reaffirmed our 2020 guidance for revenues and adjusted diluted EPS and we achieved multiple products and pipeline milestones since our last quarterly update, some of which are listed here, demonstrating the continued advancement of our late-stage pipeline. Finally, we paid $2.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders this quarter. As always, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2020 and beyond. Now, I'll turn it back to Chuck. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Frank, and thanks, Albert, for those comments. Operator, can we please now poll for questions? Operator :  Your first question comes from the line of David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. David Risinger : Yes. Thanks very much for the detailed review, and congratulations on the performance. So, I have two questions, please. First is with respect to the guidance and the second is on the vaccine candidate. So, with respect to the guidance and the assumptions on slide 13, could you just discuss what you're assuming with respect to a potential resurgence in COVID, during the start of the flu season and the fourth quarter, and the impact of that on healthcare systems and physician visits? And then second, with respect to your vaccine candidate with BioNTech, could you just discuss your level of conviction that you have the right candidate that will be safe and effective? And when do you expect to generate animal data, and when do you expect to generate initial human data? Thank you very much. Albert Bourla : Dave, thank you very much. Very good questions, as usual. The first one is guidance. Let me ask Frank to make comments about the assumptions. Frank D\u2019Amelio: Yes. So, David, on our guidance, we are assuming a recovery in the second half of the year. We expect the second quarter to be as reported as primarily impacted in a negative way from the COVID-19 virus, but we do expect the recovery in the second half of the year. And that includes the items that we talked about in our comments. In-person doctor visits sought up again, new-to-brand prescription trends, sales force activities, clinical trial enrollment, and obviously all of our sites continuing to operate and provide medicines to patients the way that they're currently doing today. So punch line, second half recovery and the healthcare system returns to normal operations. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Frank. And now, Mikael, I think, you would like to comment on the vaccine, before let me say just one thing on the vaccine. This is new technology. But we are very familiar with both the technology and the company, because we are working with them the last two years in a joint project to develop with the same technology, a flu vaccine. So, we jumped into the COVID-19 when the need emerged jointly together. And we are applying, of course all the learnings of the -- the learnings that we had with the technology during the last two years. Now, Mikael, can you speak -- please speak more specifics about the specific project? Mikael Dolsten : Thank you, Albert, and Dave for asking these important questions. I will start by saying, I think we have the most comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 vaccine program currently ongoing and it's specifically related to mRNA. As Albert alluded to, we had built a lot of experience on the various type of mRNA and formulation of lipid nanoparticles through two years work on flu and a lot of different animal data coming from our work and work from BioNTech on both oncology and other programs. When it comes to the specific Lightspeed program as it's called, that has basically in two to three months moved from the drawing table to dosing patients right now. It contains, as we have announced four different vaccine candidates that will be studied in humans. The first one already dosed. And that allows us more than anyone to cherry pick from a new disease like COVID-19, what   type, what antigen is the most effective and allows us to pick one or two to move into pivotal studies. So, that covers unmodified mRNA, modified and self-amplifying. To the best of my knowledge, we are the only one currently having self-amplified mRNA in the clinic, which would allow you to dose, at lower dose than any other construct. We already have animal data from rodents on the various constructs that are encouraging. And we also have data from patients here that shows that the two antigens that we pick seem to be the most relevant for intervening and utilizing viruses. And by having picked two, spike or the smaller components receptor binding domain again, I think we will be able to cherry pick what turns out to translate most effectively in man. So, more animal data will come over the next few weeks on primates. And I expect human data to come late May-June from the first experiments performed on plasma from vaccinated patience. And this is a unique trial design with continuous data flow that should allow us to progress fast, share data with regulators. So, we expect the flow of data coming May, June, and then move into expanded trials that could allow emergency use or accelerated approval coming in the fall, possibly October and onwards. So, thank you very much for your questions. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael. And also let me add here, but the reason also why we jumped into this is not only because we've had the familiarity with the company, with the technology, and we had discussed this project that was very exciting, but also we have -- we are uniquely positioned to help during this crisis, because we have the end to end capabilities. We are having very strong capabilities from early preclinical research, all the way to manufacturing. And frankly, as I -- we have, I think said, but I make it very clear now also, we are planning to manufacture at risk, this vaccine. So, if the technical success and regulatory approvals are there, we will have doses available in -- during the last quarter of this year. And also, it would be an omission if I wouldn't mention right now that how grateful we are with the advice and collaboration that FDA is giving us that they are trying to work their timelines day and night as well, so that they can help bring to the world, a solution. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Schott from JP Morgan. Chris Schott : Just two. First on Vyndaqel and the impact from COVID. It sounds like you're expecting a slowdown in diagnosis rates in the quarter. Should we also expect that RXs and patients receiving drug should also slow or could those actually keep ramping, once you've identified a product that can keep working through the process? My second question on Vyndaqel was also on payer mix. You've had a little bit more experience with the product. And we're still trying to get a sense of where gross to net could shake out for the product. So, any additional statistics here in terms of how many patients are getting free drug, how many are reimbursed? Any data there would be very helpful. My final question was on Prevnar in infants. Are your expectations for that product for the year unchanged, so that we're going to obviously see get 2Q impact, but you get kind of a catch up in the second half of the year, or should we actually be thinking about Prevnar infant expectations for the year coming down as that catch-up won't offset the lost sales in the quarter? Albert Bourla : I think, all three questions are very well suited for Angela to answer. So, Angela, why you don\u2019t start with Vyndaqel? Angela Hwang : Great. Thank you. Thanks for those questions, Chris. So, firstly, on Vyndaqel. As you can see, we continue to have just great momentum behind this product. And we do believe that this will sustain its moment throughout the year. As Albert mentioned, we do think that there will be some slowdown in NRXs in the second quarter. And actually just to align with those comments, we did see that in our patient hub enrollments since the middle of March, we saw a decline of about 20% in the last four weeks, compared to the previous four weeks. So, I think that this comment about new patient starts is one that we are seeing in the patient hub. However, let's also think about the great attributes of Vyndaqel. It's an oral medication; it's one that is being delivered through specialty pharmacies directly to patients\u2019 homes; it's one that because of its mortality benefits, decreases hospitalizations. All of these really play well to the time that we're in right now in this pandemic. And so, we anticipate our continuing patients to be able to continue on their drugs and be able to stay on therapy, so no impact on TRxs. Your second question was around the payer mix. And on that front, we have not seen change in terms of the numbers of patients on commercial versus Medicare versus other books of business. That has been pretty consistent through the time from launch, and our Medicare patients are the predominant part of our patient population, and that hasn't changed at all. And then, I think the third question was on Prevnar P. And on Prevnar P, similarly consistent with comments made earlier, we do anticipate second quarter to have some slowdown. And this is just because, well visits aren't taking place, there is a lot more caution regarding visits to pediatrician's offices. So, we do anticipate some slowdown there. But, we also know both from our research and from our representatives that pediatricians are anxious and are motivated to get the well visits back and to have our infants, as well as our children vaccinated. And therefore based on that and based on the fact that we expect a recovery in second half per Frank's comments about our assumptions, we do anticipate a catch-up towards the second half of the year that will allow us to attain our expectations that we had for P for all of 2020. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Umer Raffat : Mikael, on your antiviral for COVID, you\u2019re going down the protease inhibitor track, instead of the nuc. Maybe, if you could explain the thought process? And if you could also lay out for us the exact EC50 that you're seeing with your 3CL inhibitor? And I asked because some of the initial 3CL inhibitor constructs you had chosen against SARS, the EC50s were above 10. So, I wonder if you are seeing something closer to a one on the protease inhibitor you've chosen. And secondly, on COVID vaccine, Mikael, I'm curious, what's the exact threshold on utilizing antibody titers that you want to see for you to say, you know what, we have something? Albert Bourla : Thank you, Umer. Mikael, the stage is yours. Mikael Dolsten : Thank you very much, Umer. Great questions here. So, let's start with protease inhibitors. We had a privilege. This isn\u2019t just repurpose protease inhibitor from a distant relative. We had a collection of compounds that showed very potent activity to the SARS-CoV-1. And we were able to model and show that it's a very strong similarity in the binding and have confirmed that these compounds on the SARS-CoV-2 to COVID-19 disease are very potent. We are talking about very potent nanomolar type of binding. And it is supported by X-ray data available that shows again unique, highly selective binding patterns. We are now doing cellular antiviral studies, which initial data is encouraging again, showing potent activity, which needs to be studied on different cell types where the virus may be harbored. All together, we think these are very promising drug candidates. And we're moving swiftly ahead with scaling up, adding other IND type of data to potentially pending regulatory dialogues that have initiated to be able dose patients around August this year. We\u2019re also working on oral follow-on drug and have identified several candidates that show suitability for this type of delivery system. So, altogether, I feel very encouraged that this could be the first-in-class protease drug for SARS-CoV-2 and we'll keep you posted as we advance. On the vaccine, clearly, we are looking at what could be animal data guiding us on what should be the relevant threshold in order to have neutralization of virus. And we have in discussion with regulators gotten good feedback on data from multiple animal models that we are pursuing that could help to possibly even create a surrogate endpoint. We're also looking at convalescent serum from patients to understand, which of those that are used for treatment intervention guides us and will actually use those also in intervention models. So, while we expect in our Phase 2 study later summer, Q3 early to generate human data on our vaccine when it comes to impacts on events. These will be supplemented by multiple animal models and plasma levels of neutralizing antibodies used in transfusion therapies. So, all-in-all, a multi-pronged approach to nail down the type of levels we should aim for, and to keep with the most aspirational goal of getting a vaccine that can be considered for emergency use, accelerated approval around Q3 this year. Thank you very much. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael. And also to add with the antiviral as we did with the vaccines, we are producing at risk clinical material. So, in case we decide to go into summer and do clinical studies, as Michael said, we will be able to do it immediately. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two for me. The first is, given the current environment, I was just wondering if there are any changes to how you're approaching capital allocation here. Do you expect M&A and business development opportunities to increase? I think, you had talked on your fourth quarter call about potentially finalizing some deals in the first half of the year. So, just wondering if there's been any change on that front? And then, my second question is on your 20-valent pneumococcal disease program. We've now seen the top line data for the adult Phase 3 setting come out. Just wondering what outstanding questions are left here on that program, as you look ahead on the forward and securing the filing in the fourth quarter? Albert Bourla : Thank you very much. So, Frank, would you like to make some comments on the capital allocation? Frank D'Amelio: Sure. So, Terence, on capital allocation, our priorities remain the same, which are obviously dividends and we paid a $2.1 billion dividend to our shareholders this quarter, investing in the business, and then obviously M&A, so mergers and acquisitions. And clearly, there has been some value reset in the industry, and you can see some of that with some of the biotechs. And obviously, as we always do, we'll look for opportunities where we think it's a good deal for our company and for our shareholders. The one thing I want to balance this with though is, even though valuations reset, Board of Directors and management teams expectations don't necessarily reset at the same pace. So, that's always something we have to work our way through. But from a high level priority perspective, our capital allocation priorities remain the same. Terence Flynn : Thank you, Frank. And then, Mikael, is there anything that you're waiting more on, pneumococcal adult or you think you can file? Mikael Dolsten : We are very confident in the pneumococcal adult after completion of the main efficacy studies that we have done a press release, and it has the immunogenicity, safety and scalability that we were looking for. We also recently had a lot consistency study to readout, which again, showed similar grade profile for the 20-valence to be used in the adult setting. We are still having one study that is for patients previously immunized with pneumococcal vaccines that will be coming shortly. But for na\u00efve patients, we do have all data available, looking like a very strong profile and we are yet to supplement with the data sets coming on previously immunized, which, this would be to expand the coverage. And that's why we feel very confident about filing and you heard from Albert's introduction that we moved it to early Q4. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Randall Stanicky from RBC Capital Markets. Randall Stanicky : Just two questions, probably both for Angela. Can you just talk about the Ibrance trends, particularly EU5 price headwinds? When do those abate, and how should we think about Ibrance growth for this year? And then, just a follow-up on Vyndaqel, the 13% diagnosis rate, it's a nice jump from 4Q of 9%. Any change to where you guys think that can ultimately get to, putting aside near-term headwinds from COVID? Albert Bourla : Angela, go ahead. Angela Hwang : So, on Ibrance in the EU, I want to affirm that our fundamentals and our growth of Ibrance in the EU continues to be really strong. And we continue to see great growth opportunities into the future. Right now, the first line metastatic breast cancer share of the CDK class is only at 38. So, there's room for growth here. And we do have a strong leading market share of 68% of all CDKs. So, I think just right there, you can see that there are continued opportunities for growth. And that is how we see it. We saw very strong double-digit growth for Ibrance in volume. And what you didn't see and why that didn't translate into net sales is because we negotiated a number of very large contracts with certain large European countries. Many of these happened in Q4 of 2019. And because these contracts are multiyear, what you get here now is some stability in that. And so, this has allowed us to rebase our businesses. So, those impacts are already included in our guidance. And because of the timing of when these contracts are signed, we expect to return to net sales growth in the second half of 2020. So, all-in-all, I think it's just the timing and the year-on-year comparison that is driving the effect of what you're seeing from a net sales perspective. And I want to reaffirm that our fundamentals are strong, our value proposition of Ibrance is strong. And we continue to see tremendous growth opportunity both for the class, as well as our own share. Your next question was about Vyndaqel. And I think your question was around just sort of diagnosis and whether we're seeing anything particular there. And no, I mean, the strategy that we have deployed from the beginning, which is to find and heightened awareness around, which patients we should suspect for ATTR-CM and then have those patients be then diagnosed through scintigraphy, continues to be mainstay of how we are generating diagnosis. With time, we are deploying and we're experimenting with the artificial intelligence and different sort of predictive models that might allow us to again support the suspicion of these patients. But, I would say that our strategies have been rather consistent since launch. And I think that the diagnosis rates that we're seeing tell us that what we've been doing is working well. There's great receptivity for this product, both from physicians as well as from patients. We are very active on the education front, both from a diagnosis and from a treatment perspective. So, I think that what we've been doing is really working well and will continue to do so. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Tim Anderson : On your 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Just an update on timing for when we are likely to see the Phase 3 trial start in  to keep that gap with Merck as small as possible? And then, second question on adjuvant Ibrance, just an update on timing of when we will see the data? And when you do top-line that are you likely to disclose any results or is it just going to be a qualitative top-line? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Let me take quickly the adjuvant and then Mikael, please answer the 20-valent and add if you have anything on the adjuvant. We have not run any interim analysis yet on PALLAS study. And we expect, as we said before, the study will come to conclusion -- excuse me, will come to completion, which means that we will not stop expect during the interim because as I said very high criteria for study. So, typically, we do not announce when we have interim analysis data and visibility unless if we stop. So, as I said, we don't have data, we haven't performed an analysis yet. An analysis has not been performed. Typically we don't announce it and the study will come to completion as expected, early in 2021. So, Mikael, on the 20-valent, on the pace, when we can start the Phase 3 and then you have to add something on the PALLAS. Mikael Dolsten : Thank you very much Albert and Tim for the questions. We offered a press release of the three injections immunization  we later shared that the fourth dose further substantiates data. We have had extensive regulatory dialogues in the U.S. and elsewhere and shared all those data sets. So, we are planning to start the ped  PCV-20 very soon. We're talking likely about just a few weeks to be clear. So, that's our projected plans right now. And I think you said very well on the adjuvant Ibrance studies that we feel very optimistic and good about them and just waiting for them to report on the date that we have communicated. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Angela, do you want to add anything on the pediatric marketplace as we see it potentially playing out? Angela Hwang : As you said, we will launch tentatively after the Merck 15. However, we don't anticipate that the ACIP will make a preferential recommendation between the two. And therefore, we believe that PCV-13 will compete with 15 until the PCV-20 comes to market. And we are confident about PCV-13. It has tremendous experience with healthcare professionals. We have very strong account management developed with our customers through the years that we've been on the market and we also have a very reliable supply track record. And so, despite there may be gap in launches, we anticipate to be competing in the market and to continue to support the benefits of PCV-13 to infants. Operator : Your next question is from Louise Chen from Cantor. Louise Chen : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions here. So my first question for you is, do you have any update or more details on the go forward strategy for Pfizer, post the Upjohn separation as it pertains to M&A, pipeline assets, what you're thinking about there? And then, what in your DMD Phase 1b data gave you confidence to move into Phase 3 studies? Where are you with manufacturing? And what type of data do you think you'll report out at ASGCT? And then, my last question here is just back on PCV-20. Just curious if you think from the adult side that the ACIP recommendation would change at all if you were to get approved for PCV-20? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Let me maybe speak a little bit on this rather than M&A. And then, John also can add to that. And then, I will ask Mikael on the DMD, and then maybe Angela on the PCV-20 again, how ACIP will do the adults. On the go for strategy, our strategy is very clear and will remain the same. Of course, there is expected separation with Upjohn. Pfizer will become a top-line best-in-class growth story. And we are feeling more and more confident about it. We are strengthening our language around the 6%. Today, I said at least 6% will grow and that we expect that will continue. Now, the M&A is not a strategy. It is a tool to support the strategy. And that's why the M&A in the past were much more geared towards buying revenues or buying earnings growth by big mergers that could cut costs, because this is what we needed at that time. Right now moving forward, we are not in a need to buy EPS. Our EPS will grow organically as our revenues will grow organically. So, our M&A, although we never say never or anything in M&A. But right now, it is -- we will continue that. Our strategy is not to go to a big M&A for the following three reasons. One, it is that very few targets will provide -- will not dilute our growth, very few. Most of them will grow less than us. So, we'll have dilution. Secondly that targets, usually they want a significant premium. And those make me feel that most of the value is captured by the shareholders of the acquirer, like the one that is making the acquisition. And of course, those big acquisitions are creating some destruction which R&D could be an issue. So, these are the considerations. In terms of saying where are we going to invest our capital, if this is not our first priority for the reasons that I said. We are going to invest in early Phase 2, Phase 3 ready to start potential medicines that could be part of our pipeline, so that we will strengthen the pipeline that is coming post -- as products post \u201825, \u201826, \u201827, \u201828, so that we can sustain the growth that already we feel very confident we have organically or in the next five, six years. So, that's on our strategy and M&A. Now, DMD, Mikael, what makes you optimistic? Mikael Dolsten : Thank you very much. I mean, it's such a transformative area, treating these boys with Duchenne. So, we have now treated, as you will learn more at the conference, 11 patients, 8 of them at the high dose of 3 to the 14. And we continue to show -- see very consistent, based on efficacy, looking at the dystrophin expression, the distribution of the dystrophin. And as we have treated more patients and the early boys that were treated, we have now longer observation period, we can also see that durability seems to exceed 12 months when it comes to the , which makes us feeling very good that it could be a long durability for these boys. And we also have data coming out on muscle health, creatine kinase and more recently MRI that allow us again to add another level of confidence that we're changing the health of the muscles. And finally, for the motor function, where you use clinical scales, we have seen now across a number of treated boys a favorable data on their Northstar Index. And I want to point out that we're seeing it cross different ages because if you mainly monitor early boys for this, they do have some spontaneous improvements that could be difficult to differ from treatment induced. But we have also seen it on older boys, where you expect decline, but we have noted improvement instead. So, all-in-all, we feel that we have now accumulated a very robust data set on efficacy, and we have learned important experiences how to mitigate risk and manage any possible safety event. Of course, we have one of the largest efforts on new therapy manufacturing that has been expanding in North Carolina, and that will all come together now in our plan to start Phase 3 trials in just a few months. So, thank you for your interest. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael. Really, very exciting news for these boys particularly, they have virtually no solutions right now. Angela, what about our views on what would be the recommendations of ACIP on the adult pneumococcal vaccine, the 20 and competition? Angela Hwang : Yes. So, we're really excited about our PCV-20 programs, and specifically about the breadth that serotypes coverage that PCV20 provides. And we really see the benefits in two ways. One, first of all, these incremental serotypes are associated with high case fatality rates, antibiotic resistance and/or meningitis. So, these are sort of serious diseases that these serotypes will be able to cover. But also relative to PCV-15, PCV-20 is expected to provide 33% more coverage against IPD strains in adults.  So, with these data, our plan is to bring this forward to the CDC and to regulatory authorities. We will certainly be discussing recommendations and what all this means. But, I think in the end, we will know that this is a decision that the CDC needs to make. And we will be having these conversations with them as our program develops. But, certainly, we feel very strongly about the potential benefits and the additional coverage that PCV-20 can provide. And we'll keep you posted with what happens with the CDC. Albert Bourla : And John, you have to add any comments on our going forward strategy, given that you're managing this area very successfully right now and particularly on M&A targets or licensing targets that we have? John Young : Obviously, we don't talk about specific targets, as you all know. But, I think Albert sort of really hit on the sort of main points in our -- in his answer, which is we feel really good about the prospects for the continued growth of our core business. In terms of business development to strengthen that, our focus is absolutely on clinical stage assets. I think, Frank touched on this in his answer to capital allocation earlier on. But, we're really very focused on clinical stage assets that could complement our existing internal pipeline that we feel good about. So, we're going to be focused on areas including oncology where there could be interesting tuck-ins. We're going to be looking at rare disease. There's a lot of innovation taking place there. And I think we're uniquely placed, because of the capabilities and manufacturing and development that Mikael has touched on to add to our pipeline. And we continue to look across our other areas as well, select opportunities. So, we think there are opportunities out there. We continue to be very active in this space. But of course, we're always doing to make sure that we're disciplined how we deploy capital in a way that really optimizes value for our shareholders, but most importantly for our patients. So, I think between Albert's and Frank\u2019s answers, hopefully that gives you a flavor how we feel about a capital deployment and business development for our business strategy post separation of Upjohn. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much. I'm not sure if we answered also the question on DMD about manufacturing. And yes, we feel very good about manufacturing. Our investments are progressing very nicely. And we will be able to manufacture at scale from the DMD, provided that it is successful and runs. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen. Steve Scala : Thank you. I had a few questions. First on abrocitinib. I believe only the higher dose was better than Dupixent. But, there were safety issues at that dose. And it was not superior on itch. It seems the outlook is not all that positive. You obviously think differently. So, could you explain? Secondly, you spoke about the PALLAS trial. But to clarify, the PENELOPE-B neoadjuvant trial, did you say the readout is now Q1 of '21? We had thought it was likely to be top-line this year. And then, lastly, can you just quantify the Eliquis stocking in the quarter? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much. I will very quickly answer the PENELOPE -- no, the Penelope is expected to come in the second half of the year. The PALLAS is expected to come early next year. This is exactly as you had said it before. Mikael, why do you -- are you excited about abrocitinib? Mikael Dolsten : Yes. We are very excited about abrocitinib. And let me just punctuate a few things. In the JADE COMPARE study, we show that both, high and medium doses met coprimary endpoint and very effectively reducing eczema. We had a key a secondary endpoint of comparing itch to Dupixent standard of care. And this is one of the most patient-centric endpoints impacting quality of life, both day and nighttime. And the high dose statistically significantly showed better effect clinically meaningful than Dupixent, while the lower dose, the 100 milligram numerically was better, but didn't reach statistical significance. Overall, what we see is more rapid onset with our power abrocitinib than the biological Dupixent. And we see a more rapid onset numerically, whether you look at skin clearance or whether you see -- look at itch. And while there is some more infections, always with higher doses of JAK inhibitor, we think and I believe that the benefit versus the risk is still very favorable. These are mild to moderate cases, most attenuate and basically all attenuate if you discontinue treatment. And I wanted to finally emphasize that we have a very exciting additional trial that is not necessary for filing, but it's coming later this year that trial regimen that will study, if you start on the 200 milligram, which we know will clear skin, reduce itch much faster than standard of care. And then, you can switch maintenance to the 100-milligram, which likely had a lower level of any adverse events, including infection. So, that gives you potentially max flexibility to treat and clean up, itch in skin and go on a lower dose. But again, the benefit risk to me looks very favorable also for the higher dose. These infections are relatively rare or mild to moderate and can easily be managed and are quite common for patients treated by dermatologists. So, I feel very good about high dose being superior and the lower dose being somewhat similar to Dupixent, still having faster onset of action numerically and it's oral and very convenient to take. I hope that gave you a good sense why I feel encouraged to see these new treatment options for patients, moving to regulatory discussions, and hopefully soon available. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael. And Angela, what about the inventory levels? Can you explain, of Eliquis? Angela Hwang : Yes. In terms of this Eliquis impact, what we saw was an uptick in terms of inventory levels to prepare for the pandemic, and the impact was about in the mid single digits, in terms of worldwide revenue. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Baum from Citi. Andrew Baum : Thank you. I know that you've added a couple of very distinguished scientists to Board, also added a former FDA Commissioner, under your tenure Albert, as well as the Mylan transaction. Should we thing about this as an accelerated evolution of Pfizer in terms of trying to improve the ROI that has had historically on R&D? And if so, aside from the measures I outlined, perhaps you could highlight any other internal, either organizational or current enrichment that's going on that also points in that direction? And then second to Mike, Pfizer seems to have pivoted away from immuno-oncology, as many others have done, given the disappointments post-PD-1. If we do see the emergence of novel IO targets, such as  assets for the randomized Phase 2 trials, should I assume that Pfizer\u2019s willing to reengage back in that field? And I know I'm exaggerating in terms of binary, but it does seem that you have pivoted back towards to more molecules? Then finally, if you could comment on the anticipated treatment duration in the real-world setting for PALLAS, given the issues with adverse events as well as reimbursement friction for Medicare patients? Albert Bourla : Andrew, can you repeat the first part of your question, the ROI? Andrew Baum : Yes. So, I was basically saying that under your tenure, Albert, there's a notable addition of three individuals with high scientific calibers. So, obviously, the former FDA Commissioner, but also two very distinguished scientists as well as decomplexifying the organization by the Upjohn transaction. So, when I think about the evolution of the business on the Pfizer, it does seem there's a concerted attempt to try and shine more light or improve the ROI through some of these measures. So, I was asking, are there any other internal measures, talents enrichment inside the organization, or new R&D structures designed to improve R&D, either through accelerating programs, killing early the normal stuff, but if something changed in the profile of improving the ROI on R&D\u2026 Albert Bourla : Thank you very much. And the answer is absolutely yes. It\u2019s not by chance that right now in our Board we have five top scientists, four of them physicians, top scientists that they have unique expertise either in regulatory science, they have unique expertise in development, they have unique expertise in basic science, both in primary care in metabolic diseases and immunology. We have also through Susan Hockfield -- she was the pioneer of bringing together the genomic data with computation power. She was the first biologist and first woman to be any head of -- President of the MIT. And there's a very clear statement that Pfizer is different. Pfizer is a science-based company, and this is where the growth is coming. And we are adding those Board members to provide also more visibility, but also because they help us with their very high knowledge. Now, there is not one or two, there are multiple measures -- metrics that we are using to assess if indeed our R&D machine is a new machine and if we can count on it in this new strategy. And they are all pointing in this direction. I think, we've made very clear that the Pfizer of the past, because you ask a question how, if you can kill quickly and if you can let\u2019s say progress things that they really matter rather than move everything. Pfizer of the past had a success rate of Phase 2 studies of 15%. When I say, over the past, few years back, 15%, when the industry was a third. Today, Pfizer's success rate, it is close to 50%, and that's on a rolling four years assessment right now. And I'm sure, next year will be 50% or rolling 50%. And this is not the only one. In 2018, we were the Company that introduced most new molecular entities of anybody else, who would expect that from Pfizer. And we can go on and on.  John Young has a very detailed list of criteria. And he's managing the governing process. But, he is making sure that as we allocate capital, we allocate with R&D ROI in mind. And also I will add that the speed with which the Company is reacting, has nothing to do with the Company in the past. And by the way, this is very well indicated in the way that we were able to move better than any biotech in speed in developing machine or in the speed in developing an antiviral. And the reason why we have been able to accomplish this speed in addition to be cultural, it is also that we have break the company into 5 distinct business units plus 1 -- 6, excuse me 6 together with hospitals, business units, and that each one of these business units, for example, oncology vaccines or diseases, they operate like a biotech. They make decisions end to end from commercial to early R&D within this structure, like as I said, if they were a biotech company. And they are presenting their requests for finance and into -- the community that John Young is managing, so that we can allocate the capital. And last but not least, although Pfizer is laser focused on this an ROI of R&D as we are progressing, it was absolutely to avoid misunderstanding. It was absolutely none of -- it was absolutely not one of our criteria, when we jumped into the COVID-19 programs. The only criteria that we used as we jumped into the COVID-19 projects was, if we are -- we can have a solution, if we can make the difference, if we think that our technology is good one, so that you can bring a vaccine or an antiviral, because this is not times that ROI should prevail for COVID-19, it is times that the solutions will be found. So, with that, I hope I gave you some color on how Pfizer is changing and what is the meaning which is more than symbolic of appointing the new Board members. And I go to Mikael, to answer your second question. Mikael Dolsten : Thank you for that question. We think we need to be careful and not throw everything under the kitchen into immune-oncology. We try really to cherry pick the areas where we have learned after the initial positioning of PDXs,  one example is bifunctional antibodies. We have a dose escalation of a BCMA bifunctional that looks very encouraging which subcutaneous unique profile. We have follow-on PD-1 bifunctional with cytokines that can boost immune resistance. And we have oncolytic viruses. We were successful combining Inlyta with PDX, and we're building on that experience to now move from actually our Boulder units form Array, a small molecule this year that we think is an immune enhancer for cancer an XMR  inhibitor. So I hope you got that answer that we are cherry picking areas where we think we can break resistance to IO rather than serving everything on to these area. Operator : Your next question is from Vamil Divan from Mizuho Securities. Vamil Divan : Great. Thanks for taking my question. So, one, maybe following up on the abrocitinib question from before, Steve's question for Mikael. I think, I get the enthusiasm you have on the efficacy side and the convenience side. Because my question is just more on safety, now that you've seen the COMPARE data, maybe as you think about the filing. Just your level of confidence on the label being clean from some of the black box warnings we see for the current JAK and infection malignancies and obviously also BTEs. I think, in talking to dermatologists, it seems like it\u2019ll be critical for it to be -- to not have a black box in order to compete the product like Dupixent. So, maybe, just you can share your views there? And then, second also on the immunology pipeline. Your JAK-3 -- the 1600, just curious on timing on that. I think clinical trial says that the trial\u2019s expected to read on the Phase 2, Phase 3 expected in September of this year but it also says it\u2019s still recruiting patients. So, just trying to get a better sense of when we might see data for that product? I know it has breakthrough status. Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Vamil. Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : Yes. Abrocitinib, we have a large database. I feel very good about its profile. We have not seen any cardiovascular issues. And that's really what is worrying about safety. While we see as expected some viral skin infections, I consider a more of safety, tolerability and very mild and moderate, and can be well managed with standard experience in medical practice. I cannot speculate about black box. That's really for regulators. Our JAK-3 in alopecia has a very unique profile. The most selective of all JAKs that I've seen this far, we think readout will be probably, as we have predicted, mid-\u201821 and this is a pivotal study that could go quickly to filing. We do have end of this year a number of JAK inhibitor readouts in the Phase 2, like JAK-3 in vitiligo, we have oral too in psoriasis and topical in atopic dermatitis. So, we'll keep you busy with a flow of news. Operator : Your next question is from Navin Jacob from UBS. Navin Jacob : Thanks so much. Navin from UBS. Thanks for fitting me in. Mikael, I just wanted to just touch upon the commentary with regards to the regulators and allowing surrogate markers as SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Just want to dig into that a little bit more. What specifically will they be looking for that allows speedy approval? And then, I want to understand the manufacturing targets that you have by year-end, if approved? If approved, I just want to understand, is it -- I'm assuming it's going to be under a sort of extended access use basis for healthcare workers? And then, what do you need from regulators for a broad approval for the general public? Any kind of clarity around that would be helpful. Albert Bourla : Yes. I do not know how the regulators would like to regulate that. And I leave it to them. But, I can answer the question on the manufacturing. So, we expect that we will have in the last quarter of this year, millions of doses basically ready. And then, for \u201821, we could ramp up to hundreds of millions of doses available. Now, Mikael, maybe a little bit you can answer the question about the endpoints or the surrogate endpoints. Mikael Dolsten : There are, of course interest of both regulators and pharmas to see how we can learn maximally to allow potentially very important vaccine, quickly to deal with both medical and business crisis. We have had ample discussions with the highest level of regulatory leaders in both U.S. and Europe. So, in the surrogate side, there are two animal guiding principles, if you can show for life threatening diseases data. And we are pursuing mice/hamsters, as well as primate studies that are ongoing and will hopefully show to us what level of immune activity interferes with the virus. And we're also doing some, I think, really creative studies taking patient sera and testing them, how they can intervene in these models and trying to correlate convalescence, patient transfusions, and what levels protect the disease or, can halt the progression of disease in patients. So, I think this is a unique area where we will have human and animal data coming together in Q3 to possibly provide a surrogate. But, we are planning from our Phase 2 study of the vaccines to also have human event rates. So it's more of having a really comprehensive approach to bring confidence and accelerate the potential approval or emergency use of these. It's not relying on just one approach. It\u2019s multiple approaches that we bring it together in close dialogues with the highest level of regulators. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Carter Gould from Barclays. Carter Gould : Thanks for fitting me in. I guess, just one on sort of your view on the OUS pricing dynamics coming out of COVID. Just your expectations on the potential likelihood of incremental pricing pressure from government funded health care systems, given like the pressure on EU budgets and expectation we see, similar austerity measures like we saw last decade? Thank you. Albert Bourla : So, I think, it's very difficult to predict. And in any case, I think our assumptions, it is -- the pricing is not the growth driver. Pricing is -- volume is going to be our growth driver, even without COVID. But I think, if I had to speak on a high level on COVID right now, I think and not on the short-term, but on the long-term, as you are asking. I see two dynamics here. One is the one that you mentioned, which is likely governments will have, let's say, budgetary pressures and we know that that's typically an area that they try to go. So, that I think will be towards the negatives. But also we see that the value proposition of the pharmaceutical industry has been drastically reset in the minds of the people right now. Because of the pharmaceutical industry right now in the middle of this crisis represent the whole of the billions of people and the hundreds of millions of enterprises that will find a solution towards that. And I think that will work on the very positive side. So, it remains to be seen what will be the net-net of those two areas. But, I believe that in any case, it\u2019s not going to drive growth by pricing, it\u2019s going to be by volume. So, I guess this is the end of -- and thank you very much for all these questions, I really appreciate it. So, I think this is the end, Chuck. So, let me just thank you all for joining us today, for your continued interest and engagement within Pfizer. We are very happy to provide information and also are very happy to learn from you. As I said at the start, this is an extremely difficult time for everyone as such, it is both, a great privilege and a great responsibility for our colleagues to serve patients at this moment. We've had an opportunity to demonstrate the power of our science, and we'll do everything we can to do -- to be a part of the solution to this problem. And I want to close by acknowledging the healthcare workers on the frontlines whose heroic efforts have been an inspiration to all of us. Their courage, their dedication and expertise have saved countless lives right now and probably in the future even more. And on behalf of all Pfizer colleagues and their families, I say, thank you. So, have a great rest of your day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude Pfizer's first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Chuck Triano : Thank you, operator. Good morning and thanks for joining us today to review Pfizer's second quarter 2020 financial results, our updated 2020 financial guidance, Pfizer's progress in helping find solutions for the COVID-19 pandemic as well as other relevant business topics. I'm joined today as usual by our Chairman and CEO, Albert Bourla; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Angela Hwang, Group President, Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group; John Young, our Chief Business Officer; and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel. The slides that will be presented during this call were posted to our website earlier this morning and are available at Pfizer.com/investors. You'll see here that Slide 3 covers our legal disclosures. Albert and Frank will now make prepared remarks, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Albert Bourla. Albert? Albert Bourla : Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. During my remarks, I will discuss our second quarter business performance, provide an update our pipeline and, of course, speak to the progress we are making to combat the global public health challenge posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our continued strong performance speaks to the resilience of our business, even during the most challenging times. The second quarter was the first full quarter impacted by COVID-19. Revenues in the quarter included an estimated net unfavorable impact of approximately $500 million, or 4% due to COVID-19, primarily reflecting unfavorable disruption to wellness visits for pediatric and declines in adult patients in the U.S. and lower demand for certain products in China. These declines were partially offset by increased U.S. demand for certain Sterile Injectable products, increased adult demand for Prevnar 13 in certain international markets. Let me start with an update on our biopharmaceuticals group. For the quarter, our Biopharma business grew 6% operationally, driven by strong performances from many of our key growth drivers, including Vyndaqel/Vyndamax, Eliquis, Ibrance, Inlyta, Xtandi and our biosimilars portfolio. Our oncology business was particularly strong, up 20% operationally compared with a year ago quarter. Global Ibrance revenues increased 9% operationally to $1.3 billion during the quarter. In the U.S. Ibrance revenues grew 11% and Ibrance continues to retain a strong leadership position within the CDK class. The international markets delivered strong 18% volume growth in the quarter. This volume growth was partially offset by price reductions in certain EU markets, which resulted in 3% operational revenue growth outside in the U.S. The price reductions occurred last year as a result of renegotiating long-term agreements and we expect the impact will continue through to the fourth quarter of 2020 when the price changes annualize. Frank D'Amelio: Thanks, Albert. Good day, everyone. Starting with total company revenue, we generated $11.8 billion in the second quarter of 2020, down 9% operationally versus the year ago quarter. As in each of the last three quarters, the majority of this decline is due to the fact that we no longer report revenues for our Consumer Healthcare business. Adjusting for Consumer, total company revenues declined 3% operationally. As a reminder, the formation of the Consumer joint venture with GSK will annualize on July 31, so next quarter will be the last one impacted by this negative driver. Albert did a really nice job of describing the revenue drivers for each of our businesses so I won't repeat them, but I do want to make one additional point on each business to punctuate what he said. For Biopharma, the growth that we are seeing is not reliant on net price increases. In fact, on a global basis, net price had a negative 2% impact on Biopharma growth this quarter and in the U.S., net price was flat. These dynamics are consistent with the pricing environment we have seen for several years now, and we continue to believe that pricing will not contribute to our expected growth for the foreseeable future. For Upjohn, it is important to point out that despite a 31% operational decline in revenue this quarter, the business continues to perform in line with our expectations and the assumptions reflected in our initial Upjohn guidance. I should also point out that the 31% becomes minus 6%, excluding the impact of the Lyrica LOE. Now moving down the income statement, we had another quarter with significant declines in adjusted SI&A expenses, which were down 17% operationally. Nearly half of that decline was due to the fact that we no longer report expenses for the Consumer Healthcare business. The remainder of the decrease was driven primarily by decreased sales and marketing activities compared to the prior year quarter due to restrictions on in-person meetings with health care professionals primarily in the U.S. and to a lesser extent, lower spending associated with corporate enabling functions. Reported diluted EPS for the quarter was down significantly compared to the year-ago quarter, mainly driven by a onetime favorable tax settlement recorded in the prior year period. Adjusted diluted EPS was down 2% compared to the prior year second quarter. Excluding the $0.02 negative impact of foreign exchange rates in the period, adjusted diluted EPS was flat compared to the prior year. Foreign exchange also negatively impacted revenues in the quarter by $277 million or 2%. On Slide 13, we are providing an update to the detailed assumptions reflected in our current financial guidance related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. Broadly speaking, we anticipate an ongoing gradual global recovery from the macroeconomic and health care impacts experienced during the second quarter of 2020 beginning in Q3 of 2020. The guidance also assumes we'll be able to continue to operate our manufacturing and supply chain without material disruption and that we will continue investing in potential treatments and vaccines against COVID-19 throughout 2020 but does not include any revenues for a COVID-19 vaccine candidate given that it has not yet been approved. With that in mind, let's take a look at our guidance. Consistent with last quarter, we are providing three sets of financial guidance. Beginning with total company, we are raising our guidance range for revenues by $100 million and our guidance range for adjusted diluted EPS by $0.03 based on the strength and resiliency we see in our business and the dedication of our colleagues despite the challenges inherent in operating during this current global pandemic. We are reaffirming all of the components of our 2020 financial guidance for total company. I want to point out that although changes in foreign exchange rates since mid-April have marginally benefited our full year outlook for revenue and adjusted diluted EPS, today's guidance increases are not primarily driven by changes in foreign exchange. And as a reminder, we maintained both of these guidance ranges last quarter despite absorbing much larger negative impacts from foreign exchange. Moving on to financial guidance for new Pfizer and Upjohn. Both of the changes we made for total Pfizer guidance this quarter are reflected in the updates you see here to our new Pfizer financial guidance. On the Upjohn side, all financial guidance components are being reaffirmed, reflecting that the performance of that business continues to track in line with our expectations. Moving on to key takeaways. In the second quarter, our company performed well, driven by the strong 6% operational revenue growth from our Biopharma business. We raised our 2020 total company and new Pfizer guidance ranges for revenues and adjusted diluted EPS, and we reaffirmed all of the components of our financial guidance, including all guidance ranges for our Upjohn business. We raised sufficient funding through our Upjohn subsidiary to satisfy the $12 billion dividend to be paid to Pfizer upon the close of the combination of Upjohn with Mylan, which is expected to occur in the fourth quarter. We also achieved multiple product and pipeline milestones since our last quarterly update, some of which are listed here. A more complete listing can be found in this morning's press release. Finally, we paid $4.2 billion in dividends to our shareholders in the first half of this year. As always, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2020 and beyond. Now I'll turn it back to Chuck. Chuck Triano : Thank you, Frank. Operator, can we now please start to poll for questions? Operator :  Your first question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen. Steve Scala : Well, thank you. One for Frank. Pfizer delivered a much stronger quarter while some peers, including Novartis and Roche, were not as strong, yet the businesses are not that different. To what do you attribute the disparity that we're seeing in the industry? Is it product portfolio or cycle? Is it geography or is it execution? And then maybe for Mikael regarding the COVID-19 vaccine, can you elaborate on the immunogenicity and safety in older adults that was touched upon in the press release? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Steve. Frank, why don't you take the first question? And maybe, Angela, also you can chime in and then if \u2013 Mikael will answer the COVID question. Frank? Frank D'Amelio: Sure. Good morning, Steve. So Steve, obviously, I can't comment on what some of our competitors printed for the quarter. But obviously, we had a strong quarter, and I think I can attribute it to, quite frankly, the excellent execution that we continue to deliver. If you look at the Biopharma business, really strong strength across the portfolio, 6% operational growth, about $600 million in revenue, VYNDAQEL \u2013 I'm rounding the numbers. VYNDAQEL was up $200 million, Eliquis was up $200 million, IBRANCE was up $100 million, Inlyta was up $100 million, so really, really strong performance. And by the way, overall, that's despite $500 million hit to revenue from COVID, $400 million of which was in our Biopharma business. Then if you look at our spending, I think we've done a nice job on managing our spending. Obviously, we're getting some help from COVID, but if you look at the rest of the business, we continue to be disciplined on how we spend money. So I think all in, I think we're continuing to execute in a very effective way. Albert Bourla : Angela? Angela Hwang : Sure. Just to build up what Frank said, I think in addition to the execution, which was a critical element of this, we also have a product portfolio, which, in combination, really worked well together. As you said, there are parts of our portfolio that are similar to others, but this particular collection of disease areas is quite unique. You have oncology and our internal medicine, cardiology business that did not have \u2013 didn't feel and didn't experience the kind of downturn in new Rxs unlike some other portfolios. You had the hospital BU that pulled through. You had portfolios that are very much about continuing patients, the large base of patients that are continuing with their medicine. So I think that it really speaks to the strength and the diversity of this portfolio and the unique attributes that make it very resilient in a time like this. Albert Bourla : Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : Yes, thank you for the question. We are very pleased with our \u2013 both actually the b1 and the b2 vaccine candidate. And as we know, we have selected b2 and now started dosing of patients in a late stage trial. We have started b2 in near 120 patients in the Phase 1. And for the specific questions on the older adults, we were very pleased with the safety and tolerability seen in older adults after both the first injection and the boost. In general, mild to moderate reactions whether locally or systemic and overall, a very stable tolerability profile. We also reported neutralizing antibodies after the boost, day 28, that exceeded a panel of convalescent plasma, which was very rewarding to see. Finally, I want to punctuate that in addition to neutralizing antibodies, our mRNA vaccine also elicits potent antiviral T cell activation, including CD8 T cells that have been implied as key cellular mediator to control viral infection, including coronaviruses. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael. And Steve, I can't resist also adding that as you are looking at new Pfizer, what we are trying to build, a much more science-focused Pfizer, you will see three themes : excellence in execution, speed and agility. And you will see that across commercial with the results that you see; across R&D with our ability to advance a program like COVID, very complicated, in such a speed; and across manufacturing, where in the middle of a pandemic, we maintain all our operational units up and running. And we experienced virtually very, very little stock disruptions in a period that demand for some injectables went five, four, six times up. Please go to the next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Tim Anderson : Yes, thank you. A couple of questions, please. Long-term guidance in the past, you've said at least 6 on a five-year CAGR basis, and that excluded anything from COVID-19 in terms of vaccine contribution. Does that guidance still stand? And then second question on IBRANCE. When we see full PALACE results, will there be an obvious reason why the trial failed? Was it mostly a compliance issue, for example? If so, then it seems like docs would likely stick with the brand. But you could argue it the other way, too, which is your product, while it was first to market and the class is the only one that doesn't have a survival benefit in metastatic and in adjuvant, it didn't work. So I guess can you just kind of give us a little bit of insight into PALACE results? And are you confident that IBRANCE remains a growth brand over time? Albert Bourla : Yes. Let me answer the first one and then Mikael will speak about the PALACE. The answer is absolutely. It is not 6%, it is at least 6% and that we reiterate and we feel much stronger right now. And that excludes obviously any impact of COVID on the top line. And as I explained multiple times in investor events, the reason why our approximately 6% went to at least 6% while we lost PALACE was because for PALACE, we had $2 billion of revenues in our projections at 50% probability of success, so we lost $1 billion. But at the same time, since we had given the 6%, we advanced \u2013 we had successful Phase 3 study in adults, pneumococcal. We have successful POCs in multiple vaccines, which we advanced already right now to Phase 3. Three vaccines, as I spoke, we advanced in Phase III. We have Duchenne muscle dystrophy, positive POC. We have a lot of positive news that when we update the probability of success in our model, more than offset the PALACE. And with that, I want to ask Mikael to comment on why he thinks PALACE failed. Mikael Dolsten : Yes, thank you for the question. We are now analyzing data and details, looking at various sub looking at various sub-analysis and sensitivities. So it's still too early to have a view on what made this study not successful. And as Albert alluded to, IBRANCE has been and is a very strong brand in the metastatic setting. It has a favorable tolerability profile and is supported by a number of randomized controlled clinical studies. And I wanted to just add that real-world data studies have also replicated a progression-free survival and added overall survival data using real-world evidence for IBRANCE in the metastatic setting. Now we'll continue to share with you the learnings we have. And of course, we have the PENELOPE-B study to read out, which we can't comment on. It includes a different patient type than in PALACE. Chuck Triano : Maybe Angela could add on the commercial front for IBRANCE? Angela Hwang : Sure. Thanks, Chuck. Actually, we continue to see great opportunities in the metastatic indication for IBRANCE. As you can tell, we are firmly entrenched as a leader in metastatic. And even recent research that we conducted with our prescribers, our physician prescribers indicate that they see early treatment, so the early indication as well as metastatic indication quite differently, and that what is being within each of these indications will have their own role. So when you look at our market share, both in terms of in-line as well as across all the lines, after five years in the market, IBRANCE has consistently had dominant market share. So we come into this with a \u2013 with confidence in owning metastatic. But I think it's also important to remember the experience and the confidence that both prescribers and patients have in this \u2013 the metastatic disease that has been established through time. And to build off of what Mikael said, we do have overall survival benefit. And we saw that in our real-world studies, and we're the only CDK inhibitor that has these real-world studies. And certainly, these studies will further strengthen our leadership in metastatic. So I think on all accounts, when we look at where we are, the real-world data that we've generated, the experience as well as new data and new studies that are ongoing that demonstrate that patients can be retreated. So therefore, if you have already treated a patient early, you can \u2013 with a different CDK, you can certainly retreat them again when they become metastatic with something like an IBRANCE. And so on all accounts, we continue to be very bullish about our position with IBRANCE in metastatic cancer, metastatic breast cancer. Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Angela. Let\u2019s go to the next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Vamil Divan from Mizuho Securities. Vamil Divan : Hi, great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple, if I could, one on the vaccine. I'm just curious, I guess, for Mikael, based on what we know now, do you expect this COVID vaccine would be a recurring vaccine that people would take annually or to be just sort of two shots initially? And I guess the reason I'm asking is, when you think about sort of the longer-term outlook, I think a lot of people wanted a Pfizer outlook beyond 2026 when you start losing patent protection for some of your key products. Do you see this as potentially a meaningful contributor at that point in time? Or is it maybe more of an opportunity for the next two to three years?  And then my other question is just back on the executive orders. I appreciate the comments you made, Albert, in your prepared remarks. Just any \u2013 I know there's supposed to be a meeting today potentially with the Trump administration to discuss the orders that was canceled. I'm wondering if you have any insights you can share on that. Or are there any other plans to discuss on that. Or are there any other plans to discuss the orders with the administration over the next month or so? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Yes. On the first question, Mikael can speak, but also, I think Angela can add how we see this evolution. So \u2013 and then I will answer the second one. Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : Yes. Thank you for the question. Of course, there is a lot of unknown here with a disease that has just been known to the medical community for maybe six months. But we have seen a dramatic expansion of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 across the globe, including appearance of new variants. So we look upon it as in two phases. The first one is the pandemic phase where, of course, coming with a safe, high-quality efficacious vaccine soon is important. And that's why we are so pleased to be able to announce, as we did yesterday, dosing of patients in our pivotal trial. And for that, a two-shot vaccine is likely to give a protection if successful in the clinical study based on both antibody-mediated and cell-mediated, the CD8 T cells that seems to be important in protection against viruses.  Considering the \u2013 beyond the pandemic phase, which may likely, at the global level, last a few years, it is hard to be certain about the future. But I do think there are scenarios which are very reasonable and we need to be prepared for, that COVID-19 has established itself as a prominent virus, as much circulating in society as flu. And as we will understand the \u2013 how long-lasting the various vaccines are, it will allow us to better predict how often one should consider to reimmunize. A platform such as mRNA has the advantage that there is no anti-vector immunity and if needed, you could immunize annually every two years, every four years. And I just wanted to add that beyond being a very important pillar in the future defense against COVID-19 and probably reasonable to assume that there will be other coronaviruses, as we have seen how they have accumulated in a recombined form in many different species, but this platform will be possible to also disrupt platform will be possible to also disrupt the flu market, novel vaccines against CMV and even to go into a novel age group of RSV. So we see a very large opportunity based on the leadership we have with this mRNA platform, particularly by being able to engage both neutralizing antibodies and antiviral CD8 cells. Angela? Angela Hwang : So picking up on your \u2013 the points about the two phases. Some additional comments on these two phases. I think when it comes to the pandemic phase, we're thinking about it from the perspective of the fact that it could last until the end of 2021 or into 2022 where high volumes of doses will need to be provided for mass vaccinations to mass vaccinations to take place, right? And so I think in this pandemic period, the way that we're thinking about it, and as you've seen, is that we're pricing the vaccine for broad access. Broad access is our main goal and making sure that we can supply it to multiple governments around the world. After that, the next phase is a phase where we think it will become more standard, more seasonal, as you've described it, I think, where we anticipate that we will have to have continued vaccination for a number of years. And this is going to be important to create and maintain the herd immunity globally. So in this time period, we anticipate to return to more regular supply channels and a more value-based pricing approach. So a combination of both of these two is how we see the next many years playing out. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Angela. And thank you Mikael. That was very comprehensive, I think. Now as regards to the executive order, as I said, obviously, I was very disappointed to see those orders coming because I feel that they are coming at a period of time that this is not what is needed. This is a period of time that our scientists are working to develop a vaccine or a treatment, and our manufacturing workers are working day and night to maintain, under COVID conditions, supply of medicines and also provide additional supplies for this vaccine. They should worry only about how to defeat this virus and how to maintain the supply and should not start worrying about their jobs. I think the timing was wrong. And I believe that there is a need for a dialogue so that we can move forward, like look backwards. But clearly, there is a need for \u2013 on the technical level first, to be an agreement. I don't think there is a need for, right now, for White House meetings. There is a need for people that they understand the topics from both sides, work to find solutions how we can decrease the contribution \u2013 how can we decrease the out-of-pocket expense of the Americans that has gone to levels that they are unacceptable right now. This is the real problem and this is what we see that we need to reform. Thank you. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Randall Stanicky from RBC Capital Markets. Randall Stanicky : Great, thanks. Albert, I wanted to follow up on the last question. The vaccine opportunity could be a very big one but perhaps may not sell for the 2026 LOE and arguably could add to it. So as you think about business development priorities near term, has anything changed on that front? And when can we expect to see Pfizer get more active there? And then the second question, just on the vaccine, how should we think about U.S. versus OUS pricing given that you disclosed the U.S. contract with the U.S. government, but we may not get color OUS? Thanks. Albert Bourla : Yes. Thank you. Very good questions, both of them. In our M&A strategy, nothing has changed. It is exactly what we have defined. We are in the street to be aggressive and deploy capital to license in or acquire early to mid-stage aggressive and deploy capital to license in or acquire early to mid-stage clinical projects that could become medicines in the years 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026, and then they can start picking their sales so that we can maintain post-2026 the 6% growth. And that has not changed. We never say never to anything, particularly if people are asking if we want to do a big acquisition. We never say never to anything. And by the way, our firepower allow us to do vertically \u2013 virtually anything that we could decide. But our strategic direction is clear, laser-focused on this area so that we can maintain the growth. And we did have significant achievements in that front. I will mention to you the last two vaccines that we licensed in, which is the Lyme vaccine a few months ago and the COVID vaccine in our agreement with BioNTech. What was the second question? Chuck Triano : It was U.S. pricing versus outside pricing for the vaccine. Albert Bourla : Yes. Why don\u2019t I let Angela answer the question on the U.S. pricing of the vaccine? Angela Hwang : The pricing strategy for our vaccines is universal across the board. And it is based on volumes, advanced commitments, equity and affordability principles. So this agreement in the U.S. that you referred to relates to the first 100 million doses for which Pfizer will receive $1.95 billion, and this is assuming the regulatory approval or authorization. And if the government would like to purchase an additional 500 million doses, it would be at that same price and it's also subject to future mutual agreements. Switching over to the EU or ex U.S., I think, was your other question, how we're thinking about that. Again, we're using the same pricing principles across the globe. And specifically, I won't be able And specifically, I won't be able to disclose to you the content of those confidential discussions. But again, the principles are the same. And because of that, no country in the developed world will receive doses at a lower price than the U.S. for similar volume commitments. Albert Bourla : Yes. And I want to emphasize what Angela said in her statement that no country in the developed world, which means Europe, Japan, all the countries that are developed right now, will not receive a lower price for the same volume commitment than the U.S. But that, of course, excludes African countries or other countries that they don't have the means to pay over there. We may do exceptions and offer it to lower price. Thank you very much, Angela. Let\u2019s go to the next question. Operator : Your next question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn : Hi, thanks for taking the questions and congrats on all the progress of the vaccine. I guess this might be a question for Frank. Just wondering, based on the commentary in the press question for Frank. Just wondering, based on the commentary in the press release versus what you guys outlined in the first quarter, it seems to suggest that maybe you're now assuming a somewhat more gradual recovery in the second half. Just wondering if I'm interpreting that correctly. And is that driven by global data points you guys are seeing? Or is that really a result of what's been going on in some states in the U.S.? And then the second question relates to the Phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine program. Was just wondering if you can give any more details on the powering assumptions of the primary end point. And then also, you talk about the interim analyses. Any more details on that front? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Frank, go ahead, please. Frank D'Amelio: Yes. So Terence, you're absolutely right. We talked about a gradual recovery in the quarter. And we're saying that in terms of patient visits to doctors, vaccination rates, elective surgeries, where we're expecting a gradual increase, a gradual improvement over Q2 levels beginning in Q3. Same thing with new-to-brand prescriptions, where we're expecting a gradual improvement over 2Q levels beginning in Q3. And then in the U.S., just a gradual improvement in terms of our reps visiting and getting to meet face-to-face with health care professionals. So it's definitely a gradual improvement. That's an update from the language we put into Q1, and most importantly, all of which we have factored into the latest guidance that we provided to you all today for 2020. And that includes total company, new Pfizer and the Upjohn guidance that we provided. Albert Bourla : Thank you very, very much, Frank. And Mikael, can you speak a little bit about our study design, the powering assumptions, interim analysis, et cetera. Mikael Dolsten : Yes. Thank you for the question. So we started dosing yesterday in which will be 30,000 healthy adults aged 18 to 85. We have more than 30 states in U.S. picked in areas that will contribute to both enrollment as well as event rate, and that is supplemented by South America and Europe sites. When it comes to how the study will be executed, it is currently assumed that we will have sufficient number of individuals enrolled by early September to allow several interim analysis to support potential filing that could start in September or in October, depending on event rates as well as vaccine efficacy. And at this time point, I think I don't want to give more details. The primary endpoint is efficacy against confirmed COVID-19 in participants without evidence of infection before vaccination as well as efficacy against confirmed COVID-19 in participants with and without evidence of infection before vaccination. And we use PCR technology to confirm infection of SARS-CoV-2 as well as using antibody tests to confirm previous exposure. So all in all, it's well-powered study to detect a meaningful vaccine efficacy, and interim analysis would lead to opportunity to start planning for filing from September running into October. And this is, of course, pending our assumptions on event rate. I want to say that our assumptions were made a few weeks ago, looking at incidence of disease in U.S. and elsewhere. And over the last few weeks, unfortunately, the incidence rate has made the disease even more prevalent. So if anything, we would expect on that planning to be able to hit event rates sooner rather than later, which is, of course, favorable for a potential filing of this vaccine September to October time frame. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much, Mikael. And again, we said it very clearly in our press release. The study design has been discussed extensively with FDA, and we are following all the guidelines that FDA has put out there. And that should be the golden standard for anyone who is doing studies for COVID-19. We can go to the next question. Operator : Your next question comes from Louise Chen from Cantor. Louise Chen : Hi, thanks for taking my questions here. So my first question is basically, there have been some concerns that Pfizer could have a hard time meeting this 6% CAGR projection or at least 6% CAGR projection through 2025. What do you think the street is missing here? And then at your upcoming Investor Day, on the R&D Day, what kind of new data and pipeline can we expect to see? And what do you hope to address, the key things that you want to address at this meeting? And then last question I have for you is as you move towards being a biopharma pure play, what kind of margin expansion can we expect to see over the next several years? Thank you. Albert Bourla : I will answer the 6%, and then I will ask John Young to speak a little bit what you should expect during the R&D Day. And then obviously, Frank can speak about the margin expansions. Now, as I said, the 6% CAGR, we feel very, very strongly about it. And I don't think that the time horizon on this call will allow me to speak about the entry that we have in our models that I don't see, frankly, in most of the analyst expectations, but let me try. Let's start with the vaccines because it's so much into the \u2013 right now, it's so much data and it's so much into the news. I think that the analysts are having, as appropriately, expectations for pneumococcal 20 as we do. But I haven't seen anyone having anything about Clostridium difficile, which is running a Phase III study and is expected to read out, I think, late this year or beginning \u2013 I think later in the year. I don't think anyone has anything about RSV that has started a pivotal study. I don't think that anybody has anything about pentavalent meningococcal that has started a pivotal study. I don't think anyone has anything about the Lyme vaccine, but it is in Phase II study and is progressing, and it is \u2013 all of that are vaccines that are \u2013 there is no basically a similar vaccine in development. You can say pneumococcal 20 has a competing pneumococcal 15. But the rest, I don't think anything like that. We have right now, together with COVID, 7 vaccines in the clinic, 7, right? Let's go now through rare diseases. I think everybody is putting some revenues on the VYNDAQEL and rightly so. But I don't think anyone is having anything about our gene therapy platform, almost nothing. And there is that one, which is the one that we're discussing recently because we had data releases like the Duchenne muscle dystrophy. There are others that are coming sooner to the market like hemophilia A or hemophilia B. And these are very, very big markets, and we're having very, very strong data, so significant probability that we will be successful. I don't think anyone is factoring anything there. And also, some smaller products, but altogether, they have a contribution like the hemophilia, the pan-hemophilia product, TFPI and also about the growth hormone. I don't think anyone is factoring anything there. When you go to internal medicines, I don't think anyone is factoring anything. And we have been able to present recently very good data from our NASH portfolio that's progressing very nicely, but also the GLP, which could be a tremendous opportunity to move, and I can go on and on. So there is a lot of standard \u2013 I think right now, people are not modeling. And that could explain why people \u2013 some of the people are maybe factoring that the 6%, I don't know, it's 4% or 5%. But I don't think anything \u2013 anywhere, when I see the analyst expectations, there's a very big discrepancy between the 6%. But I think that as we have proven to all of you and to the market our ability to execute on these studies and as we start having readouts, I think people will see it and will assign the right value. With that being said, a good way to do that, it is to have a good discussion with you during the Investor Day. And I will ask John to discuss with us what shall we expect to see that day. John Young : Thanks, Albert, and thanks for the question, Louise. So, I think, Albert has just given you some great highlights of some of the programs that \u2013 in our pipeline that we believe are potentially underappreciated and maybe haven't been as visible to the analyst community. So our goal for the Investor Day is that we really want to highlight what we are very excited about in terms of the strong capability and the productivity of our R&D organization. We're going to provide an update on each of our 5 core R&D-driven business units in our pipeline. And I think we feel this is exactly the right time to do that with the announcement of the Upjohn transaction and our pipeline, as Albert has just commented, really being stronger than it's been in years. We really do feel this is a perfect time to share the excitement about Pfizer's profile as a leading pure play innovative biopharmaceutical company. So I won't repeat the detail that Albert has gone through, but I would just say that we'll focus the day on programs that we expect to launch by 2025, 2026, programs that the analyst community are generally not currently modeling in their valuations and some programs where there's new data. So I expect that we'll be able to shed some light on several pipeline opportunities that we see as promising and certainly including some of the specific programs that Albert has mentioned. Albert Bourla : Thank you very, very much John. And of course, also, the unique thing with this day is that we will try to also present the people behind this success. So we will give you visibility to our scientists and the commercial people that are driving each one of these units. Frank, can you please answer the question on the margin? Frank D'Amelio: Sure. So, let me just start with what's in the release, which is if you look at our guidance for new Pfizer, one of the things we say is 37%, we call it IBT adjusted margin. Now just to refresh everyone's memory, IBT is income before taxes. But in Pfizer, that's basically operating income, and then it includes other income because we have significant equity income coming into that line item from the consumer joint venture. So, now what that is framing the way I think about this is we grow the top line, to Albert's point, at least 6% on a CAGR basis through 2025. We will leverage that to the bottom line. So we're growing when we\u2019re growing the top-line are at least 6%, we're going to clearly have operating income that's growing at a rate that's greater than that. We also believe \u2013 I also believe there's opportunities to be more efficient in our SI&A spend so that, that 37%, what we'd like to do, what we expect to do is to see that go from 37% into the higher 30s, so 38%, 39% and then ultimately, I'd like to see that begin with a 4. That's how we think about. Albert Bourla : Yes, thank you, Frank. And I realized as I was trying to save some time that I didn't speak about oncology and immune inflammation in things that the analysts are not modeling and \u2013 because I may get into trouble with the people of this unit. About immune inflammation, I think a lot of analysts are modeling the abrocitinib. But I don't think that anybody is modeling all the rest of the JAK portfolio. Right now, we have 5 new molecular entities that we are trying in 10 different indications and that was by design. Our strategy was very different than the strategy of other companies that usually, they try for efficiency to select the best target and develop it for everything. What we did, we selected the best target for a specific disease because different drugs or different molecules, they respond very differently if the disease is on the skin or on the gut or on the \u2013 or if it is an arthritis. So this strategy now is about to start giving significant readouts for all the other molecules that are coming. And of course, in oncology, in addition to the work that is happening in new model CDKs and resistance to cancer from our La Jolla group, don\u2019t forget the acquisition of Array, that is the boulder, Pfizer boulder we call it right now, that they are an extremely productive group, that they are \u2013 keep providing with new leads, and we're expecting to have, in the clinic from this group, 1 to likely 2 new molecules every month. So \u2013 sorry, it was a long answer, but it's a long list. We can go to the next question. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JP Morgan. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks so much for the questions. My first one was just coming back to COVID vaccine pricing. I guess my question is, do you see this initial $19.50 per dose pricing that we saw last week as a decent proxy for pricing over time? Or should we expect price to decline here as we think about a range of potential vaccines being developed and some of your competitors have maybe different pricing strategies coming to market? And then my second question was kind of a bigger picture one here. It seems like you're running kind of an unprecedented development program with the COVID vaccines. To the extent this is successful, do you see an opportunity to apply some of these approaches to broader product development in an effort to maybe speed development time lines in areas of unmet need? I'm just trying to think here is like, is there some read across the rest of the portfolio to the extent that this study is successful? Thanks so much. Albert Bourla : Chris, in the interest of time, instead of asking Angela to answer the first question \u2013 that it is \u2013 the first one that is managing. Look, it's \u2013 the price that we have said in the U.S. is the price that basically is a good benchmark for this level of volumes that people will order. If they order less, the price would be higher. If they order more, it could be a little bit lower. But this is a very good benchmark. And I don't think that this will change during the pandemic because irrelevant how many products will be \u2013 it's not irrelevant, but I assume that \u2013 and I hope that many vaccines will be registered and will make the cut. But still, the demand for 7.5 billion people will be very, very high. And so this, I think, will be maintained. As Angela said in her answer, after the pandemic, which is, after we have this significant sets of volumes, demand for volumes now, which will take us all the way to 2021, beginning maybe of 2022, obviously, we could go to a much more normal type of situation where volumes will be much more normal and the price also will be based on the competition of the time and also will be based on the value that the product brings, which is not the case right now. Obviously, it is priced well, well, well below the value that brings to society this product. And as regard to your second question, instead of also moving to Mikael about \u2013 can we use this platform? We can use this platform. Don't forget that we are working already two years for a flu vaccine by using the RNA platform. And already, Mikael spoke in his question that he sees  answer to a similar question before, that he sees multiple opportunities to use the platform in different type of diseases. Chris Schott : Thank you very much. Albert Bourla : Next question please operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Umer Raffat : Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. I have two if I may. And perhaps first, Albert, I know Moderna's CEO said that he expects, based on his data, a 75% to 80% odds of clearing the Phase III bar set by FDA for the COVID vaccine. I'm curious\u2026 Albert Bourla : Say it again. I'm not sure I \u2013 can you say it again, what he said? Umer Raffat : Sure, Albert. So Moderna's CEO believes the odds of clearing Phase III is 75% to 80% based on the data they've produced. Are you in the same ballpark based on the data you're seeing? And one for Mikael, if I may. Mikael, in the press release last night where you decided to take the b2 vaccine construct to Phase III and not the previously published b1, what I noticed was the pivotal factor was perhaps that there were more spike-specific T cell epitopes being seen with this second construct. Can you give us a little more specifics on that? And can you also speak to the fact that several studies are suggesting about half of T cell response could actually be on epitopes, which are beyond the spike in the first place? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Yes, thank you very much Umer. Look I don\u2019t want myself to speculate now what is the probability that I see if the product will be successful. The study started and the only one that will tell us is the data readout. But I will share the opportunity here because the data that we have seen so far are very, very, very strong. But again, there have been cases that you have very, very strong clinical data in the Phase II, and the Phase III, for some reason, doesn't work. But I think it's very high. I'm optimistic based on the data that I have seen so far, but we need to wait to see what the readout will be. And then Mikael can explain all the excellent questions that you asked. Mikael Dolsten : Yes. Thank you, Albert. So I just want to say it was a great question. And as we said, we had 2 great vaccine candidates. And in the end, the data of totality favor the b2. And the specific question around spike, yes, we detected a number of epitopes. In the spike, there's one fragment that contains RBDE but also in the S2 fragment that's outside RBDE. And we think there is a richness of T cell epitope for CD4 T cells and for CD8. I would like particularly to punctuate that the majority or the overwhelming use in the field of immunology is that to fight against viruses with immune system, you need neutralizing antibodies when the virus is outside the cell, but you need CD8 T cells to kill viral containing cells when the virus is hiding in the cell. And that was really part of our full platform. And it's not just related to spike. It's related to how you construct the envelope, the lipid nanoparticles and how you modify the RNA. And we spent several years to get into that goal that's been associated, over a long time a successful way of preventing viral infection by vaccination. And I think we're on to something really unique in our platform here with that dual way of combating the infection. And of course, it also was related to really good tolerability, low dose, nice immune response in older and younger. So all of that, of course, gives us a lot of encouragement for moving forward here. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. David Risinger : Yes, thanks very much and congrats on all of the positive update. So I have two questions on the COVID vaccine. First, should we expect to see primate data in coming weeks, which provide information on the durability of your vaccine after the second dose? The reason why I ask is, obviously, there's a need for a booster just 30 days after the first dose. So it would be helpful to better understand how durable the efficacy is post the second dose. And second, with respect to your arrangements that you're \u2013 that you booked with the U.S government and that you planned to arrange with ex U.S. governments and entities, could you just discuss Pfizer's COVID vaccine liability shield expectation specifically what the U.S. government can protect you against in the event that there are surprising adverse events down the line and then what you can arrange with ex U.S. entities? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Now, thank you, Dave. Very good questions, both of them. Mikael, can you please answer the question about when we can expect primate data, the durability? And by the way, our \u2013 Dave, our booster is coming 21 days after the first dose. And then I will ask Doug Lankler to comment on the liabilities. Mikael Dolsten : Yes, thank you, Albert. Yes, the primate data, I think, have two key components. One is that we were able to show that there is no signs of any augmentation of a negative effect on disease outcome. On the contrary, we were able to show that our b1 and b2 were able to prevent disease in airways, including lung and also nose and that b2 was very effective in this, suggesting that we can protect the individuals that will be exposed to the virus and possibly, as it needs to be confirmed in humans, also reduce the risk of spreading the virus. It still will be a bit too early to have a lot of data on durability. We are following it in animals and in humans. And we have seen so far that the neutralizing antibodies actually tend to rise even though the total number of antibodies tend to stabilize at some level. And that suggests that we actually continue to evolve a new response with more potent binding antibodies. I want to just also add that when it comes to durability, Dave, if you look in the literature, in general, antibody durability after vaccination can last quite some time. But the really long-lasting durability is in the T cell compartment. And for viral disease, particularly CD8-positive cytotoxic cells, they have been detected ten years or more after SARS-CoV-1. And then finally, while we will monitor durability, of course, in the human study for several years, our platform has the advantage that we can easily boost at an appropriate time point with no anti-vector immunity and we are likely to build those antibodies and T cells. And that's, of course, different from a lot of adenovirus platforms that have difficulty to boost even one time. And we tried all of the platforms, whether viral platforms, protein-based and mRNA and for a pandemic of this, we selected a construct based on a large number of knowledge and experience cross platform and cross constant. Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael. Doug? Doug Lankler : Yes, thanks. In the U.S., we expect the PREP Act and the Vaccine Act are going to provide Pfizer broad protections against any personal injury claims that might come out of any type of problems from the vaccine or side effects or otherwise. We\u2019re pursuing similar liability protections outside of the United States through contractual and/or legislative efforts, and we believe this is going to be manageable. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much, Doug. Chuck Triano : Doug. And operator, if we can take our last question please and then we will have a closing comment from Albert. Thank you. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink. Geoffrey Porges : Thank you very much for taking the question. Just a follow up on the COVID pivotal trial over the next few months, could you clarify what you'll be telling us and when and then how that will affect the blinding and ultimately getting the full safety data for a full approval? It sounds as though, as we all know, you're going to get the number of events pretty quickly. So will you communicate when the study is enrolled? Will you communicate the efficacy results at the interim to the extent that you hit the statistical endpoint? And then again, what effect will that have on the full safety data that presumably you still need to get to achieve full approval? Thanks. Albert Bourla : Yes. Just for the interest of time, Geoff, obviously, if we hit, in an interim approval, an effective \u2013 the effectiveness endpoint, we will certainly communicate that. And then I'm not sure right now if we will provide regular updates as to how many have enrolled and when the enrollment is completed. As Mikael said, it's going to be a very rapid enrollment anyway. So we plan by the end of August to have enrolled the majority of our 30,000 patients. And then the results could come, depends on the efficacy of the vaccine and depends also on the burden of the disease. From September to October, this is the current assumptions. And with that, we will make it known. Obviously, we have done in the past ways that we can unblind data for FDA, and we can still maintain the blindness when the studies are continued because the studies anyway are planned to continue for 2 years that we are going to be monitoring our patients. So that's what I can give you right now. Albert Bourla : Let me then thank you all for joining us today and for your continued engagement with Pfizer. I really enjoyed this earnings call, very strong operational performance. So very, very few questions on products and a lot of questions that dominated the call on our pipeline, of course, with, number one, COVID-19 because this is a tremendous opportunity for the world to be able to bring an effective and safe vaccine. As you have heard, our key in-market medicines remain strong, our pipeline remain robust and we remain fully confident in the potential of the long-term growth strategy to yield at least 6% CAGR through 2025 following the completion of the pending Upjohn/Mylan combination. We discussed a lot about our hard work to combat COVID-19, and we have been very encouraged by the early data of our mRNA-based vaccine program with BioNTech. My heartfelt thanks go out to all the colleagues at both companies who are working tirelessly to find medical solutions to this global pandemic. And because of their efforts, I'm confident to say that science will win. Have a rest of the day \u2013 a great rest of your day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude Pfizer's second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day everyone and welcome to Pfizer's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir. Chuck Triano : Thank you, operator. Good morning and thanks for joining us today to review Pfizer's third quarter 2020 financial results our updated 2020 financial guidance Pfizer's role in helping find solutions for the COVID-19 pandemic as well as other relevant business topics. I'm joined today as usual by our Chairman and CEO, Dr. Albert Bourla; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; and Mikael Dolsten our Chief Scientific Officer and President of Worldwide Research Development and Medical; Angela Hwang Group President Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group; John Young, our Chief Business Officer; and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel. The slides that will be presented during the call were posted to our website earlier this morning and are available at pfizer.com/investors. You'll see here on slide three, our disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements we will make during the call regarding among other topics our anticipated future operating and financial performance, business plans and prospects, and expectations for our product pipeline and in-line products which of course are subject to risks and uncertainties as well as the use of non-GAAP financial information. Additional information regarding these forward-looking statements and our non-GAAP financial measures is available in our earnings release including under the Disclosure Notice section and under Risk Factors in our SEC reports 10-K and 10-Q. Forward-looking statements on this call speak only as of the original date of this call and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements. Albert and Frank will now make prepared remarks and then we'll move to a Q&A session. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Albert Bourla. Albert? Albert Bourla : Thank you, Chuck and good morning everyone. A great day here in New York. During my remarks, I will discuss our strong third quarter business performance, speak to the progress we are making in the battle against COVID-19, provide an update on our pipeline and how it is setting us up for an anticipated period of sustained growth, and briefly touch on the topic of affordable access to innovative medicines and vaccines. Let's start with an update on our Biopharmaceutical Group. For the quarter, revenues in our biopharma business grew 4% operationally driven primarily by the ongoing strong performance of Vyndaqel/Vyndamax; growth from our leading portfolio of biosimilars; and the continued strength of key brands including Eliquis, IBRANCE, Xeljanz, Inlyta, and XTANDI. Frank D'Amelio: Thanks, Albert. Good day, everyone. I know you've seen our release, so let me provide a few highlights regarding the quarterly financials. Our Biopharma business, which will become new Pfizer, following the close of the Upjohn transaction, generated $10.2 billion in revenue for the quarter, which represented 84% of total company revenue. On an operational basis, Biopharma revenue grew 4% in the quarter and 7% for the first nine months of the year. The 7% year-to-date operational revenue growth for Biopharma was driven by continued solid volume growth and our price-to-volume mix was a 9% increase in volume and a 2% negative impact from price. For Upjohn, although the year-over-year comparison is skewed again by the impact of generic Lyrica and changes in the China market, the business continues to perform in line with our expectations and assumptions already reflected in our Upjohn guidance for the year. Now moving down the income statement. I'll touch quickly on gross margin, which saw a slight negative impact during the quarter, mainly driven by lower sales from Lyrica, Celebrex, Lipitor and Norvasc, which are all part of our Upjohn business, as well as some incremental costs due to COVID 19. There was some offset to this impact due to lower inventory write-offs compared to the year ago quarter. We had another quarter where we saw a significant year-over-year decline in adjusted SI&A expenses, which were down 10% operationally. There are two obvious factors at work here : the exclusion of consumer health expenses and lower selling expenses due to COVID; but also a third factor, which is a planned reduction in spending associated with our corporate-enabling functions. We're in the midst of aligning those functions to the new Pfizer structure, which will be a smaller and less complex organization. We are finalizing this initiative and we'll be able to better quantify the expected financial benefit when we provide our 2021 financial guidance for new Pfizer. Reported diluted EPS for the quarter was down significantly compared to the year ago quarter, mainly driven by the non-recurrence of a one-time gain from the consumer joint venture formation in the year ago quarter and adjusted diluted EPS was down 3% compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding the $0.02 negative impact of foreign exchange rates in the period, adjusted diluted EPS was $0.01 lower compared to the prior year. Foreign exchange also negatively impacted revenues in the quarter by about $100 million or 1%. Consistent with last quarter, we are providing three sets of financial guidance a few points here regarding our assumptions. The guidance continues to only include the adverse spending on our COVID vaccine candidate, but does not include any potential revenue we may receive this year if the vaccine is authorized and we deliver doses to various governments where we have agreements. In terms of our broader COVID-related assumptions, we expect the gradual recovery in healthcare activity for the remainder of the year. I'd also note that upon the closing of the Upjohn transaction, we will treat the Upjohn business as a discontinued operation. So assuming the completion of the Upjohn transaction before December 31, the financial guidance we are providing will not be aligned with the ultimate numbers we print for the year. I'll start by saying, there were no changes made to either the new Pfizer or Upjohn 2020 guidance factors and only slight refinements to total company guidance. For total company, we are tightening our guidance range for revenues, which results in a small decrease in our midpoint and this is mainly a factor of reducing the top end of the range, as opposed to a change in our forecast. Costs as a percentage of revenue is slightly increased, mainly due to COVID-related costs, while the SI&A range is lowered a bit at the midpoint, mainly COVID, and enabling function-driven and R&D increases slightly mainly due to additional COVID program spending. This nets out to a slight increase in the midpoint of our adjusted diluted EPS range. Moving on to financial guidance for new Pfizer and Upjohn which is shown here. As I referenced, we are not making any changes to either new Pfizer or to Upjohn. Moving on to key takeaways, in the third quarter, our company performed well, driven by strong revenue growth, from our biopharma business. We narrowed ranges for our 2020 total company guidance for revenues, cost of sales, SI&A, R&D, and adjusted diluted EPS. And we reaffirmed our existing guidance components for both, new Pfizer and Upjohn. We also achieved multiple product and pipeline milestones, since our last quarterly update, some of which are listed here. A more complete listing can be found in this morning's press release. Finally, we paid $6.3 billion to our shareholders in the first nine months of this year. As always, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns, in 2020, and beyond. Now I'll turn it back over to Chuck. Chuck Triano : Great. Thank you, Frank and Albert for the prepared remarks. So time now to start our Q&A session. And operator, can I ask you to please poll for the questions? Operator :  Your first question comes from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore. Umer Raffat : Hi guys. Thanks so much for taking my question. I know there's a ton of questions that everyone has but, let me just ask one Albert for all the generalist investors listening in, which I think all the specialists understand. But can you just remind everyone that -- how a blinded trial works and whether -- and how you guys don't have, I think visibility on where the trial is tracking, for the generalists? But let me get to my question now. In your trial, the definition of a positive COVID revolves around one general symptom and one positive PCR. However the general symptoms could be very broad. So I guess, my question is the fact that, there wasn't any sterilizing immunity in the nonhuman primates. Isn't it reasonable to assume that, we could see some positive PCRs on vaccine, even though there's a good amount of neutralizing titers? And if you could remind us what's the cycle threshold for PCR, you're using. Thank you very much. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Umer. And I will ask Mikael to comment on that, just a couple of words before. A study usually -- a pivotal study needs to be blinded, so nobody knows if has received the vaccine or the placebo. That includes the doctor or the nurse, that administer the vaccine, or the patient who is receiving it. And of course all are going to the database and that is locked, with a code so no one can have access, from the Pfizer except a very small team that it is protected with Chinese walls. And of course, the DMC is going to -- is receiving periodically information un-blinded. But not, -- they didn't start yet. So the data monitor committee is -- it's composed by independent experts. But they haven't seen any unblinded data yet. And they haven't performed any analysis -- interim analysis yet. And with that, I will ask Mikael, to speak a little bit about, the specific technical question. Mikael Dolsten : Yeah. Thank you for the question. So Umer, we have as you know two primary endpoints. The first relates to, impact of naive patients to the first infection. And the second one relates to the same, but also adding, re-infection in those that were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. We use PCR machines on a commercial platform that, we have thoroughly validated. And feel very comfortable with. And use established criteria for positive cases. The central read in our large laboratory is the crucial one here. We are also able at the end of the study to look at patients that did not develop symptoms, since as you said we are particularly focused on illness cases. So we use a serology test for the nucleocapsid protein that, allow us also to look at impact at the end of the trial for patients that were asymptomatic. The symptom in the scale that we use was established in consultation with many KOL and FDA. But we also have secondary endpoint that uses CDC's symptom scale. So I think, hopefully that covered many aspects of your questions. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael. So we move to our next question, please operator? Operator : The next question comes from the line of Vamil Divan from Mizuho. Vamil Divan : Great. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So, maybe one in Eliquis and then one back on the COVID-19 vaccine. So on Eliquis, I saw the commentary around the, net price being lower. It covers gap and also the channel mix. I'm wondering if you can maybe just sort of quantify that a little bit more for us. And maybe any sort of sense of how we should think about the pricing dynamics of that product going forward just since it's obviously an important product, for you guys. And then on the COVID-19 vaccine Albert, appreciate your comments, the other day around communicating, when you have specific information. I think one thing that's just sort of been a little bit confusing, a bit more and maybe you're trying to address that now is the sort of either you'll have conclusive results on an interim analysis. And so maybe can you just sort of talk to that. Or maybe Mikael can comment on some of the confidence you have that an interim analysis in this trial should be sufficient to show conclusive efficacy as opposed to waiting, for the final results. Thank you. Albert Bourla : Yes. Thank you. I will ask Angela to speak about the Eliquis. Let me take first a little bit this COVID-19. Look, we are cautiously optimistic that we will have results and possibly an interim analysis. We never \u2013 you never know before you have the final analysis. This cautious optimism is coming from the very strong immunogenicity data that we have very strong neutralizing titers and a very strong T-cell response, excluding CD8, which is one of the important. But as I said, you never know until you have a study readout. And we have reached the last mile here right, so we expect that these things will start coming soon. So let's all have the patience that's required for something so important for public health and global economy. And with that, I will ask Angela to comment on Eliquis. Angela Hwang : So thanks for the question. So this gross-to-net adjustment is clearly a key feature of Eliquis because of the large number of Medicare patients that we have. And every year not only are there a different number or an increasing number of Medicare patients but also there are changes in the coverage gap. And as we mentioned, the key change this time is the length of time that patients are in this catastrophic coverage gap, which is longer in Q3 of 2020, compared to Q3 of 2019 by about 25% and this is sort of the level of impact that we saw this year. And so obviously this increases our expense and is the reason for the unfavorable impact. But hopefully, that gives you some sense of what happened between Q3 of this year and Q3 of last year. Thank you. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Angela and Albert. Operator, let\u2019s move to the next question please. Operator : The next question is from Gregg Gilbert from Truist. Gregg Gilbert : Hi, thanks for the question. First, Albert you noted that there's still that gap on abrocitinib versus Street estimates and what the company sees. I was hoping you could provide a little more detail behind your bullish view beyond what you offered on the call about it not being a zero-sum game. And the second part of my question is Albert, you've expressed a lot of confidence in Pfizer's ability to hit that revenue CAGR and you did so again today without COVID and without deals. But how focused are you and the team on bringing in assets to buttress that growth and/or add growth drivers that come later in the decade? Thanks. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much. I will answer the second part and then I will ask Angela actually to walk us through the abrocitinib projections that we are having. We are very confident on the 6% CAGR. And I think we have broken it down to what we believe will take to reach there. Right now if you take the middle point of our guidance with $41.6 billion, we will need additional $14 billion by 2025 to achieve 6% growth. We believe $8 billion are projected to come from our in-line portfolio and we put that during our earnings release. So that means that we are having a $6 billion that need to come from our current pipeline. Based on our projections on the revenue this requires only 40% adjustment. So $6 billion of the $15 billion that we are expecting to have non-risk adjusted in that year is a very good safety margin. That being said, also we generate a lot of cash and we want to invest this cash. And right now our business development strategy, it is to invest in something that we believe can generate significant value for the shareholders and this is to our R&D machine, an R&D machine that has completely turned around its productivity and right now is having industry-leading metrics in the multiple fronts. So our business development will be invested in Phase II \u2013 Phase III-ready programs that could become medicines in the period of 2023, 2024, 2025 2026. And those from one hand can enhance the 6% growth but even more importantly, will allow us to maintain and sustain this growth beyond 2026. So with that clarification and thank you very much Gregg for the question, I would like to ask Angela to speak a little bit about abrocitinib. Angela Hwang : Thank you, Albert, and thanks for the question and giving us the opportunity to follow up since our discussion during R&D Day. We are really excited about this opportunity and we're enthusiastic about it, because it is a condition that has a large number of patients, a significant unmet need. And both of these things is what we believe drives the size of opportunity for abro. So let me unpack that a little bit. First of all there are significant number of AD sufferers. Globally, there are 60 million AD sufferers, age 12 and up and 27 million of those are in the U.S. And just for a bit of context that is 10 times the number of RA sufferers today. Of those 60 million, only 7% of them today are being treated with a systemic agent. And so the systemic market opportunity has the real potential to more than double with the introduction of better systemic treatment because the patient need is just so high. And let me just also put that in context with a market that we know very well today, which is psoriasis. The market for systemic in psoriasis doubled over the last 10 years with the introduction of advanced systemic biologics and also more recently the IL inhibitors. So if we step back and take a look at those numbers, even at a modest 1% share of the 60 million patient population, or if you think about the future systemic market, all I need is 8% of that systemic market for abro to reach a $3 billion revenue at peak. And so, when you think about all of that and think about the advanced systemic markets that are also in place today of which there is just one and 60% of those patients who are on this product are not reaching clear or almost clear skin at 16 weeks, it demonstrates that there really is a lot of room for additional systemic options. So to Albert's point earlier about the fact that this is not a zero-sum game, we don't see the opportunity for abro as only being about gaining market share from competitors. Actually, the way we see it, is that it is an opportunity to grow the advanced systemic market through the introduction of excellent treatment options. And we believe that the differentiated profile that abro has will allow us to be a leader in this growing market. And also, don't forget market development and creating new markets is a real sweet spot for Pfizer. So, we are very excited about the launch and look forward to bringing this important medicine to the market. Thank you. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Angela. And Greg, yes just one comment on your second question about the deals. A reminder that Valneva in the Lyme disease vaccine area is going well. Arixa, a deal we just announced in the antibiotic segment. So clearly, Pfizer is still going to remain active in bringing in assets that can help bolster the long-term revenue growth of the company there. With that, let\u2019s take our next question please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn : Hi. Thanks for taking the question and thanks again for all the work on the COVID treatment and vaccine front. I guess, I know you can't provide a lot of commentary, but I think what people are trying to understand is just, if there have been any changes to the mandate of the DMC with respect to some of the new FDA guidance, so regarding the timing of the interim efficacy analysis. So essentially, is the DMC mandated now to wait for either a certain number of severe cases that have to happen or two months of safety follow-up data to kind of at that point take a look at the efficacy basis because I think you guys have been pretty confident about reporting data in October -- by the end of October. And so, just trying to understand kind of the timing of the analysis and maybe any new inputs there. Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Terence and I understand how the whole world is looking for any possible information. And we try to make sure that we maintain a very responsible way of from one hand being transparent and from the other hand not feeding speculations. So, what I can tell you to your very specific question is, until now, as we are speaking of today, no DMC has not been changed their mandates. There have not been any changes like that. And I can still repeat that we haven't performed any interim analysis yet and that we believe that the analysis will start soon on efficacy. And if the efficacy is positive or if the efficacy is negative, we will announce it. And that will happen a few days after the DMC announce that to us, which usually takes five, six, seven days. And that if it happens before the third week of November, which is very likely because, as I said, we are expecting it soon, a few days before the end of October, a few days after the end of October, but if it happens before the 15th of November, we will announce it before the 15th of November. As I said, right now, no analysis has been performed. DMC is completely blinded in any data. Of course, we are completely blinded in any data. And once we have the conditions met, they will unblind their data and they will start informing us. So, let's all be very patient. I know how much the stress levels are growing. I know how much a vaccine is needed for the world. We are seeing right now the worst fears that we've had before during -- before are becoming true. The COVID is coming back in Europe and the U.S. and globally and we are working very diligently, very carefully to make sure that we will bring this project through the finish line. Thank you. Chuck Triano : Great. Thanks, Albert, very helpful. Next question please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink. Geoffrey Porges : Thank you very much for taking the question. Albert, I'm sorry to keep pushing on this COVID readout, but you seem very bullish that you will have a positive efficacy readout, I think you've said by the end of October and that you will disclose it. Now, it's clear, it will be within five to seven days after that. So that suggests that you believe that you'll -- I think the hurdle for the first interim is something in the range of 75% to 80% efficacy. So is that your expectation? And then secondly could you comment on the realistic timing for the first dosing given that the FDA has said they need to convene an AdCom presumably you also need to have an ACIP recommendation, then you need to distribute the vaccine. Can you comment on whether it's realistic in your planning right now that anyone will be vaccinated outside the clinical trial by year-end? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Geoff. And no apologies are needed to be asked. I understand that this is very important for the whole world issue. Let me clarify, I'm not bullish that the vaccine will work. I'm cautiously optimistic that the vaccine will work. What I said very clearly it is that we may know by the end of October, if it works or not. And I think -- I reiterate this statement today. It could be -- as I said the October is not for us -- I know it's compared with the elections time. But for us the elections is an artificial milestone. This is going to be not a Republican vaccine or a Democratic vaccine. That will be the vaccine for the citizens of the world and this is how we see it. So I hope that it is going to be effective. I hope that it is going to be effective with very high protection ability but we have to wait to see the results of the study. Now when it comes to distribution, assuming we have positive data assuming that means that we will be ready to apply in the U.S. for emergency use authorization soon after we received the safety data so the safety data are expected to mature in the third week of November. So let's say, we apply around that time third fourth week of November then it is up to FDA to take as much time as they need to make the approval. It's not up to us so I cannot comment on that. What I know it is -- but we will be ready with product available. Again if all goes well but we are very well undergoing through our plans. We will be ready to distribute an initial number of those. And I believe that in the U.S. that you are asking, we have a contract with the U.S. government that we should provide them 100 million doses by March and we are feeling very good about our ability to do it. But also there's a provision that we should provide 40 million of this million doses in this year. So I think we should be able -- 30 million to 40 million to be able to provide, if we receive approval and if the U.S. government distributes their vaccines. Just to put things into perspective, let's say, 30 million doses it's 15 million people. So if we make available in the U.S. the vaccine that will be for 15 million people by the end of the year which is a very small part of the population. So it's not going to be massively available. It's going to be targeted in its availability. As we move into the first months of 2021 then we are going to have much more massive distribution of the vaccine around the world. So I hope that helps, put things into perspective. Again thank you for the interest. We all keep our fingers crossed that science will win. Chuck Triano : Thanks Albert. Next question please, operator. Operator : Your next question is from Louise Chen from Cantor. Louise Chen : Hi, thanks for taking my questions here. First question I had was is there any way to help us think through if you've reached these 32 events yet? I know there's a lot of investor interest here so just trying to get as much color as we can? And then can you provide an update on how many actual doses of vaccine you've already manufactured? It sounds like you're obviously very positive on your goals here. And the last question is will you continue to look at potential adjuvant opportunities for IBRANCE? Or are you really just going to focus on next-generation CDKs? Albert Bourla : Again let me take this question. So far we have produced hundreds of thousands of those and we are moving very rapidly with both sites to start initiating a much larger production. When it comes to thinking through, I don't think I can help you think more than what we have said so far. We are blinded events will accumulate. We will unblind the data. DMC will tell us negative positive or continue. If it is negative or positive we will let you know. If it is -- and then if it is continue, we will continue until the next milestone is reached. There's nothing else to think. But as I said, we will start this process very soon. Now for IBRANCE I'll ask Angela to comment. Angela Hwang : So yes thanks for the question on IBRANCE. In terms of our focus for IBRANCE where we've been as you know is really looking at the early breast cancer indications which disappointingly did not pan out for us in PALLAS and PENELOPE so we are very much focused on metastatic breast cancer as our opportunity with IBRANCE.  And here we continue to feel really confident about what we've seen with our data as well as what we're seeing from a market share perspective right? So first-line use of CDK in metastatic breast cancer as a class, it's still only at 52%, but we have a long way to go in terms of our ability to grow this class. But actually, for IBRANCE itself, it has a very high market share 87% in fact. And we've had this leadership position in first-line treatment for many years. And in fact, since May even post the announcement of the monarchE data, we have seen this consistent market share. So I think that our focus on metastatic breast cancer and our focus on growing the use of the CDK class in metastatic cancer will continue to provide us a tremendous amount of opportunity. I think just as a follow-up to your question in terms of are there other ideas and other thoughts for IBRANCE, just to remind you that we do have still the PATINA trial that is ongoing, which will read out in the second half of 2022 for a different population HR-positive and HER2-positive population. So it's a slightly different question, but really touches on additional expansion opportunities for IBRANCE. Thank you. Chuck Triano : Great. Thanks, Angela. Thanks for the question, Louise. Let's take our next question, please. Operator : Your next question is from Navin Jacob from UBS. Navin Jacob : Thanks so much for taking my question. And I will be very in line with my colleagues about questioning questions on the COVID vaccines. Maybe let me try this a different way. Versus your original assumptions, when you were designing the trial and based on the literature and the data set \u2013 data that are out there, not necessarily in the trial, but just from what you're seeing outside of the trial, how do you think the symptomatically for folks that are infected compared to when you originally designed the study? That's question number one. And similarly, I suppose also, with infection rate itself, I think when you enhance the size of the study from 30,000 to 44,000 patients, one of the reasons \u2013 rationale for increasing the size is because of what you deemed to be a slower infection rate. I'm wondering about that, as well as the symptom rate relative to the original assumptions? Thank you so much. Albert Bourla : Yeah. Thank you, Navin, and again I understand the interest here. I don't want to comment much more. But what we see is our infection rates that they're aligned with what we see in the country. That's not something to be a surprise, because it's a large study that we try to position geographically in multiple sites that represent basically the country in the U.S. where we have the bulk of the patients. The increase of 30,000 to 44,000 anyway wouldn't make any difference in the early readouts. It would only make a difference because of the larger numbers at the very, very late readouts. So I don't think that was the reason, but we did it. It was mainly, because we felt very good about the safety profile, so we started \u2013 we opened our vaccination to kids of 16 years old in beginning then we went to 12 years old, and then we went to people that they are suffering from HIV, from hepatitis B, from hepatitis C. So this is why. And also we use it to improve the diversity of the study which we have made it public so it's very, very good right now. I feel very good about the diversity of our study. So Navin thanks for your question. Let's all keep our fingers crossed, but we will have positive readouts. Chuck Triano : Great. Let's move to the next question, please operator. Operator : Your next question is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks so much for the questions. I guess, my first was on abrocitinib and market development. Thank you for the earlier comment. I guess, my question is if I look at the RA situation it took some time for the JAKs to gain traction. Obviously, now the class is doing really well. Do you expect a similar situation in AD? So, launch that eventually gets very large, but maybe takes some time to build momentum? Or are there differences in this market that could allow for faster uptake here? And then my second question was on VYNDAQEL, and how we think about growth from here? Should we think about the ratio of diagnosed patients to those who receive drug to shrink significantly over time? Or should we think about there being a persistent gap between diagnosis rates and those who actually receive the product? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Yeah. Excellent questions, both I think are appropriate to be answered by Angela. So Angela, why don't we start with abrocitinib and how you think the market will evolve given the experience on RA and JAKs? And then of course in VYNDAQEL what \u2013 how that change between diagnosis and treatment can evolve over time? Angela Hwang : Great. Thank you. I think in all the I&I areas, what we're dealing with here are very complex diseases, chronic diseases, where there is a tremendous amount of debilitation for our patients and a lot of suffering. So I think first and foremost, I think both RA and atopic derm share that. But maybe the difference that I see the greatest between the two is that RA is a pretty well-established disease for whom \u2013 even at the time when we launched Xeljanz right there was a lot of treatment, there was a lot of biologics, there was not an oral, but there was a lot of biologics. That in fact is quite different, when we think about where we are with atopic derm in that \u2013 in the atopic derm today, there are just not great treatments. We talked earlier today about -- in the opening about the systemic treatment, right? There's a lot of use of steroids. There is a Dupixent that has been a great solution for many patients. But even with all of that there's just not a lot of solutions at all. And today there is still a high -- there is really a significant unmet need in terms of what patients are being able to do. So I think with all market development with all new treatments, it takes time for you to reach peak. But we believe that given the significant unmet need and in particular for atopic derm patients where I think typically we've been focused on skin clearing, but what we also know for patients is that the number one condition they're suffering from is providers. And that when you have agents that can really resolve that and resolve that very quickly, it will open up opportunities that didn't previously exist before in AD. So that's how I see the market. I think we're really excited about it. We see a great ability to really meet patient unmet needs and that is going to drive our growth. Your second question was around Vyndaqel and how to think about diagnosis versus the people that receive the drug. And I think on this regard what you should expect to see is there will be some gap right? So between those who are diagnosed, there is always a difference between those that are diagnosed and those who are deemed eligible to receive treatment. And then there is a difference between -- or a gap then the next step that you have to take is for those that are treated how many of them actually get the prescription and receive a prescription. And I think that actually on that front we've been doing rather well. This quarter in Q3, 82% of those who were deemed treatment eligible were able to receive a Vyndaqel prescription. And that is in fact up from last quarter where it was actually 78% of those who were deemed eligible for treatment received a script. So the gap is not all that wide and we've seen improvements from last quarter to this one. So I think along the entire patient funnel for Vyndaqel we have great opportunities to improve how the patient flows on diagnosis to treatment, treatment to receiving a script, receiving a script to actually getting the medicines in the hands through specialty pharmacy. It's still a new condition and one that's early in its launch, so I think that we have great opportunities to improve every step of the way. Thank you. Chuck Triano : Great. Thanks for the comments, Angela Hwang. Next question please operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen. Steve Scala : Thank you. Albert with all due respect, could you please be absolutely clear whether the 32 events have been reached already? It seems that the answer is, yes, Pfizer has the 32 events otherwise I think you would say no. And on to the DMD gene therapy, will Phase 3 start this year? And has Pfizer and FDA agreed on a potency assay? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Yes. Steve, I appreciate the curiosity and I appreciate the creativity and everybody can try every possible angle, but I think I have answered this as fully as we are prepared. Now you used a very creative way of asking, so I will tell you clearly, no, we don't have the 32 events right now. So that's what I can say. So -- and I have to say, I backtracked can you remind me what was the second part of the question? Chuck Triano : Yes question was in DMD has the FDA agreed on a potency assay? Albert Bourla : Mikael, maybe you can take that? Mikael Dolsten : Absolutely. I think Steve you first asked will Phase 3 start this year. We expect and I believe Phase 3 will start this year and relatively soon. As you know the profile through modification of the steroid dose from one mg per kg to two mg per kg looks really great now. And Albert spoke in his introduction to the 19 treated boys, in which in the recent, after the steroid change we have had no cases with complement activation so we're very excited about the current plan. Now for the assay, yes, as part of our final protocol development with FDA, we changed from an initial inverted terminal repeat methodology to a transient method as suggested by FDA along with the weight of the patients to determine those. And that's all in place and made the initial dose of what was expressed as 3E14 go down to the 2E14. It's the very same dose that we use all the time. It's just that the different assay gives a different readout. But all of that is in place. We have a terrific technology platform that I think is the leading in this field how to measure the various endpoints including the concentration of the virus gene therapy. Chuck Triano : Great. Thanks, Mikael. Thanks for the question Steve. Let\u2019s move to our next question please operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Tim Anderson : Thank you. I have a non-COVID question, which is following the initial news where, you said, you spin at Upjohn, you described the company is likely to pay less of its free cash back to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. And I'm wondering, if that's still the current view, especially, if you can achieve the revenue growth targets you've given of at least 6% over the next several years. And that question ties into another question on M&A. What's the upper limit on the size of the deals you might be considering? Should we assume these will likely be sub-$10 billion transactions? Or are larger deals also potentially on the table? Albert Bourla : Thank you, Tim for asking a non-COVID question. Appreciate it really. And also it came at the time that I thought Frank will not have a chance to speak, but now we are giving him the exact right forum. So Frank, take it from here. Frank D'Amelio: Thank you, Albert. And Tim thanks for the question. So on M&A, we always say we never say never because one of the nice things about being part of Pfizer is we have the firepower to pretty much do any kind of a deal we want and I think we've been able to demonstrate that in the past. So I wouldn't limit us or cap us on some specific dollar amount given the firepower that we have. Albert mentioned earlier, our focus has been mid-phase, Phase II, Phase III kind of things that would impact our revenue base 2024, 2025, 2026. But in terms of capacity quite frankly, we're very much unlimited, strong balance street, strong capital structure, strong investment grade. We generate lots of operating cash flow. So we're in a very good position quite frankly to be very proactive as we need to be on M&A. And then in terms of your Upjohn question. From my perspective, we get the Upjohn deal done. We form Viatris. We're going to get $12 billion in cash. Our intent with that $12 billion in cash is to pay down debt given we're transferring give or take about $4 billion of EBITDA to Upjohn. But our capital deployment priorities don't change as a result of that transaction. We'll still return capital to our shareholders as we have been doing. We'll continue to invest in the business and our pipeline obviously and capital and then we'll continue to invest in M&A. So from my perspective capital priorities don't change. And in terms of M&A capacity, we're fortunate enough where we really have lots of capacity and lots of firepower. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Frank. Thanks, Tim. And we move to our next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Randall Stanicky from RBC Capital Markets. Randall Stanicky : Great. Thanks. Albert, you guys -- can you talk about the post EUA or post-approval plan around communicating safety data to the public on the -- your vaccine just to get people more comfortable? Because one of the concerns is going to be the percent of people willing to take a vaccine earlier maybe lower than it had been in previous months. And obviously, those numbers should be higher to get the herd immunity? And then a second question for Frank. Going back to the enabling-function costs you guys called out in January $4.5 billion there. Maybe just help frame that for us. How much of those savings have you already realized? How quickly can you realize additional savings in 2021? Just trying to understand the margin opportunity there. Thanks. Albert Bourla : Yes. Let me take the first before I pass it to Frank. And actually I will ask the help of Angela here also in answering this question. I do see because we are launching the polls and also I speak to people, my neighbors, my friends and I do see that there is some skepticism that has been mainly because of the politicization of the vaccine. So this is real and I think we need to address it. But we started addressing it long time back. We are doing for this disease -- for this vaccine things that we have never done before. And those are first of all things that have to do with transparency. We have published our protocol. We have -- we are publishing real-time our Phase I data to our community and the public, but also the other scientists and the other companies that are developing COVID vaccines can see them and learn from them. We have announced the first results of our pivotal study unblinded data, of course, on the safety. We signed a pledge, but make very clear to the world that we are going to follow the high ethical and quality standards. And we will continue being very transparent and very quality science-driven, which I think it is the best way to overcome the public's opinion. So by the way, we didn't even take money from the government. So to make sure that Pfizer will stay out of the politics. And this vaccine at our risk -- financial risk would not be characterized as the Republican vaccine or the Democratic vaccine. It's not -- it is a vaccine for the world that we are developing. Now going forward, I think, we will do also -- will continue doing things. Our safety data according to the FDA will be reviewed publicly by an advisory committee so that will be another additional good step. As for transparency, Angela you want also to add a few things that we are planning to do? Angela Hwang : Sure. Well, over and above what Albert said, obviously, having clear public education and a well-supported public education effort is going to be critical, right? We need to educate the public on the importance of actually getting the vaccine and then of course, around the safety processes and creating confidence around the development process that has gone into developing these vaccines. And so this happens sort of at two levels : first is about how Pfizer is working through intermediaries and opinion leaders to provide this education; and then secondly what we can do ourselves.  So on the first front, we have already been and are continuing our efforts to work with industry partners, patient organizations, government and other public health institutions to share with them our expertise, so that they can create and build content and also deliver education as they need. So just as I said, this is well underway. There's a multichannel approach. That includes ETC and these experts are already deploying a wide range of channels and forms of communication to educate and to educate specific communities. On the other hand for us, once we have authorization and once we have a label, we'll be able to do additional communication and more education around our vaccine specifically. We also recognize that of course, there are certain communities that have been minority communities specifically that have been more affected by this disease than others, so we're also supporting the development of specific content and education that can more effectively reach these communities and be more customized with sort of the approach and the content that we are sharing. So this is a very big effort that is already underway and I think you're going to see more and more of this build-up towards the end of the year. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Angela. And before I ask Frank to take the question about cost of enabling functions, I would like also Mikael to comment about our pharmacovigilance program that we have put in place and how that also could play a significant role in ensuring about the vaccine's safety. Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : Thank you, Albert. So we have the pharmacovigilance platform in the industry that has experience to handle the largest number of the adverse event reporting by far. And we have started very proactively and been in open dialogue with the operation with speed and FDA about putting this pharmacovigilance platform to play, to monitor sophisticated participant whether viewing a potential EUA and later approval. And that includes building control cohorts already now for understanding continuous disease reporting of what we expect to be the first group of responders such as health care workers and first-line responders.  We also recognize the big need for many stakeholders from pharmacists, nurses, patients, physicians to have access to rapid information. We have a very strong medical information platform across the globe and we have now augmented it both with staff and with self-serving Webex platform to be able to respond to many aspects of how we store, distribute the vaccine and expected so far mild to moderate tolerability et cetera seen with this vaccine and similar vaccines. So I think we feel we are very well prepared for that. Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael. Now Frank, back to you. Frank D'Amelio: Yes. And Randall the way I'll do this let me run some numbers and provide some I'll call it financial context. And then I'll drill down and I'll answer your question. So just first on SI&A because you're talking about the enabling function so on SI&A for the quarter we were $2.87 billion. We were down 10% year-over-year. It was really driven by three things : on the consumer separations, which was give or take about half the reduction; reduced spending in enabling functions; and some of it was COVID-driven. I called that out because a piece of that is enabling functions, which was probably what triggered the question.  Now let me run the overall numbers and then I'll drill down and answer the question. So our previous guidance on SI&A for the year was $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion. We tightened the range to $11.5 billion to $12 billion and that was really driven by COVID savings because obviously we knew about consumer, we had enabling function spending already in our plan. So it was really driven primarily by COVID spending. Then of that $11.5 billion to $12 billion, I think $4 billion to $4.5 billion is the enabling functions, which is now getting to your question.  The way I think about this is you look at that $4 billion to $4.5 billion as an either/or an expense-to-revenue ratio of the total company as it exists today and the new company when we're a smaller company because of the revenues that move to Viatris. We want that expense-to-revenue ratio to be the same or less than what it currently is today. So that's kind of a simple way to think about how we're thinking about this and how we are planning in terms of what to do with our enabling functions. Then the question you asked was Frank, you asked me a pacing question. In terms of 2021, '22, we'll obviously go as fast as we can and get as much of it as we can into 2021. Obviously, some of it will fall into 2022 just because of the nature of some of the places where we do business and certain things taking more time than others. And I'll provide more clarity on this when we provide our 2021 guidance including the SI&A guidance on our next earnings call. Randall Stanicky : Thank you, Frank. Chuck Triano : Sure. Get another question here please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys. This is Scott on for Geoff. Thanks for taking my question. You disclosed last quarter that the FDA indicated an AdCom meeting was not anticipated for tanezumab. But it seems like they want one now in March 2021, so that will push out the December PDUFA. So what changed? And maybe you can give us some more insight into your discussions with the FDA. And then, maybe as a follow-up, the assay itself wasn't highlighted as an assay with peak sales was from Investor Day. So what do you expect kind of internally peak sales upside to be here if you receive approval? Thanks. Albert Bourla : Angela, why don't you take those two? And then also, maybe Mikael can comment later on the discussion with FDA, but you first Angela. Angela Hwang : Sure. So, we are -- the tanezumab trial represents probably one of the biggest submissions that Pfizer has ever provided the FDA. Our data are extensive, and there's a lot to understand. So we're not surprised by the request to have an AdCom. And in fact we're looking forward to having this opportunity to really review and to discuss what we have seen in our data and in our clinical trials and to discuss this opportunity with the advisory committee. So, we see that as something that will create a good discussion. In terms of the way to look at the opportunity this is how we see it. This is really like many conditions, but this one in particular, a significant unmet need in the treatment of osteoarthritis. There are about 27 million Americans that suffer from this, 11 million of whom have moderate to severe OA. And in the U.S. 80% of those, moderate to severe OA patients, have already trialed and tried and failed three or more analgesics. So we know that these patients are unable today to achieve adequate pain relief. And so while there are options out there, what we also know is that the options are inadequate. And so when you look at the patient population that's ahead of us, the opportunity to provide a novel and a non-opioid form of pain relief, we think that this is the kind of opportunity that I think patients will be very interested in. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Angela. Mikael, anything to add about tanezumab filing, and FDA's request for advisory committee? Mikael Dolsten : I thought Angela answered great. Maybe I can add two things. As a potential first-in-class treatment, it's not uncommon for the FDA to hold an AdCom to discuss the submission. So in a way, it was expected. And of course, the discussion will be focused on those many patients that are not well controlled or unresponsive, not eligible who do not want to take any of the existing pain medication, and as an alternative to longer use of opioids, that's where the discussion will be. And as Angela said, we always welcome AdComs in order to share our experience and get external perspective. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael. Chuck, back to you. Chuck Triano : Thanks for the insight folks. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. David Risinger : Yes, thanks very much. So, I have one question for Albert and one for Frank. Albert thanks for the update today. Could you please define what you mean when you say you will disclose results when there is a conclusive readout? Does that mean interim efficacy success on the primary endpoint? Or does your definition of a conclusive readout include more than just the primary endpoint? And for Frank, regarding enabling functions, you've been talking about that for a couple of years, and my understanding is that, you've already been driving efficiencies in the corporate cost structure of Pfizer. So, could you just update us on where the run rate stands today versus the $4 billion to $4.5 billion you were discussing a couple of years ago? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you, David. My definition of conclusive result positive or negative, it is a futility or a demonstrated efficacy, readout in the primary endpoint. That's how things work. So, Frank? Frank D'Amelio: Yeah. Thanks Albert. So Dave, we have been reducing the enabling functions over the years, and that's obviously been reflected in the guidance that we've provided over the last year or two. That $4 billion to $4.5 billion should be thought of as a base for 2025. And obviously, we'll go to work on that base and we are going to work on that base as we move into 2021 and 2022. And the intent is obviously to generate -- to capture as much of those savings as we can, as quickly as we can. But the $4 billion to $4.5 billion think about that as the base that we'll come off of. Albert Bourla : All right. Thanks, Frank. And operator, can we take our last question for the call please. Thank you. Operator : Your final question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi. Andrew Baum : Thank you. A couple of questions. Firstly, out-of-pocket caps seem to have been proposed twice once by the Senate and then more recently by the President prior to the most favored nation executive Order. Thinking about VYNDAQEL and other high-priced small molecules obviously this could be very helpful to your business, if this comes to pass. Do you think there's a high probability that regardless of which administration out-of-pocket caps for Medicare patients is likely to feature as a central part of health care reform? And then second, just to clarify on COVID, the interim analysis. We're receiving questions from our clients repeatedly about the level of disclosure. Will it be a simple we met we look forward to sharing the data? Or do you actually disclose the data at the time the efficacy readout is given? Albert Bourla : Thank you, Andrew. Now about the out-of-pocket costs. Pfizer repeatedly and the industry as a whole has pointed out that right now the way that the insurance benefits are working is not sustainable anymore. Right now, the Americans pay out-of-pocket for their medicines likely they do not have insurance, although they do have and they took a very expensive likely very good assuming they didn't have to pay from their own pocket. So this is something that needs to change. And it seems like there is a general recognition both -- in both sides of the aisle. We will continue working with all and we hope that we will see a change in the design of these benefits that will reduce the cost that the Americans have to pay out-of-pocket when they go to collect their medicines. This is not something that needs to be done because it will help the financial bottom lines of the industry. This is because it needs to help the patients and the health care system cost in general. Right now the fact that some patients don't have the out-of-pocket to take their medicine as a result that we have significant numbers that they do not take their medicines, but medicines that are needed, medicines that have been prescribed by the physician. And as a result patients are ending up in the health care system in hospitals and they cause the health care system much more. So there is a need, any way you see it cost-wise or human paying-wise this needs to be reformed. Now in terms of COVID-19 and I think that was the last question that we have today. So it looks like it's going to be a COVID-19 in the last question. I think right now we are planning to as always these things to have a press release that we'll speak about top line met the endpoint or not. And then of course, we plan to publish data in a peer review magazine so that they will be all available. But keep in mind that once we submit data, if things goes according to plan by the third, fourth week of November there'll be also -- I think they plan to make them public during the AdCom, advisory committee that they will have. So I think that concludes our call, Chuck isn't it? Chuck Triano : That's correct. Albert back to you for closing remarks. Albert Bourla : Yes. So I just want to thank all of you for joining us today, of course your continued engagement with Pfizer. As you just heard, our continued strong performance speaks to the resiliency of our business and the strength of our portfolio, the ingenuity and the resolve of our people and I think the power of our products. As we indicated during our Investor Day, we are very confident in our pipeline. We like its breadth, we like its depth and we will continue to be opportunistic about bringing in additional promising assets where appropriate. Now we need to continue to execute and deliver for patients. Of course, we continue to monitor global economies related to COVID impact. COVID is affecting not only our business  to quantify the opportunity today to us. But if we try to quantify the opportunity what it's doing to the global economy, we are speaking about 3 years. And now it has become more obvious than any time that many things need to be done to control this pandemic. Vaccines are expected if successful to play a key role to become a very important tool. We are working very diligently. I understand and appreciate your interest that became very obvious. I just ask everybody to be a little bit patient. So -- and we all cross our fingers that science would win. Thank you very much everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Pfizer's third quarter 2020 earnings conference call.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to Pfizer's fourth-quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Chuck Triano : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today to review Pfizer's fourth-quarter and full-year 2020 financial results, our 2021 financial guidance, as well as other relevant business topics. I'm joined today as usual by our Chairman and CEO, Dr. Albert Bourla; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research, Development, and Medical; Angela Hwang, Group President, Biopharmaceuticals Group; John Young, our Chief Business Officer; and Doug Lankler, General Counsel. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. 2020 was a year like none other in Pfizer\u2019s history. With the separation of Upjohn complete, we saw the culmination of Pfizer\u2019s decade-long conversion into a pure-play, science and innovation-focused Company. Through our collaboration with BioNTech, we delivered the world\u2019s first breakthrough COVID-19 vaccine in less than a year. And by harnessing the power of the variety of digital capabilities, we made sure that despite the lockdowns and travel restrictions, we continue to serve patients around the world who rely on our medicines and vaccines. Despite this challenging environment and the incredible amount of resources we devoted to develop a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine, we generated 8% operational revenue growth for the year from our core biopharmaceutical product portfolio, excluding the revenue impact from consumer healthcare and excluding $154 million in sales of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine that we recorded in the fourth quarter. Keep in mind that this 8% operational growth includes a negative 2% impact due to the slowdown in macroeconomic and healthcare activity resulting from the pandemic. This operational growth was driven primarily by continued strong performances from Vyndaqel/Vyndamax, Eliquis, Oncology Biosimilars, Ibrance, Prevenar 13 outside of the U.S., Inlyta, Xeljanz, and Xtandi, so basically all the growth drivers contributed significantly. Frank D\u2019Amelio: Thanks, Albert. Good day, everyone. I know you've seen our release, so let me provide a few highlights regarding the financials. We again saw a very solid revenue growth for the business in the quarter and the year, which continues to support our projected 6%-plus revenue CAGR through the end of 2025. As a reminder, this growth projection excludes any contribution from the COVID vaccine. In terms of the price and volume mix for the year, the grow up of the 8% operational growth we posted, excluding consumer healthcare and the COVID vaccine, our underlying Biopharmaceuticals portfolio generated 10% volume growth, offset by a negative 2% price impact. So, continued very strong volume overall. Foreign exchange had a slightly positive impact on revenue in the quarter with a 1% benefit for the full year, while for the full year, we saw an overall negative impact of 1%. So, 1% positive for the quarter, 1% negative for the full year. Now, moving down the income statement. Adjusted gross margins were lower in the quarter, mainly due to the negative impact of foreign exchange, product mix and unfavorable year-over-year impact of cash flow hedging on inventory and COVID-related expenses. However, it's important to note that on an annual basis, adjusted gross margin for 2020 was within 90 basis points of 2019 and around 80%. Adjusted SI&A expenses in the quarter were lower by 2% on an operational basis and lower by 10% on an annual basis. There remain two main factors that drive the decrease for the year, the exclusion of consumer health and lower selling expenses due to COVID, and to a lesser extent, the early implementation of a planned reduction in spending associated with our corporate-enabling functions. Adjusted R&D expenses grew 24% in the quarter and 15% for the year on an operational basis. This growth was primarily driven by our investment in developing the COVID-19 vaccine. Reported diluted EPS for the quarter was up significantly compared to the prior year quarter, mainly driven by lower asset impairment charges compared to the year ago quarter. For the year, reported earnings were lower, mainly due to the non-recurrence of the gain on the consumer joint venture formation in 2019. And adjusted diluted EPS grew 17% for the quarter and 20% for the year on an operational basis. I'd add that our full year adjusted diluted EPS was $2.22, which is below the range of $2.28 to $2.38 we had given in terms of new Pfizer financials on a full year basis. I just want to remind you that we had indicated on last quarter's earnings call that our actual reported numbers would be lower than the guidance because the guidance assumed full year of operating without Upjohn as well as assuming a full year benefit of transitional service agreement recoveries and lower interest expenses from the deployment of the $12 billion in proceeds to pay down debt. So with the deal not closing until November, we only had a small benefit from these factors in our reported 2020 financials. Now, let's move to our 2021 guidance. We provided total Company guidance, which includes the COVID vaccine, and then we provided some additional sub-ledger detail on our assumptions regarding the projected COVID vaccine contribution, so you can also get a read on the business out. In terms of revenue, we are projecting a range of $59.4 billion to $61.4 billion, which includes a foreign exchange benefit of approximately $1.4 billion. And at the guidance range midpoint represents operational growth of 41% from 2020. For adjusted cost of goods, the range is 32% to 33% as a percentage of revenue, which incorporates the COVID vaccine, gross profit share payment to BioNTech, as well as some other related items I will speak to in a moment. On a side end, what we see is the impact of increased sales and marketing expense behind key growth brands as well as for expected product launches, led by our enabling function, cost savings. In addition, we see growth in R&D, which follows along with our pipeline development cadence. And I note, given our clinical trial success metrics Albert referenced, we're confident about making sound R&D investments. Adjusted other income and deductions is projected at just over $2 billion of income. In addition to the usual items included here, remind you for modeling purpose that three larger items in terms of income are our GSK consumer healthcare joint venture equity income, ViiV dividend income and transition service agreement recoveries, primarily related to Viatris. Working this through with our projected 15% tax rate yield and adjusted diluted EPS range of $3.10 to $3.20 with 38% operational growth at the midpoint. This range is a bit higher than what we discussed three weeks ago and was driven mainly by an increase in our COVID vaccine sales projections since then. Let me offer some assumptions and context on the projected COVID vaccine financial contribution and our collaboration agreement. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine collaboration construct is a 50-50 gross profit split. Pfizer will book the vast majority of the global collaboration revenue, except for Germany and Turkey, and we do not participate in China. We continue to expect that we can manufacture up to 2 billion doses in 2021. However, given it\u2019s still early in the year, we are not projecting that we will sell all those doses. Ultimately, we made contract of all the doses, but for the purposes for our initial guidance, we primarily included doses that are covered by strong supply agreements with various governments. On this, we currently forecast approximately $15 billion in COVID vaccine revenue, as which is what you see here. Given we remain in negotiations for additional contracts, we are not providing the number of doses behind the revenue estimate. Our cost of sales for the COVID vaccine revenue will include manufacturing and distribution costs, a royalty payment allowance as well as a payment to BioNTech, representing the 50% gross profit split. All-in, this yields an anticipated income before tax COVID vaccine in the high 20% range. Let me add that if we contract for additional -- if we contract with the delivery of additional doses during the year, we will provide a guidance update in our subsequent earnings releases. If we remove the projected COVID vaccine contribution and related impacts on revenue, that results in our business having 2021 projected annual revenue between $44.4 billion and $46.6 billion. So, 6% operational revenue growth at the midpoint, and about 8% if we include the current favorable impact of foreign exchange compared to last year. In terms of adjusted cost of goods, net of the COVID vaccine, we see a range between 21% and 22% as a percentage of revenues. For adjusted diluted EPS, we see a range of $2.50 to $2.60, which represents 11% operational growth at the midpoint. These growth rates are all consistent with how we've been publicly positioning the business subsequent to the Upjohn separation. In terms of reporting our quarterly earnings, we are not going to report two sets of financials, one with COVID and one without. But, I think the context in terms of the vaccine margins will be helpful in calculating a good estimate of the adjusted diluted EPS impact, based on the COVID vaccine revenue, we will report in future earnings releases. Let me speak for a moment about our dividend going forward and how it will initially be linked to the Viatris dividend once it is declared. To make it simple, let's start with Pfizer's current annualized dividend rate of $1.56 per share. A Pfizer shareholder owning 100 shares just prior to the spin-off, would now still own their 100 shares of Pfizer and also 12 shares of Viatris, assuming they have continued to hold the Viatris shares. The 100 shares of Pfizer would generate $156 in annual dividend income. And currently, the 12 shares of Viatris do not generate any dividend income. This $156 in annual dividend income is what we will preserve. Once Viatris declares its dividend, we will calculate the annual income generated by the 12 shares of Viatris, and then adjust the Pfizer dividend, so the combined annual income generated from the 100 shares of Pfizer and 12 shares of Viatris, totals at least that $156 in 2021. For the foreseeable future, we expect our Board to continue to support annual dividend increases at approximately this year's level. Obviously, we have no say as to what Viatris does with its future dividend. I hope this example is helpful. In summary, we had a strong 2020. The separation of Upjohn is behind us. The business is on track for solid top and bottom line growth. And we are highly focused on advancing our pipeline, supporting and market brands, and looking to deploy capital responsibly with a focus on initiatives that can solidify our long-term revenue and earnings growth. With that, I'll turn it back to Chuck. Chuck Triano : Great. Thank you, Frank and Albert for the prepared remarks. Operator, at this point, can we please poll for questions? Thank you. Operator :  Your first question comes from the line of David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. David Risinger : Thanks very much. So first of all, congrats on the phenomenal vaccine progress and the benefits that Pfizer is driving for society. That's much appreciated by everyone on this call and beyond. My two questions relate to vaccine prospects and Xeljanz. So, first, could you speak to how you are projecting vaccine sales for ? Dr. Albert Bourla : David, unfortunately, you are cutting off and I couldn't hear you. Can you repeat the question of the vaccine from the beginning? David Risinger : Dr. Albert Bourla : Unfortunately, the line is not good, David. We can't hear you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Scala from Cowen. Steve Scala : Thank you. I have two questions. In what scenarios would you not sell all 2 billion doses of COVID vaccine Pfizer can manufacture in 2021? Some competitors haven't exactly exceeded expectations, and only a small fraction of global demand has been satisfied to date. So, it seems as though you'll sell every dose you make and that the current guidance is going to be way low. Second question is on the Xeljanz CV study, should we assume DVT tracked similarly to MACE? And given that Pfizer has other JAKs in development, what do you believe are the long-term implications for the JAK class overall given this recent Xeljanz CV study? Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Steve. Let me take the COVID one, and then I will ask Mikael to comment on the Xeljanz first part, and then Angela on the implications from commercial. Steve, we try not to give a low expectation, we try to give a responsible expectation. If we are asking if there is a scenario that we will sell everything, yes, there is. Also, I would tell you that if that was an open market, which means that the physicians and citizens, they have the ability to choose which vaccine they would receive, I would feel very comfortable that we will have the lion market share because we are first and we are best, as you have clearly indicated. And we have great operations in basically every country in the world. But, this is not an open market, at least for this year. This year, it is a market that it is controlled by governments appropriately because I think we are in a crisis, as you know. And also, it is a market that creates a lot of political pressure. So, not always the decisions are sound, solid, and avoiding panic. So, with that in mind, we have a formula that we try to implement in a responsible way that takes into consideration the contracts that we have, the potential for future contracts, but also takes into consideration the strength of the contracts, takes into consideration the potential for other vaccines to present data. And in fact, the reason why we changed our revenue projections, which resulted in $0.10 improvement in our bottom line, is because we did have more news from the AstraZeneca registration and the way that it is perceived in Europe. We had the news from the J&J that reported data. We have much better visibility now in the last two weeks on their manufacturing capabilities, all of that resulted in us increasing our projections. Clearly, there are a lot -- this is a multidimensional, let's say, challenge to have accurate projections. And clearly, we are having dynamic changes, which we will follow, and we will update our estimates as time comes. But, in all honesty, I couldn't responsibly just say right now, we are going to sell everything we can make, the 2 billion, when we have all this dynamic situation that it is evolving. Now, why don't we move to Mikael to talk a little bit about the MACE, on Xeljanz, and then Angela on the revenue expectations. Mikael Dolsten : Yes. Thank you, Albert, and Steve, for the questions. As you know, the 1133 study for Xeljanz was rather unique population with increased severe risk. Now, Xeljanz has been studied in numerous clinical trials and in the market where a large population has used it in a more general RA population or in ulcerative colitis. And in those populations, it has had a very robust efficacy to safety profile. I think, RA by itself has more CV liabilities, standard RA patients, and this was a very specific subset. Now, going to other JAK inhibitors, the next generation of JAK inhibitors such as abrocitinib in registration for atopic dermatitis, or as Albert reported, ritlecitinib, which is a unique JAK3/TEC inhibitor, each JAK inhibitor differs by itself. And we think both of these two that I mentioned have very encouraging benefit to risk profile. And while regulatory agencies have, in some instances, inferred general class-label across JAKs, I think the experience will tell that abrocitinib for atopic dermatitis has a very compelling efficacy and risk profile and ritlecitinib for alopecia that's reading out later this year or for vitiligo and ulcerative colitis where we have very encouraging Phase 2 data, again, has a unique profile. So, I don't think that we should extend 1133 to other JAKs, and I think we\u2019ll also need to look at Xeljanz having a very robust profile in population that was not a smaller version of the 1133 study. Thank you very much. Angela Hwang : Thanks, Mikael. And then, just building off of what Mikael has said. As you know, we have a very robust data set that has been built around Xeljanz for over seven years, 50 different clinical trials, 260,000 patients that are currently on Xeljanz, and of course, a very robust real-world data set that goes along with these 260,000 patients. So, I think based on all of this and together with the fact that we are still so early on in our understanding of the 1133 data as it pertains to Xeljanz that we feel confident that Xeljanz will remain an important part of the treatment paradigm for RA patients and for patients with PsA and UC as well, and that it has an appropriate and favorable benefit risk profile for this sort of patient population type. And so, of course, we will share the data with you as we continue to learn more about the study. But for now, that's how we see it. And then, I think you had one more question in terms of how do we think about this in terms of impact on our other JAKs. And as Mikael said, scientifically, each one of these molecules are very different. And they're all being designed with a different benefit risk profile to match the different disease condition as well as the different patient types. And so, I think as a result, we continue to be very confident about our JAK portfolio and the investments that we're making in each one of these. And we think that what we will be able to deliver are differentiated profiles that will be appropriate and fit-for-purpose for that condition and for that patient type. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert from Truist Securities. Gregg Gilbert : Thank you. Albert, it seems pretty clear that Pfizer, the stock anyway is not getting a whole lot of credit for the COVID-19 vaccine. And whether or not you agree that that's fair, I'm curious how you expect to leverage the expertise you've built in this area into areas that investors might view as contributing more to long-term franchise value, regardless of what happens to the COVID-19 part of the story. And then, a second vaccine-related question perhaps for Angela. There's been a lot of focus on your vaccine and others about logistics and supply and coverage of variance. But, it seems to me that at some point, a key metric, if not the most important metric will be how many people want to get a vaccine. So, curious what your work tells you on that front, and whether you plan to get involved as a company in helping drive awareness and demand at some point, or is that not really Pfizer's role to play? Dr. Albert Bourla : Gregg, thank you very much. I fully agree with you, but I don't think we're receiving a lot of credit, not for the vaccines right now when you see the stock price, but mainly for our basic business and pipeline. This is business that is growing 6% and double-digit, the bottom line, excluding any COVID. And it clearly deserves much, much higher multiple in this industry. The same comes even more when you speak about the COVID-19 vaccine. But, I think, clearly, people should see much more into that. So, to your question, how do we plan to use strategically this platform? I believe that the RNA technology has been proven in a glorious way that will have an impact in treating diseases, in preventing diseases in multiple applications. And I believe Pfizer has accumulated expertise and knowledge of a decade into one year. And also Pfizer has completed infrastructure investments that would take five years, again, into one year. So clearly, we plan to use this expertise so that we will be able to benefit more and more patients. I made some comments that within the COVID vaccine, I believe that COVID is -- the dynamics in the COVID more and more indicate the potential, but we will have a clearly repeated business. The reasons for that are multiple. Let me start by saying, in the beginning, we were waiting to see if the immunity will be durable. Now, we still don't have data about the immunity of our vaccine because it is early, but we do see that the people that have the disease, more and more publications indicate that after several months, the immune response goes down. So, there is a need to boost. Also, there are a lot of papers that have been published that indicate even for the new variants that if you have very high level of immune responses, you are protecting against those values in much higher level than if you have lower levels of these antibodies. So, that indicates that the need to boost or that maintain much higher levels, it's there. And last but not least, it is clear that the scenario that the variants will develop in such a way that they may be escaping very effective protection from the current vaccine, which is not the case right now for us. Then, we\u2019re clearly preparing ourselves so that we will produce in a very speedy time and made publicly a statement that that needs to be done end-to-end in less than 100 days to provide new booster vaccines that will protect against the new variant. So, in scenarios like that and even in scenarios that the COVID will move from a pandemic into more of a normal type of vaccination business, it is very clear that Pfizer will have a key advantage, not only because of the strength of the data, but also because we have developed significant brand equity and trust with the people when it comes to their choice. We have infrastructure and expertise that will help us. RNA is not going to provide only COVID-19 vaccines. We are accelerating our work for flu right now. And we are clearly investigating multiple other applications in other vaccines for this RNA technology or therapeutic areas. So, I believe that our business, excluding COVID, is very robust with robust pipeline. But I think COVID has a very good chance that could completely transform the revenue and earnings trajectory of this business starting from now. And with that, I will ask Angela to comment on the question about, again, the COVID vaccine. Angela? Angela Hwang : Thanks for the question. And I think, what you're talking about is vaccine confidence, which clearly has been a big topic since the vaccine was introduced. And I'm actually really encouraged by data that we're receiving on a routine basis that is demonstrating that vaccine confidence is indeed building, and that compared to where we were even a month ago, we've had a significant rise in interest and willingness of the public to get vaccinated. And I think, a lot of this is driven, obviously, by real-world experience by many people who are now getting the vaccine and having good experiences with them. So, I think that this will continue. To your question about what is it that we're doing to drive awareness and demand? I think, first of all, we have to understand that right now, we are in a period where we are operating under an EUA, the emergency approval. So, there is guardrail as it pertains to that and what it is that we can do. For sure, we have worked very diligently with many, many, many medical and public health societies and institutions to ensure that we are supporting education across the entire country. There recently was even a public service announcement that was launched where it had our support in conjunction with a number of patient advocacy groups to really educate and to create confidence for the public around this vaccine. In addition to that, at a more specific level, Pfizer uniquely has really supported the healthcare professional community in its vaccination by providing a lot of training, a lot of support to ensure that confidence is gained at the vaccination side. And actually, just to share that over 30,000 HCPs have been trained by Pfizer alone in the recent month or so to be able to confidently vaccinate these -- vaccinate people. And I think that that's also helping to create confidence. But, of course, where we can get most involved and we'll be able to do even more, is once we receive BLA. And so, we're working towards that. And we will build on the education initiatives that we already have in place, but we'll be able to amplify that even more, once we have a full label. Thank you. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Angela. And good point on the BLA opening up more opportunities. Next question, please, operator? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn : Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. And thank you for all the work you\u2019re doing, again, on the COVID vaccine. I was just wondering is there an integrated system that's being set up by either the government -- or governments or Pfizer to monitor instances of vaccine, breakthroughs and conduct sequencing. And then, what factors and who will ultimately dictate when a change in the potential of vaccine is needed to cover an emerging variant? How does the consensus emerge on that question? Thank you. Dr. Albert Bourla : Yes. Mikael, would you like to take this question, please? Mikael Dolsten : Yes. There are different organized, at the government levels, efforts. In the U.S., the position of sequences both to track new strains, like the South Africa and Brazil, as well among unvaccinated and vaccinated or deposited in certain databases. There is one initiative in UK. And then, of course, Pfizer has the unique collaboration in real-world evidence with Israeli ministers of health which will allow us to track first real-world evidence for our vaccine in the population. And as you may know, we are the number one to have such data that shows 92% to 95% in real-world evidence vaccine efficacy, primarily seen initially in an older population. That's harder normally to get this stunning data. And it also showed a very low, 0.25 about for both -- 24 and 26 for first and second injection of adverse events. So, really well-performing in a large population of millions of individuals. And of course, that will also track if there are breakthrough infections. Now, in general, I think, it has been claimed that South African and Brazil variants are more difficult-to-treat. And vaccines that have lower antibody levels will have much more breakthroughs, given that the mRNA vaccines have a high antibody levels. And that was, I think, implied in Albert's answer. We expect them to be much more resistant to breakthroughs for a longer time. And I think, data from several labs shows that if you maintain with mRNA vaccines, high antibody levels, you will actually protect very well even against those variants. And that suggests -- and we are just embarking on such studies that you could boost with the current vaccine, a further time and avoid some of these breakthrough infections that were reported recently in some vaccine studies. That would be our aspiration to demonstrate that by keeping individuals with very high titers, you can really impact. And that can be recorded, as you asked in various systems that are now in place in many countries. And that could be a very important way to transit into a more sustained protection, sustained business model where the moderating allows you to plan when the next boost should happen. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Louise Chen from Cantor. Louise Chen : So, my first question is, if the COVID vaccine becomes routine, how do you think governments and physicians will choose amongst these different vaccines that have received emergency use authorization? And then, how do you think about that 95% efficacy rate in light of mutations? And the last question is on your PCV20, if it's approved, what do you expect the ACIP recommendation to be your -- what would you ideally like it to be? And, do you think there will be any upgrade for those 65-plus due to additional serotypes? Dr. Albert Bourla : Why don't we start with PCV20, Angela, and then we can come back to COVID. Angela? Angela Hwang : Sure. So, in terms of PCV20, I mean, what we believe our value there is the additional serotype and that in the adult, these additional serotypes are meaningful because it will give us 33% more protection against strains causing IPD in adults, and 42% more protection against strains causing IPD for pediatrics. So, we feel that this is very value-creating and provides us the opportunity to really bring an important option into the market that is an upgrade compared to what it is that we have today. And then, to your question about ACIP, of course, we're working closely with the FDA for approval, and with the CDC at the right moments in time to get the right recommendation. We believe that the recommendation will be positive as it pertains to PCV20, and we look forward to working with them to achieve that. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Now, as regards to the how people could choose or physicians could choose if that is a routine. I believe that if this is a routine, the decision will come as with all other vaccines and medicines, the strength of the data. I think that this is why I made before the comments that given that we are first could mean that we are vaccinating a lot of people right now with the first doses. Given that we have such a strong safety and efficacy and database in an open choice situation, we will get the vast majority of the share of choices. But, I think, we'll come reality, likely after in 2022, when the governments do their whole vaccination scheme. And also in that year, there will be ample, I believe, capacity. So, volume will not be a case, even if everyone wants to get one vaccine, I think, will be enough to make this one vaccine. What about the 95% efficacy in terms of variants? I think, we answered that. But, Mikael, maybe you want to reiterate once more why the higher the efficacy, the better it\u2019s, not only for the current, but also for the variants. Mikael Dolsten : Yes, very brief. It's clear from convalescent plasma studies that\u2019s now the last couple of weeks, been out and also from plasma from vaccine recipient, higher antibody levels seems to protect from variants in the preclinical studies from patients. So, I think, it will project into the vaccines with high antibody levels and T-cell immunity, which are an additional protection mechanism, will do very well against variants and keep boosting them, will keep the variants off the population for a longer time before there is any need to shift to variant selective. So, I think, the data we have with mRNA vaccine put them really in a unique category, having the strong immune response, the ability to boost and the ability to, if needed, reconfigure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore. Umer Raffat : I want to hit up on two different topics. One, as we think about possible new vaccine for the new variants, do you guys have plans in place? Are you working on it right now? Should we anticipate some sort of Phase 1 data by some point in this early summer? And, has there been a consideration to allocate some of this 2 billion in doses capacity to a new version of vaccine? And separately, going back to the Phase 3 you reported, it's been a few weeks. And, one of the questions I've had is, of the patients that tested positive on the vaccine, post dose two, what did we learn about what mutations those patients had on deep sequencing? What did we learn about their NAb titers and T cells? And I wonder if there's anything we can draw on correlate of protection. Thank you. Dr. Albert Bourla : Umer, very, very good, excellent questions. Mikael, do you want to take the last one and also the first one, and then I can speak then later on the manufacturing piece. Mikael Dolsten : Yes. With variants, we are embarking on a study, which will give a boost after 6 months, and possibly also compared with a 12-month dose, we'll compare the wild type, the current vaccine with a variant vaccine, likely based on the 484, I mean from Brazil and South Africa. I think that given the data are so strong with our vaccine, as we alluded to, it may very well be that the third boost at the proper time point is sufficient, and you continue to monitor variant. But, we will be prepared, if needed with data, as you said, around early summer. Quality protection is something we're working with a lot of scientists, not just looking at data in our trial, but in public consortium with INH, looking at data across many trials, and we will see the outcome. I expect, again, high antibody levels, plus T cell immunity will provide the best durability. And that makes us very optimistic about the unique profile of mRNA vaccine. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael. And the 2 billion doses that we\u2019re speaking about, it is clearly for this current vaccine, and clearly also we are working to see if we can improve that even further. But, right now, we are at our commitment of 2 billion doses. But the reason why we had selected mRNA in the first place was because it simplifies tremendous of this type of process. Our ability with this technology to build a new construct of the same vaccine by just changing the RNA -- messenger RNA within this vaccine, it is really a very, very simple process in terms of manufacturing and in terms of actually developing it. Now, nothing is simple in biology, when you speak about high, complicated processes. But relatively to any other technology, this is very simple. So, I wouldn't say that I would anticipate a major -- if we have to go to a new vaccine, that we will have a major stake up in our manufacturing capacity. I think of around 2 billion doses, could be -- and maybe a little bit less if we start producing new vaccine, replace altogether the new variants, altogether, cumulatively new, and the old, if there is a need to do a new. Operator : Your next question comes from the line Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink. Geoffrey Porges : And unfortunately, we'll continue a little bit on this thing. Mikael, could you give us a sense of whether you think the so-called South African and Brazilian variants that have similar mutations, represent terminal or near-terminal adaptations of the virus, or do you think that we will see sort of almost recurring and infinite adaptations that we may have to contemplate adapting the vaccines too? And then, secondly, have you contemplated giving a single dose of vaccine to those who previously been infected, given what's probably 20% to 25% antibody positivity in the U.S. population? And lastly, could your next-gen variant vaccine be refrigerator stable? Thanks. Dr. Albert Bourla : Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : Yes. Thank you. Yes, the first strains like the UK strain was mainly selected for transmissibility to spread quickly. As there were previously infected people in South Africa and Brazil, the new strains have been selected for immune escape, which is the 484; I mean that is the most important. High antibody titers, as alluded to before, from our vaccine seems still to be able to react quite nicely with that strain, although at somewhat more moderate reduction. And we think keeping high titer up in patients will be a very good carry forward approach, until there is a need for a strain change. Now with that concept, the up high antibody titer, you should immunize whether you have had infection or not twice. That gives you maximum titer and allows you to fight off variant strains for as long time as possible before you may need a boost, or after some time that there may be any reason to a variant vaccine, as Albert alluded to. And, we are currently initiating study to understand when a third immunization would be helpful for participants, and we will be studying 6 to 12 months as initial assumption. And, of course, we continue to make efforts to make refrigerated vaccines that include lyophilization or portable liquid with a stabilized product. And we think, end of this year or early next year, we'll have such a product. Operator : Your next question is from Vamil Divan from Mizuho. Vamil Divan : Maybe I'll just shift gears a little bit off the vaccine, I guess somewhat tied to vaccine, but a little different angle here. In terms of capital allocation, Albert, you were mentioning that no change to your strategy. So, the vaccine obviously is going to give you a boost to your sales and cash flow, at least in the near-term here. So, I'm just wondering, should we expect Pfizer to be maybe more active and complete more transactions in the coming months to just try and boost your pipeline than you otherwise might have been, or if not, I guess, just anything you could sort of comment on your kind of thoughts around this added cash flow, and what you might look to do there? And then, my second question is on Vyndamax, where it looks like you are having pretty good traction there, maybe better than we thought given the pandemic. And I'm just wondering if you can maybe comment to where this product is now relative to where maybe you would have expected a year ago, sort of pre-pandemic. I'm trying to get a sense, there are real sort of bolus of patients or you could maybe make more traction as the pandemic eases, or are you already doing quite well in terms of gaining penetration into those patients now, so we should sort of expect the same sort of state of uptake going forward? So, any thoughts would be helpful. Thank you. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Vamil, and thank you also for asking something outside COVID vaccine, at least makes it very interesting. So, you're right, the capital allocation, it is the result of our strategy. And if anything, the COVID-19 is proven our strategy correct. It is, I think, a demonstration that we do have reserves and that has the resources of a big biopharma and the agility of a small biotech. I don't think that many people would bet that Pfizer will be the first one to complete something like that. But, this is what we are building in the last few years, and this is the demonstration that we are there. So, our capital allocation, we never say never. But, right now, the dividend will be maintained. Frank was very clear about it, a growing dividend. It is an important thing -- part of our investment thesis. And we will continue in very intensive reasons to try to bring in Phase 2, Phase 3 predominantly, programs that through our R&D machine very quickly and very successfully can become medicines and vaccines that could generate revenues that will fill the gap. But, from the 6%, so we can sustain the 6% beyond 2025. Nothing changes also -- we do have higher flexibility in terms of cash, with COVID, clearly. But, it is not that we were lacking cash before and we couldn't do basically things that we wanted to do. And now, that makes it even more comfortable to do that. Still, I don't think, because you have this comfort level, we will do things that do not respect the fact that these are shareholders' money. So we will invest them very prudently. We are not going to spend them. But, we are clearly ready to take risks when needed and also clearly ready to pay a full price for things that we really want. And, as I said before, we never say never. So, Angela, how do you see Vyndamax evolving? Was there a bolus? Is it something that we continue growing? What are your views on that? Angela Hwang : So, we have been really pleased with what we've seen with Vyndaqel/Vyndamax and the patients that we have been able to diagnose. And, I think, this has gone better than we thought actually, even with the pandemic. Currently, this last quarter, we were able to diagnose 21% of the population with ATTR-CM. And so, the increase, that we've seen quarter-over-quarter, gives us a lot of confidence that our ability to diagnose and the imaging techniques that are being used, the noninvasive techniques are working really well. I would say the bolus is gone. That was something that was maybe in the first half of -- from the -- first half of the year when we launched. And I think where we are now is in a pretty good cadence of using our suspect and detect techniques, as well as the ability to refer to imaging centers to get the diagnosis. And I think that our success rate in diagnosis is evidence of this. And so, I think, we'll continue to see cadence like this. But, of course, there's still massive opportunity, 80% more patients still to be diagnosed. And so, we're really focused now on using technologies and different techniques to heighten and to look and to screen more effectively for patients, because once we know that once we can find them, they can get diagnosed. So, that's where our focus is going to continue to be in 2021. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Tim Anderson : Thank you. A couple of questions. On the mRNA platform, you talked about leveraging that technology and outside -- there is outside of a COVID vaccine. And I think you mentioned something like seasonal flu. I'm guessing timelines for any of those types of opportunities would be more normal. And I'm hoping you can kind of give us some idea, just a rough time line on when Pfizer and BioNTech might launch a non-COVID mRNA vaccine product, totally unrelated to COVID-19. I'm guessing that would be something like five years away at a minimum, but maybe you can shed some light on that. And then, second question, just on guidance for 2021 and the other income line, a big number, $2.2 billion, very much above the normal run rate for that line item. You mentioned the consumer JV and ViiV and Viatris all going into that. The only brand-new piece there is Viatris. So, can you just give us more details why that number goes so high in 2021, and importantly, what's the run rate for that line item beyond 2021? Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much, Tim. Obviously, Frank will answer the second one and Mikael, the first one. Let me also just make an introductory comment before I ask Mikael to speak about flu. I believe that COVID thing has created a new normal. I don't think I will -- we are aspiring here in Pfizer to go back in the old normal of developing timelines, even if we were, as you saw before, at the top of the industry benchmarks, right? So if COVID, why not with cancer; if COVID, why not with flu? And I think that clearly, with COVID, there was the collaboration of regulators that made that also possible, but it was a lot of other things that we have tested. And we did differently than before. So, our aspiration is that these learnings will be clearly applied to everything in our portfolio and in our pipeline. Now, with that, Mikael, tell us a little bit how you see the timelines, where are we with the flu? Mikael Dolsten : Yes. Thank you, Albert. And I think you said it well that the type of light speed approach is with the mRNA platform should, of course, be projected into other areas as well as flu. So, Tim, you mentioned 2025, I think that it would be more conservative and traditionally realistic goal, and we are looking at ways to bring it as a potential product for approval earlier than 2025. Of course, it depends on whether there are good flu seasons with the cases coming along or not. And I think, as life continues with vaccinated folks, flu will take up new momentum. So, our aim is ahead of 2025. Frank D\u2019Amelio: Albert, I'll answer on the other income. So, Tim, let me run the numbers first, and then I'll answer the question. So, you talked about the absolute size of the number in 2021 guidance. Remember, in 2020, our other income was about $1.5 billion in adjusted results. So, it's going from about $1.5 billion to the guidance we gave, which was about $2.2 billion. The major elements in the increase are really transition service agreement recoveries, and that's primarily now as a result of closing the Viatris transaction, higher joint venture income, and then, we had some pension expense benefits as well. Those are the pieces that really get us from the, call it, $1.5 billion in 2020 to the $2.2 billion of guidance in 2021. And then, you asked about beyond '21 I think the way to think about beyond '21, just in terms of the cadence, so the rhythm of that number is, the watch item for us will be what happens with the consumer joint venture relative to what GSK decides to do with their portion of that venture. We own 32% of that venture. So, we'll have to see what GSK does. And obviously, depending on what they do, that could impact our other income number going forward, beyond that. So, that's kind of the -- I'll call it, the watch item for us in that line item. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning, everyone. This is Jason on for Jeff. Real quickly, sorry to move back to COVID. But, Frank, if you could talk a little bit about the vaccine, at least at a high level, about how the marginal contributions will change over time as manufacturing scales? I just want to get a better sense of the intermediate to longer term, if COVID does ultimately transition to more of an endemic versus the pandemic. And then, secondly, we wanted to ask about next steps for Xeljanz after the recent safety data. Is the assumption here that the label will include these new data? Thanks so much. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much. Frank? Frank D\u2019Amelio: So, let me -- Jason, let me do it this way. Let me talk about kind of how the current margins work, and then I'll pivot to how they can work going forward. So, in terms of the current margins, I always start with, we're in a pandemic pricing environment. So, the one price that we published is the price with the U.S. of $19.50 per dose. Obviously, that's not a normal price, like we typically get for a vaccine, $150, $175 per dose. So, pandemic pricing, then what are the takeaways from that? Obviously, there's the direct material, the labor, the factory overhead, shipping, distribution, then obviously, royalty assumptions we've made and then the 50% gross profit payment that we pay to our partner BioNTech. Then, you layer in on top of that some marketing and sales expense and medical expense, some R&D expense, and you come out with the high-20s in terms of that as a percentage of revenue, what we guided to. That's kind of the existing financials for the vaccine. Now, let's go beyond a pandemic pricing environment, the environment we're currently in. Obviously, we're going to get more on price. And clearly, to your point, the more volume we put through our factories, the lower unit cost will become. So, clearly, there is a significant opportunity for those margins to improve, once we get beyond the pandemic environment that we're in. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much, Frank. And then, Angela, would you like to take also the Xeljanz? Angela Hwang : So, as it pertains to the label for Xeljanz, this is something that we don't have any sense of yet. This was a big study, 1133 was a big study, five years, 4,500 people. We only have the co-primary endpoints that we shared with you. We still have a lot of work to do in terms of secondary endpoints, subpopulations and bringing all of this together to discuss this with regulators. So, I think, we're still a ways off in terms of really understanding what impact they will be to our label. And certainly, we'll keep you posted. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Ronny Gal : Good morning, everybody. Congratulations on very impressive progress on COVID. I got two questions, and they are both of the things that you haven't done. The first one is development of JAK for RA. Obviously, you've got a really versatile platform for developing JAK. And especially with an eye to the Xeljanz safety issue, it seems interesting. It should be interesting for you to consider a second generation JAK in that core largest I&I market. So, any thoughts about development there, and any if there is, what will be the requirements for you? The second one is about PD-1 approaches. You are participating in that market, somewhat congenitally, if I had to put it that way. We've seen a couple of the other large pharma companies like Lilly and Novartis, bringing in PD-1 simply as a base platform for combinations or maybe as a low-cost alternative in the current market. Have you considered that approach, and where do you come out on this issue? Dr. Albert Bourla : I think, Mikael and John could provide some insight here. So, Mikael, why don't you start a little bit with more scientific information? And then, John, you can summarize our strategy for JAKs and PD-1 as\u2026? Mikael Dolsten : Yes. Thank you. Our ritlecitinib, which is a completely unique JAK3-TEC inhibitor actually in a Phase 2, already did deliver a really interesting profile. We have a study ongoing with that Phase 2 ritlecitinib by itself and combined with a second molecule, IRAK4, to see if we can use a step-change improvement in RA. Please recall also that we just communicated that ritlecitinib had really strong data in ulcerative colitis. So, that product could grow very strongly in IBD as an option, but will continue in RA. I'll say just something on our own PD-1, and maybe John can add to additional things we do globally there. We have a very nice kind of best-in-class PD-1 platform, so sasanlimab that was developed in Pfizer that is subcutaneous and has delivered very nice response rates across multiple solid tumors. And we're actually starting a Phase 3 with that one in bladder cancer combining with BCG in order to improve outcomes for those patients. Thank you. John Young : Thank you very much for the question, Ronny. I think Mikael sort of touched on the key points. So, I think, we'd really just sort of highlight that obviously we have our existing partnership on Bavencio or PD-L1. I think, you saw in our release that we confirmed recent approval in Europe for a really interesting indication that could be very valuable for patients. And as Mikael just said, additionally to that, with our own internal program, which is a PD-1, not a PD-L1, it's a PD-1, sasanlimab. In December, in fact, we initiated the study that Mikael just mentioned. And I think the thing that we are very excited about in terms of its potential for sasanlimab is that it's a subcutaneous PD-1. We think the marketplace for more convenient PD-1s is actually still to be developed. Plainly PD-1s, given their efficacy data across a whole range of tumors have enormous potential to be a backbone for the long term. So, we think that as that market evolves, the opportunity for a PD-1 has effectiveness, which has been proven across multiple other compounds, but also combined significant convenience enhancements is actually very significant. So, we're very excited about sasanlimab, and we will keep you updated with progress as that program develops. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Navin Jacob from UBS. Navin Jacob : A couple of questions for Frank and one for Mikael, if I may. Frank, just wondering if you -- if there was any change in inventory in the U.S. during -- between Q3, Q4 of 2021 and -- sorry, 2020, and how does that compare to the change in inventory in the U.S. between Q3 and Q4 and 2019? And then, separately, Frank, the high-20% margins for the COVID vaccine suggests at 100% economics, closer to 50% to -- somewhere between 50% to 60% op margin. But, wondering, because I know, obviously, you're investing a ton into R&D, moving forward into 2022, could we -- how much could we see that operating margin increase over time as R&D spend lowers? And then, for Mikael. Mikael, obviously, a key question that everyone has is durability of efficacy, which is in part affected by new variants. But, how exactly is the agency measuring durability of efficacy or requiring manufacturers or developers to measure durability of efficacy? What specific trials and/or endpoints or how is that characterized, please? Any color would be helpful. Frank D\u2019Amelio: So, thanks for the question, Navin. So, on the inventory, it's approximately three weeks on hand and roughly the same as it was last year at the end of the year. And in terms of Q3 to Q4, no major change in the rhythm of inventory, roughly approximately three weeks on hand. And then, in terms of the high-20s percentage, it's interesting how you frame the question. Because the way I think about it is, the R&D spend isn't the big -- not the big driver of what's getting us to that high-20s, which is kind of how I heard the question. It's really the COGS. And it's like I said, because primarily, it's the pandemic pricing. And then, the different layers of the COGS that I answered earlier on in the Q&A, that's really what's driving gross, the higher -- the lower IBT as a percentage of margin. So, I think you mentioned 50%. Based on all the current financials, we're lower, significantly lower than 50% on the gross margin. And then, when you layer in the expenses, you get into the high-20s. Now, to your question beyond that, once again, I think, the big factor in it will be the pricing. We'll continue to take the unit cost down as volumes improve. The royalty is what the royalty is. The profit share is the profit share is. Obviously, we're spending R&D, but we'll continue to manage the R&D spend. To me, the big-ticket item there will be what we can do on pricing. And then obviously, the more volume we generate, the lower that will take the unit cost. And those items will clearly drop to the bottom line. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Chris Schott from JP Morgan. Chris Schott : Just two quick ones here. Maybe on the BCMA bispecific. Could you just talk a little bit about how you see these agents fitting in the treatment paradigm? And maybe, as importantly, how you're seeing the competitive landscape shaping up? So, basically what differentiation do you see with your program versus others? And maybe just then a follow-up on capital allocation priorities, post Upjohn. Share repo has -- the Company has been historically pretty active on that front. Should we think about less or kind of less relevant role for share repo in the paradigm going forward as we think about maybe a little bit higher dividend payout ratio and then some of these priorities to bring in additional assets ahead of the 26 through 28 LOE cycles? Just would love to kind of hear how you see that fitting in the mix? Thanks so much. Dr. Albert Bourla : Sorry, I was muted. Mikael, would you like to take the first question? Mikael Dolsten : Yes. BCMA or elranatamab, we're very excited about that rig. And this had a high dose 1,000 \u03bcg/kg, 83% response rate in a heavy pretreated population, and it has shown a significant number of stringent or complete responses. And it's given subdued that's a very nice tolerability profile. So, although it's filled with several entrants, I think we have an opportunity to aim for being absolutely in the first wave here and with a really nice best-in-class profile. We're moving with first opportunity we see for accelerated approval in triple refractory patients that either have seen no prior BCMA-based treatment or have seen prior BCMA treatments such as ADC or CAR-T. So, we are planning such cohorts to start soon with a potential for registration. And, we're moving into second and third line, in combination with classical image and other combinations that are used in order to come to first and second-line opportunity, particularly within it. Dr. Albert Bourla : And Chris, as regards to the stock repurchases, we never say never to anything, right? We don't want to leave any weapons that we will say we never use. But clearly, the share repurchases falls at the bottom of the priorities right now. The dividend is a clear commitment, but of course, you will all know. And we believe there are tremendous opportunities right now to invest in the business. As Frank has said, we have already an authorization from the Board that we could exercise at any point to buy back shares. And we could have a moment ask for a renewal. But, this is not the priority right now. The priority, it is to make sure that we keep investing for business development and for infrastructure. So, for example, our COVID franchise will thrive over time, and our R&D machine will get many more programs from the external world that can run through it. Thank you very much. Chuck Triano : Thanks. And Albert, did you have some closing remarks? Dr. Albert Bourla : So, wow, time flies, 11:30. So, thank you very much for joining us today and for your continued engagement with Pfizer. The new Pfizer is all about two things, science and patience. I think, it's the combination of both, decade-long transformation from a diversified enterprise to more focused and innovative biopharma company. By uniting transformational technology and cutting edge science, we are pioneering biopharmaceutical innovations to do more than just treat difficult diseases. I think, we are curing and preventing them. We believe our success in development COVID-19 was just the beginning. Thanks to the incredible transformation we have executed over the last 10 years, Pfizer is now advancing one of the strongest pipelines in our Company's history. We have 95 potential new therapies or indications in 6 therapeutic areas with 9 programs in registration, 24 in Phase 3 clinical trials. This means 95 potential opportunities to change the lives of patients around the world. And when patients win, we all win. Have a great rest of your day.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to Pfizer's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Charles Triano : Thank you, Operator. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today to review Pfizer's first quarter 2020 results and financial guidance update as well as other relevant business topics. I'm joined today as usual by our Chairman and CEO, Dr. Albert Bourla; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development and Medical; Angela Hwang, Group President, Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group; John Young, our Chief Business Officer; and Doug Lankler, General Counsel. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Chuck, and hello, everyone. I couldn't be prouder of the way Pfizer has started 2021. During the first quarter, we delivered strong financial results. Even excluding the revenue provided from our COVID-19 vaccine, our revenues grew 8% operationally, 10% reported, and this 8% growth includes a negative 5% impact from pricing. We continued to accelerate production and shipments to our COVID-19 vaccine, in many cases, exceeding our contractual obligations for delivery timelines. And we achieved several important clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones. Let me start with commentary on some of our biggest growth drivers in this quarter. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine contributed $3.5 billion in global revenues during the first quarter. As of May 3, 2021, Pfizer, along with its partner, BioNTech has shipped approximately 430 million doses of the vaccine to 91 countries and territories around the world. I will share some thoughts on the sustainability of this revenue stream later in my remarks.  Eliquis has continued to deliver a strong performance with revenues up 25% operationally to $1.6 billion in the first quarter. In the U.S., Eliquis sales growth was driven mainly by strong volume growth. VYNDAQEL and VYNDAMAX generated revenues of $453 million, representing operational growth of 88%. Our disease education efforts in the U.S. continue to support appropriate diagnosis, increasing the estimated diagnosis rate to almost 24% at quarter end, up from 21% at the end of 2020. Frank D'Amelio: Thank you, Albert. Good day, everyone. I know you've seen our release so let me provide a few highlights regarding the financials. Clearly, the COVID-19 vaccine has had a dramatic positive impact on our year-over-year results, and Albert has addressed the key points on the COVID-19 vaccine landscape.  Looking at the income statement. Revenue and adjusted cost of sales was significantly impacted by COVID-19 vaccine sales and the associated 50% gross profit split with BioNTech, which we recognize on the cost of sales line. Revenue increased 42% operationally in the first quarter of 2021, driven by COVID-19 vaccine sales and solid performance from a number of our other key growth drivers. The adjusted cost of sales increase shown here reduced gross margin by 10 percentage points compared to the first quarter of 2020, which primarily reflects the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine gross profit split, which accounted for approximately 8 percentage points and, to a much smaller extent, product mix.  Looking at the business excluding the COVID-19 vaccine contribution, we saw a continuation of solid revenue growth for the business in the quarter, which nicely supports our projected revenue CAGR of at least 6% through the end of 2025. As a reminder, this growth projection continues to exclude any contribution from the COVID-19 vaccine.  In addition, compared with the prior year quarter, first quarter 2021 revenues were favorably impacted by approximately $400 million as a result of the first quarter 2021 having 3 additional selling days in the U.S. and 4 additional selling days in international markets. This increase in selling days will be offset in fourth quarter of 2021, resulting in essentially the same number of selling days in full year '21 as compared to full year 2020.  However, the favorable impact on quarter-over-quarter comparisons in first quarter 2021 from selling days partially offset by the nonreoccurrence of favorable revenue impacts related to COVID-19 in first quarter 2020, including increased demand for certain products of approximately $150 million and additional wholesaler inventories of approximately $100 million. Given these factors, the net favorable impact on first quarter 2021 revenues is approximately $150 million or approximately 1.5 percentage points of operational growth, which in effect reduces a strong 8% operational growth rate to about 7%.  Reported diluted EPS for the quarter was up 44% compared to the year-ago quarter, while adjusted diluted EPS grew 47% for the quarter. Foreign exchange movements resulted in a 3% positive benefit to revenue and a 1% benefit to adjusted diluted EPS.  Let's move to our revised 2021 guidance. We've again provided total company guidance, which includes the business with the COVID-19 vaccine, and then we provided some additional sub-ledger detail on our assumptions regarding the projected COVID-19 vaccine contribution, so you can also see our projection for the business without the COVID-19 vaccine.  To start, the adjustments we've made to our total company guidance are almost entirely due to the anticipated impact of the COVID-19 vaccine and R&D spending on incremental COVID-19 programs and non-COVID-19 mRNA programs, along with a small increase in the revenue outlook for the business excluding the COVID-19 vaccine. For adjusted cost of sales, the ranges have increased to 38% to 39%, which incorporates the incremental anticipated COVID-19 vaccine revenue, which has a significantly higher cost of sales due to the gross margin split with BioNTech as compared to the rest of the business. The projected COVID-19 vaccine revenue as a percentage of total company revenue has increased to 36% as compared to 25% in our initial 2021 guidance.  On adjusted SI&A, we have maintained our initial guidance of $11 billion to $12 billion. In addition, we increased our adjusted R&D guidance range to $9.8 billion to $10.3 billion to incorporate anticipated spending on incremental COVID-19-related programs and other mRNA-based projects that are not part of the BioNTech partnership. Working this through with a projected 15% effective tax rate yields an increased adjusted diluted EPS range of $3.55 to $3.65 or 59% growth at the midpoint compared to 2020, including an expected 4% benefit from foreign exchange.  Let me quickly remind you of some assumptions in context on the projected COVID-19 vaccine contribution and our collaboration agreement. As referenced earlier, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine collaboration construct is a 50-50 gross margin split. Pfizer will book the vast majority of the global collaboration revenue, except for Germany and Turkey, where we receive a profit share from BioNTech and we do not participate in China. We now expect that we can manufacture up to 2.5 billion doses in '21, subject to continuous process improvements, expansion at current facilities and adding new suppliers and contract manufacturers.  As of mid-April, we have contracted for approximately 1.6 billion vaccine doses to be delivered in 2021 and still have contracts for potential additional doses under review. Based on the approximately 1.6 billion doses, we are now forecasting approximately $26 billion in COVID-19 vaccine revenue this year. We continue to have 3 pricing tiers for government contracts depending on the relative wealth of nations.  Our cost of sales for the COVID-19 vaccine revenue continues to include manufacturing and distribution costs, applicable royalty expense as well as a payment to BioNTech representing the 50% gross profit split. We continue to expect that the adjusted income before tax for the COVID-19 vaccine contribution to be in the high 20s as a percentage of revenue. This margin level also includes the anticipated spending on additional mRNA programs. As I noted earlier, the COVID-19 vaccine is now projected to account for 36% of total revenue for 2021, up from 25% in our initial guidance for the year. Let me add that if we contract for additional delivery of doses during the year, we will provide a guidance update in our subsequent earning releases. If we remove the projected COVID-19 vaccine contribution from both periods, you will see that we slightly increased 2021 revenue range to be between $44.6 billion and $46.6 billion, representing approximately 6% operational revenue growth at the midpoint.  In terms of adjusted diluted EPS, we continue to project a range of $2.50 to $2.60, which represents approximately 11% operational growth at the midpoint. These growth rates are all consistent with how we've been publicly positioning the business post the Upjohn separation.  You likely saw our announcement that we have maintained our dividend payment for the second quarter at its current level despite Viatris announcing their expected dividend payment. For those continuing to own Viatris shares, this effectively represents an increase in the dividend income, and our Board felt that the strength of our business supported maintaining our dividend. For the foreseeable future, we expect our Board to continue to support annual dividend increases at approximately this year's level. Obviously, we have no say as to what Viatris does with its future dividend.  In summary, a tremendous start to 2021. The COVID-19 vaccine continues to benefit millions of people around the world, and the business is on track for anticipated solid top and bottom line growth. We remain focused on advancing our pipeline, supporting in-market brands and looking to deploy capital responsibly, with a focus on initiatives that can solidify our long-term revenue and earnings growth outlook. With that, I'll turn it back to Chuck. Charles Triano : Great. Thanks, Frank and Albert, for your prepared remarks. At this point, operator, let's move to our Q&A session, please. Operator : . Your first question comes from the line of Louise Chen from Cantor. Louise Chen : Congratulations on the quarter. So first question I had for you. What are your thoughts on the slowing vaccination rates in the U.S.? Do you anticipate things to pick up again? And will we reach that level of herd immunity in the U.S. here? And then second question I had was on vaccine sales and how you think about it beyond 2021 and 2022. What gives you confidence that there's going to be a tail here? And how does that tail look relative to the $26 billion that you're going to potentially have this year? And then last question I had for you is just on how you're thinking about FDA concerns around JAK safety. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much, Louise. Let me make some comments on the slowing vaccinations and maybe a little bit on the '22/'23 revenues. I will ask Mikael Dolsten to add some comments over there. And then for also JAK, I will ask him to make some comments about the same. Look, I think the U.S. has done a tremendously good job and they have reached vaccination level that we didn't think that they will. The truth is that as we are vaccinating more and more people, the people that are reluctant to get a vaccine are enriching the remaining pool. So it's normal to expect that we will see a drop in the vaccination. But I believe that the entering of additional pools like younger people, post the expected approval of our 11 to 15 years old. Vaccination also will provide an additional increase in the vaccination rates. All in all, I think U.S. is doing a very good job and their focus of all should be to convince those people that they have still fear about the vaccine, that they must do the right thing.  Now beyond '22 and '23, first of all, we believe, as we said multiple times, that there will be a need for boosters. And there is a need likely from now all the way to  and then believe that the likely annual vaccinations or, let's say, regular vaccinations would be required. Clearly, this belief is based on the totality of the evidence and not on studies that they have read out right now to convince that this is the case.  And the totality of the evidence are having to do with the fact that we still have very high efficacy of 90 -- above 90% in our 6 months but it is slower at 91% then 95% that we had in the beginning. So there are some indications that there is a drop in the efficacy over time. We now have been  studies of neutralizing antibodies that also is a drop on these antibodies, and that affects not only people that they are vaccinated but also naturally infected. We also know that after 6 months, the increase of reinfections to people that they had previous infections is increasing. And we also know that we are, right now, our vaccine at least effective against all the variants that we have seen but there is a drop in neutralizing titers, so which means that  to maintain good efficacy against the variants, you need to increase the immunogenicity and this is why we are doing the with the boosters.  So the totality of the events are pointing out to this. And this is the reason why basically all governments of the world are now discussing with us about procurement agreements for '22, '23 and '24. But I will ask also Mikael Dolsten to make some comments on why we think that the boosters and repeating vaccinations is a likely scenario and also a comment on the JAK sale. Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : Yes. Thank you, Albert. I thought you outlined, in an excellent manner, that we have identified a handful of key points related to immunity was induced by convalescent after injection of vaccine that will, over time, as expected, show some decline. Antibodies will show some decline as their half-life are limited. Of course, protection contains other immune mechanism. When you put all of this in context that SARS-CoV-2 is globally circulating to extent we have rarely seen or ever seen in our lifetime of a virus, and the inability to control across the globe will, of course, lead to numerous changes in the viral mutation rate. So it just punctuates what Albert said, we need continuously to keep up a very high immune pressure against the virus to stay ahead of the curve. And the best way to do that is with regular boosting.  And finally, herd immunity, while we would like to see it established, what you hear from a lot of public health and global health state emerging is that it will be really difficult on enlarged continent to establish such a high immunization rate across all ages and to ensure as you immunize one part of the continent that immunity is maintained at another part. So I think we would really need to rely on regular immunization and, of course, other public health measures rather than hoping that herd immunity across the globe can be established. Finally, on the JAK safety, already in February 21, FDA made it public about our data in 11.33 related to increased risk of serious heart-related problems and certain cancer when compared to another type of medicines, the TNF inhibitors. So these data are clearly not new. FDA, EMA and other agencies work in dialogue with us to finalize the outcome of this review. On the other hand, I think the JAK class has shown to be an important contribution as an oral alternative for many patients, and you avoid other issues such as drug antibodies with the biologicals.  So we continue to wait for finalization of the outcome of the 11.33 trial. We think each JAK inhibitor is unique and needs to be assessed by itself. And we continue to believe that with proper labeling and given the tremendous experience of Xeljanz since 2012, it will continue to have a potential to be an important medicine. Operator : Your next question comes from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn : Thank you for all the work on the vaccine front. I just had a follow-up on the booster question. Do you think that will be uniform across different groups? Or will there be any differences by baseline characteristics such as age in terms of the timing or a need for a boost? And then would you expect FDA and CDC to issue a recommendation on the need for boosters sometime this year?  And then my second question for Albert or Frank is just would welcome your perspective on the potential impact of tax rate changes in the U.S. And any thoughts on how that might change your capital allocation strategy and/or views on inversions. Albert Bourla : Mikael, why don't you take the question for the boosters? Mikael Dolsten : Yes. I think we cannot, of course, predict what CDC and similar agencies will do. But what seems to be the general public dialogue and which, of course, builds on experience with other viral epidemics, and this is, of course, a pandemic, is that you would likely start with those that are most susceptible, older adults, those with chronic diseases such as cardiovascular, obesity, COPD, asthma, many that are immune-impaired. And of course, that constitutes a very large population.  While you may start with those, if we are to really maintain control of the virus, it will be very reasonable to assume the importance of also vaccinating younger groups. Although severe COVID is less common in younger groups, some patients may suffer severely from such infection, and they are at risk also of acquiring Long COVID syndrome, which can caused significant impairment of participation in functional life for young individuals as well as old. So all in all, yes, regular boost of entire population is a clear possibility priorities to start, of course, with many vulnerable from age to chronic diseases, which is a large number of adult population. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael. And Frank, would you like to take the question about the tax? Frank D'Amelio: Sure. Thank you, Albert. So I think it's premature to comment on what impact the proposed tax reform would have in our -- how we view capital allocation and inversion simply because these kinds of proposals typically go through multiple iterations, multiple discussions, multiple negotiations. Obviously, we're staying very close to this, doing all the analytics that you would expect us to do.  But I think what's really important is how we think about taxes and tax policy. 2017 tax reform leveled the playing field for U.S. multinationals against foreign competitors. And that was an enabler, from my perspective, of much of what we've done with capital deployment, particularly in the U.S. We committed to $5 billion of CapEx investment between 2018 and 2022. We committed a few billion of that risk capital in order to develop the COVID vaccine. Funding of our U.S. qualified pension plan that we did last year to the tune of over $1 billion.  All of those, from my perspective, were enabled by the level-playing field that we now get to compete on against our foreign competitors. And so what we want from tax reform, when all is said and done, is we want that level-playing field to continue so that we have the ability to compete on a level-playing field. So that's my answer, Albert. Operator : Your next question comes from Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink. Geoffrey Porges : Congratulations on a remarkable quarter and really tremendous progress. Some quick questions. First on pricing, you mentioned the 5% headwind. Could you give us a sense of what that looks like for the rest of the year? Is that something that we should be expecting for the full year or is it just a Q1 phenomenon? And then related to that, Albert, you disclosed your view on the pricing policy and regulatory and legislative update. But is what you described a realistic case or is that the best case?  And then a couple of questions for Mikael. Mikael, I've asked you this before, but given what we're seeing in India and in other geographies, is it your view that COVID is going to be a case of convergent evolution or continuous evolution, i.e., are we seeing new mutations beyond E4 and E484K have additional resistance mechanisms to the first generation of vaccines and antibodies? And then just lastly, you mentioned mRNA. You have a maternal RSV vaccine. Are you planning to apply mRNA as a more efficient approach to getting the and infant coverage against mRNA -- against, RSV, sorry. Albert Bourla : Geoff, a lot of questions, very important. Now let me speak a little bit about the policy of the prices, and then I will ask Frank to comment a little bit on the pricing. And the needs to add something, please feel free. And then on the 2 other areas, clearly, Mikael will speak about the resistance and the mRNA.  On the pricing reforms, these are our standard positions. But I will try to explain how I feel about the pricing reforms. And I have said it in multiple occasions. We don't think that status quo is good for anyone. I don't think it's good for the industry. I don't think it's good for the Americans because there is a problem with the current way of the current system. And this is a problem that basically every American is paying for their medicines, and this is unique to medicines, not to other medical interventions, is paying out of the pocket like if they don't have insurance, although they do have insurance. And this is the fundamental thing that needs to change. Because the medicines contribution to the overall health care, it is 12%. So by definition, cannot be the big issue but it is becoming the big issue in the discussion because everybody has to pay this thing from out-of-pocket almost, unlike other intervention. So what this change could look like? And for us, a change could look -- take different forms. It could be consistent from different areas, may not be the rebate reform, which I think is one of the systemic issues that we are having with drug pricing, but it could be that out-of-pocket caps. The fundamental thing it is that there will be a cost that the industry, I'm sure, will be willing to take our first  as long as all the savings, all the contributions that we are doing right now from this industry will go to the pockets of the American patients. And this is a fundamental difference with people that we're discussing right now because we are hearing a lot of suggestions that they want to tax the pharmaceutical companies or tax the insurance companies, but the proceeds will just fall in the black hole of the federal budget, which is not what we want.  If our contributions go to the patients, we are sitting down with all the parties trying to do a decent price reform in the way that the Americans are experiencing the cost when they go to their pharmacy to collect their medicines. So is it realistic or optimistic? I believe it is realistic. I believe that there is room for agreement both with the 2 sides of the aisle and with this administration. And we will continue working on finding this solution. But I repeat, make medicines affordable for the patients and not throw money to the black hole of the federal budget. Now Frank, if you can take the price increase and then Mikael. Frank D'Amelio: Okay. So you've heard Albert and me talk about pricing and that pricing has been a headwind, and we expect it to continue to be a headwind for the foreseeable future. And that's obviously what we saw this quarter, with pricing being a negative 5% on a global basis. I should also mention it was negative 5% in the U.S.  Now in terms of our guidance, which is what you asked, Geoffrey, our guidance assumed the pricing decrease, negative impact, I'll call it in the range of low to mid-single digits. So that 5% reduction that we saw this quarter is consistent with what we assumed in our annual guidance. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Frank. And by the way, I wanted to add that this minus 5% that it is the reality of the numbers. I'm sure that many Americans haven't experienced, during this quarter, a 5% reduction in their out of pocket because it's a system that works in a way that no matter what you do on the top, their price that they have to pay is derived from very different rules. Mikael, can you speak a little bit about the resistant mechanism in the mRNA or RSV? Mikael Dolsten : Yes, thank you. I'll start with mRNA. As you discussed here, Geoffrey, of course, there is tremendous viral amounts across the globe fueled by the spread in large population areas like India. We do see several different lineages of SARS-CoV-2 established. They, however, seem to share the most critical mutations. Most of the variants have up to 10 mutations and they can combine on different ways.  So far, we believe that our B2, the current vaccine is very effective in controlling all known mutations. But as Albert alluded to, we believe it's very important to keep up very high neutralizing antibody levels in addition to the nice T cell immunity. And that's why a possible outcome of this tremendous spread, including India, is to have a regular boost.  As the pandemic continues, up to now, mutations have been selected mainly because the virus is trying to spread more quickly. The virus will now face vaccinated immunity in maybe '22, '23 increasingly. So we need to be prepared that there could be new unexpected mutations to come. And that's why Pfizer is leaving no stone untouched and also have variant vaccine developed and could be an alternative later if that scenario would emerge. But right now, it seems like the current vaccine is very effective against all these variants despite each having up to 10 different mutations.  On the RSV, well, we had very robust titers with our protein-based RSV vaccine in maternal vaccination, very good tolerability and antibodies passed efficiently through the cord blood. And we are enrolling now well in Phase III. We also have initiated a Phase II CHALLENGE study with RSV that will read out mid of the year, and that could possibly lead to progression swiftly into Phase III. So we are pretty advanced with the protein base, it looks very good. But of course, we have now an mRNA platform that we would like to use for multiple opportunities. We expect to put into the clinic, 2, first in humans, novel vaccines every year for the next 2 years. Certainly, RSV could, in the future, be 1 alternative, whether it could be a supplement to the protein base in order to add some T cell immunity. These are things we'll continue to explore and then prioritize among the many exciting opportunities for our mRNA platform. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen. Stephen Scala : I have two questions. Regarding the DMD gene therapy, is the potency assay issue related to concerns around correlation of biomarkers to motor function efficacy? Or is it simply a technical issue with no bearing on relevance of the end points?  And second question is a little bit more broad-based. But in the COVID vaccine, Pfizer has built the world's largest global pharmaceutical franchise in 6 months. I imagine that it is creating a substantial stress throughout the organization, similar to the disruption of a major acquisition. What metrics do you monitor to ensure that these stresses are not going to show up in 1 to 3 years or so as, say, subpar product performances, clinical trial failures that otherwise would have been successes and maybe missed M&A that would have otherwise made sense for Pfizer? Albert Bourla : Thank you very much, Steve. Mikael, would you like to take the DMD question? Is it a technical issue . Mikael Dolsten : Yes. So the DMD trial, first of all, and I think Albert mentioned that in his introductory remark, is enrolling in many different countries. And in each of those, we had a matrix of assays that were cleared and -- by the regulatory authorities. The particular discussion with FDA is more of a technical issue on how to do a quantification in 1 supportive assay but not really as per our view in any of the main assays. So we continue to work with them and aim to resolve it. I want to point out that to the best of my knowledge, we were first to start DMD Phase III, now enrolling well outside the U.S. late last year. And we are probably -- by now we're entering May, 6 months ahead of anyone using yield therapy as it as least public, it hasn't been disclosed any other having been cleared with FDA. Albert Bourla : Yes, yes. Thank you, Mikael. And Steve, it's true that in order to achieve what was achieved during the -- with this vaccine, the ingenuity of our people was a key component but also a lot of personal sacrifice had to be involved. So a lot of the people who worked day and night, a lot of these people, worked days and nights to make sure that this happens. And that clearly, it is taking a toll on them. And no matter how proud they feel because the passion that they have can keep them going forever, I am concerned that we need to find ways so that these people will not break them out. But I need also to emphasize that Pfizer is run in the form of business units. Since 2016, when I was running the business that basically underlies running right now and to have organized the whole operations into 6 business units. And that involved the R&D, the commercial and the clinical development. So the work for COVID happened in 1 of the 6 business units and happened predominantly in the R&D domain of these clinical units. But at the same time, the oncology business unit and the disease business unit and the internal medicine business unit and all the other business units that we are having kept working on their normal, let's say, workload, let me put it that way. They of course, also to overcome issues related with the COVID-19 that didn't make the work very easy. But again, they were being able to rise to the occasion because I believe everybody in Pfizer right now is so strong believer of a that patients come first. And this is not about that. So this sense of sacrifice that we see in the vaccines, we have seen it also in the other units. People are very passionate about what they do and they feel very proud. So I'm giving the answer to say that there is a very intense, let's say, disruption that happened in part of the organization, not in the entire organization and -- but has been offset by an incredible sense of pride that those people are taking because of what has been achieved. So I can't control them in terms of how hard they are working right now on all the other vaccines, for example. Operator : Your next question comes from Vamil Divan from Mizuho Securities. Vamil Divan : Great. And said, thanks so much for all the efforts around COVID. So a couple of questions that I have. So one, I guess there's obviously some debate around the durability of your vaccine sales and cash flows. But you clearly have a lot more sales and a lot more free cash now to than you've probably envisioned a couple of years ago because of the vaccine. So I'm just thinking that you are obviously investing more behind the COVID vaccine and therapeutics. But can you just talk about your priorities from a capital allocation perspective? Now I don't think you mentioned you don't want to do share repurchases. But is there other priorities that you could maybe look to, whether it's bringing in external assets or maybe even doing larger deals, given the extra cash that you now will have?  And then maybe a second one, I guess, for Albert, maybe a little bit more of a personal angle here. But I appreciate your comments you made around the COVID crisis in India recently. I'm just wondering if you can provide some clarity on the status of getting your vaccine to the market there. I think you filed back in February and then there's some questions about maybe doing a trial in India, I think some questions around indemnification, around side effects. Can you just clarify where things stand there and what might be reasonable in terms of timing to get the vaccine available to patients there? Albert Bourla : Yes. Thank you very much. In terms of -- let me start with that. In terms of the vaccine in India, we applied months ago, as you know. And in -- we have -- and we applied exactly the same file that we gave to the entire world, the FDA, EMA, Japan, everybody in the world. India wanted to do additional studies in order to approve this vaccine over there, which clearly, we were not ready to allocate resources and something like that, whether when we were allocating all the resources to do things into the variants, the kids, pregnant women and I can go on things that who haven't done it before. But the Indian governments are really very good in having discussions right now with us about all these issues that you have raised. So we are hopeful that they would change this policy about conducting some local trials, and we will find a path forward so that we can provide the vaccines. That being said, the key thing right now today in the next 1 or 2 months, it is that people are dying in hospitals in India, and vaccine will not change that in the next 1 or 2 months. I think that will be a reality that we have to live with right now.  And what is more important is to make sure that the Indian government has enough medicines to treat the people but they are going to be hospitals right now. And this is why I guess we announced that for 4 of our medicines, that they are in their governmental protocol because the authorities have developed a protocol of treating COVID patients. And there are 4 of our medicines involved in these protocols. We will provide enough of these medicines for every patient in every public hospital in the next 30 days.  And as we speak, we are ramping up production of these medicines in Europe, in the U.S., in Asia. And we are ramping up distribution channels so that we can ship, as quickly as possible, those medicines to India because the need is immediate. Now on the capital allocation, I will ask also Frank to make some comments here, but very few things are changing because of that. Our strategy on capital allocation was not driven with how much capital we have, was driven with how much opportunity we have. So we never say never to anything. So we maintain the eye to see be flexible. But clearly, Frank spoke about it, a growing dividend, it is a part of our investment thesis so that will be maintained. And also, we said that our investment in research, our investment in manufacturing, our investments of our capital are all aiming to improve the longevity, how durable it is our growth in the second part of the decade.  So you should expect to see a lot of Phase II, Phase III business development deals that will allow us to bring in-house a lot of potential medicines that could become medicines in this time frame. Frank, anything to add? Frank D'Amelio: Yes, Vamil, you're absolutely right. Obviously, the COVID business is generating incremental free cash flow for us, but from my perspective, not material enough to have any major impact on our capital structure. And to Albert's point, the term I would use is we will stay the course in terms of how we deploy our capital. And then Albert obviously potential areas where we would deploy it, right? The dividend, investing in the business and you saw that with the R&D guidance increase this quarter and then M&A and M&A really focused on growth in the second half of the decade. Operator : Your next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Umer Raffat : Frank, there was a comment you made back in March which got a lot of attention. And I thought perhaps you could elaborate a bit more on how you're thinking about the durability of COVID revenues and perhaps lay out the sort of the volume and the price element of it beyond 2022. And if you could also perhaps speak to the pricing seen in your Canadian contracts, whether it's consistent in 2023, '24 versus where it was in the '21 contract. And then I had a quick R&D 1 as well, if I may. I know there's these additional FDA technical requests on the gene therapy assay for DMD. I recall you guys were using ITR in Phase I and then you switched to a transgene assay in Phase III because it was a little more low variability. Is FDA now thinking the variability is higher than they want in the transgene assay as well? I'm just trying to understand what the word \"matrix\" means. Is it still just the transgene assay with different methods or are there multiple assays at play now? Albert Bourla : Frank? Frank D'Amelio: Thank you, Albert. So on pricing, Umer, I really want to not get into detail on pricing other than obviously, there are certain contracts where we disclosed with the prices. In terms of the way I think about this, what we're really focused on now is getting doses to the patients that need doses around the world so getting people vaccinated. That's been our focus. That's -- we're acutely focused on that.  You heard in our prepared remarks, we said we can make approximately 2.5 billion doses this year. We can take that up to 3 billion doses next year. And that's what we're really focused on, right, getting those made, getting them delivered and getting vaccines into patients' arms. So that's the focus.  On the Canada contract, we didn't discuss pricing on that contract. What we did say was up to 125 million doses in 2022 and 2023, with an option for more doses in 2024. And then in terms of the durability of the franchise, I'm going to try not to repeat what Albert said, but I thought Albert went into a lot of detail on why we believe the COVID revenue franchise has significant durability and why we think we see that as something that's going to take place for the foreseeable future. And Albert went through a lot of the details how we believe that is. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Frank. Mikael, about the technical question? Mikael Dolsten : Yes. The core assays that you alluded to related to AAV and transient effectiveness are all without any real comments by FDA so they're all fine. This is what I call a supportive assay, an adjunct assay that was more related to colocalization of the DMD protein and discussions on various technologies how to measure that. And as I said, in Europe, as this was an adjunct assay in other countries, we have cleared and enrolled efficiently and progressing towards the next step of the trial very well.  So it's a very technical issue how to do a detection but not related to the core potency assays. And obviously, we're working to resolve it. But what I understand currently, there is no other potential gene therapy in U.S. that have cleared yet to Phase III. And we obviously would like to be first, no just ex U.S. where we've been going for 6 months but within U.S. and work diligently to resolve this very technical question. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Timothy Anderson : A couple of questions, please. On mRNA and your flu vaccine plans, how would a trial be constructed and really, what's the goal? Are you looking to show superiority on efficacy or just hoping to achieve parity with existing vaccines? And you talked about yours being quadrivalent, so presumably, if there is a comparator, that would be something like Sanofi's flu block. Also, what would be the likely development time line? I'm guessing it's not as fast as the COVID vaccine. It would take something longer, maybe a couple of years.  And then a separate question on your 5-year guidance. Just what -- just to make sure I understand your earlier comments on pricing. What does your 5-year guidance assume about drug pricing, especially in the context of there possibly being European drug pricing austerity measures due to COVID? Albert Bourla : Yes. Thank you, Tim. And Mikael, do you want to take the question about the flu? Mikael Dolsten : Yes. With the flu vaccine, given the strong immune response we have seen for our mRNA platform, we certainly hope to be able to show substantial differentiation versus current flu vaccine. This is, of course, the aspiration we have. Technically, there will be 2 components : one is to look at immune response on antibodies that have certain standards reported related to increase in titer. And we will be able to compare to the current protein-based flu vaccines. And then we're also planning to run a vaccine efficacy study, where we think it's not just what we hope to be a very potent antibody response but also the T cell response.  So I would certainly aspire to that we would have a vaccine that is to be substantially meaningful better than the current vaccine based on the platform by itself but also based on that we are able, so fast, to align the platform with the sequence of the emerging flu strains, while as you may know, many years, the protein base are misaligned, and that's why you get very modest vaccine efficacy on maybe just 50% and similar for immune responses. So given that we saw 95% efficacy against COVID, we think there is a large module for us to improve on the current flu vaccine.  On the timing, Albert said we are moving to start human trials in Q3. And we will obviously, early on, generate data on the immunogenicity. And if that continued to go as well as our aspiration, we think we can move very fast with this vaccine and also utilizing the type of approach where you establish a large number of sites in the regions to study in order to enroll very fast. And we will look at various ways to register this vaccine and also how that could coincide with the recommendation by  So while we don't give at this early time an exact date but it anticipated we will move very fast, may not be as fast as a pandemic development but much faster than the traditional flu development. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael. And then, Frank, I know you did answer the pricing, but do you want to say a little bit more about it? Frank D'Amelio: Sure, Albert. And this was more about the 5-year CAGR through 2025. Albert Bourla : Correct. Frank D'Amelio: So I think, Tim, the way I think about it is we really look at pricing by geographic region. And we consider -- we continue to believe it's going to be a headwind by geographic region. What would be examples of that? The U.S. would be one, emerging markets would be one. Developed Europe would be one, just as an example. They all range in, I'll call it, negative pricing increases and the range is low single digits to high single digits. And obviously, we blend that all together into an overall global rate, and that's what we've assumed in our CAGR assumptions through 2025. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Navin Jacob from UBS. Navin Jacob : Just a couple on the mRNA vaccines that you're pushing forward. You had been working with BioNTech for your flu vaccine. I just want to confirm that you're using the Pfizer mRNA technology for the flu vaccine that you're moving forward with. And curious as to why you're going with that approach beyond just the economic benefit of using your own tech versus something that you're collaborating with on. Is there something different about your mRNA technology, whether it's in the non-COVID portions of the vaccine or the LMP?  And then secondly, again on the flu vaccine, what is your ability to formulate it with the COVID vaccine? I'm wondering why you're moving forward at a co-formulated Prevnar 20 plus 162b2 and not looking for the flu vaccine co-formulation. Albert Bourla : As regards to flu vaccine, we had a elaboration with BioNTech that goes back to 2018. At the time, we had announced also publicly some of the terms of this agreement. And the developments are based on the work that has been done so far by both companies on the flu. As regard to the question of co-formulated, we didn't announce a co-formulation with Prevnar right now. We announced co-administration with Prevnar. Clearly, we are looking at options to co-formulate the BioNTech-Pfizer mRNA vaccine against COVID with other, let's say, vaccines. But this is not what we spoke about today and we haven't made final decisions on co-formulate. And I think Chuck, we do not have time for another question, right? Charles Triano : That's right, Albert. Just your closing remarks. Albert Bourla : Okay. I wanted to thank everyone for joining us today and for your continued engagement with Pfizer. I do think the pandemic has been the ultimate test for Pfizer's and, in truth, the entire pharmaceutical industry's capabilities and credibility. And in my view, we have, thus far, passed with flying colors. The success of our COVID-19 vaccine has led to an important question. If we could do this for COVID-19, why not for other diseases? There are so many people suffering from other serious diseases and their needs aren't any less urgent. We now see an opportunity to take the lessons learned and new ways of thinking and apply them across our entire portfolio.  The speed with which we interact with regulators as well as the continued acceleration of digital solutions such as artificial intelligence, electronic diaries, advanced analytics and electronic health records are just some of the things we plan to bring to all of our clinical trials so we can continue to move at the speed of science.  And now before we end the call, I want to take a moment to extend my thanks and very best wishes to our colleague and good friend of mine, Chuck Triano, who will be retiring at the end of September. Chuck has been interacting with the global investment community for nearly 35 years, including the past 13 years here at Pfizer. And I think all of you would agree that during the time, he has elevated Pfizer's investor relations function to a best-in-class. That's because he values clarity, integrity and transparency in the way you communicate. And it is because he has a passion for our company and our industry that makes him an outstanding champion for both.  The good news is he will be around for at least 1 more earnings cycle and perhaps another as he has agreed to stay on us as advisor during this transition. Chuck, thank you for being a valued colleague and friend. Pfizer will miss you, but on behalf of all of us, I wish you all the best in the next part of your journey. Thank you, everyone, and have a great rest of your day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may now all disconnect.",

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like turn the conference over to your host Patrick Malloy, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead. Patrick Malloy : Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. We hope you had a chance to review the press release we issued this afternoon announcing our Q2 2021 financial results and key program updates. Joining me on today's call are Amit Munshi, President and Chief Executive Officer; Laurie Stelzer, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Doug Manion, our Executive Vice President of Research and Development; and joining us for the Q&A session will be our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Rob Lisicki. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that we'll be making forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties about our goals, expectations, plans, beliefs, timing of events or future results, including those risks and uncertainties related to our pipeline, financial projections and the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential impact on our business. Forward-looking statements involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties some of which may be beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks could be found in our earnings press release and our latest SEC disclosure documents. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to Arena, and we disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Amit Munshi. Amit? Amit Munshi : Thanks Pat, and thanks everyone for jumping on today's call. I presume everyone's had a chance to review the press release we issued this afternoon where we announced some very important updates. I'll provide some initial comments and then Doug will take you through the program updates in more detail, and the ADVISE open label data set, and then we'll hand off to Laurie to walk through the Q2 financial performance. Following the prepared comments, we'll spend the remaining time on Q&A. Before we begin, I'd like to formally introduce our newly appointed Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development Dr. Doug Manion. Doug comes to Arena with 25 years of executive leadership experience across clinical research and drug development, with companies such as DuPont, Merck GlaxoSmithKline and Bristol Myers Squibb. Most recently, he was CEO of Kleo Pharmaceuticals. Doug's extensive experience, including experience in immunology and in our therapeutic areas will be instrumental as we continue to transform into a sustainable global organization. Turning to Slide 3, if you've been following the Arena story over the course of the past year, you'll know that in early '21, we laid out three strategic principles critical to our long-term growth. First, we plan to selectively and prudently grow our pipeline to support our long-term vision for the business. Second, we will continue to put all the pieces in place to ensure commercial launch success. And third, we continue to advance the build out of our leadership team that will maintain and grow culture for success. As you can see, we're progressing forward on all three of these principles. Turning now to Slide 4, last week, we took an important first step to bolster our mid stage pipeline within our core therapeutic areas with the announcement of our collaboration and option agreements with Aristea Therapeutics. We have a high bar for in licensing and collaboration agreements and over the course of the past year, we evaluated over 200 potential deals. Very few of these opportunities presented to us met our essential criteria; first, small molecules that were well characterized with chemistry and pharmacology; second, alignment within our current therapeutic area focuses of GI, dermatology and in cardiology; and three, limited financial exposure prior to program de risking. The deal with Aristea checks all three of the boxes. RIST4721 is an oral small molecule GPCR CXCR2 antagonist that was originated by AstraZeneca with strong pedigree in chemistry in oncology. As you can see from the slide, RIST4721 enhances our early to mid-stage clinical development pipeline, with a Phase IIb ready asset in palmoplantar pustulosis or PPP, and an opportunity to explore RIST4721s potential in hidradenitis suppurativa or HS and IBD through a couple of small exploratory trials. What is important to note is that this is a fiscally sound deal structure that includes a nominal upfront investment that grants us the option to acquire Aristea and a library of CXCR2 molecules based on the outcome of the Phase IIb PPP study and other supporting trials. Turning to Slide 5, in addition, the pipeline progress we made through the Aristea acquisition, I'm happy to share some important program updates. As most of you are aware, we are studying etrasimod a selective S1P receptor modulator in two global Phase three studies of ulcerative colitis. As we announced in January of this year, we reached full enrollment in our 52 week study, ELEVATE 52 that's that he remains on track for top line data readout in Q1 of '22. Today, I'm extremely excited to announce that our etrasimod ELEVATE 12 or UC 12 has reached full enrollment ahead of expectations. And with that I'll hand it off to Doug to provide additional details on etrasimod and the ELEVATE trial as well as other programs. Doug? Doug Manion : Thank you, Amit. And hi, everybody. With regards to the UC 12 study, we anticipate the biologic naive to biologic expose participant ratio will be 60 to 40, which is consistent with the split we saw in the OASIS Phase II UC study. As many of you will do math on the timelines, you will note that the UC 12 data will complete ahead of UC 52. With that in mind, we have developed a plan with our CRO IQVIA to keep the database unlocked, sequestered and the data blinded until both databases can be locked, unblinded and analyzed concurrently, as specified in our statistical analysis plan. I would like to thank the study participants, the clinical investigators and the entire Arena team for their extraordinary efforts that resulted in this study enrolling faster than anticipated. As we said previously, we will read out UC 12 and UC 52 data sets contemporaneously during the first quarter of 2022. As many of you know, we're also investigating etrasimod in the ongoing Phase II/III cultivates study in Crohn's disease. While we previously guided for a readout of sub-study A by the end of this year, we've made the decision to increase the sample size from 50 to 70 participants in order to enhance the veracity of this trial and these data. We believe this additional data will provide a pool data set that will be commensurate with other open label trials conducted with competing products. Importantly, this enhanced data may allow us to make sub-study 1 into registrational study and reduce the overall timeline for this program. Additionally, today, we announced entry into a collaboration with Second Genome to identify micro biomarkers in the CULTIVATE program. Crohn's disease is marked by substantial heterogeneity. So the potential to identify biomarkers associated with clinical response may be important to the ongoing design of the CULTIVATE program. With our target enrollment, moving from 50 to 70 participants and the potential of impact from the COVID-19 Delta variants spreading across multiple countries in Europe. We are projecting that the top line data for sub-study A will read out in Q2 of 2022. Now turning our attention to the etrasimod dermatology programs, in 2020, we began a small Phase II exploratory study in alopecia areata, investigating 2 milligram of etrasimod in participants with moderate to severe disease. Today, we announced that we're broadening the participation, the participant population in the study to include a more moderate patient population and adding a 3 milligram treatment arm with the aim of detecting a dose response in study participants. We believe that by taking the opportunity to execute this amendment now, and should the data be positive, will put ourselves in position to move directly to Phase III. With this protocol amendment, we now expect to read our top line data in the second half of 2022. And finally, I am very excited to present a recent data cut from the open label extension of our Phase II ADVICE study investigating etrasimod in atopic dermatitis. Can we turn to Slide 6 please, the data I'll be walking you through in a moment provide us with even greater confidence in the promise of etrasimod for patients suffering from atopic dermatitis. The open label extension program followed the completion of the 12 week placebo controlled ADVICE study period and a four week washout period. At that point, all of the participants who opted into the OLE which was 85% of the ADVISE study participants who completed the 12 week study received 2 milligrams of etrasimod. When looking at the 16 week data, in the OLE, we were pleased to see a consistent clinical improvement across key efficacy measures with no new safety signals to date through 56 weeks of follow up. Let's move on to Slide 7. I'd like to point out that within each chart, you'll notice the dashed lines across the bottom, which represents placebo rates at week 12 of the ADVISE study. We have extended these placebo rates for the sake of taking a conservative view of the OLE data. Also, we've taken an additional conservative approach when estimating the Delta at the 16 week time point of the OLE as we've applied a non-responder imputation shown by the blue line. As you look across the vIGA, EASI-75 and Peak Pruritis NRS, you'll note the consistent clinical improvement across each efficacy measure at week 16. Further at week 16 of the OLE, we observed a vIGA improvement of 47%. As a reminder, vIGA is the FDA registrational endpoint for Phase III studies in atopic dermatitis. When looking at EASI-75, we observed an improvement of 72% and a Peak Pruritis change of 61%. As you will note and with the appropriate caveats of both cross study comparisons, the data is in the range of approved biologics in a day, as are the relative deltas with placebo rates extrapolated from the initial 12 week period. As you can imagine, we are very enthusiastic about these data. While we're still in discussions with regulatory authorities around the world to establish the final Phase III design and protocol based on the OLE the data presented today, along with the review of the full data set, we've made the decision to anchor our Phase III program to a 2 milligram dose. With regards to timing, we anticipate commencing Phase III study activities in Q4 of 2021. Now I'll turn it back to Amit to highlight our upcoming catalysts. Amit? Amit Munshi : Thanks Doug. If we go to Slide 8 please, with the updates we presented today, you can see the next 12 to 18 months will be both busy and exciting. And looking at Q1 '22, we'll have data from UC 12 and UC 52 contemporaneously, followed by the enhanced and expanded CULTIVATE sub-study A in Q2. In the back half of 2022, our plan is to submit our NDA for etrasimod in ulcerative colitis pending positive data. We continue to work diligently across the organization in support of our NDA including ongoing work in areas such as clinical pharmacology, CMC, quality and regulatory. Also in the second half of '22, we will turn over several important data readouts, including etrasimod and alopecia areata with two and 3 milligrams and the expanded patient population, eosinophilic esophagitis or EoE and data from APD418 and temanogrel in their respective cardiovascular indications. Now I'll hand the call over to Laurie who will take you through the Q2 financial performance. Laurie? Laurie Stelzer : Thank you, Amit. Turning to Slide 9 for key financial measures, research and development expenses for the second quarter totaled $112.5 million, compared to $64.9 million in the same period in 2020. This increase was primarily driven by advancement of our clinical trial programs, as well as an increase in personnel expenses as we staffed to support our program growth. Selling general and administrative expenses for the second quarter totaled $31.9 million, compared to $22.9 million in the same period in 2020. Net loss for the second quarter was $146.1 million, compared to a net loss of $84.9 million for the same period in the prior year. Basic and diluted net loss per share for the second quarter was $2.40 compared to basic and diluted net loss per share of $1.61 for the same period in 2020. Operating cash burn in the second quarter was $93.8 million, compared to $77.8 million in the same period in the prior year. And as of June 30, 2021, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were approximately $1.0 billion, compared to $1.1 billion at March 31, 2021. And now I'll turn the call back over to Amit who will make some concluding remarks before opening the call to the Q&A session. Amit Munshi : Thanks Laurie. We'll go to Slide 10, please. In looking at Q2 performance, you can see we make continuous - we continue to make significant progress across our entire portfolio. And that now we have a direct line of sight to our Phase III ELEVATE data readout. Overall for the portfolio, we continue to evaluate the market, competitive and regulatory environment and where necessary, adapt our approaches of our science the best chance of providing a clear clinical signal. On atopic dermatitis, we continue to make strong progress and the open label data extension that we presented today gives us confidence in entering our Phase III program. And of course, finally, we continue to maintain a strong cash position. I like to take this opportunity to thank the entire Arena team for the hard work and dedication as we continue to build towards the future of the company. With that operator, let's move to Q&A. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Alethia Young from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. Alethia Young : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the progress with enrollment. Just two for me, one, on the alopecia areata study, I just wondered if you saw anything in the 2 mg that kind of - is informing your decision to kind of move into the 3 mg, any color there would be helpful. And then as you think about the completion of the enrollment of the UC study, are there things in consideration such as staffs being kind of enrolling during COVID that you guys have proactively been doing especially in light of some of the learning maybe from atopic and just wanted to get some color on that? Thank you. Amit Munshi : Sure, let me start now. If I miss anything Doug, please jump in. On the AA study we're blinded to the data, so it's not a reflection of 2 milligram? As you know, in atopic derm we did not get a chance to explore the 3 milligram in a Phase II study, so we thought this was the right place and time to take a look at 3 milligrams. Importantly - and just as important as the 2 to 3 milligrams of expanding the patient population in the study. And then the final point, which I'll echo what Doug said in his prepared remarks, is that by increasing the study and making it more robust, we're moving this study from a proof of concept study to a study that could potentially take us directly to Phase III. So the overall program timeline gets get potentially diminished by doing that. So that's really the purpose of - to change that study. In terms of enrollment on etrasimod in ulcerative colitis, as you know, we've maintained a very high degree of touch in the trial. We continue to evaluate every patient every day, every day to entry to ensure that we have the strongest possible integrity of the trial. As I pointed out previously, discontinuation rates, and other interruptions of dosing, et cetera, are well below our pre-planned statistical expectations for the UC study. So we continue to be very positive about where that trial is heading, both in terms of the timelines as well as in terms of data integrity. Alethia Young : That's great. Thank you very much. Amit Munshi : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Neena Bitritto Garg from Citibank. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Dina on for Neena. I just have a quick question about the ELEVATE UC 12 study. How long will it take for analysis from the ELEVATE UC 12? Will it take a full eight weeks post the last patient visit report that path line data? Thank you. Amit Munshi : Yeah, so as Doug pointed out, as folks will do the math and the trial timing may look earlier than UC 52. The data are intended to be analyzed together. So the end of the study would expect the normal time period in terms of analysis, but it also important to remember that the last patient out is really dependent on whether patients enroll in the OLE or not. So we'll know more about exactly how tight the timing is between two studies as we get towards the end of the - end of patient exposure, and we get the last patient out on study. So stay tuned. We're excited about where we're at with this and really pleased that the teams were able to execute on UC 12 in the middle of a COVID pandemic. Thanks for your question. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chris Howerton from Jefferies. Your line is open. Chris Howerton : Fantastic. Thanks so much for taking the questions and super excited for the UC data too. So I guess maybe the question for me primarily is around what is the design of the CULTIVATE study? I'm feeling a little confused around the sub-study A, what sub-study 1 is and kind of how you see that becoming potentially registrational? And if you're willing to take a follow up question for me, I'm also curious what the status is of the extended release formulation is for etrasimod is, you have more clinical programs going on and more dose selection work going on, how does that layer into your thinking? Thanks. Amit Munshi : Yeah. Thanks for the question. The design of the CULTIVATE study starts with sub-study A. As you know that's a study that does not have a placebo control. It's just 2 and 3 milligrams. By expanding that study to 70 patients, we're able to get a pool of data set that's comparable to competitive products. We've done open label studies and moved directly on to registrational trials. So it really gives us the same size data set, and the robustness. And on top of that, we've got this collaboration on the biomarker side, which will help inform the overall program in time. The sub-study 1 was designed as a dose finding study between 2 and 3 milligrams in a placebo control setting. And at this point, should the sub-study A readout in line with our expectations, we would be in a position to power sub-study 1 to be the first to pivotal trial. So previously, we've contemplated sub-study 1 being a dose finding study and then moving to two large Phase III trials. In this case, we'd be able to power out the sub-study 1, if that makes sense. Chris Howerton : That does. Thanks Amit. Amit Munshi : Yeah. And then the second question on the ER formulation, we continue to make good progress across the extended release. As you know, we've done some initial work on liquid formulation, so really try to pinpoint the exact curve we wanted to generate. And now what we're doing is we're looking across 2 and 3 milligrams and looking at broad range of potential formulations to begin to mimic that initial curve. So that work is ongoing and it's an iterative process. And we look at multiple different formulation methods, and there's a concentric circle between - concentric circles between being able to really identify the right formulation and developing new intellectual property. So as we've said before, the role of extended release is to both extend and expand the role of etrasimod, extend the intellectual property life and being able to expand into new indications. And so that work is ongoing and consistent with what we've said before. We hope to bridge that into the dermatology programs over time. Chris Howerton : Okay, that's cool. Thanks Amit. Amit Munshi : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jessica Fye from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Jessica Fye : Hey, guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess first, given what's become a bit of an extended timeline for sub-study A, can you comment on where enrollment stands in the study just to give us a kind of a little progress update? How close are you to the originally planned 50 patients? Amit Munshi : Sure. So we don't comment on details of any study's enrollment. We are spot on where we expect to be on that study. But with Doug's arrival and taking a look at the competitive set, evaluating our regulatory potential path forward, we've made this change so that we can begin to move the overall program faster forward, so that's really the objective here. Jessica Fye : Okay, so with Doug's arrival that's the reason why it's just happening now that you're deciding to enroll 70 patients and this wasn't a call you were able to make earlier. Amit Munshi : No, we were working on this earlier and working through regulatory implications. As you know, working through regulatory implications isn't the fastest process in the world. So we were already working through this prior to Doug's arrival and Doug's judgment here is extremely important with his broad range of expertise, really gave us confidence that we were making the right decision here. Jessica Fye : Great and just last one for me, do you see pool safety data from sub-study A on an ongoing basis, maybe on a blinded basis? And given that the 3 milligram is - would be part of that pool data, anything you can comment on safety so far? Amit Munshi : Sure. So the safety is evaluated in a blinded fashion by external parties and the SMBs. And we haven't seen anything that would make us question our decision to go from 2 to 3 milligrams at this point. Jessica Fye : Great, thank you. Amit Munshi : Thanks Jessica. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Chris Shibutani : Great, thank you very much. Two questions, one on the current CULTIVATE study. Could you help us a little bit understand the patient characteristics background in the way that you have helped us to understand the UC program? And to get a sense whether any of the modification and enrollment from 50 to 70 patients there is taking any features of patients' exposure to biologics into account? Amit Munshi : Yeah, Hey, Chris, thanks. Yeah, there's no real difference in the additional 20 or so patients who will be adding to study from the original 50. As you know, working moderate to severe Crohn's. There's some very clear defined guidelines in terms of the patients we want in that study. And it's consistent with what everyone else has studied. I think this is the challenge in Crohn's broadly, which is, it's a narrow subset. Crohn's, as you know, has a lot of heterogeneity as Doug pointed out, and these studies are all designed to evaluate a very narrow subset of patients consistent with what other competitive products have seen. So Doug, Rob, anything to add to that? Doug Manion : This is Doug. Only to say that, yeah, we've kept the inclusion criteria as it is. We've just expanded the sample size. So we have more veracity with the data set on which we're basing our decisions. But the hope would be that we can be bullish in terms of the next phase of human experimentation. Chris Shibutani : Got it and then the follow up would be on advise atopic dermatitis. You gave us a snapshot of a work that you did in July. I think previously, you've said that you'd be doing a more fuller presentation of the data sometime in the back half of this year, should we still anticipate that and roughly when and that would be helpful to get insight. Amit Munshi : Yeah, so the data that we presented today is a relatively fulsome set. We'll continue to evaluate the open label data over time. We expect to present this data in an upcoming medical conference and we're working through that now. So this will get presented in a forum. But as I think you can see from the data just gives us additional confidence that the outcomes that we're seeing here, even with the elevated placebo rates we saw in first 12 week are actually quite robust and in line with other agents. So again, consistent with the safety profile of the etrasimod being a once a day oral, not having the liabilities of JAK inhibitors and being able to deliver efficacy that's in the range of the approved biologics. We're incredibly excited about where this is heading and we think there's a substantial market opportunity in front of us. Chris Shibutani : And just to be clear the word anchor on 2 milligrams, does that mean that 3 milligrams is not part of the go forward AD plan or is it predominant? Amit Munshi : Yeah, so it's not part of the Phase III plan. That's correct. Chris Shibutani : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Joseph Schwartz from SVB Leerink. Your line is open. Joseph Schwartz : Thanks very much. Maybe I'll ask about your new collaboration with Second Genome to analyze patient responses in CULTIVATE. What's the null hypothesis there? Is it that patients who are more dysbiotic have worse responses to etrasimod or need higher doses? And what do you do with the findings that you uncover? Will you report them along with the top line CULTIVATE data? Would you expect to enrich enrollment in Phase III, just talk a little bit more about your plans there? Amit Munshi : Sure. Joe, so let me start and I'll then hand it off to Doug. The reason to do this is really the heterogeneity that Doug pointed out and to the extent we can begin to really understand the impact of etrasimod. We've talked extensively before about etrasimod's role beyond just migration of T-lymphocytes. We've talked about activity on tight junction protein [ph]; we've talked about activity on the innate immune system. And so we're really excited to see where these biomarkers come out. Doug you want to lend some more color on it? Doug Manion : Yeah, just to say that we all know that dysbiosis is an important feature here. I think there is not a lot of literature on the quantification dysbiosis. So we're not going in with a priori notion of what that's going to turn up other than we'll do exploratory studies to see if there is a cut point in terms of response rates that might predispose us then to stratify or enrich and the Phase III program. And having done work in the Crohn's space a lot it is an extremely difficult population to homogenise. So if we can find any biomarkers that could help to predict who's going to respond better, I think it's going to significant chance to the likelihood of success in Phase III. Joseph Schwartz : Okay, thanks. And then can I just ask about your dose selection and how you're thinking about dose selection for Phase III in atopic derm? It sounds like you're settling on two mgs of the high dose, is that right? And can you give us some of your thoughts around, where - is two, does two really seem like the top end of the dose response curve? It seems like at first you thought that and then you were considering going higher. So if you can just give us an update on your latest thoughts there. That'd be great. Amit Munshi : Sure. So let me answer that question by handing off to Rob to talk about the data we presented today and how it stacks up competitively. And why we're excited to anchor the Phase III program on to 2 milligram. Rob can you shed a little bit of color on what these numbers look like relative to the competitive set. Rob Lisicki : Yeah. Thanks Amit. I'll be happy to. Good afternoon, everyone. Pleasure to join you. When we looked at the open label extension data, we're able to compare that to all of the approved drugs and the drugs that are currently in Phase II, Phase III. When you look at that data, you see a response across all domains and all endpoints that is in line with what you would see with just success, right, cross trial comparisons, different time points, all those caveats. But when you look at the response, it's in line with what's actually being seen with JAK inhibitors. Given that the response is so robust and continues to improve over time and there's no safety signals that have been observed through 56 weeks of exposure. We're confident that 2 milligrams is sufficient dose for this particular TA based on the profile of the molecule and the responses that we see. Joseph Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jason Gerberry from Bank of America. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, this is Sean for Jason. Thanks for taking up the questions. Maybe first one, just a quick follow up on the enrollment of the size for the sub-study A. Can you confirm whether the 20 additional patients, are they evenly split between the 2 milligram and the 3 milligram? Amit Munshi : Yeah, we'll continue to randomize 2 versus 3. Correct. Unidentified Analyst : Got it and I guess I'm curious your thoughts as to exploring micro biomarker, a lot of that data so far on - at least on microbiome as a treatment modality is mainly on ulcerative colitis. Maybe can you talk about how - like of what those data sets are to exploring micro biomarkers for Crohn's disease? And if not can you compare and contrast micro biomarker versus microbiome as a treatment modality for IBD? Amit Munshi : Yeah, let me hand that off to Doug. Doug Manion : Sorry. Thank you for the question. So we're open minded. So we'll look first and foremost at the impact of our treatments on dysbiosis in the Crohn's disease setting, but also look to see what the baseline dysbiosis status was and to see whether or not there's indicators of individuals who actually have better improvement than others in terms of their Crohn's disease symptomatology. Amit Munshi : Yeah. I'd just add one more thing, which is we're not discussing treatments against the microbiome; we're just looking at biomarkers in the microbiome as it relates to SNP modulation. And we think, to Doug's point, if we can create more homogeneity in the patient population that combined with the larger data set will allow us to be far more expeditious, and fiscally prudent in designing the remainder of the program. Unidentified Analyst : And curious if you're able to find a plan in terms of what patients respond to your therapy? How response that you trust are better as an opportunity for you to decide a more robust file, perhaps with a smaller data set, because you're enriching certain population, they're more likely to respond, just curious thinking about maybe later stage trial design and timeline for market, that sort of question. Amit Munshi : Sure, yeah. We won't get into the timelines on this, but Doug, if you want to take the first part of that question. Doug Manion : Yeah, again, thank you for the question. The two edged sword with enrichment, of course is if you need some biomarker to stratify, then you would need to validate that biomarkers. So we're not hell bent on the idea that one must do that, we'd still prefer to take an all comers approach, although if there's a way for us to enrich for individuals who have a greater likelihood of benefiting from our drug, we'll certainly do so. And always, our goal here is to try to have the most efficient Phase III clinical trials as possible in terms of time and cost and the number of patients necessary to get to a result that could help us convince regulators to approve the drug for that indication. So we're doing everything that we can to try to expedite the medicinal value of the trails involved in that setting. Unidentified Analyst : Got it and maybe just one last question from me on AD, thanks for the updates with the OLE data and appreciate the trending up of the EC score, and also the IGA score. So I'm just curious is that if any thoughts as to what is driving the increase in benefits over time, is it durational therapy? Is it because you no longer have those protocol compliance that may have - interfere with your ability to interpret the efficacy data in the placebo control part? Or do you have any sort of AD natural history cohort that sort of address whether there might be an evolution of placebo rate over time. Amit Munshi : Yeah. I think the most important striking finding that we had from the ADVICE double blind portion was that there was no plateau of effect. We made that point earlier in the year across and we've looked at as a patient by patient basis, we continue to see increase from eight weeks to 12 weeks, with no plateau of effect. So looking at 16 weeks was an important point for us. Recall that these patients were all washed out for four weeks before - we put back on 2 milligrams of etrasimod. So from that perspective it's cleaner ways, you can look at in open label study, to look at the effect size for etrasimod, and at 16 you can see - at 16 weeks you can see, again, a very robust response. Unidentified Analyst : Awesome, thanks so much for the color. Thank you. Amit Munshi : Thanks to you. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Stringer from Needham. Your line is open. Joseph Stringer : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking our question. Going back to the alopecia trail, you're adding the higher remake dose here. Just curious if you can expand a little bit on sort of the expanded patient population subtype, is that - how should we think about that? Is that based on potentially disease severity and baseline SALT scores and is that expanding into additional subtypes here? That stratified are possible in 2 mg and 3 mg arms. Thank you. Amit Munshi : Yeah, so yeah, we would stratify for 2 and 3 milligrams. The idea here is to give more alopecia areata patients as opposed to [indiscernible] patients, so we could address a broader subset. Recall also that we're treating for 24 weeks in this study, and we're talking about resident T-lymphocytes being cytotoxic at the hair follicle. So having sufficient time to be able to make an impact here has everything to do with being able to have that 24 week treatment period. So yes, we're looking at about 2 to 3 milligrams and expanding more to alopecia areata as opposed to [indiscernible] patients, so we'll get a broader subset of patients. And based on that, we think the expanded stuff here will allow us to make a more informed decision about how to move to Phase III. Doug Manion : And Amit, just to add, so we're going down to a SALT score at entry of 25 or more, 25 to 95, up from 15 to 95. And at the end of the day, with the added enrollment, we should have an even split between placebo 2 milligrams and 2 milligrams for approximately 26 or 27 patients per arm. Joseph Stringer : Great, thanks for taking our question. Doug Manion : Thank you. Amit Munshi : Thanks Joe. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Yatin Suneja from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. Yatin Suneja : Hey, guys thank you for taking my question, just two for me. First on CULTIVATE sub-study did you take a look at - or were there any analysis of the data that led you to increase the sample size or you just increased based on - like without looking at the data? That's the first question. Amit Munshi : Yeah, we're blinded to the data. So we made this decision based on having a data set that would allow us to really think about sub-study as a pivotal study. That was the driver. We're, again, we're blinded to the data. Yatin Suneja : Okay. And then with regard to the UC 12, can you talk about how the patient mix might be looking between the biologic naive unexposed patient and how would that compare to 52? Amit Munshi : So 52, we announced 70-30 split. This is trimming closer to what we saw an OASIS, which is about a 60-40 split. Yatin Suneja : Okay, got it and just to confirm, you will be analyzing these data sets together both UC 12, even though that one most likely will be sort of done before 52. Amit Munshi : Yeah, Doug, do you want to just expand on that? Doug Manion : Yeah, so they'll be analyzed contemporaneously. So we will do at the same time. So the plan would be to actually keep the database unlocked for UC 12 until a time where approximate to when we're going to walk the database with UC 52. And then run the analyses on each of the studies at the same time and then subsequently do pooled analysis as will be needed for the ISS and the IC of the NDA submission to the US FDA. Yatin Suneja : Okay, helpful. Just one final question, maybe on the expenses side, could you give an update on how the expenses are going to ramp up for the second half or for the rest of the year and maybe in 2022? Amit Munshi : So Laurie do you want to take that? Laurie Stelzer : Yeah, certainly, we haven't given guidance for '21 or '22 yet on cash burn. But what I can tell you is we did have a $214 million cash burn in the first half of '21. And then obviously, we have increasing patient enrollment in all of our studies and advancement in all of our studies, so we would expect somewhat. Yatin Suneja : Got it, thank you so much. Amit Munshi : Thanks Yatin. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Prakhar Agrawal from JonesTrading. Your line is open. Hi, Prakhar Agrawal : Hi, thanks for taking my question. My first question is on ADERM Phase IIIa trail. Just wanted to clarify if there are any other changes in the Phase III trial that we should expect compared to ADVICE to minimize the high placebo effect that you saw in the Phase II? Secondary it's more on commercial in our conversations with KOLs suggests that Symposia. Bristol Myers, SNP that recently launched has been limited to treatment refractory UC patients. I know there's still a long way to go, but you just wondering if you had any thoughts on the implications of [indiscernible] and their pricing in UC to how you're thinking about your commercialization strategy. Thank you. Amit Munshi : Sure. So let me - let's start with the commercialization question. Rob, do you want to take that please? Rob Lisicki : Yeah. I'm happy to. Thanks. Amit. It's early. Their approval was May 27. So we're looking at just a few weeks of data where they've been in market, their relative access within the market is pretty limited. So right now for most payers are limited behind other agents. I think another consideration is the price stands out a bit in the UC market. It's 90,000 per year. That's much higher than competitive choices and other therapies. The other piece too is that there is - one of the key differences between the work that they did and the work that we're doing is to try to generate and demonstrate value for the molecule for payers prior to launch. That's the GLADIATOR study. So my assumption would be they're engaged with payers right now and they're negotiating. So their access is very limited to a small group of patients, which is why you're likely hearing that from OLs. Amit Munshi : I'm sorry. Can you repeat the first part of the question again? Prakhar Agrawal : Yeah, on the Phase III ADERM trial, any other trial design changes compared to ADVICE that we can expect? Amit Munshi : Yeah, so what we said in the Phase III program is, we have a substantial amount of moderate patients in the Phase II study, and we'll be looking for more of a contemporary split between moderate to severe atopic derm patients closer to 50-50. If you recall, we were thinking at 3%, moderate, at baseline, so we're looking for more moderate to severe patients, and so be a much more contemporary split in the modest of your population. Prakhar Agrawal : Thank you. Amit Munshi : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Hoang from SMBC. Your line is open. David Hoang : Hey, thanks so much for the update and taking my question. So I just a couple. Can you talk a little bit about the GLADIATOR study in moderate patience? So what's the status of that, any relevant updates for that one? And are there - is there a timeline towards top line data? Amit Munshi : So for GLADIATOR that study is enrolling and we expect to have top line data to carry approval studies and we expect to have top line data shortly after approval, as Rob pointed out to really work with the payers on that with that data set to really drive greater payer access. So it's still ways down and the study is enrolling now. David Hoang : Okay, thanks. And then just quickly, I know you folks have commented on a few different ways, but I kind of wanted to ask the question in terms of atopic derm Phase III, it sounds like you're pretty confident in 2 milligram dose, but as you see more 3 milligram data from Crohn's and alopecia areata. Is it possible that kind of influences your thinking and you may be open to any type of protocol and then it's the 2 to 3 milligram arm or again is 2 milligram the dose that we all really should be looking at here? Amit Munshi : Yeah. So the Phase III program, its two milligrams we reserve the right to go back and look at 3 milligrams in a separate set of studies. But the 2 milligrams is what will go on the Phase III. And as you saw from the data that was presented, the 16 week data, the effect continues to increase, we're seeing a very safe product out to week 56. And we're seeing rates of EASI-75, IGA and the Peak Pruritis score that are in line with the market leader. So we're doing that with a once a day oral, so we feel very good about where that 2 milligram is coming out. And as you can imagine, we spent a lot of time with excellent advisors, staring at this open label data. And it's been very encouraging to hear from experts in the field about this data and how it validates 2 milligrams. As I pointed out on a previous question from the ADVICE portion, we saw that acceleration of effect from week eight to 12 and so continuing that lack of plateau really takes us out to 16. And, and so that delta feels very comfortable for us in terms of being able to think about Phase III program. David Hoang : Okay, understood. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Amit Munshi : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from to line up Jason Butler from JMP securities. Your line is open. Jason Butler : Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Two for me, first, do you have any data for etrasimod that looks specifically at a direct impact on microbiome? And I get that you're not trying to show that, but have you ruled out that you don't have a direct impact on the microbiome? And then secondly, looking past the UC study readouts, are there ancillary clinical studies, preclinical work or CMC work that could become rate limiting to an NDA submission? Thanks. Amit Munshi : Yeah. Doug, do you want to take the first part of that, and I'll take the second part. Doug Manion : Sorry, could you repeat the first part again? Jason Butler : Have you ruled out that etrasimod has a direct impact on the microbiome? If you're looking at what the indirect impacts on the microbiome treatment would be, have you just ruled out that you don't have a baseline effects directly in the gut? Doug Manion : So we believe from our preclinical models that we do not, but that's one of the things that we'll be exploring more intensely in the human studies with the collaboration that we just announced with the Second Genome. Amit Munshi : Okay, and then the second part, looking past the UC studies, there's nothing rate limiting. We've been working for well over a year on making sure the clean form and quality systems necessary as well as the CMC are all in place toward the NDA. So there's nothing rate limiting beyond getting the studies completed. Jason Butler : Okay, great. Thanks for taking the questions. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Kennen MacKay from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Kennen MacKay : Hey, thanks for squeezing me in and great to hear about the UC 12 recruitment completion, big congrats there. Doug, maybe another question on that 2 milligram dose in AD just wondering what the drivers were behind that decision to move forward with that? Did that just converge versus 1 milligram over time or really sort of, again, what the driver was there? And separately, just thinking about the 3 milligram dose in alopecia areata, are there any disease ideologies or biology there that dictate that higher dose? Or is that sort of just a result of following the data? Thanks and looking forward to that UC data. Thank you. Doug Manion : Thanks. Thanks for the question. So yeah, we feel very comfortable with the 2 milligram dose in the larger populations in which we're currently testing and most importantly, all the work that we're doing in UC. We have margins we feel there's reason to probe 3 milligrams in more refractory diseases like Crohn's and alopecia areata. And we'll see what those results show both in terms of efficacy and safety and make the right decision in terms of dosing moving forward for those indications. And as Amit already stated you never say never. So if in fact we see that 3 milligrams in select indications is in safe and more effective. And we think that the ability for us to probe it in diseases like atopic dermatitis and by the way, the regulatory agencies have a lot to say about that then we'll proceed in consultation with that. Operator : I'm showing no further showing questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Amit Munshi. Amit Munshi : Great, thank you, everybody, for being on the call today. As you see, we continue to make significant progress across the portfolio Overall, we continue to evaluate market competitive and regulatory environments and as necessary adapter approaches to shorten the overall timelines for programs and get really our science the best chance of providing a clinical signal that's really important to us. And we think the changes we continue to make on these studies are all designed to really accelerate the overall programs. We're excited about anchoring on 2 milligrams for atopic derm, given the 16 week data we presented today. And I'd like to just conclude again by thanking the Arena team for their incredible hard work and dedication across the portfolio. But specifically call out the ELEVATE team at Arena for being able to really in the face of a lot of external and noise around the pandemic being able to execute these studies in a way that's ahead of schedule as well as maintaining strict data integrity. So thank you again, for everyone jumping on the call, and look forward to continued conversations. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to Pfizer's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chris Stevo, Senior Vice President and Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Chris Stevo : Thank you, Sylvia.. Good morning. Welcome to Pfizer's third quarter earnings call. I am joined today by Dr. Albert Bourla, our Chairman and CEO; Frank D\u2019amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development in Medical; Angela Hwang, Group President Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group; Aamir Malik, our Chief Business Innovation Officer; and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel. We expect this call to last 90 minutes. Materials for this call and other earnings-related materials are on the Investor Relations section of pfizer.com. Please see our forward-looking statements disclosure on Slide 3, which is shown right now, and additional information regarding these statements and our non-GAAP financial measures is available on our earnings release and in our SEC forms 10-K and 10-Q under risk factors. Forward-looking statements on the call speak only as of the call's original date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of the statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Albert. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Chris. Hello, everyone. I'm happy to report that Pfizer generated another solid performance in the third quarter recording 130% operational revenue growth compared with third quarter of 2020. When excluding direct sales and alliance revenues provided by our COVID-19 vaccine, we generated 7% operational revenue growth compared with the previous year quarter. We also are raising our 2021 total Company guidance for both revenues and adjusted EPS. While we are proud of our financial performance, we're even more proud of these financial results -- of what these financial results represent in terms of the positive impact we are having on human lives around the world. In the first nine months of 2021, our innovative medicines and vaccines reached nearly a billion people. It's fair to say millions of lives have been saved because of this.  Excluding our COVID-19 vaccine, we reached nearly 300 million people during that time. These are humbling numbers for all of us at Pfizer. At the same time, we delivered to our shareholders the 331st consecutive quarterly dividend. We also continue to advance our R&D pipeline. Some key milestones include the first COVID-19 vaccine authorized for emergency use in the U.S. for children 5 to 11 years of age. The first patient dosed in our large Phase III RENOIR study for our RSV bivalent vaccine candidate and the initiation of Phase II/III studies for both IV and oral protease inhibitor candidates for COVID-19. Let me start with commentary on some of our key growth drivers in the quarter. The biggest of which was Comirnaty, which contributed $13 billion in global revenue during the third quarter. Today, we have produced 2.6 billion doses and shipped 2 billion doses to 152 countries or territories. So far, 75% of our Comirnaty revenues have been generated outside the U.S. and we continue to sign agreements with governments around the world. We also remain on track to produce 3 billion doses this year, of which at least 1 billion will go to middle- and low-income countries. In addition, our weekly market set of COVID-19 vaccines administered continues to increase. In the U.S., our four-week average market share increased from about 56% in April to about 74% as of October 31st. And in the EU, it went from about 70% to about 80% during the same time period. These market increases are primarily the result of our booster being the first to receive emergency use authorization, and our two-dose series being preferred by some countries around the world for use in certain younger populations. We also continue to follow the science to help ensure we stay ahead of the virus. Let me speak to two examples. First, top line results from our Phase III randomized controlled trial demonstrated a booster dose administered to individuals, 16 years of age and older who previously received the Pfizer-BioNTech primary two-dose series, restored vaccine protection against COVID-19 to the high levels achieved after the second dose.  Second, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized our COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use for children 5 through 11 years of age, the first and only vaccine to receive such authorization. For this age group, the vaccine is to be administered in a two-dose regimen of 10 microgram doses given 21 days apart. The 10-microgram dose level was carefully selected based on safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity data. Last week, we announced that the U.S. government exercised its final purchase option under the existing U.S. supply agreement to purchase 50 million additional doses of Comirnaty. This brings the total number of pediatric doses purchased by the U.S. government to 115 million, which is enough to vaccinate every U.S. child. Overall, the U.S. has now purchased a total of 600 million doses across all age ranges under this supply agreement. Now, let's take a look at some of the quarter's other key growth drivers. Eliquis has continued to deliver strong performance with global revenues up 19% operationally to $1.3 billion in the third quarter. In the U.S., sales growth for Eliquis was driven mainly by a 16% growth in prescription volume. Vyndaqel and Vyndamax revenues were up 42% operationally to $501 million globally. Our disease education efforts in the U.S. continue to support increases in appropriate diagnosis. While the main driver of growth in Japan has been the successful establishment of several referral networks in select areas resulting in new patient starts. Ibrance continue outside of the U.S., revenues outside of the U.S. were up 9% operationally to $500 million. This growth was driven by accelerating demand as the delays in diagnosis and treatment initiations caused by COVID-19 show signs of recovery across several international markets. Global revenues for Ibrance were up only 1% operationally as the international growth was largely offset by a 3% decline in the U.S. The U.S. decline was driven by an increase in the proportion of patients accessing Ibrance through our Patient Assistance Program. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our Oncology Biosimilars Portfolio, which is now the largest in the industry with six biosimilars approved in the U.S. for patients living with cancer. Global revenues from this portfolio grew 51% operationally during the quarter to $398 million. This growth was primarily driven by continued strong results from our U.S. therapeutic monoclonal antibody launches. In international developed markets, oncology biosimilars contributed 29% operational growth, driven by new launches of ZIRABEV and continued growth of TRAZIMERA.  Of course, with such a broad portfolio of life-changing and life-saving products, it will be uncommon to not have a few challenges. U.S. revenues for our Prevnar family, Prevnar 13 and Prevnar 20, for example, were down 2%, primarily due to a 36% decline in the adult indication of Prevnar 13 due to the ongoing prioritization of primary and booster vaccination campaigns for COVID-19 and the later start of the flu season compared with last year. Other contributing factors were the continued impact of the lower remaining unvaccinated eligible adult population and the June 2019 change to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the change of ACIP, recommendation for the Prevnar 13 adult indication to shared clinical decision-making. Just two weeks ago, ACIP voted to recommend Prevnar 20 for routine use to help protect adults against invasive disease and pneumonia caused by the 20 Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes in the vaccine.  Specifically, the ACIP voted to recommend Prevnar 20 for adults aged 65 and older, and adults aged 19 to 64 with certain risk conditions without the need to be followed by PPC V23 vaccination. This recommendation recognizes for the first time the significance of helping protect more population under age 65 with comorbid and immunocompromising conditions who are at increased risk of disease against these 20 diseases causing serotypes. This new one-dose regimen option, once endorsed by the CDC director, also will help simplify longstanding adult pneumococcal recommendations. As a reminder, Prevnar 20 is the only vaccine the FDA has approved not only for invasive pneumococcal disease, but also for Pneumonia. In September, I assume many of you saw that the FDA issued a drug safety communication related which completed review of the Xeljanz oral survey on trial. We are in continuing dialogue with the FDA about its assessment and the resulting final context in Xeljanz label. With this important step taken, we hope we are a step closer to having an update regarding the new drug application for abroticinib in atopic dermatitis, and the supplemental NDA for Xeljanz in [Indiscernible] both of which are currently under FDA review. In terms of Xeljanz, it's currently approved indication in the U.S., we believe that Xeljanz prescribing behavior will adjust in the coming months based on the FDA's update, resulting in an initial correction in the short-term.  But based on the trends we have observed and the broad application of Xeljanz across its approved indications, we believe Xeljanz has the potential to return to growth. Again, once the final risk label is issued and physicians have adjusted their prescribing habits accordingly as we go into 2022 and beyond. [Indiscernible] received marketing authorization for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and over from the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency and the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in both doses. It also received a positive of being in adults from the European Medicines Agency Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. We are hopeful this momentum will continue. We have applications currently filed for review with regulators around the globe, including in the U.S. and Australia. Overall, we remain confident in the importance of the JAK inhibitor class for appropriate patients with inflammatory diseases, and they are pursuing a variety of options for advancing additional JAK inhibitor assets within our portfolio. For example, Pfizer has granted an exclusive license to Brepocitinib and TYK2 both in Phase IIII development to a new Company, formed in collaboration with a partner that has a proven track record in late-stage inflammation and immunology drug development. The new Company will direct all future development decisions while Pfizer will have a 25% stake and retain certain ex-U.S. commercial rights for Brepocitinib and TYK2. This transaction will enable the allocation of resources to advance development of Brepocitinib and TYK2 while allowing Pfizer to focus on diversifying its pipeline.  And either way, in which we are continuing to bolster our pipeline is through strategic business development agreements. This slide highlights 10 such agreements we have entered into -- in recent years, spanning four different therapeutic areas. To further build on our strength in cancer research, we acquired Array BioPharma. The team in Boulder, Colorado has become a center of excellence for targeted therapies in not only cancer, but other diseases as well. With an expected 1-2 new compounds entering the clinic every year. Leveraging our strength in gene therapy, we entered into a collaboration with Vivet Therapeutics for a potential gene therapy for Wilson Disease, a rare genetic disorder that can cause severe hepatic damage, neurological symptoms, and potentially death. Our acquisition of Therachon builds on our rare disease team's 30 years commitment to develop innovative medicines that address significant unmet medical needs of people with rare diseases. Regarding our worldwide exclusive licensing agreement with Akcea, we believe our expertise and breadth of experience in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases makes us well suited to accelerate clinical development of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx, an investigational antisense therapy being developed to treat patients with certain cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.  We are excited about our collaboration with Valneva to develop and commercialize Valneva's Lyme disease vaccine candidate, VLA15, the only active Lyme disease vaccine program in clinical development today. Of course, our collaboration with BioNTech on the COVID-19 vaccine led to the first mRNA vaccine ever approved, and this relationship was born out of our companies' initial collaboration to develop an improved flu vaccine based on mRNA tech. Building on our strengths in prostate cancer and women's health, we have entered into an agreement with Myovant. Joined them in development and commercialize Orcovix Relugolix in advanced prostate cancer, and Relugolics combination tablet in women's health in the U.S. and Canada. Our global collaboration with our Arvinas to develop and commercialize RV 471 and investigational oral product estrogen receptor protein degrader built on our metastatic breast cancer franchise, allowing us to potentially go into earlier non-metastatic patients and add to efficacy of [Indiscernible] in a metastatic setting. Trillium CD47, SIRP-Alpha focus technology has the potential to be a foundational in cancer immunotherapy as [Indiscernible] have been. We look forward to that acquisition closing later this year and in the first half of 2022. With pre approvals, four EUAs and multiple submissions in the readouts, these transactions are already bearing fruit and positioning us to reach even more pace. Before I close, I want to welcome to the call Aamir Malik, who joined us in August as Executive Vice President and Chief Business Development -- and Chief Business Innovation Officer. Aamir came to us from McKinsey, where during his 25-year career, he has developed growth strategies, guided mergers and acquisitions, and implemented large-scale programs to improve patients' lives and transform performance for life science companies. This includes working closely with Pfizer on several strategic initiatives.  I have known Aamir for more than 50 years, and I'm certain he will be an incredible addition to Pfizer as we look to the next era of innovation. Looking ahead, we continue to focus on driving operational excellence across the organization and pursuing the kinds of first-in-class science that will define the new Pfizer. Given our Third Quarter performance and our current expectations for the near-term, we continue to expect a revenue CAGR of at least 6% on a risk-adjusted basis through the end of 2025 and double-digit growth on the bottom line. I would remind you that these projections do not include any potential impact from Comirnaty, recent or subsequent business development activities, or potential future mRNA programs.  Rather, we remain very confident in our ability to achieve these growth rates because of the strength of our current product portfolio and R&D pipeline. Now, I will turn it over to Mikael to speak more about our R&D efforts, and then Frank will provide financial details on the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2021, which looks solid. Mikael. Mikael Dolsten : Thank you, Albert. I appreciate the chance to share updates on Pfizer's robust R&D pipeline. As the measure of the transformation that we've instituted in our R&D organization, we track our average clinical success rates against peers. In every phase and in trend we achieved greater success rates than peer average in 2020, and have continued to sustain those higher rates in '21. Today I will provide updates from our vaccines, rare disease, inflammation immunology portfolios, and on our overall protease inhibitor. In several cases, I will reference publicly available data on other agents so that you can understand our enthusiasm about what we're seeing in our development program.  Of course, head-to-head clinical trials would be necessary to support any comparative claim. Last Friday, the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization for 5 to 11-year-old and the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, is meeting today to discuss recommendation. On the left, we show with the comparable immune response observed with 10 microgram dosing in children 5 through 11, compared to 30 microgram dosing in 16 to 25 year. On the right, we show 90.7% vaccine efficacy observed. This too, is comparable to what we have seen in older population. The rate and severity of fever and chills of the first and second doses were less in the younger children than either adolescents or adults.  We believe that vaccinating younger children is one important step in making our way through this pandemic. Looking ahead, we expect initial pivotal data from the studies in 2 to less than 5-years-old this quarter. And in 6 months to less than 2-years old next quarter, with full data readouts to follow. On the right, we show improved handling conditions that have been approved for vials to those 5 to 11-year olds. Of note are the smaller pack sizes and the ability to refrigerate for up to 10 weeks. We plan to submit data to regulators for potential approval of similar handling conditions for vials used to dose the 12 and older population. We are the first manufacturer to report Phase III clinical efficacy data on a third dose boost and, to the best of our knowledge, are the only Company with an ongoing pivotal efficacy boost study. In a study of participant 16 and older, shown on top, a booster demonstrated a relative vaccine efficacy of 95.6% compared to the original two-dose schedule during a period in which Delta was the prevalent strain, affirming the protective impact of the early immunological data which led to the EUA. It's projected that the third dose boost vaccine efficacy is even higher compared to the unvaccinated population, potentially above 98%. This assumes that vaccine efficacy for those vaccinated with two-doses versus unvaccinated is above 55% at this time point. We observed consistent efficacy in younger and older adults.  While the majority of cases were in the older age group, as would be expected, we recorded a relative vaccine efficacy of 100% in individuals aged 16 to 30 years. Data from Israel shown at the bottom and published by Professor Mark Lipsitch of Harvard and others in Lancet, showed that the third dose, protected individuals against severe COVID-19 related outcome. We plan to monitor the participants in our clinical study, and at an appropriate time, consider a randomized fourth dose boost the study to document the impact of additional and possibly annual repeat vaccination.  This will be supplemented with real-world evidence data. Countries have started to recognize the favorable risk-benefit profile of our vaccine. In each country shown here, our vaccines recommended were the only one permitted in younger populations, and indicates of [Indiscernible] not restricted for boosting. News over the weekend from another manufacturer suggest that their vaccine may not be available in the near-term for younger population. We are encouraged by these science-driven decisions, which have helped make Comirnaty one of the most used COVID-19 vaccines globally.  Next, gene therapy. In hemophilia A, we have temporarily and voluntarily paused screening and dosing in our Phase III study evaluating Factor VIII gene therapy, which we're developing with Sangamo, in order to implement a protocol amendment following their observance of Factor VIII levels greater than 150% in some trial participants. To date, no patient has experienced a [Indiscernible] event and some patients are being treated with oral anticoagulant to reduce the risk of thrombosis. We are committed to resuming dosing as quickly as possible once the protocol amendment, which is intended to provide guidelines for clinical management of elevated Factor VIII levels is implemented.  Separately based on recent interaction with the FDA, Pfizer no longer plans to conduct an interim analysis of Phase III data from our EMA and B gene therapy programs. We anticipate pivotal data readout to be based on full analysis of at least 50 study participants for EMA and 40 participants for the hemophilia B program. This will push out the timing of readout of those trial compared to our previous expectation. For Hem A, we're working to evaluate the impact of both the FDA feedback as well as the protocol amendment on timelines and we'll share an update at the appropriate time. For hemophilia B, we anticipate a readout in the First Quarter of '23. We continue to collect long-term fall updates in our Phase 1b DMD study, in which 19 ambulatory boys in the U.S. have been treated and plan to represent the 1-year dataset at a scientific meeting. We recently shared information on muscle weakness, [Indiscernible]. In some cases, with [Indiscernible] in three participants in Phase III ambulatory trial with a specific subset of dystrophin truncation notation. They were treated with higher doses of steroids and all improved within a few weeks, were discharged from the hospital and have recovered or are still recovering.  The Data Monitoring Committee have confirmed that immunological assessment performed in the trial support the hypothesis that the immune response against the immunity's [Indiscernible] protein [Indiscernible] This type of reaction is a risk potentially inherent of any gene replacement therapy, and similar severe adverse events report in other programs to support the notion that is since classified. We have proposed the protocol change to exclude patients with [Indiscernible] affecting X-somes 9 through 13 inclusive or a deletion that affect both X-somes 29 and 30. A few sites have resumed new patients\u2019 activities and we anticipate that nearly all ex-U.S. trial sites will have restarted clinical activity by the end of this month. These mutations are estimated to represent less than 15%, 15 of patients with DMD. We recognized the devastating impact the DMD has on this boy and their families and plan to include patients with some of these excluded mutations in future study. In addition, we continue to work with FDA to address outstanding R&D questions related to the Phase III studies, including technical aspects of our potency assay matrix. We have made considerable progress with development of the [Indiscernible] as per FDA guidance, and are now in an active phase of filing this update. While we cannot speculate as to when site may open, we're working to reach alignment with the FDA as soon as possible. In addition, we have 12 pre-clinical gene therapy programs and are anticipating approximately 1-2 [Indiscernible] each year. We'll now turn to a high potency PDE4 plus immune modulator, we are exploring in atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. Topical delivered high potency PDE4 plus inhibition may offer differentiated efficacy and safety profile compared to other mechanism of action whether used orally or topically. PDE4 inhibition could provide both rapid and deep responses versus other agents, with the potential for further improvement at higher doses. Even at a significant lower dose, we observed promising clinical efficacy compared to what we have seen with PDE4 topicals in other trials. We expect to initiate Phase 2b studies in both diseases in 2022, exploring higher doses.  On the left, we show in vitro potency at the low dose versus Roflumilast and Crisaborole. Our assets demonstrated approximately 240-fold greater inhibition of IL-4 and approximately 25-fold great inhibition of IL-13 versus Roflumilast. On the right, we observed the clinical and significant improvement in excema area severity versus comparatives in other studies, with a 45% reduction from baseline at Week 6. Our assets show stronger or similar efficacy at Week 6 as compared to reported data from another study at Week 8 with the recently approved topical JAK 12 inhibitor Ruxolitinib. There was no stinging observed at application site. On the left, we saw an approximately 80% reduction in IL-23 versus activated skin [Indiscernible] vehicle in an in vitro skin model. This displays a relevant mechanism of action for high potency DD4 plus in psoriasis. On the right, patients we saw significant clinical improvement in psoriasis area and severity versus a comparator in a separate study with a 4.5-point reduction from baseline at Week 6. Let's turn to a TL1A inhibitor, which targets a newly identified member of the TNFs super family being explored for ulcerative colitis. In a Phase 2a study, we saw a promising endoscopic improvement. Based on the benefit risk profile seen, there's a potential for TL1A inhibition to be used earlier in the treatment paradigm. Phase 2b studies inflammatory bowel disease is ongoing with estimated primary completion in the Fourth Quarter of '22.  On the left, our TL1A inhibitor demonstrated greater endoscopic improvement than what Tofacitinib demonstrated in a similar trial with 34% of patients responding at Week 14. We matched the population based on the characteristic of those involved in our TL1A study using propensity score matching. The Week 4 [Indiscernible] Tofacitinib is interpolated based on Week 8 data of the induction study and Month 12 data from the maintenance and open-label studies. On the right, a post-talk analysis found that 48% of patients who had biomarkers achieved endoscopic improvement versus 13% of patients who were biomark negative.  Approximately 70% of patients were positively biomarker and we believe a precision medicine approach utilizing key biomarkers may enhance patient selection and improve patient outcomes. Next, it's an [Indiscernible] base inhibitor, a potential breakthrough therapy for dermatomyositis that we develop in a research collaboration with Mass Gen Brigham. This is a disease with very limited treatment option. In an ongoing Phase II clinical trial, we have observed significant reduction in clinical disease activity in skin compared to placebo. We anticipate the readout of the full Phase II study in the First Quarter of '22. On the left, in this figure, treatment compared -- demonstrated an 83.6 decrease in gene signature scores from baseline at Week 12 compared to 11.8 with placebo.  On the right, treatment also showed significant decrease in clinical disease activity at Week 12 compared to placebo. An important step in addressing the pandemic will be the availability of effective outpatient treatments for people who acquired COVID-19. In a paper published today in science, we share the design and pre-clinical profile of our novel investigational oral protease inhibitor, including its industrial pan-coronavirus antiviral activity, in vivo efficacy, selectivity and pre-clinical safety profile. A robust program to study the breadth of both treatment and prevention in high risk, standard risk, and household contact populations is well underway. Projected pivotal readouts start potentially this quarter and extend through mid '22.  Finally, our recent milestones are a reflection of those high clinical success rates that are shared at the beginning, and we look forward to continuing the momentum in '22. Select milestones expected in the Fourth Quarter include a pivotal data readout for our C. difficile candidates, a proof-of-concept readout for [Indiscernible] for severe hypertriglyceridemia and cardiovascular risk reduction. And a proof of concept readout for [Indiscernible] or diabetes. Milestones expected in the first half of 2022 include Phase III results for our RSV adult and maternal vaccine candidate.  A potential pivotal Phase II results for [Indiscernible] in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma. A proof-of-concept readout for our mRNA flu vaccine candidate a phase to be proof-of-concept readout for the potential Lyme disease vaccine on which we are collaborating with Valneva. A proof-of-concept readout for ROBO2 FC or focal segmental [Indiscernible], a proof of concept readout for Danuglipron for obesity, and Phase III results of Talzenna and Xtandi in first-line metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. In addition, we expect continued active business development to further augment the clinical portfolio. Thank you for your attention and I look forward to your questions. Now, let me turn it over to Frank. Frank D\u2019amelio: Thanks, Mikael. I know you've seen our release, so let me provide a few highlights regarding the financials. The COVID-19 vaccine, once again, had a significant positive impact on our quarterly results and Albert has already addressed the key points on the COVID-19 landscape. Turning to the income statement, revenue increased to a 130% operationally in the Third Quarter of 2021, driven by COVID-19 vaccine sales and strong performance from a number of our other key growth drivers. And looking at the revenue growth, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine contribution from direct sales and Alliance revenues as Albert said earlier, we saw a continuation of solid performance from the businesses again this quarter, delivering 7% operational revenue growth despite a negative 5% impact from price.  Getting us to a robust volume growth of 12% for the business, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine contribution. The 12% volume growth is in spite of an approximately 2% negative impact to growth from Chantix recall and distribution pause. This supports our projected revenue CAGR of at least 6% from 2020 through the end of 2025. Of course, there will be some variability in quarterly growth rate to a variety of factors, but we continue to expect at least 6% CAGR through 2025. There was no impact from the number of selling days in the quarter as compared to the year-ago period, like we saw on our First Quarter, where we had more selling days compared to the year-ago period.  I'd remind you that the offset to this imbalance will be seen in the Fourth Quarter results, where we will have fewer selling days as compared to the year-ago quarter. For the full year, this results in essentially the same number of selling days in 21 as 2020. I will come back to this in a little bit when I discuss the updated guidance. The adjusted cost of sales increased shown here, reduced this quarter's gross margin by approximately 22% percentage points compared to the Third Quarter of 2020, which is almost entirely driven by the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine. Adjusted SI&A expenses increased primarily due to a level of promotional spend, sales force activity, or similar to pre-pandemic levels. The increase in adjusted R&D expense this quarter, was primarily driven by increased investments in COVID-19 related programs, as well as other programs within our pipeline. The growth rate for reported diluted EPS was 445%, while adjusted diluted EPS grew a 129% [Indiscernible]. Foreign exchange movements resulted in a 4% benefit to revenue, as well as a 4% benefit or $0.02 to adjusted diluted EPS. Let's move to our revised 2021 guidance. We have again provided total Company guidance which includes the business with the COVID-19 vaccine. And then we provided some additional sub ledger details on our assumptions on the projected COVID-19 vaccine contribution and the business without the COVID-19 vaccine. Our revenue guidance has increased, and we now expect total Company revenue to be in a range of $81 to $82 billion, increasing by $2.5 billion at the midpoint.  With the COVID-19 vaccine revenue for the year now expected to be approximately $36 billion, an increase of approximately $2.5 billion compared to our prior guidance. The projected COVID-19 vaccine revenue as a percentage of total Company revenue at the midpoint has increased to 44% as compared to 42% at our previous ' 21 guidance. I'll come back to that in a minute. We also adjusted our cost and expense guidance, mostly to reflect actual performance to date. Let me give you some more detail here. Adjusted cost of sales to range has decreased to between 39.1% to 39.6%.  On adjusted SI&A, we have tightened the range and now expect $11.6 to $12.1 billion a decrease for a $150 million at the midpoint. In addition, we increased our adjusted R&D guidance range to $10.4 to $10.9 billion, an increase of $400 million at the endpoint to reflect anticipated incremental spending on COVID-19 and other mRNA -based projects. We are keeping our assumption for the effective tax rate for the year flat compared to prior guidance at approximately 16%. This yields an increased adjusted diluted EPS range of $4.13 to $4.18, or 84% growth at the midpoint compared to 2020, including an expected 4% benefit from foreign exchange.  Let me quickly remind you of some assumptions in context on the projected COVID-19 vaccine contribution and our collaboration agreement. As discussed earlier, the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine collaboration construct is a 50/50 gross profit split. Pfizer books the vast majority of the global collaboration revenue, except for Germany and Turkey where we receive a profit share from BioNTech, and we do not participate in the China region. We continue to expect that we can manufacture 3 billion doses in total by the end of 2021. The $2.5 billion increase in expected COVID revenues to 36 billion primarily represents the impact of contracts signed since mid-July, which was the cut-off for our prior guidance.  This assumes deliveries of approximately 2.3 billion doses in fiscal year 2021 compared to prior guidance of deliveries of 2.1 billion doses and continues to assume that we will produce 3 billion doses during calendar year 2021. This difference of 700 million doses represents doses which will be delivered in fiscal year 2022. To refresh your memory, our cost of sales for the COVID-19 vaccine revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs, applicable royalty expenses, and a payment to BioNtech representing the 50% gross profit split. We continue to expect that the adjusted income before tax margin for the COVID-19 vaccine contribution, to be in the high 20s as a percentage of revenue. This margin level also includes the anticipated spending on additional mRNA programs and spending on the COVID-19 protease inhibitor antiviral programs. If we remove the projected COVID-19 vaccine contribution from both periods, you will see that we slightly decreased to 2021 revenue range to$ 45 to $46 billion. So, representing approximately 6% operational revenue growth at the midpoint. The decrease in guidance at the midpoint largely reflects the impact from the [Indiscernible] and pause in shipments. Terms of adjusted diluted EPS without the contribution from the COVID-19 vaccine, we have increased the range to be between 260 to 265 for the year which represents approximately 12% operational growth at the midpoint. These growth rates are all consistent on how we've been publicly positioning the business post the Upjohn separation. You may notice that the implied Q4 guidance suggests non-COVID-19 operational revenue to decline by 1%, especially as compared to the revenue growth that we've seen year-to-date of 8%. Let me walk through the drivers of this. The largest driver of the decline, is a difference in number of selling days, compared to the comparable quarter in 2020. You will remember my discussion as extra selling days in Q1 when we had 3 more selling days in the U.S. and 4 more selling days in the international markets.  And I talked then about how Q4 would largely offset that impact, leaving 2021 as a whole with approximately the same number of selling days, 2020. In Q4, we will now have four fewer selling days each in domestic and international, eight less in total as compared to Q4, 2020. This is expected to decrease sales by approximately $600 million, and have a negative impact of the growth rate of 6% for the Company, excluding COVID vaccine sales. We expect the Chantix sales to be zero in Q4 due to recall and pause in shipments, representing another 2% headwind to growth. And while it is not on normal practice to discuss 2022 outlook during the Q3 conference call, I wanted to make a brief comment related to potential Comirnaty sales next year, and we've noticed some estimates of those sales would be very high. While we have the capacity to produce 4 billion doses in 2022 at this point, we expect to recognize revenues for 1.7 billion doses in 2022, representing COVID vaccine direct sales and Alliance revenues approximately $29 billion. We continue to engage with governments regarding potential future orders for 2022 including doses for which certain governments have the option to order and take deliveries in 2022. And going forward, we will continue to be prudent in our capital allocation activities with the opportunities for deployment shown here on this slide.  In summary, a strong quarter and first nine months of the year, based on continued strong performance for our growth drivers. We have increased our revenue and EPS guidance for the remainder of the year, mainly driven by increased expectations for Comirnaty sales. Our pipeline continues to advance and we have invested to support that advance. We look forward to an expected closing of the Trillium acquisition as soon as this quarter or in the first half of 2022, subject to the satisfaction of the closing conditions. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to start to start the Q&A session. Chris Stevo : Thanks, Frank. Sylvia, we're ready for our first question, please. Operator : Your first question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Umer Raffat : Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I have three today, if I may. Perhaps first, Albert, do you expect vaccine efficacy on hospitalizations to fade overtime? I know this has been a big point of discussion and has direct implications for the longer-term booster usage. Do you expect the hospitalization efficacy to dip below, let\u2019s say, an 80% number? Number two, on the protease inhibitor, I was curious if you guys are expecting different activity in the high-risk versus a low-risk trial? I acknowledge the endpoints are different, but is there any reason to expect viral load reduction to look different between the two? And then finally, on the DMD gene therapy trial, I was curious if you have evaluated anti dystrophin antibodies, perhaps beyond the patients with exon 9-13 or 29, 30. I am just trying to understand if there's a bit of an immune response against the dystrophin being made in other patients as well and whether that will be relevant for the primary endpoint or not. Thank you so much. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much. I think I will give all three questions to Mikael because they are clearly in his domain. Mikael, what do you think about the vaccine efficacy, the protease activity and the DMD? Mikael Dolsten : Thank you very much. Our own studies, the real-world evidence is these coming from Israel all show that you do get waning over time, driven by the immune system, as expected, gradually reducing antibodies in the blood and activate the immune cells, as well as the appearance of more aggressive strain, in this case, the Delta strain. We think that the data show that you first lose protection against symptomatic disease as you have noted in our trials. And then you lose some protection, but more stage loss over severe disease and hospitalization. We were really pleased to share with you today that when you look at the real-world evidence data, we're able, in a very meaningful and substantial way, improve with a third dose boost against all facets of disease, whether symptomatic, whether severe postpartum utilization, and even death.  So yes, there is just a shift in time, and that's why we already now are preparing for revaccination when the third boost immunity may start to fade possibly off the year, which we think would be the type of data to generate to support more of an annual vaccination similar as flu. For the oral protease inhibitor, we think there is an opportunity with our approach where we are able to have high levels of the oral drug to get robust efficacy against high risk and low risk. And that's obviously what we would like to see as the trial reads out and we have to wait for data. I just wanted to emphasize that our standard risk group includes vaccinated breakthrough infection and non-vaccinated with their standard risk. This is the only trial currently running to the best of my knowledge that contains a study population that are vaccinated and we'll get possibly breakthrough infection. It's really unique indication, which is expected to have more and more prominence once the majority of people are vaccinated. And finally, the household study - exposure study, in that one, we expect based on previous experiences from Tamiflu and other antiviral drug that you're likely to get a good probability for even higher, hopefully a very high, antiviral effect. On DMD gene therapy, we're looking at ways to support this patient group that lack a part of the DMD protein, so they are not tolerant to their own protein and hence they generate an immune response to that part when they get the new gene.  I don't think that will happen in any individuals that are born with all components of the dystrophin, but maybe mutated to be not highly functional. So, our focus right now is to executing the majority of patients 85% and then developing supportive protocols, which we think are very feasible also for those that have less tolerance and are more prone direct when they're given the full normal dystrophin transgene. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much, Mikael. Let's go to the next question. Operator : Your next question comes from Vamil Divan from Mizuho Securities. Vamil Divan : Great. Thank you so much for taking my questions. So maybe just a couple like the one -- I appreciate, Frank, the comments you made around 2022 by in terms of the COVID vaccine sales. Can you maybe just share updated thoughts on how you guys are seeing the revenue stream from these vaccines are playing out over time? A lot of focus beyond \u201823, \u201824, \u201925. And so connected with that, or maybe a broader question about a year ago, you guys hosted that R&D Day and kind of went through the whole pipeline and talked about the $18 billion to $20 billion of revenue that you expect to lose because of that exploration starting in 2026. At that point, you mentioned that the pipeline you felt with the least provision to replace that revenue stream? I'm curious, given everything that\u2019s happened in the past year, kind of what's your updated expectations on your ability to overcome those patent losses in the future? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Frank, do you want to take out this? And then also Angela, you can chime in on the revenue stream. Frank D\u2019amelio: Thanks, Albert. Hi, Vamil. So, Vamil, the way I would think about '22 is kind of a rhythm that's similar to '21. And what I mean is, we'll continue to update the numbers for '22, based on the contracts that we've signed and then obviously the deliveries that will be shipped in '22 that go with those contracts. So, think about this year, as we've updated our guidance each quarter, we've been able to increase our revenue guidance to the COVID vaccine because of incremental contracts signed from one quarter to the next. We're using that same approach for 2022. So right now, 1.7 billion, I call that kind of banked, if you will, in terms of the doses and the $29 million that goes with that. Obviously, we've got to ship those doses, but we have contracts in hand that support the 1.7 billion doses and the $29 billion revenue. So that'll be the rhythm of the numbers, the way to think about it going forward in '22. Beyond '22, obviously, we're working our way through those numbers. We continue to believe that the vaccine has durability and that there will continue to be significant revenues beyond '22, but in terms of specifics there, we're continuing to work on that. Albert, I can turn that over to Angela if you'd like. Albert Bourla : Yes please, Angela. Angela Hwang : Sure. Thank you. And maybe just one more add to that, which is that, as you look into '22 and also the out-years, as Frank said, we will update you as the contracts get confirmed. But many of our contracts already have been confirmed and those are multi-year contracts. So, we already know that looking into '22 and the out years, that there are some that are going to continue to be government-driven. And then maybe the one other thing that will change over the next in the foreseeable future, is just the development of a private market. And most likely, we\u2019ll see that developing in the U.S. sooner than the others, because that's -- ex-U.S. is where the multiyear contracts have already been secured.  But I think that that will be something -- a new dynamic that we are absolutely ready to manage. And we're already transitioning our portfolio. And if you look at the presentations of the vaccine that we have into smaller pack sizes, this instead of stability, different storage enhancements that we're making all with the view of preparing to transition into vaccinations in the community setting, and preparing for a durable business. So, I would just add that to what Frank just mentioned. Albert Bourla : Thanks Angela. And what I will add in this question in addition to what Angela said, I will add that also commercial that's a position of strength for us. I think moving into a private market that's where we know how to make a difference as well. The other thing that I will say it is as you've noticed from the numbers, we are moving ahead to produce 4 billion doses. And we have already secured the contracts for 1.7 billion doses. And there are some more that we have secure in terms of options. And clearly, we have a big number of countries that we're negotiating with us. But again, I will raise my concern what I had raised in August of last year when most of the negotiation for doses in the next year are coming from high-income countries and some middle-income countries. I think we are producing enough, but for the low- and middle-income countries who received non-for-profit at the lower income countries with very severely discounted price for the middle-income countries they need to place orders. That's including COVAX and to WHO all of them. So, the $4 billion doses that they're going to produce, they are still highly negotiated by the high-end upper middle-class countries and I don't want to reach that level, but again, the low-end middle-income counties would be behind in deliveries because they didn't place their orders amount, so that's one.  As regard the broader question of the 6%, I think nothing has changed, if anything, I think the probabilities are improving in terms of how our pipeline can cover the gap to make sure that we have a 6%. So, when it comes to the 6% for all the years to after '25, we think we feel very, very confident that we will achieve it. And then I remind everyone that this is excluding all this new mRNA that we're working, excluding COVID. So, all of that is -- COVID vaccines -- all of that I think are in a very, very good state. And we are very encouraged with the modern pipeline, the pipeline that comes to fill the gap between '25 and '30.  And this is also where we believe that right now, we can bring it significantly up. What the street projects as a severe decline, I think already with our pipeline, our projections are saying that we will take it to slight growth -- flat to slight growth. And we are very much looking forward to higher programs and we're looking forward to business development to -- because the goal is to sustain a 6% growth from the second part of [Indiscernible] as well, if possible. Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Tim Anderson : Thank you. On the oral protease inhibitor, it's closely watched by investors now that Merck has positive results with Molnupiravir but it seems like in your prepared remarks, you spend more time talking about various [Indiscernible] programs in your pipeline versus this one where we'll have readouts sooner. So, I'm wondering if this suggests a lower level of confidence by Pfizer in these upcoming readouts. And then can you just talk about your views of Molnupiravir and also the recent data they released. And also, how do you think drugs like this, whether it's your own PI or Molnupiravir will be used in a real-world setting? Will it primarily be used in the studied populations which is really unvaccinated patients or will it be used more broadly? Albert Bourla : Thank you very much. We're very bullish on the oral inhibitor. This is why, earlier this year during summer, I approved another billion-dollar investment at risk to start manufacturing [Indiscernible] and, of course, to start -- to run three studies in parallel; one for the high-risk population, one for the standard population and one for the household, or let's say context population. We -- the studies are ongoing, so there is not much to say right now, other than we feel optimistic. But we need to see the results of the studies and if possible, we'll be ready. And we -- the way that those will be used, I think it is a -- there's significant part in the high-risk population, but because the cost of these medicines is way cheaper than the antibodies, I think the standard population also will have a significant uptake. And of course, there is a high-volume opportunity in the contact population -- in household contact population, that could really change the paradigm. There will be unvaccinated population but what unfortunately, will have them majority of the infections. And I think these medicines will be predominantly coming to them, but there will be also breakthrough infections either with people of high risk or with other people. But vaccinated people also will be in need of something like that. Actually, Mikael made the comment about that when he spoke about the study that we're running for standard risk of population to our knowledge is the only one that it is around. Just to make sure that there's no misunderstandings here, we are investing very heavily and recount we are cautiously optimistic that the studies will reveal the data, but we will speak when the data are here.  Now, as regards [Indiscernible], I will ask Mikael to make some points, but I would like to say that I don't think it is appropriate for us to comment on other oral inhibitor. I think the fact that Merck's product announced the 50% efficacy. I think that's great news for patients and a great news for the medical community. But hopefully if the product is approved, they will have an option in their hand. Mikael, do have anything to add to that without going to [Indiscernible] Merck's product that they should be the ones to speak about it. Mikael Dolsten : Absolutely. I think you outlined it very well. We are optimistic, enthusiastic, but as always, we're waiting for the data that we hope to come before year-end for the high-risk. The standard risk as you heard, we are only one running such a study for an oral drug. It's really unique opportunity, and it will be a growing need for those that do not get repeat vaccinations. And I think for the household study, a protease inhibitor, with its well-known safety is really intriguing.  As you know, protease inhibitor of this kind does not possess risk for the type of side effects [Indiscernible] that seen off sometimes with polymerase inhibitor and require longer follow-up before you know about the potential impact. That's why we think the protease inhibitor is really perfect shift for the pandemic moving over gradually, hopefully to an endemic. And we're just waiting eagerly to see it will help. Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Ronny Gal : Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. I have three, if I may. First, regarding your [Indiscernible] biosimilar, you kind of noticed the switch drive has been successful. You've not comment specifically on filing for interchangeability. Can you clarify that point? Second, going across the wires are some comments from DC about negotiating drug prices for 30 drugs by 2028 as part of the negotiated agreement. Is this something that drug industry can live with or not?  Is this something you're objecting to, or is this something that within a great bargain that will settle drug prices for the Drug Price legislation for the next 3 years, is this something the drug industry is comfortable with? And last, regarding your oral GLP-1, [Indiscernible] are you expecting results in diabetes in the Fourth Quarter of this year? Some of your peers suggested that the intraday variation in blood concentration of GLP-1 is bound to lead to higher side effect profile for the efficacy delivered. Can you discuss what is your view here? Albert Bourla : Thank you very much Ronny. I will answer the drug price and Angela, I will pass you the biosimilar question and the rest of the oral GLP-1 to Mikael. So let me start with negotiating the drug price. First of all, I think that we have an issue, I said in multiple times with drug price. But the issue is not the cost to the healthcare system. [Indiscernible] the cost out-of-pocket for the patients for taking their medicines. The cost of drug pricing to the overall healthcare system, it is 12%. So, by definition, it cannot be the big problem. And this cost is going down. In the U.S. in the First Quarter was minus 5, in the Second Quarter it was minus 5, in the Third Quarter is minus 5, in our audited numbers of Pfizer but the -- in fact -- of price. Problem is that none of our patients that are taking our medicines are experienced minus 5 in what they pay.  Actually, they are experiencing increases. And this is because there is a problem with insurance system that forces, tremendous out-of-pocket when it comes to medicines which is not the case when it comes to other, let's say, medical interventions, diagnostics, [Indiscernible] fees, hospitals you name it. Now, what needs to be done is, to have a reform in a way that will affect out of pocket for the patients. And I truly believe that there is a deal to be made right now in Washington. I truly believe that. And I think that the Congress should not miss the opportunity to find a deal right now that will reduce the out of pocket cost of patients which is the main, main issue right now. When it comes to negotiating drug pricing, negotiation is good and are happening right now.  Medicare negotiates very effectively with us. What people, some parts of the political spectrum, wants to see, is not negotiation, it is price fixing. What they're suggesting is negotiation it is that we will be tell the price that if we disagree with this price, then they will tax us 90%, 95% on everything that we sell in the private market. So, this is not negotiation, this is clearly a price fixing. That I think we -- is going to be a very big mistake to see that happening [Indiscernible] we are objecting. But what I want to emphasize here is not if we are disagreeing in negotiating with our pricing, I think it's a great opportunity to have a deal right now in the Congress and -- that will significantly reduce the out-of-pocket cost of the patients when they are taking their meds. Now, with that I'm passing to Angela to speak about the [Indiscernible] Angela Hwang : For the biosimilar for [Indiscernible], we will have interchangeability studies and we're finding that in December 2021. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Angela. Angela Hwang : Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : Yes. The oral GLP-1, I think it's a class with a lot of promise. I think [Indiscernible] is currently the most advanced true oral small molecule. It has not at all the same type of full defects in direction as been seen with oral delivered peptide. As you stated, we will have soon this year a readout with a slower titration for diabetes to optimize efficacy, convenience, and tolerability. This is well known for all introduced GLP-1 peptides.  We'll later next year have an obesity readout and you noted [Indiscernible] an oral has an opportunity to be possibly the most powerful within the oral segment, and are much more convenient form for the injectable, particularly for the new emerging segments of obese patients that need metabolic control. This is very attractive type of treatment to come. And we look forward to generate more data and understand these types of new emerging through oral, how to optimally position it. Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen. Steve Scala : Thank you. A couple of questions. First on the oral COVID antiviral, the initial data seems to have been delayed from the Third Quarter or the Fourth Quarter of this year to the Fourth Quarter of this year and the First Quarter of next year. So, what is the reason for the delay, for instance, are the events tracking below expectations? And secondly, a follow-up on [Indiscernible]. So, the readout in obesity in the first half of next year is quite intriguing. How quickly thereafter, assuming it's positive, could a Phase III study in obesity alone generate results? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you, a very good question. By the way, I don't think that we ever expected the oral in Q3. I'm not sure if something like that was ever said. I think we were always expecting it in the Q4 and still this is a very big chance that this would be the expectation. We'll give a range of Q4 to Q1 of next year, but still this is the expectation that there's very highly chance that we'll have it by the end of the year.  But again, things are improving nicely in all three studies of the oral. But sometimes you need to stop and wait for the data to speak for themselves. So that's our attitudes we are preparing for it. We are manufacturing and we will be ready if hopefully the data are positive. And now about our obesity drug, Mikael, can you take this question? Mikael Dolsten : Yes. Just wanted to echo what you said, Albert, we have 305 enrolling well, across all the oral PI and we have used this target date for the quite loss periods. So, we are on track. And all looks well, we'll just wait for the readouts. [Indiscernible] in obesity, we optimize obviously for the titration, as I discussed, because that's important in order to deliver this quite encouraging data that has recently been seen with GLP-1 class injectable. Some reports have shown much above 10% body weight with metabolic gains.  So that's really the purpose to get the right titration, stage titration. And this is a small molecule that we have developed manufacturing processes. So, pending data and dialogues with regulators. I think this is study that could progress quite fast to Phase III as the CMC is not complicated and the drug class is very well-known for regulators, just that this is an oral with an upside. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Louise Chen from Cantor. Louise Chen : Hi, thanks for taking my question. My first question is on the oral antiviral for COVID. Just curious how much you think you can manufacture -- how much you can manufacture, what do you think about the durability of these sales? And then is there any first-mover advantage to getting on the market with this? And then my second question is just on CD47, quite a few in development. So how do you plan to differentiate your Trillium assets? Thank you. Albert Bourla : On the oral, as I said, we keep manufacturing and depends on how much -- we will have already product available this year. And then of course, as we are moving into next year, our manufacturing capacity is ramping up. The durability of this franchise, is more or less analog to the durability of the vaccines franchise, because as long as you had COVID around, you will have a need to vaccinate and protect and then you will have a need to treat and save lives. And I think the durability I expect to be -- given that COVID has been really across the globe and in so many parts of the globe, and I think we're speaking about the years of durability. But of course, that remains to be seen, that's only my assessment. Mikael, can you speak about the CD47? Mikael Dolsten : Yeah. Now, that's a great question. We think there are several aspects of unique differentiation and that's obviously why we were keen to work on the Trillium product. Number 1. This is ligand trap with an effusion to provide longer half-life. So, it has a lower binding to CD47 than a typical antibody. And it has shown both the in pre-clinical studies and now in clinical studies that you do not get the problematic on target anemia that you see with antibodies. So that's an important unique thing, it matters a lot, particularly for blood cancer patients which already have a fragile bone marrow function, but also for potential solid cancers that are treated with various chemotherapy backbone.  Number 2 is this product is to the best of my knowledge the only one that have showed single agent activity in blood cancers and we have the most advanced dataset coming out in lymphoid malignancies, both related to B-cell malignancies, lymphomas and myelomas. And we see opportunities to combine it with several existing Pfizer assets to give us unique life cycle management. So, several unique aspects, we look forward to posts -- to see potential deal closure, and to work with the staff in Trillium to accelerate these exciting assets. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael. And Angela, I didn't ask if you have to add anything on the oral in terms of the durability of the revenues other than what I said? Angela Hwang : Well, the market that we're looking at, we estimate to be about 150 -- up to 150 million people. When we look at the -- just vaccination rate, infection rates, and then the various risk groups that we talked about today; the high risk, the low risk, as well as those who just maybe in contact with those that are infected, this is the size of population that we're looking at. I think that this opportunity will allow -- is a very attractive one.  And I think that, again, the disease patterns will determine where we go with this, but certainly, it looks to be a durable opportunity as well. And also, not to forget that this is probably something that governments would likely -- would be interested in stockpiling, like the way -- like we saw in the flu. I think that that's an additional commercial opportunity to consider here. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Angela. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Matthew Harrison : Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have three, if you don't mind. So first one is, can you talk about the 2022 revenue for the for the COVID vaccine and just give us some sense of what is -- what of that is primary series and what of that is boosters and just how you think about that developing over time? Then second on your flu data for your mRNA vaccine.  Can you, I guess comment one, on if you've had any regulatory discussions and if you think you could get approved for just tighter data alone, or you need to run an actual efficacy study, and then secondly, what should we expect to see with that initial readout? And then third, can you just detail what the protocol changes for Hem A and what you think the underlying factors are that are driving those high levels of factor? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you. The 2022 revenues are mostly from the countries in --for COVID that Frank spoke. This $29 billion that we have already signed committed contracts of 1.7 billion doses. Those doses, when it comes to high income countries, they are mainly boosters. When it comes to middle income countries and to low-income countries, there is a mix of second doses -- of primary doses, particularly second because you will be given a lot this year [Indiscernible], and also some of them are boosters.  And this is why I said that the low and middle-income countries or even the low-income countries where we do not -- we give it at cost. They need to place orders so that they can secure allocations of our quantities for their boosters. They need to think. Now, I will ask Mikael to speak a little bit about our regulatory discussions on the efficacy, or not, for flu, and then why we're doing the protocol changes. Sorry. Mikael Dolsten : We're very intrigued by the use of mRNA for flu as it can generate both an antibody response against hemagglutinin and a T-cell response that can be protective, particularly for more severe flu cases. The current flu vaccine, the protein-based are not very potent on T-cell responses, and generate more intermediate level of antibodies. Whether you can register products on those type of immune parameters is something we are, of course, considering and as we generate data, we'll have dialogues with regulators. But, of course, advantageous not just to get the approvals but to have a strong data set on an outcome such as vaccine efficacy. The program will include both outcomes.  As always, you do not need inferiority of antibodies and you may have additional immune parameters that do not exist very much with the traditional flu, but the entire program will, of course, look at vaccine efficacy to also take into account, is broader immune response. But we'll obviously always keep our regulatory dialogues open for opportunities to serve patients as quick as possible. On the protocol change to Hem A we saw that we had some patients that got very high levels of Hem A gene therapy, 150%. We didn't see actual -- we have not recorded any issues in the haemophilia patients with this.  We want to just have an abundance of caution, to have a protocol that would allow active management. And of course, if there are any patient with some risk\u2019s factors, they could easily use oral anti-coagulants, such as Eliquis. I want to just put this into context as we finalize the regulatory submission on this protocol update, that having high Factor VIII level has also some potential longer-term advantage on sustainability of gene therapy. The Factor VIII data that you've seen also from others in the field have shown some more attenuation over time for the Factor VIII molecules. We have reported so far very good efficacy with no need for transfusion and no bleeding.  But to be in the upper range, where we are, on average 60% to 70%, maybe something that allow much longer gene therapy benefit than if you were on the lower end of the spectrum, particularly for Factor VIII patients. Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael. And also, let me add in my previous answer when I said that for the high-income countries is predominantly boosters, of course, there are also, as vaccine rates are getting higher there are primary doses. But also, I forgot to mention the pediatric. And the pediatric, they will be predominantly in next year's revenues. Keep in mind that in Europe, Japan, all the international markets all revenues of COVID that will be realized next month are going to the next financial year and over there will be a lot of pediatrics. Of course, in the U.S. we'll have also some pediatric booked this year. So, with that, the next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks so much. Just two for me. First coming back to the vaccine targets for '22. As we think about the doses beyond the 1.7 billion that you've now contracted for. Is there still sale -- incremental sales opportunity in developed markets for next year or most governments contracted already? I'm just trying to get a sense if we should be thinking about most of those doses, I guess you mentioned in the call a few times, going to emerging markets and low-priced geographies where the vaccines sold closer to cost, or could there actually be some still higher price per dose business to be had? My second question on the vaccine is also just on the margin. Is that high 20% margin that we saw this year a reasonable assumption for next year given the R&D work going on, etc.? And then just a final question was on the COVID PI just talk about that standard risk trial when you're looking at both vaccinated and unvaccinated populations. Is that study powered to look at those populations separately, if we were to see different outcomes in that readout as we think about later this year or next year? Thanks so much. Albert Bourla : Thank you. I'll start with Angela to answer about the COVID vaccines remain doses next year. Frank, if you can give an answer on the margin, and then Mikael, understands our risk study. Angela. Angela Hwang : Thanks for the question Chris. No, we are not all done with the developed markets. Certainly, the contracts are in place and many of them are in place. But also, don't forget that many of these contracts have options attached to them, and those have not been realized. So, I think that there is still opportunity in 2022 for the developed world to acquire additional doses. Albert Bourla : Frank? Frank D\u2019amelio: And the increase on the IBT is a percentage of revenue for the COVID vaccines. Remember that IBT as a percentage of revenue includes; manufacturing and distribution, applicable royalty expense, and then the gross profit split with BNT so that gets you to I'll call it gross margin. And then we also include in that IBT percentage all of the R&D associated with COVID-related programs for both prevention and treatment and other mRNA-related programs. When you put all of that together, we've guided this year to IBT as percentage of revenues in the high 20s. For next year, you should assume the same thing and then obviously we'll provide updated guidance on all of the P&L line items on our next earnings call when we close out Q4, provide guidance for 2022. Albert Bourla : Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : Yeah. Thank you for your interest in the standard risk oral PI trials. As I said, no other oral drug, actually the monoclonal antibodies were not used either. So, it's really unique population, which we also recognized as we enrolled the trial, it's enrolling now very well in the trial. And yes, we have secondary endpoints that we'll look at the 2 different groups. And I do think if the vaccine efficacy is what we hope, [Indiscernible] treatment efficacies, what we hope, that should be within our reach to get the claims on both vaccinated breakthrough and all commerce that includes unvaccinated. And as I said, it will be to the best of my knowledge, the only trial on standard risk debt are not vaccinated, but it has this unique opportunity where antibodies are difficult to use in vaccinated, and there is no other way of running it.  This is a growing population and in countries that may be late with revaccinations, of course, this is a really interesting drug profile. Also, for new variant, please remember, I didn't emphasize it that much, our oral PI, to date has shown robust activity against all variants of -- from Delta to Alpha variants, all variants we have tested, we believe it's going to be active against many different coronaviruses. So, Angela spoke about stockpiling. It also has a stockpiling opportunity for new things coming up in the Corona family, even if they're quite remote from SARS-Cov-2. So, it's a real important drug before the world and fingers crossed as we look forward to readout. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Geoffrey Porges, from FVB, Leerink. Geoffrey Porges : Thank you very much. A few quick questions. First, on Prevnar, could you give us a sense of whether you believe Prevnar will return to growth next year and have -- what is the supply that you expect to have in terms of number of doses for next year? Secondly, on the question of overall guidance, it seems to me that next year should be another growth year for Pfizer given what you're saying about the many opportunities for both the COVID vaccine and the antiviral. I know you haven't given guidance, but can you give us a sense of whether that's your expectation as well?  And then lastly on capital, it seems pretty clear that you'll almost be in a net positive cash position by the end of this year given the cash that's coming in for the COVID vaccine, there have been some suggestions that you might redeploy that capital into returning to the consumer business. Is that of any interest or you got to maintain the focus on strictly innovative biopharma? Thanks. Albert Bourla : Angela, on Prevnar? Angela Hwang : Sure. As we think about the Prevnar adult revenues, I think we have to look at it at the different age ranges. For the 65 plus, the opportunity will be obviously those who are aging in the nearly 65 that are becoming every year, as well as the opportunity and we're actually waiting for the CDC and MMWR to give us guidance as to whether those who have been previously vaccinated with PCV 13 will be candidates for re-vaccination. That's how I think about revenue on the 65 plus. And then in addition to that one, what is completely new is the 18 to 64 efforts. This is a whole new population. It is a large population. And this will be the other opportunity that we'll be looking to for PCV 20 in '22 and beyond. Albert Bourla : Geoff, look on the guidance. First of all, this year we have record -- recorded record sales and I'm very happy that you're predicting that like last year we may grow. We will provide guidance as always in the first month of the year in our fourth call earnings, which I think is late January. As regards the capital allocation, Frank has spoken multiple times about lot of priorities and capital allocation. We are maintaining a growing dividend, that's very clear, and then our second priority is clearly to invest in the business, to invest in developing the business, and actually I will turn to Aamir Malik, which is his first call here to speak a little bit about opportunities in business development and how he sees them. Aamir Malik : Thanks, Albert. Thanks, Geoffrey. We see business development frankly as a very important part of our strategy and we plan to be very active in deal-making. Specifically, we're going to be interested in compelling later-stage assets that can contribute positively to the top-line growth in the back half of the decade, and we're also going to be interested in accessing medical breakthroughs that are in earlier stages of development.  And we frankly see, focusing in these areas as being much more value-creating than synergy-driven deals that require lots of resource-intensive integrations that can take a long time to complete. Obviously, we don't speak in absolutes and we never say never, but right now our focus will be as I described. On compelling later-stage assets and earlier-stage medical breakthroughs in biopharma. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Aamir and we rightly, as you can understand, we are very active as we speak in a lot of these discussions. So next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi. Andrew Baum : Thank you. A couple of questions. As you look at the competitive environment for oral antivirals for COVID, could you talk how you're thinking about the probability of either your compound or the competitor having a REMS program. I know that [Indiscernible] did at one point, but I think it has REMS now and your protease, shouldn't [Indiscernible] one from a [Indiscernible] point of view. If you care to comment on the competitive outlook for those two drugs from a regulatory side that would be interesting.  And then second, you've spoken previously, Angela, about the Xeljanz rebate providing sufficient ammunition against AbbVie to ensure that Abrocitinib is not disadvantaged when you launch in securing positions on [Indiscernible]. When I look at the totality of the rebate that AbbVie's products generate, it would seem to be a multiple of what Xeljanz does. Doesn't that still mean that you're potentially going to be disadvantaged as you seek to win share in the atopic dermatitis indication? Many thanks. Albert Bourla : Andrew, thank you for all. As always, very good questions. Angela I will give both of them to you. Angela Hwang : Andrew, I think on the Abro one as we have learned and we've talked about this in the past as well, we're just in a really different place now. We have a tremendous number of contracts that we have in place, you see that in the gross-to-net when you look at Xeljanz and work with these -- with the various payers. And it's continuing as -- with all new products when you launch, access and getting access is always a critical issue.  And so, we'll continue to do that as we have with all of our products for Abro, not to forget that obviously the profile that we have, the value that we can bring to patients as well as organizations is a big part of what's going to help us to be able to get that access. So, I think that we'll do what we've always done, and that access will build through time. And we believe that we do have a competitive profile that will allow us to play a role in this very, very big market. On your other question, which was related to the protease inhibitor, Andrew would you mind just repeating that again? Albert Bourla : [Indiscernible] Mikael Dolsten : I'm happy to say a few words. So, you were all -- Albert Bourla : Yes, okay. Mikael please. Mikael Dolsten : -- The different profiles of protease inhibitor and polymerase and how that could play out and the need for REMS. Well, as always, we -- pending positive data, we are extremely experienced in pharmacovigilance programs, and we'll discuss with regulators what they see as the appropriate. For the high-risk group we'll have a five-day study and there could be then options for a polymerase or a protease inhibitor. And it could be an upside to even look at combination between those in the future. For the standard risk, to the best of my knowledge, we are the only one that will be completing that study in a relative near-term, and actually the only one running it.  And for the household exposure study, there you are treating potentially healthy uninfected individuals, and as a physician, I would just say that the protease inhibitor class has been and is known to be addressing unique viral product and not really affecting the human cells. So, I would think it would be a very much preferred [Indiscernible] class if the profile comes out as we hope, polymerase inhibitor, nucleoside base, you're always concerned in healthy individuals whether they could incorporate into the genome. Whether the germ line or the mitochondrial genome, so I would think that's something you need to keep in consideration. But that's why we were keen to be working on an oral PI because it is broad utility [Indiscernible] to future variants and future coronaviruses. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael. And now the last question, please? Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Carter Gould from Barclays. Carter Gould : Great. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing us in. I guess to start, I just wanted to come back to the 2022 guide. Can you first clarify that that 1.7 billion doses are inclusive of the 700 million that was left over from 2021? And I guess regardless your 4 billion capacity far exceeds the doses you expect to deliver. I appreciate Frank's comment to the projected doses to be distributed will likely -- may and likely will evolve. But is it safe to assume you're done increasing capacity and/or ' 22 could be a peak on capacity?  And then on the TL1A inhibitor, this is the first time I think we're hearing you guys talk about this publicly, presumably which we believe you have a better understanding of what drove the immunogenicity in [Indiscernible] here that you don't view the rate of [Indiscernible] as a problem or that you have confidence it will decrease with the subq formulation. Any insight on this front? And then finally, still plan to hold that Analyst Day this year or has the thinking changed on that front? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Many questions. Angela, explain a little bit the 1.7. Angela Hwang : Sure. I think the way to think about it is that the 1.7 billion doses that we talked about for '22, are those that we have line of cycle contracts for. And as Frank said, as contracts continue to be confirmed and finalized, will add to that. The spillover that you mentioned, which is the end of fiscal year but really not the end of calendar year, and so there is some -- there were some doses that were contracted for in 2021, but the revenue will be collected in 2022, so somewhere between December and January. I think the way to think about it is just that we have to look at contracts as well as revenue recognition and those are two -- they're two slightly different things. Albert Bourla : Frank, capacity? Frank D\u2019amelio: So, Carter, 3 billion doses this year, 4 billion doses next year. Quite frankly, I think as demand requires, we can continue to expand on our capacity. Just as an example, give you some of the improvements we've made. When we first thought of making the other vaccine, it took us 110 days from [Indiscernible]. We've taken 110 days down to 31 days, so over 70% improvement in terms of the process. And quite frankly, I think we continue to make more improvement, so I don't think capacity is going to be a challenge for us. I think just the matter of our making sure we're meeting the demand that's being generated by patients. And obviously by the contracts we generate and the like. But I don't see capacity as some constraining factor for us. Albert Bourla : Well said Mikael -- Frank. Mikael TL1A? Mikael Dolsten : Yes. Thank you for -- Carter -- for asking about TL1A, it's a noble member of the TNFs super family. It's actually had some genetic association with IBD Crohn's disease a more severe Crohn's disease. We're by far the most advanced with our biological. And so far, we have not seen any meaningful impact of [Indiscernible] on activity of the drug in patients. So, we think we will be able to manage that. Of course, we are waiting for the final readout of the study. We think it could be a drug given conveniently subcutaneously. We are reporting based on a biomarker, first to my knowledge, to have a biomarker for selecting of high responders that captured still broader patient group.  And if you look at the efficacy in the biomark group, it's really above where any other agents have reported so far. And that's what we want to report and reproduced in the extended study. And this Tl1A is highly applicable not only to issue colitis, but also to Crohn's, so that's another indication where we will aim to go, which is supported also by genetic study. So, thank you very much for your interest in it and look forward to keep you updated as we generate more data and move on with this exciting program. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael. And Chris, maybe you answer the question about the analyst I think there was an R&D Day I think in the question, right? Mikael Dolsten : Sorry about the -- yes. Chris Stevo : Yes. Sorry. That is our plan, correct. Albert Bourla : All right, so you've heard of that. I think, Chris, that's the end of our call, right? Chris Stevo : It is. Albert Bourla : Maybe I will make, perhaps, one closing comment. Clearly, we're very happy and very excited for, first of all -- and proud for the impact that we have on global health and public health across the world with 150 countries receiving our vaccines. More than a billion people, we have touched their lives with our medicines and products. I think that's a record not only for us, but for any pharmaceutical Company so far. Also, that came with very strong financial rewards also.  Our $80 plus billion of revenues that we will record this year likely sets a new record from the sales so far of any pharma clearly for Pfizer. We are looking with a lot of optimism in the future because our pipeline is having very exciting projects that are moving very nicely into our utilizing our learning, and our development from COVID-19, so that we can accelerate even further and create new standards not only for us, but for the industry. Thank you very much for your support. And I wish you a nice day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes Pfizer's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chris Stevo, Senior Vice President and Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Chris Stevo : Thank you, Sylvia. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Pfizer's fourth quarter earnings call. I am joined today by Dr. Albert Bourla, our Chairman and CEO; Frank D\u2019Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development in Medical; Angela Hwang, Group President Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group; Aamir Malik, our Chief Business and Innovation Officer; and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel. We expect this call to last 90 minutes. The materials for this call and other earnings-related materials are on the Investor Relations section of pfizer.com. Please see our forward-looking statements disclaimer on Slide 3 and additional information regarding these statements and our non-GAAP financial measures is available in our earnings release and in our SEC Forms 10-K and 10-Q under risk factors. Forward-looking statements on the call are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. Speak only as of the call\u2019s original date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statement s. With that, I'll turn the call over to Albert. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Chris. Hello, everyone. 2021 was a watershed year for Pfizer, a year in which we set all-time highs in all major areas of focus for Pfizer. We reached an estimated 1.4 billion patients with our medicines and vaccines. That\u2019s more than one out of every six people on Earth. Never before has Pfizer\u2019s patient impact been so wide-reaching. We improved our ranking from fourth to second among large biopharma companies in the PatientView Global Survey. According to Morning Consult, 61% of Americans have a favorable view of Pfizer, which is up 33 points since January of 2020. Just last week, Fortune ranked us fourth on its annual World\u2019s Most Admired Companies list, the highest ranking we have ever achieved. 95% of our colleagues said in an internal survey that they are proud to work for Pfizer, which ranks among the best in corporate America. We increased our investments in research and development from $8.9 billion in 2020 to $10.5 billion in 2021, and we initiated 13 pivotal clinical studies, the highest number ever for Pfizer. Last but not least, we grew revenues by 92% operationally to $81.3 billion and adjusted diluted EPS by 92% operationally to $4.42. Our success in leading the fight against COVID-19 have not only made a positive difference in the world, I believe they have fundamentally changed our company and our culture forever. Colleagues across Pfizer are inspired by what we have achieved and are more determined than ever to be part of the next potentially game-changing breakthrough. To that end, we are applying the lightspeed principles developed for our COVID-19 work to our other therapeutic areas to make sure we continue to move at the speed of science for the benefit of all patients. As a result, we believe we can do even better with each of these metrics in 2022, each one of them. Our full-year 2022 financial guidance, for example, includes for the first time ever a forecasted revenue midpoint that is triple-digit, $100 billion and an adjusted diluted EPS midpoint of $6.45. While Comirnaty is having a significant positive impact on Pfizer\u2019s financial performance, it\u2019s the tremendous impact that COVID-19 vaccines have had on society that is most important. In the U.S. alone, the COVID-19 vaccination program is estimated to have saved more than 1 million lives and prevented more than 10 million hospitalizations, according to a December 2021 Commonwealth Fund Report. The economic impact is equally astonishing -- astounding. According to a December 2021 Heartland Forward Report, the rapid deployment and wide availability of COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S. created an estimated economic savings of $438 billion in 2021 alone, which amounted to U.S. GDP being 2.3% higher than it otherwise would have been, 2.3 points. I\u2019m proud to say that Pfizer contributed significantly to these benefits given that approximately 6 out of 10 doses administered in the U.S. as of February 6, 2022, were Comirnaty. This is the value of our science, what our culture has enabled and what drives our people. Now I would like to speak to three factors that will help drive our growth going forward. The first is the long-term outlook for COVID-19 and why we believe we are well positioned to continue to lead the battle against this disease. Second, our thoughtful capital allocation strategy and why we believe it can help drive our growth in the second part of the decade. And third, how our commitment to ESG principles is designed to create sustainable growth for Pfizer to deliver meaningful value to patients and society. Let me start with the COVID-19 pandemic. Our scientists continue to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 virus and believe it is unlikely that it will be fully eradicated in the foreseeable future. They believe this for several reasons. The global distribution of the virus makes it difficult to contain. The virus has shown an ability to mutate often, making it difficult to stay ahead of it. And the data appear to show that natural infections do not lead to the type of durable protection needed to prevent all transmissions and viral mutation. As a result, people can become reinfected by the same or different strains over time. That said, we now have the tools in the form of vaccines and treatments that we believe will help enable us to not only better manage the pandemic, but also help countries move into an endemic phase. In other words, we believe these tools will help allow us to go back to normality and spend time with family and friends, travel, attend indoor dining and concerts, and enjoy many other activities while lowering the risk of overburdening hospitals and healthcare systems around the world. All of us at Pfizer are extremely proud of the role we have continued to play in bringing these tools to the world. Throughout 2021, we continued our efforts to bring our COVID-19 vaccine to more populations and to further ramp up our manufacturing and distribution capabilities. As a result, the market share of our Comirnaty vaccine has continued to grow, representing 70% of all doses distributed across the U.S. and EU as of February 5. When it comes to Paxlovid, we expect to produce 6 million treatment courses during the first quarter of '22. Overall, we expect to produce 30 million courses in the first half of 2022 and 120 million courses for the full year, of course, depending on the global need. Having recently received a conditional marketing authorization from the European Medicines Agency, Paxlovid has now received emergency or conditional authorization for use with certain populations in approximately 40 countries so far. We are in discussions with governments around the world and expect that as the number of authorizations increase, so will the number of contracts for this treatment, which could truly be a game changer. At Pfizer, we are keenly aware of our responsibility to continue to invest in R&D to maintain our leadership in providing these tools and other meaningful solutions to the world. That\u2019s why we continue to develop and test different versions of our vaccine to potentially address variants of concern as they emerge, and why we are currently working on a new Omicron-based vaccine candidate and on a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine candidate. It\u2019s also why just two months after receiving Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Paxlovid, we are already working on a potential next-generation oral COVID-19 treatment. Going forward, we are confident in our ability to maintain this leadership position because of our significant investments in R&D combined with our ability to move at the speed of science without compromising quality or safety, the strong credibility we have earned with governments, healthcare providers and consumers combined with our extensive global field presence, and our unparalleled capabilities for high-quality manufacturing at scale. Now the second thing I wanted to touch on is how we think about our capital allocation and to repeat once more our strategy. We feel that the entirety of our business continues to demonstrate a robust topline growth trajectory through 2025. Consensus estimates are beginning to slowly recognize this momentum. However, consensus estimates currently show our topline shrinking from 2025 to 2030. I want to repeat that this is inconsistent with our own plans. Our goal is to continue to be a growth company from '25 to 2030, despite the impact of LOEs expected during that period. Our confidence in our ability to achieve that is underpinned by the momentum of our business, the durability of our COVID-19 offerings as which I just described, the underestimated strength of our internal pipeline, and, of course, by our ability to deploy capital into growth-focused business development to access external science. Few words about them. We leverage business development opportunities to advance our business strategies and objectives. The strength of our balance sheet and cash flows allow us to pursue new business development opportunities going forward that could add at least $25 billion of risk-adjusted revenues to our 2030 top-line expectations. We expect to do this while still maintaining our growing dividend, as well as flexibility for other uses of our cash. The focus of our business development efforts will continue to be on compelling external science in the form of both later-stage assets, as well as earlier medical innovations, that have the potential to be breakthroughs for patients. Our focus will largely be in the therapeutic areas and platforms where we have the scientific skills and acumen to add substantial value and select the most successful targets. In addition, we feel that we have distinctive attributes such as world-class excellence in clinical development and unsurpassed manufacturing and commercial capabilities at scale that makes us a very attractive partner across a variety of deal arrangements. We believe the opportunities to deliver on this approach exist, and I will be personally focusing on this execution. I want to emphasize that despite our significant capital flexibility, we will never lower the scientific and financial standards we apply in our business development. As we pursue these opportunities, we will continue to be highly disciplined in our evaluation and prioritization processes. Since 2019, we have already invested almost $25 billion in business development transactions adding more than $13 billion in consensus, I repeat, in consensus 2030 revenue. I would point out that the $13 billion of consensus currently includes nothing for the Trillium assets, the Biohaven collaboration, or the recently announced mRNA deals, all of which have substantial potential. I see this pace of business development accelerating going forward, and I am confident it will be an important driver in ensuring Pfizer as a growth company in the back-half of this decade. One highly visible example of our approach to business development is the recent investments we are making in mRNA technology and collaborations. mRNA has emerged as a versatile technology, with potential applications across many infectious diseases, cancer, rare genetic disorders and even auto-immune diseases. Although mRNA is not the holy grail, we believe the technology has the potential to have a game-changing impact on global health, which is why we have developed a robust mRNA strategy and are aggressively building our platform. While the pandemic has demonstrated that it\u2019s not that easy to deliver mRNA vaccines at scale, Pfizer has emerged as a leader in this space. With decades of experience on our side, we\u2019ve developed what is arguably the most efficient clinical development and vaccine manufacturing capabilities the world has ever seen. We also have rapidly scaled and built out new capabilities in record time by hiring nearly 2,400 new colleagues in these functions in a nine-month timeframe. Going forward, we plan to continue to invest to capitalize on the leadership we have built in terms of both mRNA R&D and manufacturing. In addition, of course, to these internal investments and improvements, we\u2019re also making external investments to build out our capabilities in this space. For example, Pfizer recently has entered into four important business development deals to help advance our mRNA strategy. We are expanding our collaboration with BioNTech to use the existing platform to co-develop an mRNA vaccine candidate for herpes zoster virus to protect against shingles. Our agreement with Beam Therapeutics expands our mRNA efforts to another core therapeutic area for Pfizer, rare disease, with a four-year research collaboration for three targets for rare genetic diseases of the liver, muscle and central nervous system. We believe this will give us the potential to use mRNA to treat diseases, not just preventive treatment. Our agreement with Acuitas gives us the ability to collaborate with and license their proprietary lipid nanoparticle technology for up to 10 targets for mRNA vaccines and therapies. We believe this will give us greater independence in this space. And we have signed a strategic collaboration and licensing agreement with Codex DNA, a leader in the development of automated solutions for on-demand synthesis of genes and mRNA, potentially allowing enzymatic assembly of DNA at the front-end of the mRNA production process. This could possibly reduce the time to produce a new vaccine from three months down to two months. If successful, this would be an important differentiator when developing a vaccine for the flu, for example, as it would allow us to select a strain much closer to the start of any flu season. These deals represent only four pieces of a much bigger strategic puzzle. As we continue executing on our mRNA strategy, you should expect to see more targeted activity in this area. Of course, our business development activity in the last quarter went beyond executing on our mRNA strategy. This is an update of the slide I showed you last quarter, and I would like to highlight a few of the other recent deals, they are marked as new in this slide. The acquisition of Trillium builds on our strong track record of leadership in oncology, enhancing our hematology portfolio as we strive to improve outcomes for people living with blood cancers around the globe. Our strategic collaboration with Biohaven leverages our leading commercial capabilities in pain and women\u2019s health with [Technical Difficulty] I apologize for the technical issue. I will repeat my script for this last slide. And then, we go forward. So, of course, our business development activity in the last quarter went beyond executing on our mRNA strategy. This is an update of the slide I showed you last quarter, and I would like to highlight a few of the other recent deals, you can see them with the indication, new. The acquisition of Trillium builds on our strong track record of leadership in oncology, enhancing our hematology portfolio as we strive to improve outcomes for people living with blood cancers around the globe. Our strategic collaboration with Biohaven leverages our leading commercial capabilities in pain and women\u2019s health with Biohaven's groundbreaking oral CGRP receptor antagonist, the only one approved in the U.S. for both acute and preventative treatment of migraine, so that we can potentially bring a valuable new treatment option to patients living with this debilitating neurological disease outside the U.S. And through the proposed acquisition of Arena we plan to leverage Pfizer\u2019s leading research and global development capabilities to accelerate the clinical development of etrasimod for patients with immunoinflammatory diseases. Now, I'd like to share some details about Pfizer\u2019s enhanced ESG strategy. The strategy is focused on six areas where we see opportunities to create a meaningful and measurable impact over the next decade : product innovation; equitable access and pricing; product quality and safety; diversity, equity and inclusion; climate change; and business ethics. Each quarter going forward, I will provide examples of how we are embedding ESG into all core areas of our business. This quarter, I will highlight our efforts to improve clinical trial diversity, to improve diversity within our colleague base, and help ensure equitable access to our COVID-19 vaccine and treatment. Last year, Pfizer published an industry-first retrospective analysis of demographic data of U.S. participants in 213 of our interventional clinical trials that initiated enrollment from 2011 through 2020. The analysis demonstrated that overall trial participation of Black or African American individuals was at the U.S. census level, 14.3% versus 13.4%, participation of Hispanic or Latino individuals was below U.S. census, 15.9% versus 18.5%, and female participation was at U.S. census 51.1% versus 50.8%. We published this analysis to be transparent and for it to serve as a baseline as we measure progress in this area. We believe that diversity in trials is a matter of equity and good science and are taking decisive steps designed to improve diversity in our trials. Our goal is to achieve racially and ethnically diverse participation at or above U.S. census or disease prevalence levels as appropriate in all our trials. The second item I want to highlight is the significant progress we are making in diversifying our colleague base, particularly at more senior-level positions. In the last three years, for example, we have increased the percentage of women at the Vice President level and above globally from 32% to 42%. Over the same timeframe, we have increased the percentage of minorities at the Vice President level and above in the U.S. from 19% to 25%. The third item I wanted to highlight is the progress we are making to help ensure our COVID-19 vaccine and oral treatment are accessible by everyone everywhere. I am thrilled to say that we remain on track to meet or exceed our goal of delivering at least 2 billion doses of our vaccine to low- and middle-income countries by the end of 2022, having just met our goal of delivering the first 1 billion by the end of 2021. I also want to highlight two data points about our 2 billion-dose commitment. 1 billion of these doses are being provided to the poorest countries completely free of charge, thanks to our agreement with the U.S. government. Pfizer is providing these doses to the U.S. government at a not-for-profit price, and the government is then providing them to the poorest countries for free. Also, the 1 billion doses we delivered in 2021 represented 37% of all doses we delivered this last year. In terms of our oral COVID-19 treatment, we have signed a voluntary license agreement with the Medicines Patent Pool, which we hope will lead to expanded access pending country regulatory authorization or approval in 95 low- and middle-income countries that account for approximately 53% of the world\u2019s population. Lastly, I'm pleased to announce that the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors has been reviewing methods for linking executive compensation with ESG performance, which we expect to begin this year. For details regarding the impact of our ESG strategy had on our business in 2021, please keep an eye out for Pfizer\u2019s 2021 ESG Report, which will be published online in mid-March. In summary, 2021 was an outstanding year for Pfizer, and we look forward to continuing to apply the lessons learned from COVID to deliver breakthroughs for patients across all our therapeutic areas. We remain focused on being nimble, investing in our R&D organization and exploring dynamic partnerships that will enable us to fully realize the power of our science. None of this is possible without the contributions of our amazingly purpose-driven colleagues, who continue to rise to the challenge of addressing the world\u2019s most devastating diseases. In 2021, our colleagues exceeded expectations. Therefore, we will once again use a part of the bonus pool that the Board approved for bonus-eligible colleagues and executives to provide a one-time special COVID-19 Circumstances Bonus to our non-bonus eligible colleagues across the board to reward them for their hard work and to help them cover personal, family and living expenses incurred because of the COVID-19 pandemic. With that, I will turn it over to Mikael to update you on our R&D efforts. After Mikael, Frank will provide financial details on the fourth quarter and our outlook for 2022. So Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : Thank you, Albert. I\u2019m delighted to share updates from this quarter as we continue to deliver first-in-class science. Today, I will share updates from our COVID-19 programs and select other assets in our pipeline. Let\u2019s start with Paxlovid. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to burden public health, we have advanced the science on our novel oral antiviral therapeutic. Importantly, we see consistent, potent antiviral activity in vitro against all current variants of concern, including both Delta and Omicron. This would be expected from how the compound was designed. On the left, you can see a crystal structure showing how tightly nirmatrelvir binds into the active site of the Omicron variant. History has told us from the HIV protease field that the closer the therapeutic is designed to mimic the substrate, the harder it is for resistance to emerge. That combined with the essential nature of the protease, the short duration of treatment and the co-dosing with ritonavir to drug exposures that are over 5x to 6x the amount of compound needed to kill the virus in an in vitro assay, suggests there is a reduced risk for resistance. External data support our findings. In this slide, the lower values, the stronger potency, illustrated by nirmatrelvir being on the low end of the Y axis on the left having the most potent activity. Nirmatrelvir maintains in vitro potency in the low nanomolar range, as you can see in these graphs that include other authorized or approved therapeutics. On the left is in vitro data from a study done with the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Pfizer. Nirmatrelvir demonstrated potent antiviral activity as measured by IC50, a measure of drug efficacy indicating the concentration needed to inhibit infection by half. This is consistent with findings from the Rega Institute at KU Leuven in Belgium, shown on the right. We anticipate a New Drug Application decision by the FDA in the high-risk population in the second half of '22, pivotal readouts of our household contact and standard risk studies in the second quarter and second half of '22, respectively, and a study start in children 6 to 18 years old in the first quarter of '22. In the standard risk study, we are expanding enrollment by 750 non-hospitalized patients with symptomatic COVID-19, and vaccinated, standard-risk patients may also be eligible, provided their last SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose was received at least 12 months prior to screening. This expansion will allow us to further evaluate the secondary endpoint seen in the interim analysis, which showed a 70% reduction in hospitalization and no deaths in the treated compared to placebo. We also are advancing work on a potential next generation SARS-CoV antiviral with the aim of achieving similar high clinical efficacy and pan-Coronavirus design properties that maintain activity, with a favorable safety profile, and counter potential viral resistance but without the need for ritonavir boosting. A first in human study start is expected in the second half of '22. Now, we also continue to advance vaccine development and have achieved Emergency Use Authorization for use in children as young as age 5. Effectiveness data for three doses of the vaccine for people 12 years and older, and early laboratory data observed with Delta and other variants of concern, including Omicron, suggest that people vaccinated with three doses of Comirnaty may have a higher degree of protection against both symptomatic and severe outcomes compared to two primary doses. Informed by these data, in addition to the immunobridging data, we are evaluating a third 3-microgram dose in our study of children six months through four years of age, with the belief that a third dose may be optimal for this age group. However, as pediatric cases and hospitalizations are at an all-time high, FDA urged us to start a rolling Emergency Use Authorization submission with the two-dose efficacy, immunogenicity and safety data we have accumulated thus far while we continue to collect data, including from third-dose administration. We plan to submit third-dose data once available. In the meantime, FDA has scheduled an Advisory Committee meeting for February 15 to consider the two-dose suggested data collected to-date. If Emergency Use Authorization of two doses is granted and the CDC recommends usage, parents will have the opportunity to begin a COVID-19 vaccination series for their children between 6 months and 4 years of age while awaiting potential authorization of a third dose. Turning to the adult population. In the wake of surging Omicron cases, in January we completed a laboratory analysis of the effect of a third dose boost of Comirnaty on live virus neutralization. Encouragingly, there was a more than 25-fold increase in Omicron live virus neutralizing titers observed between day of dose three and one month post-dose three. We observed a moderate 4-month post-dose three antibody decay for wild-type and Omicron variant. Between one month and four months post-dose three, neutralizing titers were 1.6- and 2-fold lower for wild-type and the Omicron variant, respectively. We\u2019re now starting to see effects of a third dose boost in maintaining a high level of protection against Omicron in the real world. These data from Kaiser Permanente Southern California show Omicron-related emergency department visits without hospitalization on top, and hospitalizations on the bottom. Three doses of COMIRNATY provided better vaccine effectiveness against Omicron than two doses, and there was high vaccine effectiveness of three doses against Omicron-related hospitalization, similar to Delta-related hospitalization. We did see some waning of effectiveness against emergency department admissions due to Omicron three months or more after a third dose, which suggests the potential need for another boost of the current vaccine or an Omicron-based vaccine. We have started an Omicron-based vaccine candidate trial in adults 18 to 55 years of age. This study will evaluate more than 1,400 participants across three cohorts : Those who have already received two doses of the current vaccine 90 to 180 days prior to enrollment will receive one or two doses of the Omicron-based vaccine. Those who have already received three doses of the current vaccine 90 to 180 days prior to enrollment will receive one dose of the current vaccine or the Omicron-based vaccine. And those who are vaccine-na\u00efve will receive three doses of the Omicron-based vaccine. This study is part of our science-based approach to develop a variant-based vaccine that we hope achieves a similar level of protection against Omicron as the current vaccine has with both wild-type and earlier variants, but with potentially longer duration of protection. Now, let\u2019s turn to our next generation CDK inhibitors for cancer. Most patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer eventually develop resistance to both endocrine and CDK4/6 inhibitors despite their transformative efficacy. Inhibition of CDK2, delivered with a CDK selective active drug or a triple activity CDK 2/4/6 agent, may prevent, delay, or reverse resistance and prolong survival. These are data from a subset in the CDK2/4/6 inhibitor Phase 1 dose escalation and antitumor activity study of heavily pre-treated patients with hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer. The most improvement in terms of tumor size reduction was seen in patients treated with monotherapy or in combination with fulvestrant. We observed three confirmed partial responses and three patients with stable disease for more than 12 months. One patient has been receiving ongoing treatment for more than 28 months. There has been an acceptable safety profile at the recommended Phase 2 dose, which is 25-milligram twice daily. We plan to conduct a Phase 1 dose expansion and expect to complete it in the fourth quarter of this year. Selective CDK2 inhibition with -- CDK2 only inhibitor may allow dose titration and has the potential to be used in combination with approved CDK inhibitors, such as palbociclib, or other next-generation CDK4 selective inhibitors. There were two confirmed partial responses in the Phase 1 study of our selective CDK2 inhibitor in patients with advanced or metastatic hormone receptor/HER2 negative breast cancer who had received/progressed on prior CDK4/6 inhibition and endocrine therapy. One patient had a maximum tumor shrinkage of 54% following CDK2 inhibitor treatment for approximately 8 months, and the second had 100% shrinkage of all target lesions following treatment for approximately 9 months. We are showing scans of the first patient at baseline and 8 weeks. There was an acceptable safety profile as a monotherapy, and we are currently exploring combinations. We expect the Phase 1/2 study to be completed in the second quarter of '23. Now, let\u2019s turn to our six-valent Lyme disease vaccine candidate which we are developing in partnership with Valneva. 13 We have received further positive data from our Phase 2 proof of concept study and expect to start Phase 3 in the third quarter of 2022 with a dosing regimen of zero, 2, and 6 months to prime, followed by routine boosters before the start of a Lyme season. Our Phase 2 study is continuing and includes a pediatric population ages 5 to 17 years. Since Lyme disease is seasonal, our goal is to establish a regimen that results in high antibodies at the beginning of each season. We, therefore, looked at a boost one year after the primary series. We saw substantial boost antibody response in Phase 2 to all six serotypes present in North America and Europe following the three-dose primary series vaccination schedule, with a 14- to 31-fold rise in season one and a 51- to 69-fold rise in season two. The vaccine candidate was generally well tolerated at all dose levels tested, and we are excited about further development and the potential to help prevent this debilitating disease. Last quarter, we told you that we saw robust dystrophin expression out to one year in our Muscular Dystrophy gene therapy Phase 1b study. I will show you encouraging functional motor data in a moment. We recently shared some very sad news that a DMD patient with advanced disease in the non-ambulatory cohort of the Phase 1b trial passed away after presenting with hypovolemia and cardiogenic shock. This patient was 16 years old and the first in the non-ambulatory cohort treated with RAPAMUNE, along with steroids, as part of the immunosuppressive regimen. RAPAMUNE is not used in the Phase 3 ambulatory study. Like most non-ambulatory DMD patients, he had more advanced disease with underlying cardiac dysfunction. There is evidence of an active viral infection and we are investigating how this may have contributed to the outcome. Additional assessment will be required to define next steps needed to restart the Phase 1b study in non-ambulatory patients who are more progressed in the disease. I will now share data from this study. The ambulatory cohort -- sorry, I had one more sentence to say here. 19 patients were enrolled in this study, 16 of whom received the dose selected for our Phase 3 program and three of whom received a previously studied lower dose. At one year post-treatment, there was a 5.6 point improvement in ambulatory function as measured by North Star Ambulatory Assessment compared to an external control, matched for age and baseline function. This is particularly encouraging given that patients at this age and stage of disease typically experience a considerable decline in ambulatory function as illustrated by the external control. On the right, we show time in study, with six participants nearing or more than three years since treatment. The ambulatory cohort in Phase 1b is similar, but slightly older on average, to the population in the Phase 3 CIFFREO trial. Considering the favorable benefit to risk profile in this study and observed in ambulatory patient population and in consultation with the Data Monitoring Committee, we believe the safety profile of our DMD gene therapy is manageable in this patient group. Additional mitigations are being added to our study protocol in consultation with the DMC and other medical experts. Pending regulatory feedback, we anticipate Phase 3 study sites to begin to re-open in the next few months, with the potential to report topline results and, subject to clinical trial success, submit a BLA by the end of 2023. Turning now to Internal Medicine, and ponsegromab, our candidate for cachexia due to cancer. It targets GDF-15, which as seen is frequently elevated in cancer patients, drives reduction of appetite and body weight loss, and is associated with poor outcomes. There may also be potential to treat cachexia associated with other chronic diseases such as heart failure and COPD. We have encouraging Phase 1b data which I will show next. Ponsegromab was evaluated in 10 cancer patients who were undergoing anti-tumor treatment and had more than 5% body weight loss in the last 6 months, or more than 2% body weight loss with a body mass index of less than 20 kilogram per meters squared or diagnosed sarcopenia. Ponsegromab administration was found to suppress circulating GDF-15 levels in cancer cachexia patients below the level observed in healthy subjects. Preliminary data from the Phase 1b trial show ponsegromab treatment resulted in significant body weight gain compared to historical placebo. You can see the nice trend in body weight increase remained even after the dosing was stopped at week 12. The gray dotted line indicates the historical cut-off associated with improved survival. We are co-developing a companion diagnostic with Roche Diagnostics designed to enable precision medicine, and we expect to start a Phase 2 study in cancer cachexia in the fourth quarter of this year. Injectable GLP-1 receptor agonists offer potent lowering of glucose and weight in diabetic and obese patients, with proven cardiovascular benefit, but this drug class is underutilized due to its injectable administration route. Our small molecule GLP-1 receptor agonist danuglipron could potentially offer a convenient oral alternative to injectables and is being evaluated for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, obesity and NASH. It has been developed in our Internal Medicine Research Group with a vision to expand the use of this potent, easily administrated GLP-1 drug class to a primary care setting. Here are data from the Phase 2 study in Type 2 Diabetes. We recorded strong dose-dependent reductions in both HbA1c, a measure of long-term blood sugar levels and body weight, compared to the marginal effects noted with placebo. After 12 weeks of treatment with the 200 milligram twice daily dose, HbA1c decreased by almost 1.6% and body weight decreased by 5.4 kilograms. The safety and tolerability profile is consistent with the GLP-1 class and the most frequent adverse event rates were GI-related. We expect to start a Phase 2b titration optimization study mid-'22 with doses up to 200 milligram twice a day, and complete a Phase 2b study in non-diabetic subjects with obesity in the first quarter of next year. Finally, here are select recent and upcoming milestones from across the pipeline. The solid blue dots represent milestones achieved and the open blue dots represent anticipated milestones. Programs in bold are major anticipated events. Some of the programs on the right have already been designated as lightspeed, meaning they have accelerated development timelines, or are being considered for lightspeed designation. Finally, I would like to take a moment to thank Morrie Birnbaum, our outgoing Chief Scientific Officer of the Internal Medicine Research Unit, for his immense contributions over the last seven years, and welcome Bill Sessa, who joins us from Yale School of Medicine following a decades-long career in academia, including serving as Vice Chair of Pharmacology, Professor of Medicine, and Director of the Vascular Biology & Therapeutics Program at Yale. Bill is an eminent leader in this field, a groundbreaking scientist and a celebrated innovator, and I know he will bring his tremendous vision and insights to our investigation of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Thank you for your attention. I look forward to your questions. Now, let me turn it over to Frank. Frank D\u2019Amelio: Thanks, Mikael. I know you\u2019ve seen our release, so let me provide a few highlights regarding the financials. The COVID-19 vaccine once again had a positive impact on our quarterly results and Albert and Mikael have already addressed the key points on the COVID-19 landscape. Turning to the income statement. Revenue increased 106% operationally in the fourth quarter of '21 driven by COVID-19 vaccine sales and strong performance from a number of our other key growth drivers. And looking at the revenue excluding the COVID-19 vaccine direct sales and alliance revenues and Paxlovid contribution, the fourth quarter was slower than the first nine months of the year, declining by 2% operationally. As we discussed during our third quarter call, there was a 4% negative impact, or approximately $500 million, from fewer selling days in the U.S. and International. Excluding that impact, operational growth would have been 2%, which is still lower than the mid-to-high single-digit growth we had experienced during the rest of the year. This was factored into our forecasts for the year but let me briefly walk you through this. In our Biopharma business, you will remember that the fourth quarter of '21 faced a tough comp from the fourth quarter of 2020 for Prevnar, as pneumococcal vaccinations were strong ahead of COVID-19 vaccine availability. Excluding vaccines from the current and comparable period would add 5 percentage points to the growth. Adjusting for the unusual comparative period differences related to vaccines and selling days, our revenue growth would have been approximately 7%, which is similar to what we've been delivering lately. For the year, operational revenue growth was 92%. Excluding Comirnaty direct sales and alliance revenues and Paxlovid, 2021 operational revenue growth was 6%. This is consistent with our projected revenue CAGR of at least 6% from 2020 through the end of 2025. Of course, there will be some variability in quarterly and annual growth rates due to a variety of factors, but we continue to expect at least a 6% CAGR through 2025. The adjusted cost of sales increase shown here reduced this quarter\u2019s gross margin by approximately 16 percentage points compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, which is almost entirely driven by the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine. Adjusted SI&A expenses in the fourth quarter increased primarily due to increased product-level spending, including Comirnaty and higher healthcare reform sales-based fees. The increase in adjusted R&D expense this quarter was primarily driven by increased investments in late-stage pipeline projects, including additional spending related to our oral COVID-19 treatment. [Technical Difficulty] Albert Bourla : Frank, I think you were disconnected. Frank D\u2019Amelio: Chris? Chris Stevo : Yes. We can hear you, Frank. Go ahead. Frank D\u2019Amelio: Okay. I'm not sure I left off, but I think what I'll do is start with the '22 financial guidance. So we\u2019ve again provided total-company guidance, which includes the business with the COVID-19 vaccine. We will continue to provide insight into our expected revenues for Comirnaty, and, now for the first time, we will also provide some color on our expected revenues for Paxlovid. However, note that we will no longer be providing EPS guidance for the business excluding Comirnaty. Similarly, we won't provide EPS guidance for Paxlovid. Our revenue guidance represents a record for Pfizer, and we expect total company revenue to be in a range of $98 billion to $102 billion, representing an operational growth rate of 24% at the mid-point. Please consider that this revenue range reflects approximately $1.1 billion of anticipated negative impact from changes in foreign currencies and also the impact of the loss of Meridian's sales of approximately $300 million, both of which your models may not take into account. Regarding our COVID-related revenues, we now expect the COVID-19 vaccine revenue for the year to be approximately $32 billion, an increase of approximately $1 billion compared to our prior guidance provided on December 17. For Paxlovid, we expect sales of approximately $22 billion. This means that excluding the COVID-related revenues, we expect sales to be $46 billion at the midpoint, representing operational growth of 5%. While this is slightly below the 6% CAGR that we continue to expect between 2020 and 2025, I would remind you that there will be volatility along the way. Let me give you some detail on our cost and expense guidance. For adjusted cost of sales, we are expecting a range of 32.2% to 34.2%. Given that we are now more than 12 months past the launch of Comirnaty, we expect its negative impact on our cost of sales margins to be less than it was in 2021, assuming a similar level of revenues. Further, Paxlovid is expected to have a very positive impact on cost of sales as a percent of revenues in 2022. On adjusted SI&A, we expect $12.5 to $13.5 billion, an increase of $900 million at the midpoint. We expect our adjusted R&D guidance range to be $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion at the midpoint that is about $500 million higher than last year. We expect an adjusted effective tax rate for the year somewhat higher than 2021 at approximately 16%. These assumptions yield an adjusted diluted EPS range of $6.35 to $6.55 or 47% operational growth at the midpoint compared to 2021, excluding an expected $0.06 negative impact from foreign exchange. I would like to point out some additional information which may be helpful for your models. You will note that our guidance assumes a weighted average share count of approximately 5.8 billion which represents an increase of approximately 100 million shares over 2021. This accounts for the number of shares that we normally issue for employee compensation annually. The increase of 100 million shares over 2021 decreases our EPS by about $0.10 at the mid-point. I notice that most of your models instead assume a flat share count for 2022 as compared to 2021. From the first quarter of 2022 and going forward, we've made a decision to modify our adjusted financials' treatment of amortization of intangibles. Previously, we only excluded amortization related to large mergers and acquisitions. Now exclude all intangible asset amortization expense, this is anticipated to contribute $0.6 to our 2022 adjusted diluted earnings per share, and helps improve comparability with our peers. 2022 guidance once again assumes no share repurchases. You will note that Pfizer did not repurchase shares in either 2020 or 2021. While we continue to have outstanding unused authorization to repurchase another $5.3 billion of stock and can be opportunistic, given the potentially value-enhancing business development opportunities which are available to us, we do not expect to repurchase shares in 2022. Now a word on our 32% stake in the Consumer JV with GSK. As you know, GSK has announced its intention to engage in a demerger transaction for at least 80% of its 68% stake in the JV in summer 2022. We talked about our stake as a non-core asset whose value we will seek to realize over time. While we have determined neither the manner nor timing of how we will do so, there are a number of possible alternatives and we will attempt to monetize this asset in the manner which will create the most value for our shareholders. We receive approximately $600 million in pre-tax income from the JV annually, and this will not change as a result of the demerger transaction, and our guidance assumes that this will continue throughout 2022 with no change to our 32% stake. Let me quickly remind you of some assumptions and context on the projected COVID-19 vaccine contribution and our collaboration agreement. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine collaboration construct is a 50/50 gross profit split. Pfizer books the vast majority of the global collaboration revenue, except for Germany and Turkey where we receive a profit share from BioNTech, and we do not participate in the China region. We continue to expect that we can manufacture 4 billion doses in total by the end of 2022. The $1 billion increase in expected COVID vaccine revenues to approximately $32 billion in 2022 primarily represents the impact of contracts signed since mid-December, which was the cutoff for our prior guidance. While we can\u2019t predict what may be needed due to omicron or other variants, I would also caution you that there is less potential upside to this guidance through the year, compared to the situation we faced in 2021 when the vaccine was newly available and few people had received any doses of the vaccine. As you will remember, our cost of sales for the COVID-19 vaccine revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs, applicable royalty expenses and payment to -- representing 50% gross profit and split. We expect that, the adjusted income before tax margin for the COVID-19 vaccine contribution to the slightly higher than the high twenties as a percentage of revenue that we had in 2021. Unlike the situation for Comirnaty demand for Paxlovid should have upside from these levels, depending on the outcomes of discussions with certain governments and potential purchases for stockpiling against future coronavirus pandemics. If we remove the projected COVID-19 vaccine and Paxlovid contribution from both periods, you'll see that we expect at the 2020 to 2022 revenue range to be $45 billion to $47 billion, representing approximately 5% operational revenue growth at the midpoint. Please remember our guidance excludes the former revenue contribution of approximately $300 million to Meridian, and all '21 quarters have been recast to exclude Meridian is discontinued operations, accounting for its divestiture. Going forward, we will not give earning guidance, excluding the estimated income from our Comirnaty direct sales and alliance revenues and Paxlovid. However, to help you with your forecasting, a couple of minutes ago, I gave you my view on 2022 Comirnaty pre-tax margins. For Paxlovid, I would think about its margins as being typical for a small molecule drug, and unlike Comirnaty, it is expected to not be dilutive to pre-tax margins. To help you further, several years ago before COVID-19 existed, I spoke about our business being on a path back to a 40% plus pre-tax margin and we expect to achieve this level in 2022 for the business excluding Comirnaty and Paxlovid. Going forward we will continue to be prudent in our capital allocation activities with the opportunities for deployment shown here on this slide. In summary, an exceptionally strong quarter and year based on continued strong performance for our growth drivers. During the year, we raised guidance, and for the year, we met or exceeded our guidance in all key metrics. Our pipeline continues to advance, and we have invested record amounts to support that advance. Last week, Arena's shareholders voted to approve Pfizer's acquisition of the Company. We look forward to a targeted closing of the Arena acquisition as soon as the first half of 2022, subject to the satisfaction of the closing conditions, including antitrust approvals. We continue to expect to be active in regards to business development throughout 2022, as we continue to get access to the best external science and bring breakthroughs to patients in 2025 and beyond. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to start the Q&A session. Chris Stevo : Thank you, Frank. Apologies everyone for those technical difficulties. Just want to remind you, we do have the prepared remarks posted to the website. So, if there's anything you missed because of the difficulties, please refer to the prepared remarks, and given the technical difficulties, we're going to try to let the Q and a session run a little longer to answer people's questions. First question, please. Operator : Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America Securities. Geoff Meacham : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just had two. The first one, Paxlovid guidance, I know you guys are factoring in only signed agreements, but can you give us a general sense as to agreements or doses perhaps that are under discussion, and is that dependent on supply ramping? The second question, on external BD Albert, I understand the strategy. I think the uncertainty is really the ability to scale some of the products that you brought in. So, if COVID-19 is less of a long-term contributor than you assume, what\u2019s the appetite to do higher impact larger deals? You clearly have the capacity. Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Angela, do you want to take a little bit of Paxlovid? Angela Hwang : Sure. So, currently, we are in active discussions with over 100 countries and governments around the world. So, I\u2019d say that the discussions are going really well. In terms of where we are with the contracting, as you say, we\u2019ve included some of the contracts that we already are -- that we have. But, of course, this number changes every day. And contracts are being secured and distribution agreements being secured literally on a day-to-day basis. So, I think that this is a number to watch out for. And we do continue to expect movement. I think that there is a tremendous amount of interest for our product. And certainly, as the clinical program continues to develop and emerge, as you know, we only have the high-risk study right now, we still have the standard risk and the prophylaxis that\u2019s coming up, and I think that the full clinical program will also be another point of impetus for contracting and ordering. So, I think it\u2019s going just really well and more to come on this front. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Aamir, maybe some comments on the BD. Aamir Malik : Sure. Thanks for the question, Geoff. I think in terms of the top line, we\u2019re going to be incredibly flexible. We have said repeatedly that we are most interested in compounds that have potential to be real breakthroughs, and this can take the form of later-stage clinical development as well as earlier stage medical innovation. We\u2019re going to bias to the Tas, oncology, I&I, rare, vaccines, internal medicine and hospital, where we\u2019ve got the scientific chops to make good choices and add real value. And we\u2019re going to be flexible on the deal types. Acquisitions are obviously very much in the cards, but strategic partnerships and alliances are well. And, in fact, some of our best successes have come from some capital-light collaborations. If we see a larger opportunity that\u2019s strategic and creates value and meets the criteria that I just described, we\u2019ve obviously got the balance sheet to utilize to do that. So, we certainly will look at those, but we\u2019re going to talk about and focus on the priorities that I described more so than synergy driven deals per se. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Aamir, and just to add to both points because I\u2019m sure that both will be asked a lot. On the Paxlovid, clearly, the numbers could become way bigger than what we have right now, but this is not something that we have done in the past and we don\u2019t plan to do right now to give based on what could be the potential as a guidance. We are giving guidance based on what it is more or less secure. However, signed deals are already agreed, but not signed yet deals, but agreed prices and volumes. So, clearly, if you remember, when we started with the vaccine, in the beginning, we had a guidance of, I think, $15 billion in the first quarter, something like that. Eventually, made $36 billion. Here, we start even stronger in our first projections with Paxlovid. So and that\u2019s why we manufacture and we\u2019ll move ahead with our plans and already we are at 120 million treatments and we have the ability to go higher if the discussions that we\u2019re having materialize. In terms of also the business development, I just want to emphasize that -- because I\u2019m getting a lot this question on the size. We are agnostic to size. Where we are biased, it is deals. But in order to justify the premium, we will have to do significant cost synergies. This is not -- these are -- could be very profitable deals for other, let\u2019s say, periods of the history of the Company, not now. Right now, the Company is having a manufacturing machine, but it is performing at its best, an R&D machine, but it\u2019s performing at its best, a commercial machine, but keeps being the leader in the industry in terms of their ability to execute and deliver. So, the last thing I want to do, it is to do a deal, but in order to justify the premium to the shareholders of the other company, we will have to shut down manufacturing sites and to consolidate the shared sites and consolidate field forces, so that we can justify, so we can generate the core synergies. This is not the time to disrupt the momentum of the Company. This is a time to bring into this manufacturing machine, the research machine, the commercial machine more substrate in addition to what we produce organically ourselves. And this is why the business development is aiming in these areas. So, let\u2019s go to the next one. Operator : Your next question comes from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Mohit Bansal : Great, thanks. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe one on Paxlovid. So, there have been some news reports talking about logisticals and access issues for Paxlovid. And I understand the supply is tight for now, but would love to get your thoughts on how you\u2019re working on improving the logistics when the supply is no longer an issue, especially in a world where home testing would become a norm and one needs to take this drug within five days of diagnostics. Thank you. Albert Bourla : I wouldn\u2019t say that we have logistical issues of supply. But, Angela, would you like to take that, please? Angela Hwang : Sure. So first of all, again, our deliveries and our allocations for the doses have gone extremely well here in the U.S. Just to give you some context, 265,000 doses have been allocated by the U.S. government since the EUA was approved. And of that 265,000, 85% of all the doses have been ordered. So and we see a range of ordering patterns from the states. Some states are ordering 100% of the allocation, others are 80%, 70%, so on and so forth. So, it is really only a handful that haven\u2019t really ordered up to their allocation. But I would say, for the most part, the weekly orders are going up and increasing week by week. And there is a very strong placement of orders. So, I would say that the drawdown right, of the doses and the utilization is going really well. And again, it differs by state what the allocations are and how that\u2019s going. And then, as Albert said, I don\u2019t know that we have logistical -- like, they are not logistical issues. I think, initially, what was difficult was that it was not clear where the doses were being located because every state had a different system for where to actually distribute Paxlovid from. But there are a number of tools now that have gone up online, both at the state level as well as on Pfizer\u2019s website. We\u2019ve taken the state government tool and also loaded it on our website, so that both HCPs and patients can see where Paxlovid is being -- where it\u2019s available and where the orders as well as prescription can be placed. So, I think in that regard, that\u2019s all been ironed out. I think looking forward into the future, clearly, having a seamless sort of end-to-end, from diagnosis, positive results to then being able to prescribe quickly and having the patient be able to acquire the drug quickly is our goal. And I think, on all of those fronts, we\u2019re working with a number of partners both from a testing and a diagnostics perspective, but also from a telemedicine perspective and from a pharmacy perspective, to ensure that we have as fast and as efficient, I can say, a patient journey, right from diagnosis right until treatment. So, all of that is in place. And you\u2019ll continue to hear more about that as the launch and as the utilization increases. Albert Bourla : So, again, to punctuate and give a little bit of context to what Angela said, the 85% that -- it has already been ordered from the quantity that we are making available to U.S. government. It\u2019s a very, very high number. For example, the same number in the first month for vaccines, if you remember well, if you remember from that time, was dramatically lower than that because it takes time for the states to get their act together and it is really variable state by state. So, there are states right now, but once the quantities are made to them available, they are ordering immediately and there are states that take their time until they get their act together for the distribution. In general, way, way, way more efficient than what used to be in the first months of the vaccine, also, what is extremely important, it is that every week, there is constant replenishments, which although we do not have right now, data for scripts, because it\u2019s too early, what we do have it is that the quantities that the states are accumulating, they\u2019re disappearing and then immediately they are placing orders. So, I would say we have, let\u2019s say -- we are pretty happy with the way that the first month, the collaboration with the U.S. government went in terms of allocating doses. And there is dramatically also improvement in the tools, as Angela described. But the bigger improvement will come from the fact that the second month, we will make available way more quantities, and the third month, way more quantities because the issues right now for people trying to find it, it is in few places in the state because you can\u2019t expand the network of places that it is variable when you have smaller quantities. That will be very, very different in this month and basically all over the place, I think, in the third month where significant quantities will be delivered. Okay. I think let\u2019s go to the next question. Operator : Your next question is from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Evan Seigerman : Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. I was wondering if you could provide an update on the FTC review process for the Arena deal. If I\u2019m not mistaken, there was a recent procedural move where you and Arena withdrew and re-filed the HSR Act filing essentially to allow the FTC an additional 30 days for review. And then, I\u2019d also love for you to walk me through your assumptions on how you forecast $13 billion in revenue from BD transactions that would imply to your specific targets and combination of targets in mind. Any color here that you could provide would be very helpful. Thank you. Albert Bourla : Yes. Thank you very much. On the last one, just to make sure, but this is not our assumption. Our assumption is way higher of the $13 billion. What I just gave you, it is what is the consensus of the deals that we have signed so far. But on the FTC review, I would like to ask Doug to provide maybe a review on that, Doug Lankler, our General Counsel. Doug Lankler : Yes. As you pointed out, we did request to refile, which is not unusual. Under -- the deal is, of course, subject to customary closing conditions and typical anti-trust clearance and shareholder approval, which, as you know, we\u2019ve received. We don\u2019t expect a significant break in time from our proposed sense that the deal will close in the first half of this year. We still expect it to close in the first half of this year. Albert Bourla : Thank you. And Aamir, although I did explain that this is consensus numbers, not our numbers, do you want to make any other comment on the $13 billion of 2030 revenues that consensus forecasts for the deals that we have signed? Aamir Malik : Yes. The only thing I would add is, we feel very good about the progression of all of the substrate and the deals since 2019 that Albert outlined. We\u2019ve seen a significant number of approvals in the EUAs in that group, submissions as well as quite a few Phase 3 starts. So we think that that substrate is progressing well and the $13 billion is the consensus number. Our expectations of what\u2019s there are materially higher and there are a number of transactions. We spoke to Trillium, Biohaven and even some of the recent things that we\u2019ve done in mRNA that are not yet factored in the consensus forecast on those transactions. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Umer Raffat : Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking my question. Perhaps two on vaccines today, if I may. First, on the flu vaccine. I know you\u2019ve had a trial ongoing on your mod RNA since September. And I noticed you just initiated a new trial of a self-amplifying mRNA for flu. And I wonder if the decision to progress a second mRNA program in flu was triggered by any emerging data from your first-gen flu Phase 1 that\u2019s been ongoing. And then, secondly, on the Omicron-specific booster, perhaps in light of some of the emerging data on immunogenicity differences or lack thereof versus regular COVID-19 vaccines. I guess my question is, what\u2019s your confidence on ability to show superiority of an Omicron-specific booster versus regular and what would be the regulatory criteria? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Thank you very much. I think Mikael can take the question. On the flu vaccines, just to make sure what I clarify, the plan was always to initiate an mRNA for flu and a round of two programs entirely. It\u2019s not that we show data that forced us to do SI&A. It was always the plan. We are advancing new forms of mRNA technology in SA. It is one of the most promising next-generation of RNA technologies. But Mikael, any comments on that and on the Omicron-specific -- our confidence for superiority? Mikael Dolsten : Thank you. Yes, we are accumulating, first of all, from our mod mRNA data trial, data on various regimens and on multivalent constructs. We remain of the view that we aspire to develop a flu vaccine. Currently, the most aggressive timelines are focused on the mod mRNA. Our plans is to develop something that has a differentiation versus the current tetravalent standard of care. I know other companies have spoken about being similar, while at this moment we still see opportunities to possibly differentiate with an mRNA-based or mod mRNA. As Albert alluded to, we are actually filing the IND for the self-amplified. I think, the protocol may have gone up already on ClinicalTrials.gov, but dosing is going to be within the next couple of months or so. And it\u2019s entirely based on us aiming to develop that platform, which has particular relevance for combinations vaccine, given that possibly we expect to have much lower mRNA burden and can over time build vaccine combination of several different pathogens. We\u2019ll keep you updated on progress with the mod mRNA flu and we certainly see data that suggests that this is a feasible path and we are working to refine our approach to aim for a differentiated vaccine. Albert Bourla : What about Omicron and how confident we are about the superiority? Mikael Dolsten : Yes. The regulatory path is that we expect to have a -- if successful, an Omicron boost would show higher neutralizing antibodies for Omicron versus a similar boost by the Wild Type vaccine and acceptable titers to the other previously available strains to preserve broad protection, but possibly with higher Omicron. I really think we showed. Let the science play out here. We are talking about a number of weeks before we get data. And as alluded to, it has three different arms on top of three doses, Omicron versus Wild Type, that was on top of three previous doses, on top of two previous vaccine doses, one or two Omicron, that will be very interesting data set, and then Omicron on naive. So, I think it\u2019s a really interesting trial and we\u2019ll extract a lot of data and we\u2019ll report whether we can get that superiority. But in any case, I would just want to punctuate that our current vaccine is active of the three doses and raise relevant neutralizing antibodies. And the T-cell responses that we see are likely the one that contribute in real world evidence to provide effective protection of the current vaccine against hospitalization and death. Omicron vaccine is an interesting opportunity that we\u2019ll learn more about. But our science is progressing against several dimensions on how to further improve over time mRNA vaccines, although they\u2019re all pretty good ones. So, you should expect Pfizer continue to be a leader in this field through multiple approaches, together with BioNTech. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Louise Chen from Cantor. Louise Chen : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So, my first question for you is, what are the key pushes and pulls to your underlying business excluding COVID? And what gives you confidence that you can still meet that top-line sales guidance that you gave through 2025 despite some of the volatility that we\u2019re seeing right now? And then, just wanted to ask you on your TL1A antibody and where you are with development of that product and the reporting of data? Have you changed any of the timelines for when you report data? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much. On the 6%, what gives us confidence, it is that we are -- we keep meeting the goal. As I said that we set the goal in \u201919 for a 6% all the way CAGR. And then, we had -- year-to-date, we are at 6% right now. The year particularly it is at 5% for the underlying business. But there is a little bit of volatility, but always we knew that this will be a year that we are losing some of the revenues of CHANTIX compared to previous year, which affects quite significant this deal, which then, as we are launching new products, they are coming up. Maybe I will ask Angela to give a little bit more details on the inputs and how this is progressing and also Mikael on the antibody question. Angela? Angela Hwang : Thank you, Louise. I think the 6% confidence is really driven by two things. First of all, the launches, right, that will take place between now and 2025, which will continue to drive growth for us. But also importantly, in our in-line portfolio, Louise, every single one of our products still have opportunities to grow. They can grow from a number of different ways, right? There is still under-diagnosed patients. So, from new diagnosis, you can continue to drive a tremendous amount of growth in Eliquis and in Vyndaqel. In many of our products, we still have class growth. Think about the CDK4/6s, think about Xtandi, think about Braf/Mektovi. These are all therapies that are still, I think, underutilized from a class perspective. So, there\u2019s growth there. And then finally, for all of them, there is the opportunity to grow in terms of market share, just given just the strong clinical profile and strong lifecycle support that we have for all of our product. So, I think we see tremendous amount of growth still. We just have not tapped out of growth in our core in-line brands. And then, you add on top of that, the launch brands. This is where we\u2019re going to get our growth from. Albert Bourla : Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : Thank you, Angela. On the TL1A, as you remember, the previous earnings call, we showed some really strong data in the range of 34% endoscopic improvement and, with a biomarker, 48% in patients way above expected standard of care. That trial has enrolled very fast. It\u2019s fully enrolled. Full trial readout will be Q4. We are obviously considering based on the encouraging data in the previous trial opportunity for interim analysis that pending data could allow us to accelerate development of the program to its potential pivotal study. So, all in, it\u2019s moving very well and very fast. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen. Steve Scala : Thank you very much. Just to be absolutely clear, I understand that Pfizer wants to be conservative on Paxlovid, but it seems that Pfizer has merely scratched the surface on its 2022 potential and that scratching of the surface is what\u2019s in 2022 Paxlovid guidance. So, please just tell me if you disagree with that statement. Secondly, and just to be clear once again, do you not see growth for Pfizer overall in \u201925 through \u201930 without business development? And then, lastly, on danuglipron, Slide 39 shows some very good data. I\u2019m curious what was the discontinuation rate in the study? Can the dose be increased further? And does Pfizer expect additional weight loss beyond 12 weeks? Thank you very much. Albert Bourla : Yes. So, let me take the two first questions and then Mikael can take the research one. Look, it\u2019s not that we are giving conservative guidance. What we do, we have principles that we follow because otherwise you can be lost. And the principles that we are following, it is that we are only giving guidance for contracts that have been signed or they are very close to be signed because we have agreed critical terms predominantly. So, this is what you have heard about Paxlovid. Clearly, this is only a very small fraction of the 120 million treatments that we are right now preparing to manufacture and it is a small fraction of things that we are discussing right now around -- with different governments. But we are not taking, for example, an approach that we take all the discussions that we\u2019re having with the different governments, we risk-adjust them to see how many things can go part through and then we give a guidance. This is not what we do. We only give, and this is the same with the vaccines, things that have been signed or are really agreed by the time -- in a specific deadline. And I think, Frank said it was last week, I think, this deadline. So, clearly, there is a lot of potential, but it is not that we are putting a little bit of our own conservatism in the numbers. We are following a principle, so that we can always be clear with what we say and why we say. So, that\u2019s the -- then what about the study dose and the 12 weeks delay, Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : On the danuglipron, I\u2019m pleased that you were happy and impressed with our data. And indeed, I would say the glucose lowering through HbA1c and the body weight deductions are probably among the best in such a short treatment period. Tolerability and discontinuation rates improved versus previous study because we extended the dose titration from two weeks. And overall, safety, adverse events, I think, are very much in line with what you see comparable titration approaches with injectables. Given that we see that we can improve tolerability and discontinuations with this medium titration rate, we have the next studies coming up with a further slow dose titration, maybe up to a month or so, and we think that may even bring readouts of efficacy further above this. So, we are very pleased with the profile. And I think the next study will nail down for us dose regimen and will help us to move with a strong profile into a potential pivotal study. Albert Bourla : All right. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Tim Anderson : Thank you. A few questions. The RSV vaccine data previously said early \u201922, now you\u2019re saying first half \u201922, does that imply there has been some slippage because early to me, I always felt that meant January, February, something like that. mRNA flu, second question, what\u2019s a realistic timeframe for potential regulatory filing of a product like that, assuming you find success in your trials? And then, last question, Ibrance, sales soft. You say it\u2019s due to patient assistant programs. We haven\u2019t seen that impact, other CDK4/6s. And I haven\u2019t generally heard about those programs impacting other brands, either at Pfizer or other companies. So, I\u2019m wondering what else may be putting pressure on Ibrance. Are you having to cut price to maintain access? Albert Bourla : Yes. What was your question on flu vaccine? Tim Anderson : A realistic timeframe for filing for approval of the mRNA flu vaccine. Albert Bourla : Yes. Thank you. Thank you. So, why don\u2019t we go -- Mikael, what about RSV? If you can speak about both. We have both now, adult and maternal. And then the mRNA. And then, Angela, if you speak about Ibrance. Mikael Dolsten : Yes. On the RSV, we have enrolled very well maternal and adult, and are basically, I would say, fully enrolled. So, it\u2019s entirely to ensure we have the number of events that we were looking for. And we expect both trials to readout, whether it\u2019s somewhere between Q1, Q2 or at a later part of Q2, we\u2019ll just see and as events accumulate, but it\u2019s going very well. So, I feel very optimistic with RSV study to conclude and we\u2019re looking forward to that data. MRNA flu, we are right now accumulating ingenuity from several different type of dose regimens. And if we are able to conclude with an optimal dose regimen using the mod mRNA, a potential Phase 2/Phase 3 study could certainly be initiated this year, but of course it\u2019s a little bit early to speculate before you have identified the right Phase 2/3 dose regimen. If we would embark on such a study this year, we expect it can conclude very fast, given our experience to run very large trials in this sector and this population of adults. And so, we\u2019re talking about possible conclusion then within next year. But it\u2019s, I would say, one step at a time. We\u2019ll keep you informed. We are encouraged so far. And we\u2019ll go from there. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael. And then, what about, Angela, on the Ibrance? Angela Hwang : Sure. I can confirm that the patient assistance program is indeed the primary reason for the decline in volume that you\u2019ve seen on Ibrance. Just to give you some perspective, in Q4 of 2021, our PAP prescriptions were up 32% compared to where it was in Q4 of 2020. And all of this is 53% more than what it was pre-COVID. And so, this is really what has cost us a tremendous amount of paid prescriptions. And that\u2019s really the primary reason. We also saw, and throughout the year, and this has been something that we\u2019ve been watching quarter-over-quarter, just some slowdown in a new patient starts. And -- but we\u2019ve seen this sort of phenomenon across multiple products in our portfolio. So there\u2019s a small contribution from that. But the largest contribution by far is truly this phenomenon we\u2019re seeing here in terms of PAPs Albert Bourla : Thanks, Angela. Before we move to the next question, I realize that I didn\u2019t answer one of the questions that Steve made, Steve Scala, about if we believe that we need business development to grow in the period \u201925 to \u201930. And clearly this is not the belief right now. We think that we have a clear LOE number that we estimate around $17 billion. And we have a pipeline that delivers more than the LOEs. So, only organically, with what we have right now, in our calculations, we are at positive growth trajectory. The $25 billion I just mentioned needs to be on top of everything, the balance between LOEs and different funds like that, everything new but will be invented in the meantime, and of course, the COVID trajectory through 2030. But we don\u2019t need right now business development at all to grow. What we need business development is to maintain high level of 6% growth top-line, all the way through 2030, for example. Let\u2019s go now to the next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi. Andrew Baum : Thank you. Couple of questions. First, what are your expectations that you\u2019ll need two shots of Omicron as opposed to one? The reason I ask is recently published animal models suggest that one Omicron mRNA vaccine actually generates lower levels of neutralizing antibody against Omicron than the ancestral spike variants, presumably due to antigenic sin. It obviously has implications for both revenues in terms of two shots but also compliance. And then, second, perhaps you could comment on the outlook for CD47 and talk to the differences between your molecule and Gilead\u2019s, which obviously has run into some safety issues with trial suspensions. Many thanks. Albert Bourla : Yes. I will take the first one very quickly so that I can give time to Mikael to speak about the second one. Look, we have to wait to see the result, but I don\u2019t think it is all mRNA vaccines are the same, so I don\u2019t think we should extrapolate preclinical data for one effort to what will be the clinical, let\u2019s say, results of the other effort. We are testing both; one shot, we are testing two shots, and we are testing pretty soon hybrid vaccines, but everything what we have seen so far give us confidence that we will have a very strong reaction and immunogenicity of the an Omicron against Omicron. But, of course, that\u2019s based on preclinical. We need to wait see the first clinical data so that this assumption can be validated. With that, Mikael, what about Gilead? And by the way also, Andrew, you said what about your expectations. Our expectations are not based on one shot or two shots or five shots. Our expectation, as I said, it is contracts signed as for last week with Comirnaty. So what we\u2019ll sign further on will be in addition to whatever we have given so far. Mikael, on the Gilead? Mikael Dolsten : Yes. The interest in our product from Trillium was triggered by its unique design. It is what we call receptor fusion blocker protein in contrast to magrolimab that you referred to that\u2019s on hold, the Gilead antibody, it binds with a lower affinity to the target. And that was by purpose to allow it particularly to accumulate on high-expressing cancer cells and less accumulate on red blood cells to cause -- not to cause anemia or hemolytic anemia. And indeed, in our studies that have generated proof of concept, we have seen single-agent activity in blood cancers with basically negligible effect on red blood cells. So this is playing well out. We do not know why magrolimab is on clinical hold, but of course this differentiation that we have in our molecule may be one example of why our molecule has been doing so well this far. While we initially focus on lymphoid malignancies of the B-cell type, we think we also may become increasingly interested to go to the myeloid space where magrolimab has been, AML and MDS, particularly if our profile now may be superior and we\u2019re waiting readout from such studies also. So, for us, the Trillium deal is delivering on all what we expected and may actually have upside due to its more unique profile. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Chris Schott : Hi, great. Thanks much for the questions. Maybe just two to start with on just some clarifications around guidance, I know you\u2019re not giving a lot of details around core versus COVID-related earnings this year, but there\u2019s a lot of questions on that front. But if I just take the low end of your sales range at $45 billion, apply a 40% margin, tax-adjust that, I think I\u2019m getting a number somewhere around $2.60 per share at the low end. Is there any issues with that math I\u2019m doing? Or am I in the right ballpark there if I just want to think about a low end of core guidance for this year? My second question was on Paxlovid, and you\u2019re referencing here typical small molecule, I guess, gross margins for this one. Just help us frame that a bit more. I guess, is something in the mid-80s a reasonable level to think about for gross margins for this product or is it substantially higher or lower? I\u2019m just trying to better understand profitability to maybe think about some of these contracts coming forward in this year and maybe that Paxlovid number moving. And then, just the final one just to wrap up. I\u2019m still trying to get my hands around the BD side of the business and kind of the approach. I guess, should we be thinking about a significantly different approach to business development for Pfizer today versus what the Company was doing two or three years ago prior to the COVID upside? Or is this more just a continuation of, I guess, the focus and what you\u2019re looking at if we\u2019re thinking back to like 2019 as an example? Thanks so much. Albert Bourla : Yes. I\u2019ll take very quickly the third one and then Frank can take the first two questions. I wouldn\u2019t -- I would say, it is a continuation but with a way more accelerated pace. I don\u2019t think we are changing what we\u2019re saying since 2019. We are going into the science, as Aamir said. We are going into areas that we think we\u2019ll make fewer mistakes in selecting the right targets. We will be more successful, so we will be able to meet at least the success rates of the industry. Our aim is to exceed them as we\u2019re selecting assets. We prefer to go to areas that we can add value and there are significant areas that we can add value by becoming the preferred partner of several biotechs. And also, we have seen, as Aamir said, that some of the best deals we have done were not the most capital-intensive deals, right? So, there are -- so all of that, we are learning, we are not going to relax the discipline that we\u2019re having in selecting, but we are going to intensify a lot our activity in that area because, of course, we think that now is the time science is at a stage that we can find enough targets to be able to add value and create value. So that\u2019s on the BD side. Now, Frank, a lot of financial questions for margins, guidance, etc. Frank D\u2019Amelio: Sure. So, Chris, on the walk through you did on, I\u2019ll call it, the business excluding Comirnaty and Paxlovid, I would use the midpoint on the revenue. You used, I think, a 40% income before tax margin. Then you got to tax-effect that. I didn\u2019t hear you say tax-effect it. So, if you do the math, you do the walk through and then you tax effect it, obviously dividing that by shares outstanding. That will give you, I think, a number that\u2019s in the ballpark. On Paxlovid gross margin, let me answer the question this way. One, we don\u2019t give margin information by individual product, right? It\u2019s something that, for many reasons, we don\u2019t do. But the way to think about it is, one, that the income before tax margin on that, the margin profile is similar to our other solid oral dose products. And remember, when you look at the gross margin, there\u2019s going to be SI&A investment in Paxlovid this year because we\u2019re launching that product. There\u2019s additional R&D investment in product that year because we\u2019re continuing obviously to evolve that product. All of that obviously is captured in the income before tax margin on that business, which is similar to our other solid oral dose products. It\u2019s all factored in our guidance. The one place where you can really see the impact, and hopefully this is helpful, you look at our cost of sales as a percentage of revenue last year, for the full year, 37.7%. If you look at our guidance this year, 32.2% to 34.2%, the midpoint is 33.2%. That\u2019s down, at the midpoint, 4.5%, most of which is being driven by the Paxlovid revenue this year. So maybe that\u2019s the way to help you in terms of just how to work the numbers. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Frank. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Chris Shibutani : Thank you very much. Two questions. One, again, just to make sure I understand clearly the thinking about what underpins the intermediate growth expectation through \u201925. I believe, when that was originally issued back in 2019, that did not assume contribution from business development to achieve that CAGR of 6% to \u201925. Is that still the case? That would be the first question. And then, the second question relates to Paxlovid. We have the standard risk study that you\u2019ve modified expanding. Can you talk about what kind of result we would need to see in order to influence the kinds of decisions and discussions that Angela is having with governments, in particular, the primary endpoint which just missed statistical significance on the alleviation of symptoms. Do you need to hit that? Or are the discussions being guided around the ability to meet the secondary endpoint, which was the decreased risk of hospitalizations and severe disease from that standard risk study? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Maybe I can take both in the interest of time. I can confirm that our guidance of 6% was excluding BD. So that was from \u201919 all the way to \u201925, 6% CAGR, from the things that we had at the time. As regards the standard risk primary endpoint, I think most of the governments, if not all, they are focusing right now all their purchases and their discussions that they\u2019re having on the ability to reduce hospitalization. And by the way, most of the -- I mean, FDA, for example, has already approved vaccinated and unvaccinated, which is included -- that means that includes also people that were in the standard risk population because the high-risk population were all unvaccinated. So, if we go -- the standard risk, I think, will contribute, but I think everybody is moving with the assumption that we give it to all people to prevent hospitalization. That\u2019s the main thing that everybody is looking. Now, the in-house contact, this is a very different that can change very much the landscape. There are no discussions around that right now. But if it comes positive, clearly that could be used also in preventing infections in high-risk populations once someone in the household or in the senior house or in other, let\u2019s say, business -- in other, let\u2019s say, settings that people are living together, one is getting infected. But this is something that will come on top of any discussions that we are having right now if it is positive. Let\u2019s go to the next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Vamil Divan from Mizuho Securities. Vamil Divan : Hi, great. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess I\u2019ll stick with the same theme around Paxlovid and business development. First, on Paxlovid, just to make sure we\u2019re all starting on the same page, I guess, can you comment on exactly how many doses are included in the guidance that you\u2019re giving right now? You mentioned in the release, the 20 million to the US, I think 2.75 million to UK, but there\u2019s obviously been some other contracts that have been signed. So, I don\u2019t know if you can give us a number or a range just so we have a sense of kind of what\u2019s included right now. And then, on business development, I just thought one thing was sort of interesting when you\u2019re talking about Slide 13. Albert, you mentioned the strength of allocating cash flows while you pursue new BD opportunities going forward that could add at least $25 billion of risk-adjusted revenues in 2030. And I\u2019m just curious, that $25 billion is sort of a specific number, I\u2019m wondering -- obviously that\u2019s in your prepared remarks. So, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s well thought out. So I\u2019m just curious what sort of drove that, and obviously that number could be much smaller or probably a lot bigger depending on what you do over the next few years. So, maybe if you can give some -- provide some clarity on why you worded that the way you did. Thank you. Albert Bourla : Why we selected $25 billion to speak about $25 billion, you mean? Vamil Divan : Yes, saying at least $25 billion in adjusted revenues. Albert Bourla : Yes, I got it, I got it. Frank, would you like to take the Paxlovid and the doses? Frank D\u2019Amelio: Of course. So, Vamil, on the Paxlovid guidance, you heard Angela mention before. We\u2019re very active right now, 100-plus negotiations with different governments. Don\u2019t want to put any information out there that could, I\u2019ll call it, lead to misleading assumptions and those assumptions being detrimental to those contract negotiations. But now, you mentioned a couple of contracts that have been announced publicly and where the dose information was included. You mentioned the US $20 million and the UK $2.75 million. If you look at everything we\u2019ve announced publicly, give or take, it\u2019s around -- about 30 million treatments. And so that 30 million treatments is clearly included in the guidance that we provided in the $22 billion of revenue. Albert Bourla : Thank you. And Aamir, why we selected $25 billion? Aamir Malik : Sure. So, Vamil, a couple of thoughts. One, we obviously -- between the strength of our balance sheet and the cash flows, we have the ability to deploy significant capital. And going beyond our growing dividend, we think that those cash flows deployed into business development are going to give us an attractive return. So that\u2019s one piece of it. The second is, we think that this is frankly a great time for scientific advancement in our industry, as you look across academia, venture, biotech, big, small, there is no shortage of external substrate that we think can complement what we\u2019re doing internally. And we\u2019re going to be thoughtful and disciplined about the science that we want to pursue. And the combination of those two things, combined with the capabilities that we have, we think that there is significant growth that we can add to our business through business development going forward. Albert Bourla : Yes. And also -- it is very important also to understand, Vamil, that we believe that once you put a target, you better execute way better when you have a target in front of you. And actually believe that the target is to be public because we\u2019re a public company and we don\u2019t have a problem to do it. So, also we went into to analyze the substrate and the opportunity, and as always, we are providing at least $25 billion, because as always we like to have targets that we\u2019re putting out there and we\u2019re beating them. But we believe that with the current, all our analytics that we have done, this is a very reasonable target to achieve, without, let\u2019s say, utilizing all of our firepower right now. So that will allow to do dividend and other uses of capital and still do volume. And we are confident to put it out there so that people can start measuring against it. Thank you very much. And next question? Operator : Your next question comes from Kerry Holford from Berenberg. Kerry Holford : Thank you. Firstly, just on the oral GLP-1, I wonder if you can confirm the number of pills a day that you\u2019ll be using in Phase 2b study up to that maximum dose 200 mgs twice a day. Was that pill burden for the highest dose? And also, on obesity, you\u2019ve not discussed that today, but do you have the Phase 2a data inhouse? I note too that you said that you\u2019ve made another oral GLP-1 molecule into the clinic. And I\u2019m just interested to know how that asset will differ from the initial danuglipron. And then, lastly, just on the guidance. So if I\u2019m thinking about the $4 billion range on your sales guidance, given you\u2019ve given us a point estimate there or thereabouts for the vaccine and the antiviral, should I assume the majority of the flex remaining relates to the base business? And if so, can you help me understand the key moving parts within that element of the business, which drugs may be a driver of that flex? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Let me take very quickly, in the interest of time, the last one. No, the flex is spread around everything. So you should assume, for example, in the 31 of -- in the 32 that we gave for -- 33, right, on the vaccines, $500 million up, $500 million down, that\u2019s $1 billion. On the Paxlovid, $500 million up, $500 million, that\u2019s another $1 billion. And then, on the business, as always, we gave $1 billion, up and down. So whatever you think is the midpoint, $1 billion up, $1 billion up, which is consistent with what we were doing all these years for that level of business. And Mikael, on the oral? Mikael Dolsten : Yes. Danuglipron is a BID drug and pill burden will be relatively low. You also asked for the additional GLP-1 drug we have in clinical development, that\u2019s once a day drug. As we have now, I think, really defined what will be soon optimal tetration for an oral GLP-1 and we were of course pioneering that there isn\u2019t really a date on it. We may actually consider to take the once daily in the same study as danuglipron, given that we have now this unique opportunity to look through what seems to be two great directs. But currently, I believe danuglipron has all what it takes to go forward to a potential pivotal study based on this study that we shared with you. But it\u2019s, of course, a unique situation to have more than one molecule, and it gives us the very best option for going into Phase 3 quite rapidly after concluding that Phase 2b, pending, of course, expected outcome. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael. And the last question, please. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Carter Gould from Barclays. Carter Gould : Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I\u2019ll keep it to one since we\u2019re at the end. And at the risk of not getting an answer, on OUS pricing for Paxlovid, I understand the underlying aspect is driving sort of your pricing strategy between GDP and volume-based discounts. But in practice, how consistent has the pricing been across geographies? Any color at a high level would be helpful. And as we think about potentially the standard risk data, the prophy data kind of playing out over the course of the year, should we anticipate that pricing will be relatively consistent per course in the second half relative to the first half? Any color there would be helpful. Thank you. Albert Bourla : Our pricing for Paxlovid is a tier pricing. So there is a tier for high-income countries, and that is more or less in line with what you have seen published for Merck\u2019s, for example, product, and we have seen published ourselves. Only exception was the U.S., that they got a very special price because of higher orders, but the rest are more or less consistent. And then there is, of course, there is a second tier for middle-income countries. And for the lower-income countries, we are going to provide it at cost. But also for the low-income countries, in addition to our own providing at cost, of course, we have also initiated a process that a very big number of generic companies will start manufacturing for the low-income countries, which will be 53% of the global population. Now if the price will remain consistent, clearly, this is nothing to comment here. We will not, let\u2019s say, commenting on how prices may or may not evolve in the future. Thank you very much. Now some closing comments very quickly. We have generated strong results, of course, for both pace and impact and financial performance, and we look forward to continue that in 2022. I want to speak a little bit about a few changes in people that we are doing. Speaking about that, we continue to attract visionary, purpose-driven leaders, with a track record of delivering breakthrough results for patients. Case in point, last week, we announced that Dr. William Pao will join Pfizer as Executive Vice President and Chief Development Officer, effective March 21 of this year. Dr. Pao brings more than 25 years of experience as an oncologist and scientist. He joins us from Roche, where he most recently served as the Head of Pharma Research and Early Development. He oversaw the discovery and early development of a portfolio of new molecular entities to treat diseases related to cancer, neuroscience, ophthalmology, rare diseases and can go on and on and on. Of course, cancer is a very big part of his portfolio. Clearly, I want to mention that Dr. Pao succeeds Rod MacKenzie, a legendary leader in Pfizer, who recently announced his intent to retire after 35 years of Pfizer. I want to thank Rod for his incredible contribution to Pfizer, including the outstanding leadership in helping bring Comirnaty and Paxlovid to the world so quick. Of course, also, I need to touch based on something that everybody has in mind. I want to take a moment to recognize my trusted colleague and friend, Frank D\u2019Amelio, who also has announced his intention to retire from Pfizer after an incredibly impactful decade and at the half with the Company as CFO. Frank is one of the smartest, more respected and most effective leaders I have ever had the good fortune to work with, and the positive impact he has had on Pfizer and on all our stakeholders is immeasurable. Frank isn\u2019t going anywhere yet, just to clarify as he has agreed to stay on board and as we search for his successor and also to serve in a consulting role through the transition. That said, I wanted to take the opportunity to thank him publicly for all he has meant to Pfizer and to me personally. And Frank, on behalf of our 80,000 colleagues around the world, I wish you good health, every happiness as you begin a new chapter when this time comes, because it\u2019s not yet. Wherever life\u2019s journey takes you, I\u2019m sure it will be directionally correct. And that will bring an end to our call. Thank you for joining us. Have a great rest of your day.

A brief question-and-answer session will follow prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Steven Immergut. Please go ahead. Steven Immergut : Thank you, and welcome to GBT's conference call to discuss the company's financial results for the first quarter 2022 and to provide a business update. I'm Steven Immergut, Head of Communications and Investor Relations. With me today on the call are Dr. Ted Love, our President and CEO; Jeff Farrow, Chief Financial Officer; David Johnson or DJ, Chief Commercial Officer; and Dr. Kim Smith Whitley, Executive Vice President and Head of R&D. During today's call, Ted will give an update on our progress in Q1, Jeff will review our financial results, DJ will give an update on the Oxbryta launch, Ken will discuss our pipeline and then Ted will give a few closing remarks before we open the line for questions. Earlier this afternoon, we issued a press release announcing GBT's financial results and business progress for the first quarter ended March 31, 2022. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that certain statements we make on this call that are not historical facts may be forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q as well as in today's press release. Copies of our SEC filings and press releases can be obtained from the Investors page of our company website at gbt.com. The forward-looking statements made on this call are only as of the time they are made, and you should not place undue reliance on such statements. Future events or simply the passage of time may cause our beliefs to change, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements other than as required by law. I'll now turn the call over to Ted. Ted Love : Thank you, Steven, and good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter was a notable start to the year for GBT, highlighted by strong sequential growth in new prescriptions of Oxbryta, including a promising start to our launch in patient ages 4 to 11. The early feedback and metrics on the pediatric launch have been encouraging. For example, we've already secured coverage with many important payers for this expanded indication. In patient ages 12 and older, we had our best result for new prescriptions in several quarters. We are optimistic that this momentum will continue if our key growth drivers increased overall awareness and interest in Oxbryta as we expect. In addition, we are hopeful that the COVID-19 environment will continue to improve given the significant headwinds it has caused for delivery of regular in-person care for patients with SCD. With respect to Europe, we continue to make exciting progress. Following the marketing authorization for Oxbryta by the European Commission in February, we completed regulatory activities to put us on track for a potential approval in Great Britain by mid-year. We kicked off reimbursement discussions in Germany, France and England and continue to enroll patients in our early access program. We also began educating HCPs on Oxbryta and have robust activities planned for launch in Germany very soon and for the EHA meeting in June. During the quarter, we continued our efforts to aggressively advance our clinical programs while exploring additional therapeutic targets in SCD and other red blood cell disorders. For GBT601, we plan to initiate a Phase 2/3 clinical trial by mid-2022. And later in the call, Kim will provide an exciting update on the restart of our Phase 1 study based on patient interest. Altogether, we are well positioned to continue delivering for patients with SCD. We have continued to build momentum with Oxbryta both in the U.S. and internationally, and we are advancing what we believe is the most comprehensive pipeline in sickle cell disease. Our dedication to supporting the SCD community has never been stronger, and our progress with these and other efforts are highlighted in our recently published 2021 ESG report. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff to review the first quarter 2022 results. Jeff Farrow : Thank you, Ted. Total net revenue from sales of Oxbryta was $55.2 million for the first quarter of 2022, in line with our guidance of $54 million to $56 million; first quarter revenue increased by approximately $16 million or 41% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, first quarter revenue declined slightly from the fourth quarter. This reflects the anticipated work down of inventory during the quarter following increased purchases by distributors at the end of the fourth quarter, an incremental increase in gross to net and the impact of Omicron variant in the first part of the quarter. These drivers were partially offset by the continued increase in the net number of patients on Oxbryta, days of inventory on hand at the end of the first quarter was in line with historical levels. Gross to net was 16.3% for the quarter, around 0.5% increase from the fourth quarter, primarily related to increased patient co-pay support as commercial insurance out-of-pocket deductibles reset for patients for the new year as well as higher 340B and Medicaid accruals in the quarter. Now turning to expenses. Cost of sales for the quarter was $1 million compared with $600,000 for the first quarter of 2021, which represents a slight increase on a percentage of sales basis. Cost of sales is anticipated to increase in 2022 as we begin to finish utilizing the remainder of our fully expensed inventory that was previously recorded as R&D expense. R&D expense for the first quarter was $53 million compared with $51 million for the same period in 2021. The increase in R&D expense was primarily due to an increase in external costs related to GBT601, partially offset by a decrease in external costs related to Oxbryta. SG&A for the first quarter was $75 million compared with $59 million for the same period in 2021. The increase in SG&A expense was primarily due to increased professional and consulting services associated with our expanded commercial and medical affairs operations for Oxbryta, including supporting the pediatric launch in the U.S. and launch readiness in geographies outside of the U.S., increased employee-related costs and operational growth, partially offset by a decrease in non-cash stock compensation expense. Both R&D and SG&A expenses were slightly below our expectations in the first quarter, primarily due to the timing of certain expenses that we now expect to be recognized later in 2022. Net loss for the first quarter was $81 million compared to $75 million for the same period in 2021. Basic and diluted net loss per share for the first quarter was $1.26 per share compared with $1.21 per share for the same period in 2021. We ended the first quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $662 million compared with $735 million at the end of 2021. Looking forward to the second quarter of 2022, we anticipate revenues in the range of $63 million to $65 million or sequential growth of 14% to 18%. We expect this will be driven by new prescription growth, including phasing in the first quarter, which was more back-end weighted in terms of growth of new prescriptions. And we expect this will be partially offset by an increase in gross to net and the timing of broad pediatric payer coverage. In summary, our first quarter results were in line with our expectations and we expect that revenue will grow over the remainder of the year. In addition, we continue to be well positioned with a strong balance sheet allowing us to continue to make key investments for future growth. And with that, I will now turn the call over to DJ. David Johnson : Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. As I've done in the past, I will provide an update on three key metrics that will give you further insight into our progress. These metrics are : new prescriptions for Oxbryta, which informs underlying patient demand; the number of healthcare providers prescribing Oxbryta, which captures the progress we are making on adoption; and payer coverage, which speaks to the access environment for Oxbryta. First, new prescriptions. We delivered more than 1,200 new prescriptions during the quarter, our strongest demand quarter since Q1 of 2020. This was driven by the pediatric launch and incremental growth from the 12 and older group. Starting with the pediatric launch, we got off to a strong start in the quarter. We were able to leverage two years of Oxbryta education and awareness building from our original approval to quickly engage with healthcare providers on the pediatric label expansion and to train them on administering the new formulation in early January. Our team did an excellent job building excitement, particularly among pediatric hematologists and caregivers, and early feedback from this engagement has been overwhelmingly positive. This is reflected in the high number of new prescriptions in the quarter. Somewhat expected, the uptake in the pediatric population was strongest in the early part of the quarter when many physicians and patients have been eagerly awaiting the opportunity to start Oxbryta therapy. As a result, many existing prescribers had some of their younger patients ready to initiate therapy shortly after approval. In terms of COVID-19, we did see some impact from Omicron in January, reflecting continued caution by SCD patients and caregivers. However, demand and field team access dynamics did improve in February as infections declined. Similarly, our market research shows that comfort levels for in-person care bounced back quickly in February with most patients and caregivers preferring in-person visits for routine care. And in February, HCPs we surveyed indicated that the majority of their SCD appointments were conducted in-person. This is a good leading indicator that things are likely to start trending back to more normal health care engagement this year. Feedback from our field teams supported what we heard from our market research. Anecdotally, our team saw patient volumes increase in February and March, with ongoing headwinds for COVID causing some adult patients to be cautious due to the increased risk to their health. On the provider side, we continue to see office turnover and staff shortages. And when we look at the claims data in Q1, SCD patient visits to HCP offices remain below pre-pandemic levels. We believe the net effect of all these trends contributed to the sequential growth in new prescriptions for the 12 and older age group, along with the momentum from our DTC and real-world evidence that was presented at ASH last year and recently published in expert review of hematology. We also believe the 12 and older segment benefited from HCP engagement around the pediatric launch, given that the majority of our targets treat a range of age groups. We also continue to see a broad range of patient characteristics for those prescribed Oxbryta, such as baseline hemoglobin and VOC burden suggesting that the prescribers are increasingly recognize the importance of addressing polymerization and long-term health. The COVID environment has remained relatively stable from mid Q1 through April, though we are closely watching the recent uptick in cases. Assuming COVID impact does not escalate, we anticipate that new prescriptions in the second quarter will be roughly flat compared to the first quarter. This reflects slightly lower pediatric new prescriptions following the strong start with patients that have been waiting for Oxbryta, offset by continued incremental improvement in the 12 and older group. Looking ahead to the second half of the year. If the environment continues to improve, we believe we have the potential to accelerate growth driven by our ongoing DTC campaign, new real-world data that we continue to publish and the pediatric launch. The key leading indicators that we see as predictive of a return to sustained quarter-over-quarter growth are improvements in the industry-wide new-to-brand prescriptions and our patients' health care visits returning to pre-pandemic levels. While we are hopeful this will occur, we know SCD patients remain cautious. For example, all the SCD focused community-based organization meetings planned for the second half of the year are taking place virtually. As we prepare for more SCD patients to potentially return to face to face interactions with their health care providers, we are working to raise overall Oxbryta awareness through our ongoing DTC campaign. The metrics from the campaign around targeted audience reach continue to exceed our original goals. In the first quarter, this was aided by several new tactics, including updating the campaign to reflect the pediatric approval and an improved ability to target SCD patients, which we believe contributed to a higher frequency of monthly engagement. In addition, we launched our branded and unbranded content on new channels, including YouTube, Pandora and podcasts. Visits to oxbryta.com and SickleCellSpeaks.com, reached an all-time high in the first quarter. We also are seeing encouraging growth in the number of SCD patients visiting their HCPs within one month of seeing our DTC advertisement. As we think about recent trends, the conversion rate for new prescriptions was consistent with prior quarters. Similarly, Oxbryta adherence, which includes compliance and persistence for patients in the first year of therapy, continued to be within the range of our prior quarter\u2019s and analogs. As we gain more data on adherence for year two and beyond, we are seeing lower adherence compared to year one as would be expected for any chronic medication. But we are encouraged that some patients in year one and beyond have restarted Oxbryta, and that Oxbryta adherence continues to trend better than SCD analogs. In addition, we continue to proactively roll out new tactics aimed at improving overall adherence, including long-term adherence. This includes additional services through our, a patient hub GBT Source Solutions, which continues to be an important driver of patient engagement and adherence. For example, early feedback on the email newsletters and mobile messaging that we launched around the end of 2021 has been encouraging. These services are also available to patients via our specialty pharmacies. And the data shows that patients engage with GBT Source or the similar services offered by these partners, have better adherence rates than those that do not. So we plan to continue investing and driving utilization of these programs. Next, my second metric, healthcare provider penetration. During the quarter, total interactions with healthcare providers increased significantly compared to the fourth quarter, which was lower due to the holidays and lingering impact of the Delta variant. And despite the impact of the Omicron variant in January, in-person visits continued to improve as they have for several quarters, reaching around 50% of our salesforce interactions with HCPs during the quarter. Against this backdrop, we added about 120 new prescribers in the quarter. This includes several prescribers from the 200 new targets we added for the pediatric launch. This group focuses almost entirely on patients that are 11 and younger. Encouragingly with the momentum from the pediatric launch on new prescribers and reengaging prior writers March was our highest month for the number of active prescribers in the last 12 months. When we look at the breakdown of writers, we continue to see prescriptions being written by both specialists and non-specialists, which we believe is a positive trend for the long-term trajectory for the long-term trajectory of the launch. Turning the payor coverage. We continue to have broad payor coverage for the 12 and older patient population with more than 90% of coverage lives, having access in the United States. And our focus is on making it easier for physicians to prescribe and patients to receive Oxbryta. In terms of coverage for the four to eleven age group, we made substantial progress and we are well on our way to achieving our goal of broad coverage by mid-2022, faster than we did with the adolescent and adult population. Before turning the call over to Kim, I also want to provide a brief update on our commercial activities in Europe. We are gaining experience with more than 100 patients participating in our early access programs across Germany, France, and the UK. And following our European Commission approval in February, we are working to launch Oxbryta in Germany in mid-May. We will have open pricing in Germany for the first year while we negotiate future reimbursement. There are around 3000 sickle cell patients in Germany, and we anticipate adoption will be gradual leading to minimal revenues for Europe in 2022. Separately, our team has also begun reimbursement negotiations in France and England. We have begun educating physicians in Europe, on Oxbryta, including plans for our robust presence at the European Hematology Association or EHA meeting in June. At EHA we plan to promote Oxbryta for the first time in Europe, engage with physicians, including our branded [indiscernible] and sponsor an educational program. We also recently held a successful internal launch meeting in Europe, where it was clear that our employees are excited about bringing Oxbryta to patients and to helping GBT achieve our mission around the world. And with that, Kim will now talk about the developments in our pipeline. Kim Smith Whitley : Thank you, DJ. And good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, I will provide an update on our efforts to further expand Oxbryta\u2019s clinical evidence and geographic reach, and our progress advancing our pipeline. Following on our regulatory approval in the European Union in February, we submitted for marketing authorization in Great Britain and believe we are on track potential approval by midyear. As a reminder in the UK Oxbryta was granted approval of early access medicines scheme EAMS, which provides two key advantages. First, patients that meet the eligibility criteria can gain early pre-licensed access to Oxbryta. We are pleased that UK patients have already started on Oxbryta through the EAMS designation. Second, medicines under EAMS that receive marketing authorization by the MHRA, as well as a positive assessment by NICE, benefit from accelerated NHS, England commissioning. In support of the pediatric launch this week at the American Society of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology or ASPO Conference, we will present results from the Oxbryta expanded access program for children with sickle cell disease, age four to eleven.  The EAP data reinforces the efficacy and safety of treatment with Oxbryta in these patients, as seen in the HOPE-KIDS 1 Study. Those hope HOPE-KIDS 1 results were first presented at EHA last year and were published this April in pediatric blood and cancer. Importantly, the majority of patients in the EAP had improved scores as measured by the patient and clinical global impressions of change scale, indicating that Oxbryta treatment is positively impacting their lives. I also want to flag that a 77-patient, single center, real-world experience study of Oxbryta from Dr. Alan Anderson was published in late April in the European Journal of Hematology. Dr. Anderson presented this data, which showed a mean hemoglobin increase of two grams per deciliter and substantial improvements in patient quality of life at several meetings in 2021. At the Annual EHA meeting in June, we plan to present new Oxbryta, real world data and other studies that reflect our efforts to generate new data. EHA abstracts will be announced later this month and we are excited about our planned activities. Now let's turn to the pipeline. For inclacumab, our P-selectin inhibitor, we are enrolling patients in our two Phase 3 studies collectively named THRIVE. One is evaluating the reduction of VOCs over a 48-week treatment period based on inclacumab's potential for quarterly dosing. We believe this would be a meaningful improvement for patients compared to monthly dosing and aligns well with a typical sickle cell disease practice schedule of quarterly office visits. The other Phase 3 study is evaluating 90-day VOC, readmission rates, following an initial VOC hospitalization, which tragically occurs in around 50% of patients who experience an initial VOC. This study is enabled by inclacumab's profile and aligned with its best-in-class potential. We are continuing to focus on enrolling THRIVE as quickly as possible. Turning to GBT-601, our next-generation hemoglobin polymerization inhibitor that we believe has potential to be a best-in-class therapy. At EHA, we aim to share more data on GBT-601, including sickle cell disease patient EPO levels from the Phase 1 study. Separately, we aim to publish new preclinical data for GBT-601 in a peer-reviewed journal later this year. Based on the impressive data we reported at ASH in December, we are working to aggressively advance GBT-601. Our plan is to initiate a Phase 2/3 clinical trial with the goal of submitting for a full regulatory approval with FDA. We expect the Phase 2/3 design will allow us to advance more quickly into the pivotal Phase 3 portion and are working towards our goal of initiating the Phase 2 portion by mid-2022. The purpose of the Phase 2 portion is to identify the optimal dose to advance into Phase 3. As we explore higher doses, we believe they will lead to higher occupancy and hemoglobin increases, and importantly, consistently improve the red blood cell health of patients to resemble that of a sickle cell trait individual. We are also exploring a 150-milligram dose of GBT-601 with patients from our Phase 1 study. We are very excited that all six patients reach out to the clinical trial site wanting to restart therapy, providing us the opportunity to restart the study and explore a higher dose. In my experience, this is the first time I have seen the restart of a sickle cell study due to patient demand.  Patients will receive a 150-milligram daily maintenance dose for six weeks. We anticipate data from this portion of the study will be available by the end of the year and include the same key endpoints as the data we reported at ASH in December. I am proud of the progress we are making with GBT-601, over a short timeframe, while also continuing to drive enrollment in our inclacumab studies and advancing our Oxbryta studies. I firmly believe GBT has the leading clinical and pipeline programs in sickle cell disease. I'll now turn it back over to Ted. Ted Love : Thank you, Kim. In closing, we are off to a strong start in 2022. Given our progress, we are increasingly confident in the outlook for Oxbryta and our pipeline, which provide multiple, new growth opportunities in the coming quarters and years. For Oxbryta, new prescriptions are improving and we believe we have additional upside with the anticipated increase in in-person patient visits. And as we raise awareness through our many ongoing efforts, including our DTC campaign, our compelling clinical data and our pediatric launch. We also continue to invest in the near-term opportunities in Germany, France in the UK, afforded by a recent European commission approval, with the goal of potential broader expansion over time to add another layer to Oxbryta\u2019s growth potential. In terms of innovation, we believe GBT is well positioned with what we view as the most comprehensive pipeline in sickle cell disease. And over the next several years, our goal is to have at least five medicines approved or in the clinic. This R&D goal is matched by our commitment to provide broader support to the SED community. On that note, I want to provide a brief update on potential federal legislation we are supporting that will provide new funding from multidisciplinary care teams across the lifespan of individuals living with sickle cell disease. This legislation is modeled after the federally funded hemophilia treatment centers, a network of 130 clinics that offer coordinated care to Americans living with hemophilia. The total package of $535 million would help the SED community several ways, including a dramatic increase in the funding for SED treatment centers. Currently, this funding is about $9 million per year, which is far below federal funding for other orphan diseases. The legislation would also fund 110 community-based organizations that support patients, families, and communities facing SED. If signed into law, this would be the most comprehensive piece of legislation for sickle cell in 50 years. In summary, we are well positioned to be the leader in sickle cell disease with multiple opportunities to positively impact the lives of the patients we serve. With that, we\u2019ll open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from Ritu Baral with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Ritu Baral : Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to drill down a little bit more into the distribution of NRxs sort of across the quarter? And maybe any color on what you\u2019re seeing in April? Can you just confirm that there was sort of a net increase in NRx numbers over the quarter? I guess I\u2019m trying to figure out if the pediatric bolus is over, but that growth is continuing into April. And then I have a follow-up. Ted Love : Hi, Ritu. This is Ted. We\u2019ll ask DJ to answer that. David Johnson : Yes. Thank you, Ritu. Yes. So, we have seen an increase in net patients on Oxbryta in Q1 over Q4, just like we\u2019ve seen every quarter, the pool of patients on Oxbryta has increased. And of course, as you would expect, because we have the new indication in Q1, we did see some healthy growth, not only in top line enrollments in Q1 at 12 \u2013 over 1,200 new enrollments, but the total pool of patients also went up consistent with that. So, we haven\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not here to talk about Q2 results. I don\u2019t have a lot to talk about that. But we\u2019re certainly pleased with the overall performance in Q1. It\u2019s our strongest quarter from a pure demand perspective since the first quarter of approval two years ago. Ritu Baral : And the pediatric bolus is pretty much over. Is that what you guys are anticipating internally? David Johnson : What I tried to convey in my prepared comments was that we did see the strongest enrollments in the early part of Q1. So signifying that all that work we\u2019ve done for two years, preparing the market, educating on Oxbryta. And of course, many of \u2013 in fact, two thirds of the prescribers in the pediatric pool of treaters are ones that we were already calling on for the two years because they also have 12-and-older patients. So yes, they had patients ready to go right when we got approval. And so that\u2019s why that would make sense that was the strongest months for us. So yes, we think we\u2019ve kind of gotten past that. Now, we\u2019re moving on to more of a consistent number of enrollments expected from the pediatric group going forward. Ritu Baral : Got it. And then just a quick follow-up on GBT601. What doses will you be investigating in the Phase 2a what\u2019s the sort of range of doses? And will you be pursuing a loading dose strategy again in this study? Thanks. Kim Smith Whitley : Hi, Ritu, it\u2019s Kim. Yes, we are going to be pursuing a loading dose similar to what we did with the Phase 1, MAD 1 and MAD 2 phases. And then we will be using a daily maintenance dose of 150 milligrams. Ritu Baral : In the Phase 2a? Great. Thanks for taking all the questions. Kim Smith Whitley : So that\u2019s to clarify, Ritu, I\u2019m sorry. That was for the follow-up for the Phase 1. We have not disclosed a dose for the Phase 2 because, as you know, we are using Phase 2 for the dose finding portion. So that\u2019s just what\u2019s going to be going on with the additional Phase 1 restart. Ritu Baral : Okay. And so the range of doses that you\u2019re going to use in that, that\u2019s to be determined? Kim Smith Whitley : So, we are going to explore, of course, the doses that we looked at, at least in our Phase 1 and consider doses based on a 100 milligram and 150 milligram before we decide whether or not we will explore doses above that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Gerberry with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : This is Parry on the line for Jason. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to get some additional detail on reinitiating the Phase 1 trial for GBT601. First, when could we expect to get an update on when patients will start getting dosed \u2013 and then I know that you spoke about the six patients, but is there a potential for a higher number of patients in the Phase 1? And then I just have one other question. Kim Smith Whitley : We are anticipating to restart the six participants, hopefully, all six, but we are not planning on adding new participants to the Phase 1 portion. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you. And then just one more on the NRx number. Are you able to give a breakdown on adults versus teens in 1Q for NRx? And then I\u2019m curious, in terms of the states that have gain coverage. Are any of these states from the key geographies? I know that you\u2019ve discussed 17 states with this high concentration of sickle cell disease patients? Any detail would be helpful. Thank you. David Johnson : Yes. Regarding the NRxs, we\u2019re not breaking out NRx by age group. Our goal is to drive overall adoption with sickle cell patients in four and above. The pricing is the same and we know that these patients will matriculate into the 12-and-older category over time anyway. So another important dynamic to keep in mind is just that the 12-and-older population is still going to be the largest driver of growth going forward. It\u2019s by far the largest group of patients. So, we think just reporting on overall demand, overall enrollments every quarter gives you the best idea of how we\u2019re driving demand. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re at that time. And I forget the second piece. Unidentified Analyst : The second question is related to specific states, if you\u2019re able to provide any detail on key geography states. David Johnson : Yes. We\u2019re getting prescriptions across the 17 states that make up 85% of our sickle cell patients. As you would imagine, that\u2019s where we\u2019re also the bulk of the pediatric patients near that same geographies, and we are getting prescriptions across the state you would expect. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gregory Renza with RBC. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is [indiscernible] on for Greg. Thanks for taking our question. I was wondering if you could provide some more color on your expectation around the growth trend in adult population going forward as the pandemic impact has gradually stabilized. What\u2019s your latest thinking around providing more long-term sales guidance and probably breaking down the revenues by age group? Ted Love : So Jeff, do you want to take that, because you speak to the issue about revenue guidance in the long term. I think we have up to now, as you know, focused on giving quarterly guidance, and our plan has been to move to longer-term guidance, but we really want to make sure that we are somewhat beyond the pandemic. And we\u2019re not really sure if we\u2019re there yet. We\u2019re hopeful, but not really convinced that we\u2019re completely be there with some of the variants that could be popping up it. So\u2026 Jeff Farrow : That\u2019s exactly right, Ted. I think the biggest unknown that we have is what\u2019s going to happen with the potential additional variants popping up and the impact it might have to patients visiting their physicians, which is a big driver new Rxs. So \u2013 and I believe the part of your question to is what\u2019s our expectations on the 12 and above. We do anticipate that growing over time. We do expect to get back to sort of the level that we saw prior to the pandemic happening. It\u2019s going to take some time. One of the things that we\u2019ve referenced before in this past, given the fact that these patients haven\u2019t gotten in to visit their physicians previously, the first visit might be one of those health check-ins \u2013 like how are you doing? Let\u2019s talk generally what\u2019s going on? And then maybe the second visit, is where we talk about, hey, there\u2019s a couple of new medications out there for sickle cell, would you like to hear a little bit about that. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re anticipating it to be sort of a stepwise growth as opposed to a light switch in terms of growth there. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Akash Tewari with Jeffries. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is [indiscernible] for Akash. So you have indicated a call. So previously, we noticed in the consensus estimate about 280 Oxbryta sales for 20 [ph] this year. And based on our math, this revenue implied about putting 100 new prescriptions per quarter for the rest of the year. Do you think that\u2019s a reasonable goal for this year? And in addition, previously, you mentioned you have a goal to reaching $15 billion market cap by 2025. We believe that suggests around $3 billion to $4 billion product sales. What are some signals you saw major confident to reaching that target in 2025? Thank you. Ted Love : Yes, Jeff, you may want to take part of that, but I\u2019ll start off with the 2025 goal. So in building a company, you do want to set some aspirational goals for how you want to build a business. You want them to be realistic, though, as well. And one of the things that we did is that we looked at companies, which had actually moved from where we are today to a market cap of beyond $15 billion, we\u2019re in that range. And if you look at those companies, those companies tend to have multiple products either approved or looking very likely that they will be approved shortly. And we certainly think we\u2019re well positioned that with Oxbryta already approved with inclacumab in Phase 3 and with GBT601 being a program that we think we can move very aggressively with. And obviously, there\u2019s more opportunities. We do have things going on in research and we have the capacity to do deals. So, we think the 5% is achievable. We also know that companies that hit these numbers tend to have significant revenue. And obviously, we think Oxbryta has long-term potential of generating revenue. We\u2019re obviously growing our revenue quarter-over-quarter. And over the next couple of years, we think that the revenue could look like a company that has a position to be in that market cap. So there\u2019s nothing mathematical. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a program that tells you how to get to a market cap of $15 billion, but they\u2019re ingredients. And we think we\u2019ve got the fundamental ingredients to make it happen here. Jeff Farrow : In reference to the patient numbers, we\u2019re really not in a position to speak to it because it does go hand-in-hand with revenue guidance. That said, I think what we\u2019ve previously said still holds true that we expect growth in the back half of this year. A couple of things that are going to be driving that is our hope that the pandemic will subside, and we\u2019ll start seeing more in-office visits, which will drive more NRxs. And then just a reminder that we still have to go through the payer process on the pediatric side. And so we expect to have broader coverage by the middle of this year, which, of course, will help revenues in the long run as well. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you very much. Very helpful. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Yanan Zhu with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question. Yanan Zhu : Hi, thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the progress and the four to 11 age group launch. Two questions perhaps. The one on the guidance and the prescription numbers, is the \u2013 is that from this quarter\u2019s $55 million to the guidance for the next quarter at the middle point, $64 million revenue. How much of that is driven by the pediatric patients transitioning, I mean, four to 11 age group transitioning to insurance coverage and how much is that driven by increasing in demand? So that's my first question. Thanks. Ted Love : Yes, and thanks for the question. We're not really in a position I think to bifurcate those out, but I think your point is a good one. As I mentioned on the previous question that we are still seeking broad payer coverage on the pediatric side. So obviously those patients that maybe weren't covered in the first quarter, becoming covered in Q2 will help us on that aspect of it but we also do anticipate growth overall in new prescriptions, somewhat incremental growth, but we do also expect some growth on the 12 and above as well. So generally I think what DJ had said was that we expect a, somewhat of a decrease on the pediatric side, the four to 11, just given the early access that happened there. But we do anticipate growth on the 12 and above side of prescriptions. Jeff Farrow : Which we saw in this quarter as well, yes. Yanan Zhu : Right, because, Jeff, I thought I heard you say when you were making the guidance, there is a phasing in part of consideration of that kind of dynamic. Basically that says in a sec back half of the first quarter, the demand is higher. So that's my understanding? Jeff Farrow : That's correct. That is correct. Yes, particularly in the adults. Yanan Zhu : Right, right. Yes, given that there is a bolus in \u2013 when the pediatrics was approved, which is I mid-February, so it sounds like there has to be adult growth in the back half of the quarter for that \u2013 for you to consider facing in into next quarter. Jeff Farrow : Correct, yes. Yanan Zhu : Thanks for explaining that. And my next, other question is on the 150 milligram dose, so could you talk about, obviously if you have to choose a dose, this is a dose you have chosen a higher dose. What's the hemoglobin occupancy that you think you'll get based on your modeling? And is there a possibility that you will do something similar to what you did before that is having a, like a second part with even higher dose with these six patients? Thank you. Kim Smith Whitley : We anticipate with the modeling that obviously this will be adjusted because our original modeling was based on six participants. But when you look at those six participants, we should, with a 150 milligram dose get occupancies above 40%. So we are comfortable using those going into a Phase 2, but understand that we'll get much more data to support a model to find a dose out of the Phase 2 study. Jeff Farrow : And I think one of the other things that's important to point out is that we looked and showed you all a fair amount of [indiscernible] data. And we showed that many of the parameters on these patients were beginning to approach normality. We would love to have them actually arrive at mimicking the blood from a sickle trait individual rather than someone from a sickle cell patient. So that's the rationale for going higher to see if we can recapitulate, that state that looks like sickle cell trait and no longer sickle cell disease. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Yatin Suneja with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed with your question. Yatin Suneja : Hey guys, two questions. First, I just want to confirm the guidance is 63 to 65 for Q2, correct? Jeff Farrow : Correct. Yatin Suneja : Okay. So if we look at the midpoint, your guidance is actually implying about $9 million off additional growth in 2Q, which is exactly what you did in second quarter of 2021? And this is the guidance that you're providing despite having an expanded label or limited COVID headwinds, a lot more increase in NRx that you're seeing. So I'm just trying to understand why revenues are not growing at a higher rate when you have all these dynamic in your favor? And then also maybe comment that will they accelerate in Q3; just help us understand this dynamic? Jeff Farrow : Sure, Yatin. It\u2019s a great question and it is something that we wanted to make sure was understood. The biggest issue in \u2013 there's a delta between the NRx growth and the revenue guidance that we're providing. The biggest issues are really three folders. One, we still don't have broad payer coverage on the pediatric side, so while we might be shipping bottles or having requests come in, we can't recognize revenues on that. So that's going to inhibit the revenue growth. The other aspect to a less extent is our increase in gross-to-net. And then finally we have a dynamic in Q2 similar to what we had in Q1, where the quarter ends on a Thursday. And we have seen is one of our customers especially distributor tends to buy on that date, but that shipment is not received until the following quarter. So there results a fairly large purchase that does not get recognized in the second quarter. So that's part of the rationale as well for the lower on the guidance. Yatin Suneja : Got it. And then maybe just one more on the pediatric side, so of the 16,000 patients that you're targeting, can you just talk about realistically how many can be reached with Oxbryta mean, is it like 50%, 30% or higher? Just give us some number if you can in the longer term? Thank you. David Johnson : Yes, this with DJ. I don't think we've ever given a market share estimate for our sickle cell patients, including the adult patients for that matter. I think if you look at some of the analogs in the marketplace that should give you an idea of what we can likely achieve and exceed. I mean, if you look at hydroxyurea consistently is in the 30% of patients in any given year are on therapy. There's a lot of patient's cycle on and off therapy, but consistently about 30% of patients are on therapy in a given year. So that would be if you assume around 100,000 patients that's about a 30%, I guess patient share. With Oxbryta being a broad indication and now going down to four years old, it does open up the market to 100,000 sickle cell patients that are now qualified for Oxbryta. With really no restrictions to speak of in terms of hemoglobin levels or other conditions that would, it's a very broad indication. So we would expect to do at least as good as that over time, it's going to take time. We do need to fully come out of the pandemic. We talked about some of the headwinds still being patient visits to healthcare providers still lower than we needed to be, but we are expecting that to improve this year. So yes, so I think all of our pediatric patients in the four to 11 are really candidates for us, and we're going to work very hard to get them access to Oxbryta as quickly as possible. Yatin Suneja : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ben Burnett with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Carolina Ibanez : Hi, good afternoon. This is Carolina Ibanez on for Ben Burnett. Thank you for taking our question. Expanding up on a previous question what do you expect to show in terms follow-up time for the six patients that are going to be restarted in the 601 \u2013 in the higher dose 601 study, and that will be part of the data update later this year? Jeff Farrow : Yes. You're talking about the follow up patient that we're restarting on therapy from Phase 1. Carolina Ibanez : Correct. Jeff Farrow : We kind of said the toward the end of the year it's typically as where we try to present major news, depending upon when the patients we start, we would present all the data that we have. So it could be multiple months of treatment by that time. Carolina Ibanez : Okay. And a quick \u2013 and a second follow-up question for the pediatric patients do you have a sense for the adherence in this patient population? Jeff Farrow : It's little early to have any adherence data. We only have a couple of months and in some cases, some patients are still awaiting to receive their first bottles and that sort of thing. So we don't have enough data yet, although we can look at our 12 and older population and we know for example that the 12 to 18 year olds in that group are actually the highest adherence. And so we think the younger the patients, and especially when the caregivers, the parents are involved we have the potential with the four to 11 year olds to have some of the best adherence yet. So we're excited to look at that and we should be able to talk about that more later in the year. Carolina Ibanez : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Raju Prasad with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. Raju Prasad : Thanks for checking the questions. DJ, you just mentioned this kind of on the compliance rate in some of the younger patient populations. And do you guys have any data that supports kind of this from the early launch metrics that you're getting kind of repeat prescriptions from these younger patient populations. And if we're thinking about kind of pull through revenue in the next quarter, how much recurring revenue we could expect from kind of this bolus of new patients you brought in, in the first quarter? I got another one. Thanks. David Johnson : Yes, yes. I would just say that from a pediatric group in particular, we don't have enough data because they're really just getting going. So you need to look at that over time. It's really anecdotal from the clinicians that four to 11 year olds in the trials and the fully access programs, et cetera. And they would tell you that with the parents involved, the kids tend to do better on adherence. And we've seen in our own data that that the younger patients, the teenagers in our 12 and older category do in fact have better adherence than the adults. So we think everything's pointing towards better adherence. I would say that that, yes, over time what we've always said is that we want to be at least in the same category as the analogs, 50% to 70% adherence at the end of the first year therapy. We remain there right now with our therapies and we're going to watch it over time. We're putting a lot of resources towards supporting patients and we're hopeful that this year will be able to actually increase adherence in some groups over time. Raju Prasad : Great. And then can you remind me the gross-to-net that you said in your prepared remarks, and then maybe just give me directional \u2013 directionality on the gross-to-net and the pediatric cohort? Jeff Farrow : Hey Raju, it's Jeff. So we had gross-to-net this quarter was about 16.3 and we do expect that to go up incrementally quarter-over-quarter to sort of a steady state of about 25% probably by midyear. I think it's better to look at it in aggregate because that's how we think about it. Particularly since price signal is flat between the two indications, but you are right there are more patients in the four to 11 age group that are on Medicaid as opposed to potentially being dual eligible on Medicaid and Medicare. So it is slightly higher gross-to-net on those patients, but in the aggregate we do expect to get to that 25% by middle of next year. Raju Prasad : Great. And then maybe just one last one on 601, you mentioned that it was kind of inbound interest from the patients to get back on drug and to study 150. Just kind of curious to know would that, I mean, is there any thoughts about expanding the SCD cohort or have more patients or is it just bringing those six patients back in that were washed out of drug and getting them back on drug to look at occupancy before the Phase 2? And then just kind of as a Part B to that question is there a chance that you might study two dose cohorts in the Phase 2 trial after this data? Thanks. Jeff Farrow : Yes. So just to be clear, the plan was to do a proper Phase 2 study with dose ranging, and we're doing that. What happened with the six patients is that they called back and said, they'd like to go back on drug and we're opportunistic. So we thought that was fantastic news and an opportunity to oblige those patients and get more information, but that's not a subsidy for our Phase 2 study. So we're starting our Phase 2 study. That's where we're going to get the proper dose range. We're going to get more data from these six patients. But again, to be clear, it's not our Phase 2 study. Raju Prasad : Great. Thank you. And would you file amendment to increase the dose level in the Phase 2 2150 \u2013 or is that already included in the design? Ted Love : The plan is to expose these six patients starting at 150. I think Kim had that in her prepared remarks. And in the proper Phase 2 study, we'll look at a variety of branches. We obviously have shown you data on 100 milligrams. We saw that, that produced about 32% modification. We saw the [indiscernible] data look very exciting, but the patients didn't get perfectly to sickle cell disease. So obviously, we're going to go higher, and we're going to go longer and we're going to get the data and make decisions based on the data. So it's a little bit hard to tell you what the dose is going to be until we actually do the study. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joon Lee with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question. Joon Lee : Hi, thanks for taking our questions and congrats on the quarter. Just following up on the previous question. Impressive that you're able to restart the trial, the Phase I trial for 601 due to patient demand. It's also highly unusual. Was there any particular clinical benefit that they missed and complained that drove them to demand that we start? And did this require any level of dialogue with the FDA to get this restarted. Thank you. Kim Smith Whitley : We were really pleased to see that participants in the Phase 1 were interested in restarting 601. I think that what we're pleased with in the development of 601 is we have data from Oxbryta to go on. And as you know, in our HOPE trials, we had a global impression of health overall that shows that individuals felt better when they were receiving Oxbryta. So it's not inconsistent to think that individuals felt better and that was one of the reasons that they were interested in restarting. However, we did not query specifically why they were interested. But I think that just from knowing our Oxbryta experience, I would suggests that they may have felt better while on 601. Joon Lee : Did this restart required a consent from the FDA or in any way? Kim Smith Whitley : Well, I think that one of the things that is very interesting about this approach is that using intrapatient or intra participant dose escalation is kind of standard within our drug development. So I don't think that this really required an additional discussion with FDA. I think that what we did was pretty conservative. We looked at two doses, then we looked at our safety tolerability profile and analyzed the data before we offered an increase in dose for the participants restarting. Ted Love : I mean, of course, I was of course, our protocols and things are filed with the FDA. So there's nothing FDA is not aware of. And our safety data from Phase 1 has been shared widely as well. So we feel good about the profile. And I would just add, I mean while we didn't do formal testing of the patients or how they felt, my suspicion is that they came back and said they wanted to go back on drug. They must have had something desirable, but we did not formally collect anything. Joon Lee : Right. No, because when I \u2013 when we did our touches, they said that the patients just felt better \u2013 and it's just such a big descriptor. So I just want to understand what aspect of this clinical improvement they were localizing just that was a curiosity. But I mean, it's good, but... Ted Love : Yes. That \u2013 so I mean many of these patients with one, two, three gram increase in hemoglobin, they feel more like they can get their normal activities done. They \u2013 I mean, if you were anemic with a hemoglobin of, you wouldn't feel normal. And if it increased to 10%, you would definitely feel better. So I think a lot of it is that. Some patients have also complained that they have kind of daily pain that gets better when they have fewer sickle cells, presumably on treatment. But again, we didn't do anything formal. So we don't want to project it is if we get something formal. We are just being clear that the patients did come back and say, we want to go back on the therapy. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tessa Romero with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Tessa Romero : Hey guys. Thanks so much for taking my question. The first one is, can you provide a little bit more color on what you are seeing with respect to in-office healthcare professional visits with sickle cell disease patients by age group, are there any differences that are noteworthy? And then I had one follow-up on the 601. David Johnson : Yes, I'd be happy to share some of the information. We \u2013 every quarter, we take a look at the claims data for sickle cell patients, and it still is below pre-pandemic levels in terms of health care visits across the board. When you look at it for 12 and older versus 4 to 11, the 4 to 11 are actually even farther below baseline. And the reason for that is because recall that the vaccinations for the younger kids has been slower and haven't gotten to all of them yet. So parents are very cautious about getting their kids in and around the health care system and out and about when they have sickle cell disease and could potentially contract COVID. So that's why those health care visits are down. It has everything to do with COVID risk or our patients being at risk for poor outcomes if they catch it. So they're just being cautious. They're being smart and the kids are being especially, I guess, conservative. So that's still the case today. Although, as I also said in my prepared remarks, our market research suggests that physicians and patients are feeling more optimistic about getting back in person our reps are getting back in person at higher levels now. So we think this is all a good sign and a leading indicator that we're going to get there. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Choi with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Paul Choi : Hi, thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for taking our questions. My first question is commercial. And just going back perhaps to DJ's earlier comments with regard to a substantial portion of the growth coming from the pediatric population. I want to maybe just understand a little better as to why the 12 and older population growth here seems to be relatively flat. Is it just in terms of understanding slower NRx dynamics? Or is it \u2013 has it been just sort of issues with regard to adherence broadly over the population as to why this portion of the revenue mix has been relatively flat over the past few quarters? And then I had a follow-up question. Ted Love : Yes. Just to be clear, I want DJ to answer, but just to be clear, it wasn't flat. There was obviously new patients coming in the four to 11 because that was just approved, but there was growth in the 12 and older. I think I want to make sure we want to be clear about that. David Johnson : Yes, that's exactly right, Ted. We've seen growth across the board, of course, substantial growth in the four to 11 given that it's new. But we do see growth also in the adults being reinitiated now as we've gotten this approval. There's it makes a lot of sense as well. Many of the physicians that are now treating the four to 11-year olds also have patients in the 12 and older. And as they \u2013 as we got approval, in a broader set of patients and the FDA wanting it to get to lower ages. That's also a great signal to our clinicians that this drug has even more experience, has been tested and proven in the marketplace now. The real-world evidence is stronger than it's ever been. So for all these reasons, there's more confidence using Oxbryta across the board. And in fact, in the 12- to 18-year-old group, we saw some reasonable growth as well, suggesting that yet, some of those same physicians that are now using it in four to 11 are now initiating it in their \u2013 in their 12 to 18 year olds as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Harrison : Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to ask two things related to 601. So First, can you just remind us how much tox data you have and how long you can dose patients for with 601 right now, if there are any restrictions related to preclinical talks. And then second \u2013 what are the headwinds to starting the Phase 2/3 just in terms of this operational things? Or are there other things you're still considering related to dose and still doing some modeling and things like that? Thanks very much. Kim Smith Whitley : Yes. We're on target with our toxicology studies, there's no limitation for dose increasing based on that. And then the second part of your question was regarding... Matthew Harrison : So I guess I was asking more around if there's any limitation on duration of dosing related to the tox studies that you've done, I don't know if you've done all of the longer-term tox studies, and that has an implication on duration. And then second, I was just asking around the Phase 2/3 study in terms of getting that started. What are you waiting for to get that started? Thanks. Kim Smith Whitley : Yes. So there's no limitation on duration as well. And the \u2013 really the goal of the Phase 2/3 study will be, of course, with the Phase 2 to do dose finding and then to go over into a Phase 3 without having to start a new Phase 3 study. And there is really no limitation on the start of the Phase 2 other than the completion of the protocol, getting the sites on board and those study-related factors. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Li Watsek with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question. Li Watsek : Hey guys congrats and thanks for taking my questions. I guess I'm just wondering if you can comment a little more on the new prescription growth in Q1. What is sort of the relative contribution from I guess, improved cover situation versus sort of this new expansion to younger kids? And where do you see the trends go this year? And also, I guess, on the expansion into the pediatric population, can you talk about maybe the dynamics that you've seen in younger kids relative to adults? And are there any particular concerns from I guess, pediatric prescribers that you may call out and on penetration into this group. Is it mostly a function of access? Or are there any other considerations here as well. Thanks. David Johnson : Yes, I can take that one. So yes, as we said in our prepared remarks, the NRx \u2013 we're not breaking it out by age group. We're looking at overall demand. We're super excited about having over 1,200 enrollments in the quarter, the highest we've had in over well, about two years and for a quarter, and that's really driven by both groups, the four to 11-year olds as well as the 12 and older. We saw growth in both those groups. In terms of dynamics in the kids versus adults. Yes, I mean, in general, pediatricians tend to be parents to be pretty cautious about what you put in the kid. So they're going to want to see and be convinced of a lot of the data. The good news is we got this indication after being on the market for two years. We have a wealth of real-world experience, safety data and experience in the real world. So we have a new formulation, for example, that was developed specifically for the kids that can be dissolved and into a liquid and given to the kids that way. And lots of great patient education and parent and caregiver education that goes with it. So we're set there. In terms of concerns, no new concerns. I mean if you think about it mechanistically, this is the exact place we should be going. The younger the population stopping sickling and preventing polymerization early should have the best impact on preventing downstream effects of sickle cell disease. So we're super excited about that, and we think the parents are as well. And then penetration-wise, we're very excited about being indicated across the board for all sickle cell patients ages four and older now. So we should be able to, over time be able to grow into more and more patients. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Ted Love for any closing comments. Ted Love : Okay. I'd just like to end by thanking everyone for joining the call today. We hope you all stay safe and healthy. And please feel free to reach out if you have any additional questions. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chris Stevo, Senior Vice President and Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Chris Stevo : Thank you, Chelsea. Good morning. Welcome to Pfizer's second quarter earnings call. We anticipate that this call will last 90 minutes. I'm joined today by Dr. Albert Bourla, our Chairman and CEO; Dave Denton, our CFO; and Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development and Medical. Joining us for the Q&A session, we will also have Angela Hwang, Group President, Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group; Aamir Malik, our Chief Business and Innovation Officer; William Pao, our Chief Development Officer; and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel. The materials for this call and other earnings related materials are on the Investor Relations section of pfizer.com. Please see our forward-looking statements disclaimer on Slide 3 and additional information regarding these statements and our non-GAAP financial measures is available in our earnings release and in our SEC Forms 10-K and 10-Q under Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements. Forward-looking statements on the call are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, speak only as of the call's original date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of the statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Albert. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Chris. Hello, everyone. I am proud to say that Pfizer continued to deliver strong operational performance in the second quarter and has increased its full year 2022 operational financial forecasts for revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per shares, all while operating in a challenging foreign exchange environment. Compared with the second quarter of 2021, global revenues were up 53% operationally to $27.7 billion and adjusted diluted EPS increased 100% operationally to $2.04. Both results exceeded consensus analyst expectations, and the quarterly revenue figure represented the largest in Pfizer's history. Key growth drivers for the quarter included PAXLOVID, Comirnaty, Eliquis and Vyndaqel/Vyndamax globally, and our Prevnar family of products in the U.S. Year-to-date, we have reached an estimated 845 million patients around the world with our innovative medicines and vaccines, which represents a 77% increase from the prior-year period. And we did all this while also taking steps to help address broader issues impacting global health, including climate change, equitable access and the war in Ukraine. So, where do we go from here? After two-and-a-half long years, like everyone else, we would hope that this global health crisis would be over soon. But as much as hope is important, hope is not science. And science is telling us that COVID-19 likely will remain a major global healthcare concern for years to come. We believe that Pfizer is well positioned not only to maintain but to grow both our commercial and scientific leadership in the battle against COVID-19. In terms of our commercial leadership, we believe Pfizer's skills are even better suited for operating in open markets than they are for government-contracting markets and will be even more competitive when this transition happens. Recently, Angela announced a new commercial structure that prepares us to provide even better support for the ongoing Comirnaty and PAXLOVID revenue streams. In terms of our scientific leadership, we expect to further enhance our position through the continued introduction of new innovations, including preparation for new variants of concern and potentially improving the durability of protection. So far, we have been fortunate that most of the variants have led to less severe illness, but there remains the possibility that a future variant could emerge that combines Omicron's contagiousness with the original virus's severity. This is a scenario no one wants to imagine, but one for which we need to be prepared why we're doing all these investments. That\u2019s why also it is critical that Pfizer continues to invest in the research and development of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. With this context as a backdrop, let me provide an update on our current COVID-19 offerings and then continue with other products. I will start with Comirnaty. To date, we have shipped more than 3.6 billion doses of our vaccine to 180 countries and territories around the world. Comirnaty remains the most utilized COVID-19 vaccine in the markets in which we operate that report market share data. Pfizer's cumulative share of doses administered in these markets have increased from 52% in January of this year to 63% in July of this year. In developed markets, our share has increased from 59% to 68% over that same time period. Next, I would like to briefly touch on the topic of vaccine boosters for the fall. Outside the U.S., global regulators have issued guidance to advance an Omicron-adapted bivalent vaccine candidate to help address the continued evolution of the virus. As such, Pfizer and BioNTech have submitted data to the European Medicines Agency on the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity for the company\u2019s bivalent Omicron BA.1-adapted vaccine candidate. We also continue to work with health authorities around the globe on regulatory submissions. The U.S. Food & Drug Administration recently asked biopharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer, to develop a modified vaccine containing an Omicron BA.4/BA.5 component and we begin clinical trials with these vaccine candidates. Pfizer is currently proceeding with development of a COVID-19 bivalent Omicron BA.4/BA.5 booster vaccine candidate and is targeting this fall for rollout in the U.S., subject of course to regulatory authorization. Pfizer is well positioned to satisfy its current contractual obligations and potential demand within its production capacity through the end of the year. Because of our robust manufacturing capabilities, we are planning to deliver both variant vaccines in the fall, pending regulatory approvals. Turning to PAXLOVID, we continue to be very pleased with how things are progressing in the U.S. as we are seeing several initiatives supporting increased access for eligible patients. First, the number of facilities with PAXLOVID, the supply have continued to increase with more than 41,000 sites live as of July 15, an increase of more than 7,000 sites since early May. We are pleased with the FDA's July 6 revision of the Emergency Use Authorization for PAXLOVID that authorized state-licensed pharmacists to prescribe the treatment under certain conditions, thereby expanding access for patients. As you can see on this slide, we have seen a nearly five-fold increase in PAXLOVID utilization since the first quarter. We also continue to retain greater than 90% market share of oral COVID-19 treatments in the U.S. and are taking a state-by-state approach to engaging key government officials to discuss their access strategies. We are also continuing to work with states to educate consumers, healthcare providers and pharmacists about the importance of treating all appropriate high-risk patients rather than limiting treatment to the severely immunocompromised and unvaccinated. In spite of the strong growth, we have seen in PAXLOVID uptake in the U.S. due to our and the government's efforts, we estimate that a significant amount of eligible patients outside the U.S. are not yet being treated with the drug and may not know they are at high risk of progressing to severe disease. So, we believe there remains substantial opportunity to grow PAXLOVID utilization. For international developing markets, we are seeing significant increases in usage across many markets, reflecting the recent wave of BA.4/BA.5 and resulting increases in hospitalizations, ICU admissions and deaths. For example, over the month from June 24 to July 24, average daily deaths in Europe almost doubled from a low of 0.6 per 1 million people to 1.15 per 1 million; in Japan, they almost tripled from 0.12 per 1 million people to 0.34 per 1 million; and in Australia, they increased from 1.78 per 1 million people to 2.59 per 1 million. While we have less precise numbers on market shares outside the U.S., our internal estimates indicate that we saw an estimated 116% increase in usage between June 24 and July 15 across international developed markets where we have supply agreements. So, we believe there is a significant opportunity to continue the growth outside the U.S. as physicians become more knowledgeable about PAXLOVID and treat appropriate patients. While COVID-19 remains top of mind for many people, we are seeing encouraging performance with some of our other innovative products as well, and I wanted to take a moment to highlight two of them. We are very pleased with the success of our U.S. launch of Prevnar 20 for adults. Second quarter U.S. revenues for our Prevnar family of vaccines for adults were up 337% operationally, compared with the prior-year quarter to $431 million, with Prevnar 20 representing more than three quarters of the total adult revenue. The great majority of U.S. healthcare networks, IDNs and retailers, who have made formulary decisions, have chosen Prevnar 20 alone as their higher valency pneumococcal vaccine of choice to help protect adults. This has resulted in Prevnar 20 having a 97% market share. This is also the first time there has been a routine recommendation for Prevnar for people in the 19 to 64 age group with underlying medical conditions. This group has an increased risk for contracting pneumococcal pneumonia and, unfortunately, has historically been the hardest to activate. Lastly, we believe the simplicity of Prevnar 20 being the only vaccine that can help protect patients with one dose in one visit is preferable to competitors' offerings. Quarterly revenues for Ibrance grew 1% in the U.S. compared with the same quarter last year, despite a continued increase in the proportion of patients accessing Ibrance through Assistance Program. This marked the first quarterly revenue uptick in the U.S. since the fourth quarter of 2020, which is an encouraging sign. Total volume in the U.S. increased 3% compared with the year ago quarter. Before I turn it over to Mikael, I want to touch on some actions we have taken recently to further demonstrate our commitment to Environmental, Social and Governance, ESG principles. We recently announced an Accord for a Healthier World. Under this Accord, we are offering all of our patented, high-quality products that are available in the U.S. or the EU on a not-for-profit basis for 1.2 billion people living in 45 lower income countries. This includes all future Pfizer products, as well. I am thrilled to say that the first product under this Accord has arrived in Rwanda, with more on the way. Pfizer's experts also held a session for 100 Rwandan medical professionals to discuss efficacy, safety and dosing of this milestone. This is just the first step of Accord implementation, but an important one that will impact many lives. We also recently announced our commitment to achieve the Net-Zero Standard across our value chain by year 2040. This is ten years ahead of a new voluntary external standard. This includes aiming to reduce our company emissions by 95% and value chain emissions by 90% within the next roughly 18 years. In response to the war in Ukraine, we are donating the equivalent of all profits from our sales in Russia to causes that provide direct humanitarian support to the people of Ukraine. Our first down payment of $5 million is going to eight global and local NGOs to support humanitarian relief and response efforts, and we will continue to channel these profits to the Ukrainian people until peace is achieved. I am also very proud to share with you that in a recently published report from MSCI, Pfizer\u2019s annual ESG rating increased three notches compared with June 2021, going from B to A. This is just the latest external recognition we have received for our commitment to sustainable and ethical business practices. I couldn\u2019t be prouder of our colleagues' commitment to good governance practices, quality and integrity. With that, I will turn it over to Mikael to update you on our R&D efforts. After Mikael, Dave will provide financial details on the second quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2022. Mikael Dolsten : Thank you, Albert. I\u2019d like to start by highlighting two recent leadership appointments. I\u2019ve appointed Annaliesa Anderson to lead Vaccine Research & Development, succeeding Kathrin Jansen, who previously announced her retirement. With more than two decades of biopharma R&D experience, Liesa most recently served as CSO for Bacterial Research and Hospital. Over the last two years, she has led the team of infectious disease biologists that designed and delivered PAXLOVID to an emergency use authorization. Under her leadership, we also advanced several bacterial vaccine programs into clinical development and approval. I\u2019ve also named Charlotte Allerton, CSO for Anti-Infectives, a new research unit. Creating this new research unit allows us to expand our focus beyond medicines that typically are used in hospitals. Charlotte is an esteemed scientist who will broaden our anti-viral strategies with additional efforts in antibacterial and anti-fungal science and medicines. Charlotte has been our Head of Medicine Design most notably co-leading the discovery and development of PAXLOVID and will continue in that role, as well. I have had the privilege to work closely with Liesa and Charlotte for more than 10 years and have been continuously impressed by them as world class scientists in their respective fields of expertise. Both have demonstrated good product hunting skills and a sound business mindset. I\u2019m looking forward to working with them in their new roles. Let\u2019s begin with COVID-19. The pandemic continues to evolve into a disease which is causing significant disease burden, including high rates of acute disease, medical care utilization, hospitalization and deaths, during the entire year. A growing number of patients affected by acute COVID infections are developing chronic disease and suffering from long COVID symptoms affecting multiple organs such as the lungs, heart, kidney and brain and the vascular system. We have seen major waves of variants of concern emerge quickly, become dominant, then be superseded by the next variant. Omicron and its sublineages are the most antigenically distinct compared to prior variants of concern, more transmissible and show evidence of partial immune escape from existing vaccines. As the composition of SARs-CoV-2 changes, it is essential we advance new approaches to extend the level of protection that COMIRNATY originally conveyed. In a clinical trial, we evaluated the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of mono and bivalent Omicron BA.1-modified vaccines administered as a fourth dose in more than 1,900 participants over age 55. We are also evaluating different doses of mono and bivalent BA.1 in participants 18 to 55 years of age. While we saw promising responses to both mono and bivalent versions in the over 55 population, we moved forward with bivalent following guidance from regulators. The BA.1 vaccine candidate elicited a superior immune response for BA.1 compared to the current version of the vaccine. A seroresponse rate which exceeded noninferiority and neutralization activity which increased substantially. The BA.1 vaccine neutralized wild type and Delta similarly to the current version of the vaccine, suggesting the Omicron-modified version maintained responses for the ancestral strain and other variants. Based on these data and following guidance from regulators, we have completed regulatory submissions in Europe, UK and Canada for the 30-microgram bivalent vaccine in individuals 12 and older and plan submissions in other markets soon. The data also showed this vaccine candidate neutralized Omicron BA.4 and BA.5, though to a lesser extent than BA.1. This suggested a need to develop both a BA.1-modified vaccine and a BA.4/5-modified vaccine. We studied BA.4/5 monovalent and bivalent booster candidates in mice and found a substantial increase in neutralization responses to all Omicron variants of concern. Neutralizing titers against BA.4/5 increased 11-fold for the monovalent and 4.8-fold for the bivalent compared to monovalent BA.1 vaccine. These data were shared at the recent FDA advisory committee meeting as a potential surrogate to help expedite development of a BA.4/5 vaccine. We plan to submit the BA.4/5 bivalent vaccine candidate for Emergency Use Authorization in the U.S. in preparation for the fall booster campaign. To adapt more rapidly, we have agreed with FDA that this submission will be based on safety and immunogenicity data generated in adults with an Omicron-modified BA.1 vaccine and supported by BA.4/5 bivalent-specific preclinical data and BA.4/5 bivalent chemistry, manufacturing and controls data. This strategy is bolstered by previous experience showing that overall responses have been similar between human clinical and mouse data, our clinical experience with Beta and Omicron-modified vaccine candidates, and by leveraging our mRNA platform and manufacturing experience for the current vaccine. To support future potential U.S. licensure and global registrations, we plan to initiate a clinical study to evaluate the BA.4/5 bivalent vaccine. The clinical study design is under discussion with the FDA. We aspire to continue leading with science and working to identify vaccines that will help provide strong and durable protection as new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge. We aim to deliver a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine that can provide durable antibody and T cell immune protection against severe disease and hospitalization for at least one year. We plan to take a stepwise approach by designing and testing different candidates that engage multiple arms of the immune system including antibodies and T cells. First, yesterday we announced the start of a Phase 2 study evaluating a bivalent modRNA vaccine candidate which consists of RNAs encoding novel enhanced prefusion spike proteins for the SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain and an Omicron variant. The enhanced spike protein encoded from the mRNAs has been modified with the aim of increasing the magnitude and breadth of antibody neutralization response that could better protect against COVID-19. We project delivering key clinical data this fall. Second, we plan to initiate a proof-of-concept study with a potential pan-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate by the end of the year. This combines the super-stabilized spike sequences with a T-cell enhancing construct, aiming to extend durability of protection against severe disease and new emerging SARs-CoV-2 viral variants. Now turning to PAXLOVID, last month, we submitted a new drug application to the U.S. FDA, seeking approval for the treatment of COVID-19 in both vaccinated and unvaccinated adults and pediatric patients 12 years and over weighing at least 40 kilograms at high risk for progression to severe illness. We anticipate a PDUFA date in the first quarter of 2023. We plan to generate further data in those who are immunocompromised, hospitalized with severe COVID-19 and at increased risk for poor outcomes due to the disease or who are pregnant. We also are considering multiple collaborative studies to evaluate potential treatment for long COVID. Finally, we are working with the FDA to finalize a protocol to study patients who may be in need of retreatment. According to CDC, a brief return of symptoms may be part of the natural history of SARSCoV-2 infection in some people. We believe the occurrence of COVID-19 rebound is uncommon and not uniquely associated with any specific treatment. At this time, cases are being reported at a rate consistent with the EPIC-HR trial. Turning now to flu, we know that currently available vaccines are not optimal in addressing the unmet need as each year many people are infected, hospitalized and die, resulting in tremendous public health and economic impact. In part, this is because the flu vaccine development cycle is inefficient and even when current seasonal vaccine strains match circulating strains well, they typically confer only 40% to 60% protection. Potential advantages of the mRNA platform include shortened timelines to enable a quicker response each season, improved strain matching, faster and more reliable manufacturing and broader immune responses from both antibodies and T cells, the latter needed particularly in older adults. Based on our experience with COVID-19, T cell responses appear to be critical for protection against severe disease and hospitalization in infectious viral disease. Here we show Phase 2 T cell data for our quadrivalent mod-mRNA flu vaccine candidate in subjects 65 and older. We believe this is the first evidence of a flu vaccine candidate inducing substantial responses for both CD4 and CD8 T cells. On the left, at day seven the CD4 T cell response was more than two-fold for all four flu strains for our vaccine compared to a current high dose vaccine now recommended in the U.S. for adults 65 and older. Over half of the cohort receiving our vaccine candidate had a more than two-fold response. On the right, at day seven the CD8 T cell response and responder rates were greater for all four strains for our vaccine candidate versus the comparator. Our belief is that these encouraging T cell responses, combined with higher seroconversion rates through A strains which are the most predominant circulating strains and have pandemic potential may translate into improved efficacy over current seasonal flu vaccines, particularly in those 65 and older. Based on these data, we plan to initiate a Phase 3 efficacy study this year. We\u2019re excited to share that new data on our oral GLP-1 receptor agonists, two abstracts on twice-daily danuglipron and one on our once-daily candidate known as 1532 have been accepted for the European Association for the Study of Diabetes conference in September. These investigational medicines were designed in-house by Pfizer\u2019s innovative chemistry and discovery teams. In a Phase 1 study in adults with Type 2 diabetes, after only six weeks of treatment, 1532 robustly reduced mean daily glucose to almost near-normal levels. Participants also experienced weight loss of up to 5 kilograms, compared with 2 kilograms for placebo. We believe this to be a potentially best-in-class profile across both injectables and orals. Similar changes in body weight were observed in participants with non-diabetic obesity, 1532 is characterized by favorable once-daily pharmacokinetics, a low risk for drug-drug interactions, robust efficacy across multiple metabolic endpoints and GLP-1 receptor agonist class-like tolerability which overall encouraged us to plan for a Phase 2 study to pick the winning candidate prior to a potential Phase 3 study start. These development programs may lead to potential indications in Type 2 diabetes, obesity, NASH and cardiovascular risk reduction in Type 2 diabetes and obesity patients. Over the 12 past months, we have built a strong inflammation and immunology portfolio with diverse products to help address multiple drivers of disease and unmet need. CIBINQO was approved for atopic dermatitis in adults and last week received priority review designation in the U.S. for adolescents 12 to 18 years. We are nearing a regulatory submission for etrasimod in ulcerative colitis. We have submitted regulatory applications in the U.S., Europe and UK for ritlecitinib for alopecia areata and are awaiting acceptances. We also plan to start a Phase 3 study of ritlecitinib in vitiligo this year. We are pleased to now share promising new updated data from our anti-Interferon beta monoclonal antibody in specialized rheumatology. Patients with dermatomyositis show elevated Type I Interferon gene signature in blood, skin and muscle, correlating with disease activity in skin. As we continue our development of this candidate, a potential breakthrough therapy for hard-to-treat dermatomyositis which attacks the skin and muscles, we believe it may have the ability to address a broader set of inflammatory autoimmune diseases, possibly including polymyositis and lupus. On our third quarter 2021 call, I shared data from our ongoing Phase 2 dermatomyositis study, focused on skin inflammation and showing significant reduction in disease activity when compared with placebo in just three months of treatment. Now both doses met the primary efficacy endpoint in skin predominant disease. The disease also manifests with progressively debilitating muscle weakness and fatigue. Early data suggest that in a small cohort of patients with muscle predominant disease, our candidate resulted in numerically better efficacy scores across all key muscle endpoints including patient-reported outcomes after three weeks. We plan to submit the data for presentation once the study completes. Now, a promising update on elranatamab, our investigational B-cell maturation antigen CD3-targeted bispecific antibody. At ASCO, we presented data from a Phase 1 trial in people with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma whose disease is refractory to at least one agent in each of three major classes of medications approved for the disease. We saw a confirmed overall response rate of 64% and 35% of patients achieved stringent complete response or complete response. More than half who received prior BCMA-directed therapy, such as an antibody-drug conjugate or chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, achieved a response. Responders\u2019 probability of being event free at nine months was 77%. Elranatamab elicited durable Minimal Residual Disease or MRD negativity meaning no disease was detected after treatment in all evaluable patients who experienced a complete response or stringent complete response. Molecular responses were durable as well with 60% \u2013 62% of those complete responders documented to have MRD negativity at more than six months, including two patients who were MRD negative beyond 18 months. MagnetisMM-1 results, and emerging data from MagnetisMM-3 which is studying triple-class refractory multiple myeloma support further development across a broader program with potential registration enabling studies MagnetisMM-5 in patients with double-class exposed multiple myeloma and MagnetisMM7 in newly diagnosed post-transplant patients with multiple myeloma. There is potential for deep and durable results that can be broadly accessible to patients due to off-the-shelf, subcutaneous, and convenient dosing. The efficacy and safety profile we have seen to date in a challenging patient population supports advancement into earlier lines of treatment. Finally, here is a snapshot of select milestones for this year, showing healthy progress in the pipeline. It was an important quarter for COVID execution, and we look forward to sharing complete readouts from anti-Interferon Beta and the modFlu candidate before the end of the year. Thank you for your attention. Let me turn it over to Dave. Dave Denton : Thank you, Mikael and good morning, everyone. As this is my first call as CFO, I thought I would set the stage for the next chapter of Pfizer, and our relentless focus on creating long-term shareholder value. Over the past few years, Pfizer\u2019s cash generation capabilities have expanded significantly, and the efficient deployment of this capital is more critical than ever. It\u2019s clear to me the company is uniquely positioned for growth, and at the same time, enhancing financial returns. And as we look to the future of the company, we are focused on three primary areas to drive significant shareholder value. First and foremost is our continued emphasis and investment in science and innovation. We are investing internally and externally to create breakthrough medicines, deploying more than $50 billion in this area in the past three years alone. Our second priority is maintaining and growing Pfizer\u2019s dividend, paying out more than $25 billion to shareholders over this period. We recognize that our dividend represents an important component of returns for our investors. And finally, from time to time, we will return capital to shareholders through value-enhancing share repurchases. Over the past three years, the company has allocated nearly $9 billion in this area. Clearly, maximizing shareholder value will be a major focus and I believe all three areas will contribute to our success. More recently, in year to date, we deployed more than $12 billion into innovation, paid dividends of $4.5 billion, and repurchased $2 billion of our shares. This demonstrates an on-going commitment to our robust capital deployment framework. With that now let me briefly review our financial results for the quarter. I will confine my remarks largely to adjusted and operational growth figures. Turning to the income statement. Revenues increased 53% operationally in the second quarter of 2022. These results were driven by momentum in PAXLOVID sales and strong sales of the COVID-19 vaccine; and underlying strength from a number of our key products. Excluding PAXLOVID and Comirnaty, Biopharma product revenues grew operationally by 2% compared to the prior year. In-line products, Xeljanz and Chantix, were impacted by labelling changes and a global pause in shipments, respectively. While Ibrance continued to transition into a new COVID normal market environment. PC1, our contract manufacturing business, grew 89% operationally in the second quarter 2021, and therefore faced a tough comparison versus last year, with PC1 declining by 25% operationally. And now bringing that together, Pfizer\u2019s non-COVID-related revenues grew by 1% operationally in the second quarter. Adjusted cost of sales dollars grew more slowly than revenues, resulting in gross margin rate expansion of 570 basis points versus the second quarter of LY. This improvement in gross margin is largely attributable to the impact of higher-margin PAXLOVID sales; partially offset by higher COVID-19 vaccine sales; and the impact of a $450 million write-off of COVID-related inventory that had expired or are expected to expire. Given the unpredictable nature of the virus, we chose to manufacture and hold excess stock to ensure we could meet global health demand for products if an extreme need were to arise. Adjusted SI&A expenses in the second quarter grew by 7% operationally. The increase was primarily driven by spending for PAXLOVID and Comirnaty, and higher healthcare reform fees. The 27% operational increase in adjusted R&D expense in Q2 was primarily driven by investments in multiple late-stage clinical programs, including programs to prevent and treat COVID-19, and costs to develop recently-acquired programs. The effective tax rate on adjusted income in the quarter of 15.4% declined by 170 basis points versus last year driven by a favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings. And as a result, reported diluted earnings per share of $1.73 grew by 77%, while adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.04 grew 92%; on operational basis adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 100% in the quarter. Foreign exchange movements continue to dampen our results; negatively impacting revenues and adjusted earnings per share by 7% or $0.08 per share. So with that, let\u2019s move to our 2022 guidance. Given our strong second quarter performance and our improving outlook for the year, we are increasing our operational expectations for both revenues and adjusted earnings per share. For the full year, we are increasing our operational revenue expectations by $2 billion, and operational adjusted diluted earnings per share expectations by $0.24. Unfortunately, given additional U.S. dollar strengthening since we last updated guidance in early May, foreign exchange negatively impacts revenues by $2 billion, leaving our reported revenue guidance range unchanged at $98 to $102 billion. This represents an operational growth rate of 29% at the midpoint compared to 2021, a 200 basis point improvement over prior expectations. The improvement in our operational adjusted diluted earnings per share outlook of $0.24 is also negatively impacted by foreign exchange movements, compressing EPS by $0.19. The net impact of these cross currents allows the company to raise the low-end of its adjusted earnings per share outlook by $0.05 to $6.30 to $6.45 a share. This represents 65% operational growth at the midpoint compared to 2021. Regarding our COVID-19-related revenues, we continue to expect the vaccine revenue for the year to be approximately $32 billion, unchanged compared to our prior guidance provided on May 3, despite the impact of approximately $1 billion of incremental negative foreign exchange. For PAXLOVID, we expect sales of approximately $22 billion, keeping the guidance unchanged, despite an incremental $300 million headwind due to FX. Our non-COVID-related revenues are absorbing approximately $700 million of impact from negative foreign exchange. Given the seasonality that we expect, I would also like to give you some color on the expected cadence of these COVID-related revenues across the second half. Based on current guidance for Comirnaty, we expect approximately 25% of second half sales in Q3 and 75% of sales in Q4, driven by expected deliveries of Omicron-adapted vaccines in Q4, again subject to regulatory approval. Conversely for PAXLOVID, we expect approximately 60% of sales in Q3 and 40% in Q4.  So, with that, let me give you some detail on changes in our cost and expense guidance. We are decreasing our expected adjusted SI&A spend by $300 million across the range to $12.2 to $13.2 billion. Additionally, we are also increasing our guidance for adjusted R&D expense by $500 million at the low-end only, with the new range of $11.5 billion to $12 billion, reflecting incremental investments in multiple programs, including mRNA vaccine programs outside of COVID-19 and other programs. We are also slightly reducing our expected effective tax rate on adjusted income by 50 basis points to approximately 15.5%. 2022 guidance once again assumes no incremental share repurchases, beyond the $2 billion of share repurchases we completed in March 2022. So in closing, it\u2019s an exciting time in the history of Pfizer. We believe that our strong financial performance in the quarter and our improving operational outlook for the year sets the stage for long-term shareholder value creation. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to start the Q&A session. Chris Stevo : Thanks, Dave. At this time let\u2019s start the Q&A session. Please limit yourself to one question per caller. And if you have additional questions we ask you to please get back in the queue and we\u2019ll address as many questions as we have time to do so. And if you have any remaining questions afterwards, the R&D team will be available to answer those questions for you as well. Chelsea, if you could queue up the callers, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question come from the line of Carter Gould from Barclays. Carter Gould : Great. Good morning. I appreciate all the disclosures there at the end. But I wanted to follow up on the Comirnaty guide again. Obviously, you had some incremental contracts that got signed since the last time you gave guidance. You highlighted sort of the FX headwind. So I guess trying to tease out exactly kind of \u2013 explicitly kind of what you\u2019re assuming around potentially, I guess, EU doses getting pushed into 2023 and just some additional color there, if you can please. Thank you. Dave Denton : This is Dave. Carter, this is Dave. Thank you for the question. Let me walk you the guidance for this year from a vaccine perspective. As you well know, we had a guidance of $32 billion to begin with as we entered \u2013 come out of Q1. There\u2019s really three moving parts as I think about our guidance for the year : one is we do have an incremental contract from the USG for 105 million doses this year, which is an uptick to that guidance; Secondly, we\u2019re experiencing headwinds from an FX perspective to the tune of $1 billion since Q1, but for the year, really $2 billion in that product alone; and then third, as I just articulated, the cadence of deliveries in the back half is really skewed to Q4. And with that, some ex-U.S. deliveries could move from November into December of the calendar year. And if that were to occur, given our one month lag from a reporting perspective that would fall \u2013 those revenues would fall into Q1 of 2023. I do not know whether that\u2019s going to happen, but I\u2019m planning that it might happen. So therefore, I\u2019m probably being conservative in my approach, in my outlook to the revenue guide for that specific medicine. Chris Stevo : Okay, let\u2019s go to the next question. Operator : Your next questions come from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Truist Securities. Robyn Karnauskas : Thanks for taking my question and all the color on the call today. I guess mine is on PAXLOVID. And maybe you could talk a little bit about I know there, while you said there\u2019s low rate in line with clinical trials for rebounding, maybe that\u2019s under reported and you outlined your plan for new trials. What are you doing to potentially decrease that potential for rebounding in the new studies? Are you extending and doubling the dose? And maybe some trends a couple, give us more color on some trends that you\u2019re seeing on PAXLOVID. I know you mentioned globally. We\u2019re hearing in some states it\u2019s more limited versus others. Maybe just give us more color there on trends you\u2019re seeing on access? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Sure. William why don\u2019t you speak a little bit about the program, what we haven\u2019t rebounding? And then Angela, you speak a little bit about the trend of the revenues in the uptake. William Pao : Sure. Thanks, Albert, and thanks for the question. So as we reported earlier in the EPIC-HR study, we did see a single agent percent of potential rebound. But we also saw it in the placebo arm with a very similar rate. Since then we have seen other studies coming out including from the Mayo Clinic, Case Western, and Kaiser Permanente and others showing data that\u2019s very consistent with ours in terms of single-digit percent of rebound. And it\u2019s also been seen not only with placebo, but also with competitor antivirals. And internally, we also have data from real-world data, as well as additional pharmacovigilance data showing again that it\u2019s a very similar low percentage rate of recurrence. That said, though we are working with the FDA to finalize plans for a trial in which we would treat such patients and we\u2019re still deciding on the final outline of that. And in addition as Mikael outlined, we\u2019ll be looking at other cohorts of patients, for example, immunocompromised patients who have a large unmet medical need. And in that setting, we will be looking at, for example, five days, 10 days and 15 days of dosing to determine the optimum dose regimen for those patients. Albert Bourla : Thank you, William. And I need to say that we are very serious about PAXLOVID and we are looking very diligently. All the anecdotal reports that are coming, but all the data, I repeat all the data, our internal data, but we are detecting rebounds by proactively checking viral loads or the external data that have been reported through pharmacovigilance to us, or through studies that have been performed by third parties, very reputable third parties like Kaiser Permanente and or Mayo Clinic. They are consistent that this is low single-digit, actually less than 1% in the external studies. And it was as repeated around 2% in the methodology we used in ours and very consistent with the numbers of the placebo. So although we try to see if there is a need to do something about it, seriously, we can\u2019t find any data set other than anecdotal reports. Also, I want to emphasize that even the anecdotal reports, they are all indicating that it is a mild. So we don\u2019t have any rebound that it is more serious, right? And clearly, we haven\u2019t identified any single case that we have resistance to the PAXLOVID. So we are looking into it. And William said that we are going to run also some studies we\u2019re discussing our protocols with FDA to see if treatment of those cases could help. But so far our conclusion, although we are looking a lot, it is very small percentage similar to COVID placebo or COVID other antivirals, and with very mild symptoms. Angela, what about the trends internationally and in the U.S., if you want. Angela Hwang : So globally, I think that we\u2019re doing really well and we\u2019re making excellent progress. We have made and manufactured 30 million doses, and we delivered 23.5 million of those doses. So I think that the contracting is going well. The demand and expectations for the need for PAXLOVID is definitely up there. But maybe let me use some U.S. examples where things are - where we have a little bit more data and where things I think are going particularly well. The U.S. actually contracted a 10.8 million doses with us so far and 7.4 million doses of all of those have already been allocated to all the states. So I think that gives you a sense of how much demand is coming in from all of the states, and then every single week, our utilization of PAXLOVID has also increased. In fact, most recently we hit an all-time high of 389,000 doses or doses of PAXLOVID that were used in just in one week. So that gives you a sense of sort of the increase and the momentum. What\u2019s really driving this is, obviously, the education and the familiarity and the experience now of physicians, as well as patients. But also the excellent work that is being done at the federal, as well as the state level \u2013 at the state level in terms of education and utilization. And I want to call out in particular, the test-to-treat program that I think has been particularly effective and very positive. To date, more than 41,000 pharmacies are now test-to-treat centers. And that means that that just gives access to a tremendous amount of the population to be able to access PAXLOVID. And also recently pharmacists are now able to prescribe PAXLOVID within certain limitations. And over and above whatever states and the federal government are doing Pfizer is also aggressively and assertively supporting education. So actually, we have leveraged the entire Pfizer field force to provide education, we\u2019re running webinars. And to date, we\u2019ve reached over 300,000 healthcare professionals, as well as 80,000 pharmacists just to give you a sense of the extent and the breadth of reach that we have accomplished. And all of that and also complemented by public service announcements about driving awareness of the treatment, but also the individual risk that each patient could carry and making them aware that they could be a potential candidates for PAXLOVID. So I think with all of these efforts that have gone on and that we\u2019re continuing, we feel really good about the momentum of PAXLOVID, the utilization of PAXLOVID, and the benefit that PAXLOVID can bring, particularly in a time when there\u2019s surges going on around the entire world. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Chris Stevo : Thank you, Robyn. Next question, please Chelsea? Operator : Your next questions come from the line of Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Terence Flynn : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I had a two part one on your mRNA seasonal flu vaccine program. I was just wondering if you had any HAI titer data that you can share from the trial. We saw the CD \u2013 the T-cell data, but again, wondering if there\u2019s any titer data you can share? And then anything on the safety tolerability there, is it fair to assume that the profile is similar to Comirnaty or are there any particular differences you\u2019d like to call out? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much Terence. Mikael, why don\u2019t you take this question? Mikael Dolsten : Yes. We will share details in upcoming conference, but I can just give a little bit more color. As you know, the highest medical burden and hospitalization of cures in the 65 plus were the A strains are the most dominant. We had very strong titers against the A strains and exceeding what you would see with the current recommended vaccines. So we are very bullish about our ability with mRNA to induce both strong antibody response and CD4 and CD8 T cells, which are not in used by current standard of care. And this is the reason why we are sharing today that we are announcing to Phase 3 study. Chris Stevo : Thank you, Terence. Next question, please. Mikael Dolsten : Tolerability, sorry. Tolerability of this 30 microgram, sorry, Terence. I didn\u2019t note that first. Tolerability is of course supported by our billion of doses of the platform in COVID. And on top of that in older adults, the 30 microgram have a very good acceptance, the main patient group. And I believe it\u2019s going to be excellent and very similar to other available flu vaccines. Albert Bourla : And also Mikael, you spoke about A, you didn\u2019t speak about the B strains in the immunogenicity as they were similar to the current high dose of quadrivalent. [Ph] Mikael Dolsten : Yes. I didn\u2019t mention the B strains. We noted in general, lower response to B strains with both standard of care. And we edged on the lower side with our vaccine. That\u2019s why I was so encouraged to see the unique T cell response against the B cell strain and the total of that data make us encouraged that we will have a strong product for both A and B. Albert Bourla : And then they think how confident we feel it is that although the regulatory pathway, it is just demonstrate non-inferiority in immunogenicity, we are going for an efficacy trial. So the trial that is we announced yesterday is going to measure real efficacy in flu, which we believe that we expect of course science is unpredictable, but we expect to win with flying colors. Let\u2019s go to the next one. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Umer Raffat : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question and a clarification. The questions on PAXLOVID. I know the test-to-treat program from the Biden administration is going to bake driver volumes. And my question is how would the demand dynamics change when we transition to a commercial purchasing model? And let\u2019s say the test-to-treat is still in place, would that \u2013 would there be any change or not? And my clarification is Mikael, I think some comments you might have made at a recent non transcripted meeting on the TL1A program, and whether there\u2019s been a signal consistent across the Phase 2a and Phase 2b, could you please clarify that? Thank you very much. And I\u2019m referring to the interim analysis that happened recently. Albert Bourla : Yes. Angela, what do you think if we go to open commercial market? Do you think that we will be better or worse off for PAXLOVID? Angela Hwang : Yes. So I think that there are elements that we will be able to implement in the commercial market that currently that we don\u2019t. So for sure, you\u2019ve just heard me share comments about the efforts that we\u2019ve put into PAXLOVID already here in the U.S. and ex-U.S., right? The execution and the support of education support of our entire field forces, support of retail, support of patients through education again, and PSAs. Now, all that will continue, but I think what happens in a full commercial launch is that you will have multiple distributors and multiple points of distribution throughout the entire country. You will have stocking by every pharmacist, pharmacy, and pharmacist and various points of use. And so I think that in a commercial setting actually, you\u2019ll be able to reach a much broader set of channels that we currently even do today. So I think that\u2019s one difference. I think, the second difference is that what you can do from a commercial perspective will also look different. Remember today we\u2019re under an EUA and while we can do a lot of education, key things like sampling cannot be done in an EUA. So that\u2019s going to be an example of another difference that will happen post EUA. And then I think finally even if you think about consumer education, today we\u2019ve really limited ourselves to unbranded and sort of disease awareness education, but again in a commercial setting, you could support through branded education and talk a lot more about the product. And so all of these are things that actually Pfizer does and the commercial organization of Pfizer does really well. This is our sweet spot. So I think that we look forward to building on top of what the government has been doing, which has been really excellent and building on top of that to do more and to support greater initiatives across the country. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Angela. Well said. What about TL1A Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : Briefly, this is our internally discovered antibody against TL1A, a member of the TNF superfamily that is associated with inflammatory diseases. Yes, we had consistent, robust efficacy for all come you see patients and very strong efficacy consistent across the trial for a prospectively defined precision biomarker. Tolerability was very good. Now this is induction data, and later this year, we will have maintenance data and as we get those data set, we will decide about next step. Umer Raffat : Thank you very much. Albert Bourla : Let\u2019s go to the next call. Operator : Your next question come from the line of Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Mohit Bansal : Great. Thank you for taking my question and congrats on the early oral GLP-1 data, especially for once daily. My question is how much incremental data we are going to see in September from the one you presented today and also how soon can you move this agent into bigger trials? And how do you see the biggest differentiation versus the oral semaglutide at this point? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Mikael, maybe also could take that question. Mikael Dolsten : Yes. We are very excited about this new data set [indiscernible] that you will see at EASD Meeting in Stockholm in September, there will be additional data. And I think you will find HbA1c very encouraging, although this was a short study. I think, compared to oral semaglutide, the differentiation is substantial. This is a true small molecule that can be given. So once a day, it\u2019s completely independent on fasting or meal concordance. And I think you will be able to reach higher effects on both glucose as well as on weight reduction. As I reported now, we were almost at 100 mg/dL reduction over four to six week and five kilogram. And we haven\u2019t yet optimized the titration to even higher doses. So we are very encouraged of what we see we going to share with regulators soon, our next trial set and move swiftly to allow us to pick the winner and the regimen for a potential Phase 3 study to come after the Phase 2b. Mohit Bansal : Thank you, Mikael. Albert Bourla : And also to add that this is for us clearly high priority project. We have a designation within the company what we call the Lightspeed project, project of significant value to patients and as a result also significant economic value where we give this designation and we move them with a speed of light and we overinvest to make sure that we derisk and we move fast. And I review personally on a biweekly \u2013 on the bimonthly basis, the progress of this program. So that is going to be one of them. Thank you very much. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question is come from the line of Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Evan Seigerman : Hello, thank you so much for taking my question and congrats on the progress. I would love for your perspective on the provision for Medicare to negotiate directly with manufacturers a part of the now coined Inflation Reduction Act that we have press reports \u2013 reporting deal between Manchin and Schumer. And what kind of \u2013 what's the potential long-term impact on your R&D and innovation? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you. I'm disappointed with what I'm reading in the newspapers. Of course, we can't know exactly what will happen because we have seen that this situation is very volatile, but everything that they are reporting they are going to implement a pride setting in reality it is not a price negotiation because they're forcing their will by implementing a 95% tax, according to previous guidance that will cause the industry significant. We estimate that 270 billion over 10 years. There is a positive provision there, but they're reducing the out of pocket cost for the patients. That's a significant one, but it's too little and too late. They could do way more because that will cost them 10% of the 270 billions, but they're going to collect. They are basically not doing that to alienate patient's costs because they could give all the money and then made significant, significant difference with the patient. They're just giving a part of that and they won't even to start it for understood well from year 2025. So although that out of pocket is a very positive provision, but the rest one is a provision that I think will force the industry to reduce R&D if it goes the way that they are suggesting. So other than that, I don't have anything to add. We will wait to see how the \u2013 what exactly in reality that means and we'll go from there. And also I want to say it is very disappointing that they're choosing to single out one industry everything in this bill, from what I understand [indiscernible] is affecting everyone, but then there are specific measures to affect only the pharma industry, particularly when we are out of the pandemic or this industry has proven the value that brings to public health and to the global economy. We would be in a very different point in this global economy if we didn't have the investments and the thriving life sciences sector. And they are choosing to single out this industry I think is wrong and I hope that the reason will prevail when this discussions goes to Congress. Let's move to the next question please. Operator : Your next questions come from the line of Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald. Louise Chen : Hi, thanks for taking my question here. Just curious if some of the setbacks that we've seen in the CD47 space changed your view on the market opportunity for your Trillium asset. Thank you. Albert Bourla : Yes. Why don't we go to William? William Pao : Yes, sure. So thanks for the question, Louise. So we saw the news the other day. Internally, we remain confident in our program with Trillium and we proceed with the programs that we are planning and we'll let the data speak for itself when they come out. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of David Risinger with SVB Securities. David Risinger : Yes, thanks very much and congratulations on the performance. I wanted to ask a little bit about VYNDAQEL and VYNDAMAX. The performance was below our and consensus expectations. If you could speak to that and also talk about the sequential prospects going forward i.e., has the product peaked out in the U.S. and how should we think about future prospects relative to the sales that you booked? Thank you very much. Albert Bourla : Thank you, David. Angela, what do you think? Angela Hwang : Well, we continue to be really pleased with how VYNDAQEL is doing. If you look at just from a diagnosis perspective, quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year, we continue to do a really great job of effectively finding and identifying who that ATTR-CM patients are diagnosing them and then bringing them on to therapies. So in this quarter we have reached an all time high over 40% diagnosis rate. And I think that this is well beyond what we thought we would be able to do in the timeframe that we have had. So we continue to believe in the growth that this product has. The real world data that has been generated now and the overall survival benefits are really compelling. And the fact that we are the only product being able to demonstrate these benefits, I think speaks well to how we'll continue to be able to build in this market despite competition that will arise. I think what you're referring to in terms of the impact and the expectations really is a one-time effect in and it was in Japan. And this was a very specific price decrease that was planned and driven by regulation. When VYNDAQEL was launched in Japan, again based on pricing regulation in the country, that was specific to the country, it was much higher price than any other country we had. And so by regulation, again, it's the 75% price decrease that we're seeing is a function of that. But the underlying growth of VYNDAQEL in Japan is really strong. We had just in the first half of 2022, 69% volume growth. We had 32% year-over-year of new patient starts. So, hopefully, this gives you a sense that the net revenue impacts you see are, in fact, not a reflection of the demand and the true underlying demand, whether it's in the U.S. or ex-U.S. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Thank you, Angela. Thank you, David. Let's go to the next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Tim Anderson : Well, thank you. A question on your RSV vaccine. There doesn't seem to be anything, but a brief mention of the program in the press release or the slides, and really nothing in prepared remarks that we have Phase 3 data results coming out very soon, I'm wondering why. But really my main question is why you recently changed the primary endpoint in the Phase 3 trial, including downsizing of the trial. And that comes on top of the delay in readout as announced earlier this year. And if I can slip one in on your quadrivalent mRNA flu, when would we likely see results from your Phase 3 that you're starting up? Albert Bourla : Thank you. Mikael, both questions goes to you. I think the first question thing was for RSV, right? Yes. Mikael Dolsten : Yes. We have made a great progress in the RSV adult file. As you know, we ran it through two different seasons in the northern and southern hemisphere to make sure we had good patient experience and cases. Things are looking good for a readout that would come soon. I remain very positive about RSV adult based on our Phase 2 challenge data that was stellar and the role this particular entity and that we're targeting play unless we are the only one that are targeting the two forms of this perfusion. You also asked about modRNA flu. Yes, as Albert mentioned, we are going big here with an efficacy study. We are enquired about the data we're seeing. We think it's a unique dataset. And we plan to soon embark on our Phase 3 after proper dialogue with regulators. Of course, this is an event trial, but if the season is robust, which you can never know, we would expect the Phase 3 to readout next year. Albert Bourla : Exactly. And also, I'm sorry if we gave the impression that RSV is not important to us. It's extremely important. There is no better good news. This is why we didn't mention it much, but still remains the very good news. But the previous studies were extremely strong and that the current studies are progressing very well. So we have very high confidence, absent a surprise, but we will launch next year, very robust product, both in adults and in maternal \u2013 the maternal whereas both studies are progressing very well. Thank you very much. Let's go to the next question. Operator : Your next question is come from the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Geoff Meacham : Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just had a couple on PAXLOVID real quick. Can you give us an update on the number of countries you're in contract discussions with I'm just thinking relative to the start of the year? And then related what's been the biggest contributor of supply expansion in 2Q? And when do you think you guys will be fully, fully normalized? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Let's go to Angela for the number of countries and where we are with that. Angela Hwang : Yes. So we are in contract with a significant number of countries at this point, maybe I can talk about it from a dose perspective. So more than 35 million treatment courses have already been contracted with a number of countries and this is what we publicly disclosed. There are additional doses that I can't talk about because either the country didn't want us to disclose them publicly or we're in the middle of negotiations with them. So I think to answer your question since we last left off, we have made progress with our contracting. I think what's \u2013 maybe what's more important to clarify is just that the approach that countries are taking to contract with us is just really different to where we were in Comirnaty. In Comirnaty, they were interested in securing large amounts of doses upfront, but that's in fact not the case here in PAXLOVID. And the reason being that number one, they're being prudent with how they are ordering. And they're able to do that because they know that we have the manufacturing capacity and that we can pivot as we need. They will \u2013 the countries are also trying to manage inventory and not to have too much aged product lying around. And so I think that this is what's driving the more smaller more frequent contracting rather than big, big contracts that like you saw in Comirnaty. The other thing I will also say is, and the reason why I'm talking in doses rather than specific countries is because we're also working with supranational organizations, who are acting on behalf of multiple countries. So think Global Fund, think UNICEF, these are \u2013 in addition to the bilaterals there are also important organizations who are helping us to supply and bring doses into the countries. So I think all in all great progress, and I think you should expect to see that this is one of these things will \u2013 that will just keep inching away because of how countries want to manage the inventory and the supply. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Angela. And also to \u2013 because you had also question on supplier above, we have done tremendous, tremendous progress on that field. Actually, we have been able to reduce dramatically the lead time, so how much time it's needed for manufacturing and to have improved dramatically our yields. So supply is not an issue, actually removed almost everything in-house now in terms of API and finished product. Thank you very much. Next, go to the next question. Operator : Your next questions come from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks so much for the questions, just one follow up on the PAXLOVID comments. As we move, I guess, from some of these large government orders that was out of the U.S., et cetera earlier this year to maybe these more kind of on-demand smaller contracts. How do we think about what the impact that has on pricings? I think that you were giving some volume based discounts before. And just help us, I guess, as we think about kind of 2023 and beyond what pricing does for that business. And then kind of the bigger question I had was just on Ibrance dynamics. I think you mentioned in the prepared marks, you're seeing signs of a recovery for your business there. I am just interested in how you're kind of seeing the balance of just overall market dynamics relative the competitive landscape with obviously competitors with an adjuvant indication? Thank you. Albert Bourla : So thank you very much. Chris, we do not provide, let's say, forward-looking projections on pricing and particularly every time I speak about pricing is becoming big news. So I want to make sure that we respect that. I know what you are asking and I can give a very high level answer. Clearly, we are providing special pricing when we are contracting very, very big quantities with governments. That's also the incentive for the government to buy big quantities because the price is really, really very attractive. If we move to normal market, the prices would reflect both in vaccines and in antivirals, the prices of similar value, similar technology products that they are out there. Clearly, also when you move to private to commercial markets, the complexities are getting way, way higher. We will need to go to single doses in the vaccines, so manufacturing complexities are very higher. We need to have distribution to small distribution centers, including physician offices. So all of that creates a very big complexity, but also could be taken into consideration as we price our products at that time. And I want to emphasize that also those present significant opportunities for us because the open market it is way more complex, way more diverse to have millions of customers rather than one or two and displays our strengths in terms of having global presence or within the U.S. a dramatic presence in every single territory of the country with thousands of people that they are calling physicians, hospitals, accounts \u2013 in payers accounts, et cetera, et cetera. So it's something that if we see a turn into this market also we would see us being able to compete more of a position of strength than now. As we get to Ibrance, Angela? Angela Hwang : Sure. Well, as you say, the metastatic breast cancer CDK4/6 market is incredibly competitive yet. I will emphasize that Ibrance continues to be the leading CDK4/6 inhibitor. In fact, we have a 74% market share across all patients in first line therapy. So I \u2013 and I think that this number has been pretty consistent because we talk about it every quarter. And I think it demonstrates just the tremendous experience that physicians and patients have and the confidence they have in Ibrance despite new competition, the patient experience, the fact that we have real-world clinical evidence. All of this really adds to the confidence that we have in this brand. And even though Ibrance is a mature brand, we do continue to see growth and where the growth will come from \u2013 from the following places. You're going to see growth from the CDK class. You're going to see growth from the recovery of new patient starts, which as you know has not recovered to the levels of the \u2013 of prior to the pandemic, as well as stabilization of the PAP through time when economic conditions improve. And I actually want to make a special point of this class growth because therein lies, I think, a tremendous opportunity for all of us. Today, well, last year, this time, the CDK class was 48% in first line metastatic breast cancer use. This quarter, it was 54%. So even though it's grown, that still means that the majority of the time CDKs are not being used. And I think all of us in this class really need to focus on this as the leading priority in helping to grow each of our brands, but also to grow the class to impact patient outcome. Albert Bourla : Thank Angela. Next question, please. Operator : Your next questions come from the line of Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. Chris Shibutani : Thank you very much. First a quick word of welcome and appreciation to David for your proactive commentary on the facing of revenues. It really mirrors what your predecessor hit off and finally referred to as the rhythm of the numbers. Very helpful to get insights on near term factors that are generating push-pulls on those numbers. My question is on business development. However, I'm not sure that Aamir has joined us, but perhaps if you could update us on your latest thoughts, the teams in terms of how you're feeling about areas of focus, particularly in view of recent broader commentary, for instance, from the FTC, taking a look at competitive dynamic there? And then secondly, as you reflect upon the overall ecosystem and the receptivity, given things like lowered relatively speaking, biotech valuations, are you sensing any shifts or trends or changes in the mindset of potential targets, partners, acquirers? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much, Aamir is here. And he will be happy to speak about it. Aamir? Aamir Malik : Chris, thank you for the question. Let me just start with your specific FTC point. I think we've demonstrated a very strong track record of shepherding our transactions to-date through the regulatory process. And that's been largely built on having just a close successful, constructive, and collaborative relationships with regulatory bodies globally. In addition, our business development focus and I'll recap, our priorities in a second, is focus on how do we use our unique abilities to translate emerging science into breakthrough medicine. So most of the deals that we do are pro-patient and they're pro-innovation. So we're confident that we can continue to advance our BD strategies in a successful way. We've been very clear that our goal is to add $25 billion of risk adjusted revenue by 2030. And I think we are making very good progress against that. This year you saw our transaction with ReViral and subsequently with Biohaven, which respectively we believe have the potential to add $1.5 billion and $6 billion in peak sales to our business. And this was on the back of a very active 2021. And going forward, we're leaving very few stones unturned when we look at opportunities and our focus is going to be consistent. It's on scientific substrate that has the potential breakthrough for patients, deals that accelerate our top line growth in the back half of the decade, and then opportunities where we can add substantial value, whether that's through our scientific chops and/or our commercial capabilities. And we're going to be very open to deal structures. And we've said before, we're also going to be agnostic to size. We've been clear about the fact that cost synergy driven deals are not where our focus is going to be, and we're going to be extremely disciplined. I think we're very excited about the opportunities that are ahead of us and the flexibility that our balance sheet gives us to pursue those. And on your question on valuation fluctuations, those market valuation fluctuations are not going to drive RBD strategy. We're going to remain focused on fundamentals in the way that I described. Albert Bourla : Thank you. And it's very important when we are aiming very high to also be able at the same time to be disciplined. Disciplined in valuing the science and paying the right price for the right science, so that the capital that we will dispose will be maximized in producing value for patients and holders. So we grow very big $25 billion, but as we are proving, we are very, very disciplined in how we are allocating our capital. And we will continue doing that. With that, let's go to the next question. Thank you, Aamir. Operator : Your next questions come from the line of Andrew Baum with Citi. Andrew Baum : Thank you. Two part question, please. Your former Head of Vaccines is now in [indiscernible] your competitor GSK when he top line the recent positive Phase 3 data for their RSV vaccine Canada, which is adjuvant data observation he made was he stressed the same level of efficacy in the older patient cohort than in the younger patient cohort. It's possible to imagine that this may be uniquely related to the adjuvant that they have given The immunosenescence of the aging population's T-cell given your vaccine does not have an adjuvant and give background. Is that a concern particularly over follow long years, follow up? And then second just following up on the question on Ibrance, could you think talk to your Arvinas compound ARV-471, we come up with market shares, which are materially lower than yours. But whatever the number is, it's clearly reducing quite significantly as competition builds momentum in the market. How do you thinking about as you transition this drug into Phase 3, both what combinations you're going to run and what are you going to use as the control arm for the combination of a plus a CDK4/6? Albert Bourla : Thank you, Andrew. Just to make a correction. It was not the Head of our Vaccines that joined was another member of the vaccines team, but by no means was correct. Let's move to Mikael. Mikael Dolsten : Yeah. I am very optimistic about our RSV vaccine construct. We have seen high immune titer that are critical for the vaccine across all ages. In fact, we are the only one that have showed cross strain A and B for RSV, the ReViral high titers, which differ between all the vaccines, including the one that you mentioned, because they mainly measure cross activity from A to B strain. So that was supported also by our challenge data that looked formidable. So while nobody can predict exactly outcome of studies and compare one study to another, we remain very bullish that our bivalent vaccine should stand out in performance and in tolerability. Please note some of the arguments, including the one that you referred to often associated with somewhat unpleasant side effects. And that was one part of our differentiation to achieve with the bivalent, very high data is far and with best in class tolerability. Albert Bourla : And what about Ibrance? Mikael Dolsten : The ARV-471, I can only speak about the science here, that we see that drug being active in several lines as by itself best-in-class estrogen receptor PROTAC. And we are going to set up our studies in a patient population, which contains many estrogen receptor mutants, which often are poorly managed by the current available fulvestrant or other sides. And we think this is a unique opportunity. And number two, the drugs seem to combine very well with our own CDK4/6 drugs, and we think it could advance into early metastatic lines and possible over time, even to early breast cancer, maybe they're combined with our CDK4. So we have very high hopes for that class of drugs ARV-47 1 combined with our pipeline. Thank you. Albert Bourla : Anything to add William? William Pao : Yeah, I would just add as you mentioned Mikael, the preclinical data shows that the protein degradation could be superior to selective estrogen receptor integrators. And so we're very excited about this potential to be superior to search that are being developed. Albert Bourla : Thank you from your lips to gut ears. Also, I want to add on the RSV, because it's the second question that came and maybe gave the impression that we are not very hot on it. We are extremely hot on it. Clearly very important product for us, clearly very important product for GSK. So there will be a lot of speculation. Maybe the other one will do that, or maybe the other thing will do this. I think data will speak on the cells with the totality of data available so far that I have seen. We have higher reasons to believe we are better, but you never know before the end of the trials. But right now with all-in-all looks like we have very, very strong profile with all the data that has seen so far. We are waiting a lot with a lot of excitement to underlying data and see the realities. And then of course the best will win. Next move now to Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Scala with Cowen. Steve Scala : Thank you so much. I would just like to understand more deeply Pfizer's thinking on Factor XI. I could think of three possibilities. First Pfizer believes there are simply no room to improve upon Eliquis. Second Pfizer believes Factor XI could be very useful, but you haven't found the ideal candidate or third, Pfizer is not sure the jury's still out. Any thoughts? Albert Bourla : I think we have answered it before, and maybe Mikael also can give some color because it's a very, very good question. But bottom line is we are looking for science that it could provide hope that we can have something better than Eliquis and we haven't found yet. So that's the reality. According to our opinion, there is not much maturity right now to overcome the brilliant, the very good profile of Eliquis. Mikael anything to add that simple as that? Mikael Dolsten : I think you said it very well, in the atrial fib platlet inhibitor and ASI are going to be genericized Eliquis and Rivaroxaban, great drugs, Eliquis being a market leader Factor X inhibitor or by the time Factor XI comes to market close to, or already generalized. So the room for an expensive drug in an area with this many great treatments that requires tremendously high R&D expense coming off the patients have consumed multiple great drugs. For us doesn't look like the best area to deploy capital. We always wish other would like for the benefit of patients. Albert Bourla : Yep. Thank you. Let's go to the next question. Operator : Your final question will come from the line of Elliott Bosco with UBS. Elliott Bosco : Hi, this is Elliott Bosco from UBS on for Colin Bristow. Thanks for taking our questions. Just a few on PAXLOVID. You mentioned countries needing to manage broader supply. Do you think that current PAXLOVID use trends will result in excess inventory versus what has been contractually purchased? And additionally, could you comment on the recent Codexis retainer arrangement and how we should think about that with regard to 2023 PAXLOVID demand? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Angela? Angela Hwang : Sure. I think that the way we are manufacturing PAXLOVID with of course, great knowledge from our prior experiences with COMIRNATY, but also in terms of our negotiations and discussions with countries is actually allowing us to do supply planning very well. So we are manufacturing as we need and according to the contracts and according to the demand that the countries are providing us. So I think we're doing that in a very prudent and in a very \u2013 in a prudent and an effective way. So I didn't \u2013 we didn't your second question? Albert Bourla : Yeah. What was the second question? I'm not sure. Elliott Bosco : Codexis, the enzyme supplier for PAXLOVID. Albert Bourla : It was the \u2013 you want to speak, I did refer to it, but maybe also you can yeah reiterate it David. Dave Denton : Yeah. I think Albert indicated this earlier in his remarks, is that in fact over the last several quarters, we've improved our manufacturing process, reduced the cycle time and importantly improved the yield from an output perspective. So therefore we don't need as much raw materials and API to produce the same amount of finished goods. And then finally we've actually invested in our network to make sure that we can actually produce some API as well. So we're in good shape. Albert Bourla : Is what I said before. We are moving most of it now, because we could way faster than what we anticipated, move it inside. So that created some cancellation of raw materials to some external suppliers. I'm sorry about that. I think that was the last question. Let me close with a few takeaways. The first one, as you see, we continue to deliver strong operational performance. We increased our full year 2022 operational financial forecast, while maintaining it challenging for an extension environment. So I think few companies likely will be able to do that. We believe we are well positioned not only to maintain, but also to grow both our commercial and scientific leadership in the battle against COVID-19. It will be for us very important focus. And we believe that the medical need will be there for the years to come. That's why we're investing so heavily. We continue focus on driving long-term shareholder returns by remaining very disciplined both on our operations and our incremental capital deployment, you saw even in this quarter but even more we are squeezing our administrative expenses our SMA is going down. And then we reinvest in R&D because we have programs that we are starting, that we feel is a very good return on our investment. And we continue to advance our internal scientific pipeline while executing against our previously announced plans to potentially add at least $25 billion of risk adjusted revenues through business development opportunities from 2030 comply. Just I want very quickly to see that these results in our yielding curve, this efforts in our year-end results. Just to mention few of the potential approvals and launches that we're going to have in the next few months. CIBINQO, we expect to launch the adolescence in next year. And of course next year will be very first year where we expect to have full access for this drug. We expect to launch next year, RSV maternal. We expect to launch next year RMV adults. We expect to launch next year, Prevnar 20 for pediatrics. We expect to launch next year, Elranatamab for triple class refractory myeloma. We expect to launch next year, Ritlecitinib for atopic. We expect to launch next year TRUMENBA, our meningococcal vaccine. We expect to launch next year Talapro for prostate cancer metastatic castrations with patients. We expect to launch Myfembree for endometriosis. And then a little bit later, we expect maybe this in 2023 or beginning of 2024 DMD and through mRNA. So this is the organic, I'm not referring to the Biohaven that is coming and to other molecules I'm referring mainly to the organically developed pipeline assets. I don't think that much of that has been a factor into what some of the analysts are projecting. That's why I'm emphasizing them so that they can pay a little bit more attention. Those are very high probability of success. The ones that I mentioned they are not in the pocket clearly all of them, and some clearly might not make it to the cross-line, but we believe they're seriously de-risked all of that. So with that in mind, I'm really looking forward to have a 6% CAGR by 2025 in our business as we promised in 2019. In fact, year-to-date, we are at 6% excluding BD and excluding COVID. And I think we will do that by 2025, we will maintain this 6% CAGR and we will do more by BD that with are right now implementing. So I think we have a very good growth prospect, and we will maintain our leadership in comp. Thank you very, very much for your interest. And for those that have summer vacations yet, enjoy your summer vacations. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Pfizer's second quarter 2022 earnings conference call.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chris Stevo, Senior Vice President and Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Christopher Stevo : Good morning. Welcome to Pfizer's third quarter earnings call. We anticipate that this call will last 60 minutes. I'm joined today by Dr. Albert Bourla, our Chairman and CEO; Dave Denton, our CFO; and Dr. Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development and Medical. Joining for the Q&A session, we will also have Angela Hwang, Chief Commercial Officer and President, Global Biopharmaceuticals Business; Aamir Malik, our Chief Business Innovation Officer; Dr. William Pao, our Chief Development Officer; and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel.  Before we begin the call, I'm also happy to announce that we will host an Analyst Day in New York City on the afternoon of December 12. Members of our executive team and other leaders of Pfizer will share information on our rich slate of potential near-term product launches and the R&D readouts which will drive the next wave of product launches after that, both of which will support our 2030 revenues and beyond. In-person attendance will be by invitation, but we will also be webcasting the event. While we're not going to talk more about the agenda today, we look forward to providing more details as we get closer to December 12.  Materials for this call and other earnings-related materials are on the Investor Relations section of pfizer.com. Please see our forward-looking statements disclaimer on Slide 4. And additional information regarding these statements and our non-GAAP financial measures is available in our earnings release and in our SEC forms 10-K and 10-Q under Risk Factors and Forward-looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Results. Forward-looking statements on the call are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, speak only as of the call's original date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements.  With that, I will turn the call over to Albert. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Chris. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I will briefly touch on some recent highlights. I will then spend the bulk of my time speaking to our expectations for what we feel will be a promising and prosperous future for Pfizer and the patients we serve.  In addition to generating a stellar financial performance, since our last earnings call, we reported positive pivotal data for several exciting pipeline programs, including our RSV vaccine candidate for older adults, Prevnar 20 for children, the potential combination of treatment of TALZENNA and XTANDI in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, our pentavalent meningococcal vaccine candidate for adolescents and young adults, as well as exciting progress for our GLP-1 program in type 2 diabetes and obesity.  Just this morning, we announced positive top line data from the Phase III clinical trial investigating our bivalent RSV vaccine candidate when administered to pregnant participants to help protect their infants from RSV disease after birth.  We established a new commercial structure within our global biopharmaceutical business that is focused on 3 broad therapeutic areas : primary care, specialty care and oncology. We believe this new structure will enable us to maximize the commercial success of the multiple exciting product launches, including several potential blockbusters that are poised to emerge from our scientific pipeline over the next few years. We have continued to advance potentially game-changing vaccines in the fight against respiratory disease by entering into a Phase III study for our mRNA flu vaccine candidate and initiating a Phase I study for a vaccine candidate that combines our mRNA flu and COVID-19 vaccine in one shot.  We completed the acquisitions of Biohaven Pharmaceuticals and Global Blood Therapeutics, giving us market-leading franchises in both migraine and sickle cell disease, respectively.  Less than 6 months ago after launching An Accord for a Healthier World, a breakthrough initiative designed to close the health equity gap for 1.2 billion people living in 45 lower-income countries, I'm proud to say that the first shipments of our products have arrived to these countries, and we are working with governments on health system improvements that can help make sure these products reach those in need.  And of course, we continue to lead the fight against COVID-19. Most notably, our Omicron-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine has been authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, by the European Medicines Agency and several other regulatory bodies. And as part of Pfizer's commitment to providing equitable access to COVID-19 oral treatments, we agreed to supply at a not-for-profit price up to 6 million PAXLOVID treatment courses to the Global Fund for low and lower middle income countries.  An exciting quarter, for sure. But in our company and our industry, it's all about what's next. The next breakthrough medicine or vaccine, the next game-changing, the next solution to an unmet patient need. This continued pursuit of what's next is embedded in Pfizer's DNA and the foundational driver of our purpose : breakthroughs that change patients' lives. It's also why we have confidence that Pfizer's story is a story of growth.  We recognize that some are questioning Pfizer's longer-term growth projects, particularly in the '25 to '30 time frame. That's understandable given that we currently expect a negative impact of approximately $17 billion in revenues from losses of exclusivity during that period based on our internal calculations. We believe we not only can overcome these expected declines, but also can potentially generate strong growth through the end of the decade. Let's take a closer look on how we expect to accomplish this. Our strong capital position has given us the ability to pursue business development opportunities with the potential, if successful, of course, to add at least $25 billion of risk-adjusted revenues to our 2030 top line expectations.  We believe the deals we have already done for Arena, Biohaven, Global Blood Therapeutics and ReViral have the potential to get us more than 1/3 of the way there and that we have more than enough capital to invest in the additional opportunities needed to meet or exceed this target.  Perhaps even more exciting is the wave of potential growth drivers emerging from our R&D pipeline in the near term. Over the next 18 months, we expect to have up to 19 new products or indications in the market, including the 5 for which we have already begun co-promotions or commercialization earlier this year. We can find -- you can find the list of these launches in the appendix of the presentation we posted today for this earnings call.  If successful, these 19 launches, of which more than 2/3 have the potential to be blockbusters, will be the most ever in Pfizer's history. The 15 in-house-developed projects alone could potentially represent approximately $20 billion in 2030 sales, which would more than offset the expected LOE impact.  Many of these programs are already largely de-risked from a clinical perspective. The majority of them were discovered in-house and nearly all of them would be for indications outside of COVID-19. If approved, we expect each of these to be key contributors to our growth aspirations through 2025 and beyond.  And of course, we have many more potential vaccines and medicines in our pipeline with numerous launches expected in the '24 to '30 time line. These include gene therapy candidates for hemophilia A, B and Duchenne muscular dystrophy; our oral GLP-1 for diabetes and obesity; a potential combo vaccine that would cover flu and COVID in one shot and many, many more.  With regard to our COVID-19 products, while their sales may fall from our expected 2022 levels of approximately combined $55 billion, we believe our COVID-19 franchises will remain multibillion-dollar revenue generators for the foreseeable future which should serve as a buffer for any unforeseen challenges with other products in our portfolio.  Our confidence to execute this plan stems from the depth of our financial resources and the firepower it gives us to pursue business development opportunities, the powerful brand equity we have built up over the past 170 years and further enhanced in the past 2 years. According to a recent survey, our brand awareness now stands at an impressive 82% and our favorability stands at 61% compared with 42% for the industry as a whole, results that were obtained just a couple of months ago. And of course, the strength of the 3 foundational pillars of our company, our world-class scientific, our world-class commercial and our world-class manufacturing engines, and you will see on this slide some highlights of each one of them.  Let me now briefly highlight 3 potential blockbusters that we expect to contribute to our long-term growth. RSV is an area of significant unmet need, particularly in older adults and infants. Each year, it is estimated more than 177,000 older adults are hospitalized and 14,000 of them die in the U.S. alone due to RSV that is confirmed by a diagnostic test. We believe we have the potential to be a leader in this space and have a real impact on public health.  On March 24 of this year, the FDA granted breakthrough designation for our RSV vaccine candidate for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in individuals 60 years of age or older. We are excited to report positive top line data from the Phase III RENOIR trial in late August, with the recent presentation of detailed results at IDWeek 22.  A preplanned interim analysis showed vaccine efficacy of 67% against RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness, defined by 2 or more symptoms. And vaccine efficacy of 85.7% was observed in participants with more severe disease, presenting 3 or more RSV-associated symptoms of lower respiratory tract illness.  We are also excited about the potential for our maternal RSV vaccine candidate. Globally, each year, RSV sickens more than 6.5 million infants under 6 months old and kills approximately 45,000. As announced this morning, our maternal RSV study met the success criterion for 1 of the 2 primary endpoints. Vaccine efficacy of 81.8% was observed against severe medically attended lower respiratory tract illness due to RSV in infants from birth through the first 90 days of life. And high efficacy of 69.4% was demonstrated through the first 6 months of life.  So there is the potential that, subject to regulatory approval, by late 2023, early 2024, we could have the only RSV maternal vaccine in the market, along with an RSV vaccine for older adults, that has high efficacy, and it is well tolerated with no safety concerns.  Combined, the 2 indications represent a potential multibillion-dollar peak revenue opportunity if approved, especially with our highly respected primary care sales force executing these launches. Including the RSV antiviral investigational candidates we acquired with ReViral, we aim to have end-to-end solutions with both preventative vaccines and therapeutics to treat those infected with RSV.  Ulcerative colitis or UC is a chronic and often debilitating inflammatory bowel disease that affects an estimated 1 million people in the U.S. alone. Many patients living with this disease never achieve or maintain remission, and physicians are seeking effective, proven oral therapies with a favorable benefit/risk profile that can be an attractive first-line advanced therapy option. As a result, we expect the market opportunity to grow by about 50% over the next 5 years.  The positive Phase III data from the ELEVATE UC 12 and 52 trials reinforce our belief that etrasimod has a differentiated clinical profile and can be an important treatment option if approved. We believe that etrasimod can be a multibillion-dollar blockbuster product. We expect to launch the product in the U.S. as soon as the second half of 2023, pending regulatory approval, through our specialty care sales force, which already has strong relationships in the UC market, thanks to its work with Xeljanz, biosimilars, et cetera.  Lastly, let's look at migraine. Following our acquisition of Biohaven in early October, we are now aiming to build the world's leading global migraine franchise with the potential to impact 1 billion patients around the world. Migraine is a debilitating disease and has 11.6% prevalence worldwide. In the U.S. alone, there are 40 million patients with migraine, and 1 out of 5 women are migraine sufferers right now. The economic burden is significant at $36 billion per year. We believe our portfolio, including NURTEC ODT, VYDURA and zavegepant, could meet a range of needs in the market, allowing physicians and patients to decide how to appropriately manage migraine treatment and prevention. As a result, we see the potential to reach more than $6 billion in peak revenues altogether. In the U.S., NURTEC is growing very well, including the impact of Pfizer's co-promoting, which began in August pre-close. NURTEC has further strengthened its #1 market share position in the oral CGRP market, and we expect even stronger growth as we deliver on our promise to further enhance our commercial efforts behind this program.  Outside the U.S., it has been approved in the EU, U.K., Israel, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and we have filed for registration in an additional 10 markets. While this is not a new product launch, we believe this is a great example of how we can take this portfolio to new heights by leveraging the full strength of Pfizer's global commercial engine, including in primary care physicians.  Moving over to zavegepant. We recently expect to launch zavegepant intranasal in the U.S. next year, pending FDA approval, and we plan to globally commercialize. Lastly, the oral prevention Phase III trial is ongoing with a data readout expected in the third quarter.  So with that, I turn it over to Dave to update you on the results and outlook for the financials. After Dave, Mikael will speak about the progression of our pipeline. David Denton : Thank you, Albert, and good morning. I'll begin this morning with a few comments regarding how the company continues to deploy capital in a disciplined manner in support of long-term growth and, importantly, enhanced shareholder returns. As you know, Pfizer's cash generation capabilities has expanded significantly over the past several years and the efficient deployment of this capital is more critical than ever.  During the first 9 months of 2022, the company has deployed and committed capital in 3 main areas : first, we've invested $7.8 billion in internal R&D as we continue to support our growing pipeline of innovative medicines. These investments are squarely focused on driving revenue growth through 2030. Secondly, in the first 3 quarters of this year, we have invested approximately $8 billion in completed business transactions. Additionally, early in the fourth quarter, the company completed investments of more than $18 billion in transactions, including both Biohaven and GBT, which brings us to approximately $26 billion in capital deployed for business development transactions thus far in 2022 alone. These transactions illustrate our progress towards the goal of adding $25 billion in risk-adjusted 2030 revenues through BD.  And finally, we have returned nearly $9 billion of capital to shareholders through a combination of both dividends and value-enhancing share repurchases. Clearly, maximizing shareholder value through prudent capital allocation will continue to be a major focus for Pfizer. So with that, let me briefly review our financial results for the quarter. I'll limit my remarks largely to adjusted and operating growth figures.  Third quarter revenues demonstrated strength across many areas of the business, but much of that strength was somewhat obscured by our incredibly strong performance in the third quarter of 2021. Given the strength in the prior year, revenues this quarter decreased 2% operationally. However, looking at it on a 2-year basis, revenues this quarter were up more than 120% compared to the third quarter of 2020. The slight decrease compared to last year was in line with our expectations given the phasing of scheduled deliveries of COMIRNATY, which we discussed in our earnings call last quarter. Also underlying our results this quarter was the strong performance of PAXLOVID as well as continued strength from a number of our other key products.  Excluding direct sales and alliance revenues related to the COVID products, Pfizer's revenues grew 2% operationally in the quarter. Gross margins expanded by 1,450 basis points versus the third quarter of LY. This improvement is largely due to increased sales of higher-margin PAXLOVID and decreased sales of lower-gross margin COMIRNATY compared to last year. These improvements were partially offset by the impact of a $400 million charge related to excess raw materials for PAXLOVID. Given the unpredictable nature of the virus, we intentionally chose to order additional stock to ensure we can meet any global health demand if an extreme need were to arise.  Adjusted SI&A expenses in the third quarter grew 23% operationally. The increase was primarily driven by spending for PAXLOVID and COMIRNATY and higher health care reform fees.  The 2% operational increase in adjusted R&D expense in Q3 was primarily driven by increased cost to develop recently acquired assets as well as investments for certain oncology and non-COVID-19 vaccines programs. This was partially offset by lower spending on programs to prevent and treat COVID-19 and various late-stage clinical programs.  The effective tax rate on adjusted income in the quarter was 4.4%, significantly lower than typical, driven by tax benefits related to global income tax resolutions in multiple tax jurisdictions spanning several tax years. Excluding these tax resolutions, the underlying tax rate was consistent with historical trends.  As a result, reported diluted earnings per share of $1.51 grew by 6%, while adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.78 grew 44% on an operational basis in the quarter. Now foreign exchange movements continue to dampen our results, negatively impacting revenues by approximately $950 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.05 this quarter. Now let me move to our updated 2022 guidance. Given our strong third quarter performance and our improving outlook for the year, we are increasing our operational expectations for revenues by $1.7 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.19. This operational increase on the bottom line would have been even higher if not for an incremental $0.06 negative impact due to higher acquired IPR&D expenses.  Partially offsetting these operational increases is the impact of additional strengthening of the U.S. dollar since we last updated guidance in late July. Incremental foreign exchange movements negatively impacted our expectations for 2022 revenues and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $700 million and $0.09, respectively.  The net impact of these cross-currents result in increases to the midpoints of our revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance ranges. These revised ranges reflect operational growth rates of 31% for revenues and 70% for adjusted diluted earnings per share at the midpoint compared to 2021. And this was up from our previous operational growth expectations for revenues and adjusted diluted earnings per share of 29% and 65%, respectively. Regarding our COVID-19-related revenues, we now expect the vaccine revenue for the year to be approximately $34 billion, up by $2 billion compared to our prior guidance. For PAXLOVID, we expect sales of approximately $22 billion, keeping the guidance range unchanged despite the negative incremental impact of changes in FX.  You can see on this slide our updated costs and expense guidance which incorporates our performance to date, our recent acquisitions and our updated expectations for the remainder of the year. More information on each of these updates can be found in this morning's press release. 2022 guidance once again assumes no incremental share repurchases beyond the $2 billion of share repurchases we completed in March of 2022.  In closing, it's an exciting time in the history of Pfizer. We believe that our strong financial performance in the quarter and our improving operational outlook for the year sets the stage for long-term shareholder value creation.  With that, I'll now turn it over to Mikael. Mikael Dolsten : Thank you, Dave. Today, I will focus attention on high-value programs that will potentially deliver breakthroughs in areas of high unmet need and are expected to be key contributors to our growth aspirations through 2025 and beyond.  With anchor products such as COMIRNATY, PAXLOVID, IBRANCE and XTANDI, we are building out comprehensive franchises in several areas, including respiratory, metabolic disorders, genetic hematology and certain cancers. We have deep expertise in these areas, and there is exciting science emerging. I will share updates from 3 of these today : respiratory, metabolic and prostate cancer.  Building on our success with COMIRNATY and PAXLOVID, we see enormous potential to help address major causes of respiratory disease through vaccines and therapeutics. Work on the next-generation vaccine candidates are well underway. And last week, we started a Phase I clinical trial of our second-generation oral therapeutic candidate. Our quadrivalent modRNA flu program has progressed into Phase III, and we will start shortly a Phase I study of an mRNA-based vaccine candidate that combines our quadrivalent modRNA flu vaccine candidate with the Omicron-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine based on BA.4/5. In RSV, we believe a dual focus on developing a vaccine and antivirals could make a significant impact globally. I will share new data with you shortly. PAXLOVID continues to be an important tool in helping to combat the impact of COVID-19. And secondary endpoints from the EPIC-High Risk study as well as data from real-world evidence support the product's efficacy profile. In the EPIC-HR study, PAXLOVID reduced COVID-19-related all-cause deaths and ICU admissions by 100% and COVID-19-related hospitalization by 86% in unvaccinated, high-risk patients compared to placebo. It also reduced the duration of COVID-19 symptoms by 2 to 3 days compared to placebo. We are pleased to see PAXLOVID leading the COVID-19 treatment landscape and remain confident in its safety and efficacy in treating patients at high-risk for severe outcomes.  We recently reported a positive interim analysis from a Phase III study in older adults of our novel RSV vaccine candidate, which targets the prefusion F protein on both RSV A and B, without need for an adjuvant. We saw remarkable vaccine efficacy across the first RSV season. The vaccine was extremely well tolerated with favorable systemic tolerability, a key consideration for vaccines.  We also are developing the RSVpreF vaccine candidate for use in pregnant women so that protection may be conferred to newborns. And this morning, we announced exciting results from a preplanned interim analysis of our Phase III trial. We observed vaccine efficacy of nearly 82% against severe medically attended lower respiratory tract illness or MA-LRTI due to RSV in infants from birth through the first 90 days of life and efficacy of more than 69% through the first 6 months of life. Success criterion was not met for the second primary endpoint. However, clinically meaningful efficacy was observed with MA-LRTI of 57% in infant from birth through 90 days of life and efficacy of 51% over the 6-month follow-up period. The Data Monitoring Committee indicated the vaccine was well tolerated with no safety concerns for either vaccinated women or their newborns.  Given these impressive results, we look forward to filing BLA for both older adults and pregnant women with the U.S. FDA by year-end with potential launches in '23. If approved, our maternal RSV vaccine candidate potentially would be the first available to help prevent this common and potentially life-threatening respiratory illness in young infants. Turning now to prostate cancer. We're building upon the standard of care set by XTANDI in castration-sensitive and castration-resistant population. The Phase III EMBARK study of XTANDI in non-metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer is expected to read out first half of '23. And the Phase III TALAPRO-3 study of TALZENNA and XTANDI is expected in '24. These trials may indicate benefit in up to 20% more patients than are currently treated and potentially prolong duration of use, subject to clinical success and regulatory approval. Now in TALAPRO-2, we observed the first clinical benefit of a PARP inhibitor plus XTANDI in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with or without homologous recombination repair or HRR gene mutation. Irrespective of HRR gene mutation status, the study achieved its primary endpoint. The combination delivered a significant and clinically meaningful improvement in radiographic progression-free survival and appears to have resulted in the longest observed such survival in a randomized trial in this setting. We are encouraged by these results and believe that TALZENNA in prostate cancer may have blockbuster potential, subject to regulatory approval.  Turning to metabolic disorders. I previously shared that we are developing 2 oral GLP-1 receptor agonist, danuglipron and 1532. Recently presented Phase Ib data for 1532 show dose-dependent reduction from baseline at 4 to 6 weeks in mean daily glucose, fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c and body weight. Both candidates are potentially best-in-class and differentiated by offering full agonism, which may be required to achieve the same level of response as injectable GLP-1 receptor agonists while offering a convenient once daily dose for 1532. Glucose effects plateau at lower doses, while body weight effects continue to improve at higher doses.  The planned Phase IIb study will evaluate 1532 versus both oral semaglutide and placebo in type 2 diabetes and separately versus placebo in obesity. Using semaglutide as a comparator in the type 2 diabetes arm should allow us to observe potential early signs of differentiation in efficacy, tolerability and safety. We will evaluate doses up to 260 milligrams in this study, higher than the studies in the Phase Ib. We plan to begin dosing soon and anticipate the readout in first quarter 2024.  The ongoing Phase IIb study of danuglipron in obesity with now once-monthly titration is expected to complete second half of 2023. Data from these studies will be available in relatively quick succession and, assuming clinical success, allow us to select one based on efficacy, tolerability and dosing to advance to Phase III in both type 2 diabetes and obesity. In closing, we are excited about the developing science within these franchisees and share here recent and anticipated milestones in the next 18 months. We look forward to continue our development both for potential patient benefit and sustainable growth.  Thank you. Let me turn over to Chris to start Q&A. Christopher Stevo : Thanks, Mikael. With that, let's start the Q&A session. We have about 30 minutes for this session. We will answer as many questions as time permits. And Investor Relations will be available after the call to answer any follow-up questions. Chelsea, please go ahead and queue up the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. We'll go to our next question, Colin Bristow with UBS. Colin Bristow : On COVID '23 expectations, should we expect anything from you here on the December 12 Investor event? And then just more broadly around this, how are you thinking conceptually about guiding to this? Will it be similar to last year? Are you thinking of more sort of scenario-based guiding? Anything that would be helpful.  And then just a sort of temperature check on business development, if you could update us on your priorities and interests. And then from a deal perspective, just how big would you be willing to go? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you. On the December 12, what you should expect, it is a good overview of our very important new product launches in the coming 18 months, with more details about the science and the market potential of those launches as well as some of the most important pipeline potential new medicines and vaccines that they are not going to be launched in the next 18 months but will be launched in the period between '24 and '30.  Now for the BD priorities, I would ask Aamir to reiterate once more our strategy when it comes to BD. Aamir Malik : Thanks for the question, Colin. The BD priorities remain consistent with what we've articulated before. And principally, we are most excited about scientific substrate that has the potential for patient breakthroughs. That's going to continue to be our north star. We're looking for deals that accelerate our top line growth in the back half of the decade. And importantly, we're focused on opportunities where we can add substantial value, and that can come in the form of either shaping the science or also accelerating our commercial momentum. And if you look at the deals that we announced and closed in 2022, including Arena, Biohaven, ReViral and GBT, they would all be very consistent with those priorities.  We've said that we are agnostic to size of transaction. But you've also heard us be very clear about the fact that cost synergy-driven deals is not where our focus is going to be. We're going to be focused on driving growth through our BD. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Aamir. And also, Dave, maybe you can also address the question about guidance on COVID and are we going to provide it and when for '23, et cetera. David Denton : Yes. Thank you, Albert. Maybe let me discuss the stage as it relates to COVID and the COVID franchise. I think if you look out longer-term, the franchise is going to be a multibillion-dollar franchise in the respect that this is going to be somewhat like a flu, sustained flu, but actually more deadly than the flu. So therefore, I think the products, both from a vaccine and the therapy perspective that Pfizer has developed, are going to be quite relevant for many years to come.  Having said that, when we provide guidance for 2023, when it's appropriate to do so, we will give investors a perspective on what our expectations are for the year. We will break out that guidance specifically, so you can hold us accountable for delivering on those revenue promises when the time comes. Operator : Next, we have Louise Chen with Cantor. Louise Chen : So I wanted to ask you, first off, how you think about -- or maybe more color on how you think about the pushes and pulls in 2023. There's a lot of moving parts there. And then secondly, on your RSV franchise, there seems to be several players with drugs in development and they've all reported out positive data. So curious how you think about this market playing out over time? Albert Bourla : Yes. Let me say a few words about the push and pulls, and then I will ask Angela to complement and then speak about how we see the RSV market.  Clearly, '23 is a very, very important year for us given the unprecedented number of new launches that we are going to have in the next 18 months. And most of them will happen in '23 and some beginning of the first quarter of '24. But we are launching products, not only a very big number of them, but only the internal ones, $20 billion, excluding the BD, Biohaven and the Global Blood, $20 billion of peak sales were expected 2030 sales we are expecting from those launches. So it's a very, very big number. And it's very important for us to do it well. In addition, so clearly, that will bring -- our non-COVID business will be a significant boost for our non-COVID business. Now when we move to COVID, we expect '23 will be a transition year with likely in the U.S. moving from a government model into a commercial model for vaccines and therapeutics. The timing is not certain. So we are ready to do it ASAP, but we will be phased over the years. And it likely will not be the same for PAXLOVID or COMIRNATY. And clearly also, there will be some stuff that will have to be depleted in '23. And clearly, will be new price dynamics as we are moving to '23. So COVID will be a little bit more of a transitional year in '23 until it will be established into more like a flu volumes type of market. But of course, with different price points and different severity of the disease, that will bring both therapeutic and vaccines into a multibillion-dollars franchise. But we are not going to predict now what will be the number for the years out, but we will try to be as accurate as possible for our '23 numbers when we will provide guidance. Now Angela, anything to add on the push and pulls? You are carrying a lot of the weight for the new launches and also speak about one of them, which is going to be the RSV maternal and adult. Angela Hwang : Well, we're extremely excited about both the adult vaccine as well as the maternal vaccine. First and foremost, because it is in the sweet spot of what Pfizer does, respiratory vaccines, right? We have a lot of experience of this created through the legacy of our pneumococcal franchise and the strength we have there, but also recently from COMIRNATY.  I'll also add that Pfizer is the only company that has both the adult vaccine as well as the maternal vaccine. And it really does fit so extremely well into our existing commercial footprint. These are large populations, both the adult as well as maternal.  Let me just start with adult and just sort of characterize that a bit. There's 61 million 65-year-olds, all of whom are eligible for this vaccination. It's actually a -- it's quite a devastating disease. The hospital costs from RSV for adults is over $1.2 billion. It is also underreported and underdiagnosed. And so we have a really great opportunity here to drive awareness of this disease but also to use the commercial footprint that we already have to create awareness, to create education and to bring this vaccine to those who need it.  Equally, in the maternal space, a devastating disease. Most of the mortality and the morbidity is in infants that are under 6 months old and those that are preterm. And actually, over 102,000 deaths worldwide are resulting from infant infections of RSV. So again, we see a tremendous opportunity to make a difference here. As you know, through the work that we've done on Prevnar, we have a tremendous legacy in pediatric vaccines. And so that, coupled with our strength in women's health and the commercial footprint we have there as well, is going to be perfectly suited for us to launch the maternal RSV vaccine.  And so bringing all of this together, I think that we have the scientific knowledge, we have the technology, we have the relationships with the vaccinators and the sites of vaccinations. We are also very well versed in our work with the vaccine technical committees around the world, in bringing together a broad recommendation, which we believe is what's going to give us access to many, many infants as well as adults to these 2 tremendous breakthroughs. So I think we have the best-in-class capabilities to do a great job with this respiratory portfolio. Albert Bourla : Very well, Angela, and I agree with you. Operator : Next, we have Steve Scala with Cowen. Stephen Scala : I have three questions, but they're all short. First, what impact on RSV-associated infant hospitalizations did Pfizer see in the Phase III MATISSE trial? Second, can you tell us what NURTEC sales were in Q3? I know you didn't own Biohaven in Q3, but you likely know the number. And then lastly, all things considered, is it unrealistic to think that COMIRNATY plus PAXLOVID sales could be as much as $15 billion in 2030? Albert Bourla : Thank you very much. Mikael, what about the RSV data? Mikael Dolsten : Thank you for the question. So as you have seen in our press release, we reported out very impressive data and the 2 separate primary endpoints that were independent, it is sufficient to hit one for filing. And to our privilege and encouragement, we hit strongly on the most important. And that was defined as severe, medically attended lower tract respiratory infections, where we had close to 82% vaccine efficacy. That is defined by clinical features, such as the rate and the stress of respiration, oxygenation levels, et cetera, in the children and will include patients, whether they are hospitalized or not. We will later release data on secondary endpoints that include hospitalization. When you look at this dramatic effect on the severe infections, it seems very reasonable to project that we will have a dramatic impact in lowering hospitalizations. I'm probably talking about tens of thousands of hospitalizations in the U.S. that may not happen if this vaccine is used to vaccinate maternal prior to delivering children as appropriately studied in this vaccination. So we're very encouraged and optimistic about that type of value. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael. Before I turn to Dave to answer the question about the sales of NURTEC in the third quarter, let me make a comment on COMIRNATY and PAXLOVID and the franchise.  Clearly, we said that we will provide us good picture of what we expect to be the sales for next year. Now you're asking about year 2030, which is even more challenging. But also, the way you are asking the question, is it unthinkable -- is it unreasonable to think that we could have a $15 billion franchise? Well, taking that it is $55 billion right now, it's not unreasonable to think that in year 2030, could be that. But it's not clear that it will be done. So that will depend on the virus and how it behaves. It will depend on if it will become standard practice to vaccinate together with flu. If we will have a combination product, clearly, that will enhance this direction. So I think it's a little bit too early, but no, it's not unreasonable to think given that where we are right now.  Now, what about NURTEC sales? David Denton : Yes. Steve, this is Dave. As you said, we didn't own the business last quarter, but maybe just a little bit of color on how the product is performing. If you look at the volume last year, or last quarter, rather, Q3, if you compare it to last year, it was about a 45% growth rate in year-over-year script volume. And then if you look at it sequentially, which I think is really important, we saw about a 16% growth rate sequentially Q2 going into Q3. So I think this shows the promise of this product, number one.  And number two, I think once we get it, now that we have it in the hands of our field force and into our primary care field force, we can really maximize the value of this needed medicine into the patient population here in the U.S. and abroad. Operator : Our next question will come from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist Securities. Robyn Karnauskas : Great. On PAXLOVID, I was just -- I'm sure you saw the recent publication citing how many people have died from not even getting an antiviral. Can you talk a little bit about the efforts you're making to educate physicians to give the drug? And do you think we'll ever get to a point where people will be more comfortable, doctors will be more comfortable taking it, given all the news around the PAXLOVID rebound? And second question, can you talk a little bit about the opportunity for vitiligo and alopecia in your pipeline? And when should we hear the next readout? Albert Bourla : Thank you very much. Both questions, I think, can be answered very nicely by Angela. Angela Hwang : Well, thank you for the question. So we can just talk a little bit about PAXLOVID and how that's been going. I mean, first and foremost, we are under an EUA, so that means that we are working hand-in-hand with the U.S. government to ensure that we are providing the education to the public.  The U.S. government and the state governments, I think, have created a tremendous amount of education already using public service announcements and public campaigns. And equally, we have provided education to all the potential prescribers of PAXLOVID.  So if you think about where we are today, over 500,000 physicians have written PAXLOVID. And what you have in addition to that is education that we've provided not only to doctors but also to pharmacists. We've trained over 80,000 pharmacists in terms of how to write PAXLOVID.  And so I think the education is really firing off, both at a prescriber level but also at a consumer level where we have worked, again, also closely with state governments and local governments, to ensure that we're providing the right amount of education. I will say that the Test to Treat sites that the government has stood up federally, there's now 27,000 of those around the country, have also been great sources of education for PAXLOVID.  So I think that it's -- frankly, I think it's going well. I think that we're continuing to do more in anticipation of the fall. But the fact that you've had 500,000 physicians write this PAXLOVID already is a great indicator of their confidence with this.  And the fact that probably, the one most important area of education that we need to continue to emphasize is just who are the eligible people for PAXLOVID. And actually, if you look at the definition that the CDC provides, there are 22 risk factors for who should be eligible. And they include those who are over 65, right, age-related risks, but equally, risks such as mental health illness, risks such as an inactive lifestyle, risks that you may not be aware of. And so I think that that's really where we want to focus now through this fall. Albert Bourla : And what about vitiligo? Angela Hwang : I think we're really excited about these new indications for ritlecitinib. I think probably the main theme here is that there are not effective -- there aren't any treatments for these highly -- very serious inflammatory conditions today. So huge unmet need, huge -- just a place where there's just no options today. So the fact that we're able to bring a treatment like this to market, I think, will have tremendous uptake by patients who up to now just are left with no options. Albert Bourla : And William, can you please address a little bit the issue about the rebounds that was also mentioned? William Pao : Sure, Albert. Well, Mikael already mentioned that we gave updated data from our EPIC-HR study on the effect of PAXLOVID versus placebo in patients with high risk for COVID-19. And we had additional end points there which we showed a 100% decrease in ICU admissions, a 100% decrease in mechanical ventilation among hospitalized patients, 100% who got PAXLOVID were DC-ed to home versus 53% placebo. We also had 82% reduction in oxygen support, 86% reduction in COVID-19-related hospitalization, 89% reduction in mean days hospitalized versus 100 patients and also a 73% reduction in any COVID-19-related medical visits. Importantly, we also showed sustained time to symptom alleviation and sustained time to symptom resolution of an impact of 2 to 3 days of PAXLOVID versus placebo.  But most importantly, about rebounds, there's been several studies recently that have shown actually that rebound occurs with COVID, in general. For example, there was a recent publication of 158 patients who got placebo with COVID and actually, 1/3 of those had recurrent symptoms after the resolution of their symptoms, suggesting that it's a phenomenon associated with COVID and not with PAXLOVID.  Importantly, we also haven't seen any evidence of resistance that is clinically meaningful. Whereas with antibodies, for example, we have seen that you can also can get symptom rebound, but that is associated with resistance. So again, PAXLOVID is not associated with resistance but the antibodies are. So we feel very confident that PAXLOVID has a significant impact and a role against COVID. Operator : Next, we have Andrew Baum with Citi. Andrew Baum : A couple of questions. Firstly, as it relates to maternal RSV vaccine. Could you talk about reimbursement coverage in the U.S.? I'm assuming you'll get an ACIP recommendation. And therefore, there will be 0 out of pocket, which may differentiate it versus the monoclonal. And I'm sure on a cost basis, that will be material.  And then secondly, could you talk to your efforts with your ER degrader with Arvinas in light of the evolving data on SERDs? Thinking about Astra's recent positive trial on MDS subgroup. Do you believe that this is a function of defining the right patient population at the right stage of the disease rather than the potential risk to the development of the entire category? Albert Bourla : Drew, thank you. In the interest of time, let me give the first answer. Yes, you are right. As long as the product is recommended by CDC, and we believe with this type of efficacy, it will be recommended, there is 0 co-pay irrelevant of the insurance. If it is commercial or if it is public, their obligation is 0 co-pay from the payers, and they have to cover it. Mikael, what about the Arvinas molecules? Mikael Dolsten : Yes. Thank you for asking. Clearly, we think that there are 2 factors that will separate out the good drugs from the less good in this class of degraders. And we think that PROTAC, which is the mechanistic name of the 471, is more effective in down-regulating the estrogen receptor. And selecting the right patients compared to standard of care, that includes selecting patients that have estrogen receptor mutations and need more powerful drugs and it's related to the property of the drug itself. We look forward to advance that drug with Arvinas to pivotal studies in the relatively near future and also to soon reveal to you a lot of progress we had in our breast cancer franchise, including the CDK4 drug. And that may be part of what we consider to share in December at the investor update on launches and next waves. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael. Another reason to attend this great event. Operator : Next, we have Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Evan Seigerman : Congrats on the progress. Two questions for me. On BD, I want to be brief here. But can you talk about what other therapeutic areas you might want to explore? I know you're in neurology with Biohaven, nonmalignant hematology with GBT and, of course, inflammation. Would you consider adding oncology?  And on the same line, kind of, Albert, in some previous comments ahead of this call, you had mentioned going alone with some of your mRNA technologies. What applications of mRNA do you see outside of COVID? I mean this personalized cancer vaccine is an area that you would explore. Albert Bourla : Maybe I'll pass that to Aamir. Aamir Malik : Sure. Evan, thanks for the question. As far as our therapeutic areas of focus, as I mentioned before in our priorities, our focus is on where we can make a difference and shape the science. And the good news is we actually have distinctive capabilities across many different therapeutic areas. So you've seen us active in internal medicine, anti-infectives, I&I and, certainly, oncology. And our focus is going to be on where we have breakthrough science and the potential to shape it. And we feel very good about the breadth of our scientific capabilities to give us lots of flexibility to work in different TAs. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Aamir. Yes, we didn't answer the mRNA and how we think about it, Mikael. Mikael Dolsten : Yes. So I'm excited to share we're broadening that platform. You heard about advance of the mRNA flu vaccine successfully to the next stages. Albert mentioned plans that are ongoing to combine it with COVID vaccine to build more broader respiratory vaccine with indeed improved convenience in single administration, single-patient visits. We are on our way to the Phase I study, together with BioNTech, on our shingles vaccine that really aim to deliver the power of the mRNA, but remove what we've seen as a pretty significant issue with of the current adjuvant vaccine.  We're looking at several other mRNA vaccine that we will share in proper time. But also, that Aamir briefly alluded to, we have made progress in our alliance with Beam to really identify the first type of candidates that will move forward to genetic medicine in some of the important rare diseases. And we're looking at application at certain areas of in vivo cancer medications, where we think this technology can be more successful where compared to the past of cancer vaccines. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much, Mikael. Operator : Next is Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Mohit Bansal : So on RSV vaccine side, I mean -- so the congress on the data in maternal vaccine, my question is Sanofi has an antibody which you can give to an infant directly and it shows good results. So in your opinion, I mean, the strategy, there could be one strategy, you immunize moms, expecting moms versus infants directly. How do you think about the end market shaking out eventually? Albert Bourla : Yes. Angela, do you want to say how we could compete potentially with an antibody in infants? Angela Hwang : Yes. I mean, first of all, if you look at where the -- most of the morbidity and mortality is happening, it's really at the under 6 months, right, in that age group and also with preterm babies. And so you really need that protection from day 1. And I think that that's where we believe our differentiation is. From birth, literally from the moment of birth, you have protection. And you have duration of protection throughout the 6 months, which is what we've shown in our clinical trial. So I think while there -- I mean, obviously, it's great to have many different options. I think that the option that we have with our vaccine is truly a unique one and one that plays well to the situation with the infants. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much. And of course, Andrew made also the point, with vaccines, we do not have co-pays. And antibodies are quite expensive, and you do have co-pays. Operator : Next, we have Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Brian Tsang : This is Brian on for Tim. Just two from us. What is Pfizer's current level of interest in Alzheimer's disease? And do you think there are compelling business development opportunities in the market? Or would the efforts likely to be homegrown?  And then second, on the Prevnar 20 and the competition. Wondering if you can opine on Merck's strategy, which is to bifurcate the market between peds and adults and have a product tailored to each segment. They have strains in each and they will be going head-to-head against Prevnar. They said a tailored approach is better than a one-size-fits-all approach, which is what Prevnar is. Just wanted to get your thoughts on that. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much. Clearly, as you know, Pfizer had externalized their neuroscience portfolio, and we have created a company that's working on that actually. And we have a very significant equity over there.  We are monitoring how science is evolving. And apparently, there are a few things that are happening right now. I'm not referring only to the positive data of one study that we just saw, I'm more referring to earlier science that is emerging that seems to have a high promising for most clinical results.  So we are monitoring that. And if we think that there is a good opportunity, we may reexamine entering. The reason why we actually want to exit is because we felt the science is not ready at the time.  Now I will move it to Angela to answer your second question. Angela Hwang : We're really proud of our pneumococcal vaccine franchise. And I want to begin with just talking about the great successes that Prevnar 20 has had since its launch. Even though it's competing with other -- with another pneumococcal or other pneumococcal vaccines, we have a 95% market share. We have 97% formulary access. And we just recently had an updated ACIP recommendation that is going to enable Prevnar 20 to be used for catch-ups in those that are 65 plus as well as 65 under. And so I think that, that is a great demonstration of the leadership and the legacy that Pfizer has in pneumococcal vaccines or respiratory vaccines and the tremendous relationships and knowledge that we have in the space.  Equally, that plays out in the pediatric space. So even though we're obviously anticipating the launch of pediatric Prevnar 20, but in the meantime, Prevnar 13 is competing really well with the PCV15. I think that, again, the relationships that we have, the deep trust and knowledge that physicians have of the -- of our pneumococcal vaccine is really standing -- is really helping us competitively. And I think that there's great anticipation for the 5 additional serotypes that you're going to be able to get with Prevnar 20 over 15 in the pediatric space.  So I think all in all, we're off to an extremely strong start and we look forward to bringing our next vaccine to the market. Albert Bourla : Okay. Thank you very, very much. Operator : Next, we have Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Christopher Schott : Actually, kind of a qualitative question on how to think about OpEx dynamics going forward. It seems like we've seen some upward bias in spend at the company, which has kind of coincided with the ramp in COVID sales. I guess for a position where that COVID market resets as we transition past the pandemic, is there opportunity? Or should we think about a pullback in OpEx spend associated with that? Or should we think about these as more normalized levels of spend given all these growth initiatives that you're highlighting and investing behind at this point? Albert Bourla : Thank you, Chris. Nice question. And our new CFO clearly has views on this. So Dave, what do you think? David Denton : Chris, good question. Listen, before getting into -- it's probably a little too early for guidance for '23. But my expectation is that there would not be a pullback in expenses. I think if anything, what we're fortunate to have is a very robust launch schedule over the next 18 months. And we're really focused on investing to make sure that those launches are extremely successful and these medicines get in the hands of patients pretty quickly.  And so if anything, our focus is to get behind these launches, make sure that we execute them flawlessly and that we see the ramp-up and drive our sales performance, particularly in the 2025 to 2030 time frame. Operator : Next is Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Geoff Meacham : Thanks for the question. Just had a few. The slide on long-term growth is really helpful. On the $20 billion on Slide 9 that you guys have highlighted, can you talk to the long-term contribution that is not COVID? I know there's some -- there's a long-term piece for COVID, but most investors are focused on kind of the non-COVID drivers. And then on I&I, looking to next year when we'll have many biosimilars launching for Humira, how much of market disruption do you think we'll see from higher buyers, similar volumes and payer preferences? I'm thinking about the effect on CIBINQO and then the etrasimod launch specifically, but also Xeljanz and Inflectra. Albert Bourla : Yes. I will ask Angela to answer the second question. On the first one, maybe I can give some clarifications. On the $20 billion, so we have included revenues from new launches. This is our estimations for 2030. New launches that are happening either started in '22, CIBINQO, for example, is there, because it started. And then we are adding claims or are about to happen and we have the list in the appendix. And in this list, excluding the BD, which we do not count over there, we count on the previous bar, where we have the $25 billion of revenues, are summing to $20 billion in our expectation.  Just to clarify, this does not include COVID. This is excluding COVID, excluding new things that may come from COVID, excluding new things that may come in antivirals or new vaccines or combination vaccines or any of that. These are not part of that. Now in the other pipeline, which are things that are not in the near, near short term and things that will launch after the 18 months period all the way to '30, clearly, a lot of these things maybe are not known to you yet. But among the things that are known to you and that should be included over there, should be the GLP-1, should be any combinations between flu and COVID or RSV, should be our interferon , and the Lyme vaccines, the Arvinas, should be the gene therapies that could come. All of that should count towards that bar that we haven't quantified yet publicly. Of course, we know what we expect ourselves. Thank you very much. Now, Angela. The I&I and the vaccine launch. Angela Hwang : So the way to think about it is the biologics market and the oral market is -- the way we think about it is that it's different. And the reason I say that is because there is -- if you look at the treatment algorithms and how the biologics are used and how the orals are used, you picked Xeljanz as an example, right? Clearly, there, the label says that you have to have used anti-TNF before you move on to an oral JAK. And so I don't think that the competition is across biologics. With orals, I think the competition is literally with HUMIRA and the biosimilars of Humira, and then the orals have their role.  So I'll use Xeljanz as one example. I'll use etrasimod as another example. There, the benefit of this is that you have an oral therapy that actually can be used earlier line and actually pre-biologic. So again, there, you -- it's the different lines of treatment and the fact that I think there are distinct places where you would use an oral and a distinct place where you would use a biologic, and I don't think that's the crossover. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Angela. We're running a little bit late, so we'll have 3 more questions. And we'll try to make -- answer them very quickly. Operator : Next is Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Terence Flynn : I was just wondering on PAXLOVID, it looks like there's going to be some doses remaining on the current U.S. contract as we head into 2023. So just maybe, I know you talked about how COMIRNATY would work as we move to a commercial market. But maybe just help us think about how that will work here in the U.S. as we transition out of the pandemic here.  And the second question I had is just any more detail you can share on the Prevnar data in peds regarding the serotype coverage? I know that was a question that came out post the Phase III data. Albert Bourla : Very quickly on the PAXLOVID, it is not very different than what is happening with the vaccine. There will be a transition period. We will have to announce the list price, then we have to work with the U.S. government to transition so that when they stop distributing their, let's say, goods that they have, we will, let's say, start and we have a seamless transition. So the market will always become covered. But we will give more details given these dynamics, what happens and when this happens, the transition at next -- in the guidance for next year. Mikael, anything you have to say on the pediatrics? Mikael Dolsten : Just very brief that we have had positive studies in U.S. 3-plus-1 schedule, European Union 2-plus-1, after either 4 or 3 doses, which is the toddler complete schedule. We covered 20 serotypes in U.S. and 19 in the EU. But the totality of data across all endpoints, we believe, clearly speaks to that this is an important vaccine that adds coverage. And it's likely going to be the vaccine in the near term and for quite many years that have the broadest coverage. Operator : Next, we have Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. Chris Shibutani : In terms of RSV, if you could share some thoughts in terms of the velocity of the uptake that you're expecting? Is flu a good barometer? And how quickly do you think, if that's the case, that we could possibly reach through? And then with etrasimod, in the previous owner's hands, there were additional opportunities, I believe, Crohn's disease data, Phase II; atopic dermatitis, Phase III, were originally in the time lines for calendar 2022. Will we get some insights on that -- on those clinical programs? Albert Bourla : Yes. I will ask -- actually, for the clinical programs, William, to speak a little bit about that. William Pao : Yes. Sure. For etrasimod, we have nothing new to update at this time, Chris. Albert Bourla : All right. And then for RSV, I would say, clearly, we think that it could become like flu-like. I think all respiratory disease eventually will have coverage like we have right now in flu. The question is how often that will happen. And that will depend on several factors. Education, of course, of the people and their physicians, but also the availability of combination programs and products that could significantly bring all 3 of them together, RSV, COVID and flu. Operator : Next, we have Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Umer Raffat : I wanted to ask two questions on pricing today, if I may. Perhaps first one, Albert, I know the COVID vaccine repricing was a very bold decision. And I understand the dynamics around the value proposition, the pandemic versus endemic era pricing, et cetera. But I think the sheer magnitude of the increase is making a lot of investors ask questions around ESG implications, any political blowback, et cetera. I'm just curious how you guys thought about this very important decision and how you're thinking about the expectation on net pricing.  And then separately, on PAXLOVID. I know you're running a 10-day trial versus the 5-day course that's currently approved. Does that mean PAXLOVID will effectively become 2x the price once a 10-day course is approved? Albert Bourla : Yes. I can answer both of them. Look, I think what was very bold and the right absolutely decision was to price the PAXLOVID during the pandemic at a very, very, very low price. Clearly, the price that -- excuse me, the vaccine at a very, very low price. That was the right thing to do, and we did it and we maintained that for the years to come.  Now that we are coming to the end of this period and as we are moving to very different product, which has very different presentations, which are -- now we are moving to single instead of mass vial, multi-dose vial, we are pricing the vaccine according to the cost effectiveness. And the cost effectiveness of the current vaccine, the way that CDC is pricing it, is way, way, way below than what the price that we have set at $110 and $130. Also, keep in mind that people will not see any difference and the system will get the benefit of a cost-effective product. And the people wouldn't see any difference because there's no copay.  Now on the PAXLOVID, I think it's too early to speak. We haven't announced any price. And we do not know what will be the outcome of the studies or the outcome of a new class that is coming following PAXLOVID. Operator : Our last question will come from David Risinger with SVB Securities. David Risinger : So my two questions are regarding the core growth, which was 2% operationally in the third quarter, could you talk about what you're assuming and how we should think about growth prospects in the future, specifically in the fourth quarter since you've guided to that in your updated guidance? And then second, could you provide an update -- and I might have missed this, if I did, I apologize. But could you provide an update on your next-gen oral antiviral for COVID? Albert Bourla : Thank you. One, on the 2% operational, excluding COVID, just to make a clarification, if you exclude also the contract manufacturing business that we have that was really COVID-related, it has very increased revenues last year because we were contract manufacturing for BioNTech territories that we don't have to do now because BioNTech took over for their territories their own manufacturing. In fact, the growth was 4% of our pharmaceutical business, excluding COVID and excluding this piece of contract manufacturing. Now Angela, based on that, what will we expect to be the growth trajectory? Angela Hwang : Well, we've talked about our 5-year CAGR, right, to be 6%. And just I want to reiterate that, that is exactly the track that we're on. Every year does not necessarily have to look identical. But over the 5-year period, we're absolutely confident that we're going to deliver the 6% CAGR. Albert Bourla : All right. So thank you very much. So with that, I think we are close to bring our call to a close. Please don't forget to attend our event on December 12, where we will provide details about our very important new product launches in the next 18 months in some of our most important pipeline, potential new medicines and vaccines. Thank you for joining us today. Have a great rest of your day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's earnings call, and we appreciate your participation.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chris Stevo, Senior Vice President and Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Chris Stevo : Good morning. Welcome to Pfizer\u2019s fourth quarter earnings call. I\u2019m joined today by Dr. Albert Bourla, our Chairman and CEO; Dave Denton, our CFO; Dr. Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development and Medical. Joining for the Q&A session, we also have Angela Hwang, Chief Commercial Officer and President, Global Biopharmaceuticals Business; Aamir Malik, our Chief Business Innovation Officer; Dr. William Pao, our Chief Development Officer; and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel. Before we begin the call, I wanted to remind you of some of some logistical items. Materials for this call and other earnings related materials are on the Investor Relations section of pfizer.com. You see our forward-looking statements disclaimer on slide 3. Additional information regarding these statements and our non-GAAP financial measures is available in 10-K and 10-Q under Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Information and factors that may affect future results. Forward-looking statements on the call are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, speak only as of the call\u2019s original date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of the statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Albert. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Chris. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. During this morning\u2019s call, I will touch on some of our highlights from 2022, and share some thoughts regarding Pfizer\u2019s exciting near and long-term growth plans. 2022 was an outstanding year for Pfizer on multiple fronts. We exceeded $100 billion in revenues for the first time in our 174-year history. We maintained our industry-leading clinical success rates and further improved our cycle times, which already were among the industry\u2019s best. We were named to 10 different \u201cbest employer\u201d lists, including those published by Forbes, LinkedIn, Glassdoor and others. And most important, more than 1.3 billion patients around the world were treated with our medicines and vaccines. A truly humbling achievement. Our key growth drivers for the full year 2022 included : global sales of Paxlovid, strong growth for Comirnaty in developed markets, the launch of Prevnar 20 for the adult population in the U.S., the continued strong growth of Eliquis globally, the strength of our Vyndaqel family globally, and the addition of newly acquired products Nurtec ODT/Vydura and Oxbryta. Looking ahead, we foresee strong operational revenue growth of 7% to 9% in 2023, excluding revenues from our COVID-19 products and the impact of foreign exchange. We expect our potential new launches, newly acquired products and inline products will all contribute to this growth. These projections include our forecasts for several important potential product launches, including our RSV vaccine for older adults, potential Prevnar 20 pediatric indication, and products and candidates that came to us through recent business development activities, including etrasimod for ulcerative colitis, Nurtec and zavegepant for migraine, and Oxbryta for sickle cell disease. We\u2019re in the midst of an 18-month period during which we expect to have up to an unprecedented 19 new products or indications in the market. 15 of these 19 are from our internal pipeline, with the remaining 4 coming to Pfizer, as just explained, via the recent business development deals. Recognizing the importance of these potential launches, as well as those expected in 2024, to both Pfizer and the patients who rely on our innovations, we are increasing the support we are putting behind them by investing an incremental $1.3 billion in SI&A expenses in 2023. Dave will provide more details on these investments during the presentation. One example of a product that is already benefitting from this additional support is Cibinqo, which recently has seen an improving growth trajectory that we expect to continue through the course of 2023. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Cibinqo\u2019s new-to-brand prescriptions grew 84% sequentially, the fastest growth rate in the class. We have started 2023 with 55% commercial formulary access, and we expect that access to continue to improve during the year, especially with the upcoming expected expansion of the U.S. indication to include adolescents, 12 to 18 year-olds, if approved. We also introduced a new direct-to-consumer campaign in November, which has increased patient awareness of Cibinqo and led to more patients asking their doctors about it. We look forward to the expected U.S. launches of etrasimod in ulcerative colitis and ritlecitinib in alopecia areata, if approved, as well as the expected launch of Abrilada, our biosimilar to Humira, to further expand our franchise in immunology this year. However, we recognize that investors are not only interested to hear this year\u2019s guidance, but also to understand the long-term growth prospects of the Company. Particular questions are focused on our plans to offset the expected $17 billion impact of the LOEs between 2025 and 2030, and our long-term projections for our COVID-19 products. We will try to address both, starting with this slide regarding our business, excluding COVID. As you can see in this chart, we expect the 15 of the 19 potential launches that are coming from our internal pipeline to generate 2030 revenues that will more than offset the expected LOE losses forecast for 2025 to 2030. The potential $20 billion in this chart is a risk-adjusted number. I would also point out that some of the potential launches are expected to be bigger contributors to our growth than others. And if all 15 were to achieve their full potential, this figure could go even higher. In addition, we believe we have the ability, if successful, to add at least $25 billion of risk-adjusted revenues to our 2030 topline expectations through business-development activity. As we have said previously, we believe the deals we have already done for Arena, Biohaven, Global Blood Therapeutics and ReViral have the potential to get us more than 40% of the way there with approximately $10.5 billion in expected 2030 revenues. I am very pleased to see that the analysts\u2019 consensus expectations for the same revenues have already reached $9.5 billion, closing materially the gap that previously existed between internal and external expectations. Four of these products have already launched or are expected to launch, subject to regulatory approval, in 2023. We also have more than enough capital to invest in the additional opportunities needed to meet or exceed this target. And, of course, we have many more potential vaccines and medicines in our pipeline, with numerous launches expected in the 2024 to 2030 timeframe, if successful in clinical trials and approved. Some of the most promising assets include : our oral GLP-1 candidate for diabetes and obesity, all of them are under this dotted box, XB; potential combo vaccines for flu, COVID-19 and RSV; our potential vaccines for Lyme disease and shingles; multiple new oncology product candidates, including ARV-471 and our CDK4 inhibitor for endocrine receptor-positive breast cancer; our gene therapy candidates for hemophilia A, hemophilia B and Duchenne muscular dystrophy; our pan-hemophilia A&B antibody treatment; and many more. If approved, we expect each of these to be key incremental contributors to our growth aspirations through 2025 and beyond. Even without any of these additional potential products, we expect our 2025 to 2030 revenue CAGR to be approximately 6%. And if some of them are successful, the CAGR could exceed 10%. Now, let me turn my attention to our COVID-19 portfolio. At the JP Morgan Conference earlier this month, I spoke about expecting 2023 to be a transition year, representing a low point in our COVID-related revenues. Let me provide a little bit more color on that. I will start with Comirnaty in the U.S. as an example. In 2022, 31% of the population, or 104 million Americans, received on average 1.4 doses of COVID-19 vaccines for a total of 144 million doses. Comirnaty\u2019s share was 64%, or 92 of these 144 million doses, as you can see in the first column. In 2023, we expect about 24% of the population, or 79 million people, to receive vaccine doses for COVID during this year. This drop is due to expected fewer primary vaccinations and reduced compliance with recommendations. We expect they will receive about 1.3 doses per person on average in 2023. The drop is because fewer people are expected to receive their primary doses and, for the most part, only those who are older or at higher risk are expected to continue receiving more than one booster per year. This should result in about 102 million total vaccine doses administered in 2023. We believe Pfizer will maintain at least its 64% market share and therefore expect about 65 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to be administered in 2023. In 2024, we expect the utilization rates and market share figures to stabilize and come in roughly the same as in 2023. Then starting in 2025, and continuing in 2026 and beyond, we expect to see an increase in COVID-19 vaccination rates, assuming the successful development and approval of a COVID/flu combination product. A successful introduction of a COVID/flu combo could over time bring the percentage of Americans receiving the COVID-19 vaccine closer to the portion of people getting flu shots, which is currently about 50%. Outside the U.S., we expect these general trends to be similar with some variations from country to country. So, what does this mean for revenues? We expect 2023 to be a transition year in the U.S. In 2022, we sold at pandemic prices more doses than were eventually used. This resulted in a government inventory build that we expect to be absorbed some time in 2023, probably the second half. Around that time, we expect to start selling Comirnaty through commercial channels at commercial prices. We expect that in years 2024 and beyond, the doses sold and doses used in a year will more closely align together and the commercial price to remain relatively stable with only inflation-like price increases. Now, let me briefly urn through Paxlovid. In 2022, we estimate that 110 million COVID-19 symptomatic infections were reported in the world, excluding China. Approximately 12% of them were treated with approximately 14 million oral therapy courses and Paxlovid had the lion\u2019s share of them with approximately 90% market share. Average was 86%, but in the second half of the year exceeded the 90%. Keep in mind that this reflects a full year of reported infections, but only a partial year of Paxlovid availability due to supply constraints in the first quarter of 2022. In 2023 and beyond, we expect infections to increase slightly at 2% annually, due to waning immune protection of the population resulting from reduced vaccination rates. Similarly, we expect treatment rates to increase as awareness, education and additional oral entries will grow the oral antiviral market. Finally, we expect Paxlovid to maintain very high share despite additional competitive entries, given its strong benefit-risk profile and brand recognition. So, what does this mean for revenue? As with Comirnaty, we expect 2023 to be a transition year for Paxlovid as well. In 2022, we sold at Pandemic prices more treatment courses than were eventually used. This resulted in a government inventory build that we expect to be absorbed some time in 2023, probably second half. Around that time, we expect to start selling Paxlovid through the commercial channels at commercial prices. We expect in years 2024 and beyond that the courses sold and used will align closely together within every year. There has been a great deal of speculation regarding the new but uncertain market opportunity for Paxlovid in China, so let me share what we are seeing. We have an agreement with one company to import and distribute Paxlovid in China, local company, and we have a manufacturing agreement with another local Chinese company for local manufacturing. Pfizer shipped only tens of thousands of courses to China in fiscal year 2022. From December, which is the first month of our non-U.S. fiscal year, through March, we expect to ship millions of courses to meet local demand. We expect we will be able to sell effectively under government reimbursement through end of March. And despite China\u2019s recent decision not to include Paxlovid on the country\u2019s National Drug Reimbursement List, we expect to offer the product on the private market after April 1st unless, of course, a listing opportunity opens up before then. Lastly, I want to point out that while we are expecting increased utilization in all regions of the world as infections increase, we are not including any major new non-U.S. or non-China contracts in our 2023 forecasts. Let me close with a few thoughts regarding our scientific engine. R&D continues to be the lifeblood that fuels us as a company, which is why we plan to increase our R&D spend by at least 8.7% in 2023 to $12.4 billion and $13.4 billion range. In addition to the increased investments, we are taking steps not only to further improve our industry-leading success rates and cycle times, but also to increase overall return on investment and R&D productivity. As you have seen in the last year, we continuously prioritize our pipeline to focus on the assets that represent potential breakthroughs and have the potential for generating higher returns, putting more capital behind larger opportunities like GLP-1, flu, elranatamab, and others. We are at an inflection point to act from a position of strength with our best-in-class R&D productivity, a robust pipeline of innovative assets and one of the highest R&D budgets in the industry. With that, I will turn it over to Dave to provide details on our fourth-quarter performance and our outlook for 2023. After Dave, Mikael will provide an update on our R&D pipeline. Take it over, Dave. Dave Denton : Thank you, Albert, and good morning, everyone. Albert has already taken you through many of the key drivers of our full-year performance, so I will focus my opening remarks on some key highlights from the fourth quarter. Revenues grew 13% operationally, primarily driven by Comirnaty\u2019s strong growth in developed markets following the slowdown in deliveries that we discussed in the third quarter ahead of the rollout of the bivalent booster. We also saw very strong performances from Paxlovid outside the U.S. and the ongoing launch of Prevnar 20 for adults within the U.S. Excluding direct sales and alliance revenues related to our COVID-19 products, Pfizer\u2019s revenues grew 5% operationally in the quarter, and if recently acquired products from Biohaven and GBT are also excluded, revenues were up approximately 3% in Q4. Reported diluted EPS this quarter grew by 48% to $0.87, while adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.14 grew 69% on an operational basis in the quarter. Both EPS figures include a $0.32 benefit from lower acquired IPR&D expenses compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Once again in the quarter, foreign exchange movements significantly impacted our results, reducing fourth quarter revenues by approximately $2.5 billion, or 11%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.19, or 24%, compared to LY. On a full-year basis, foreign exchange negatively impacted revenues by $5.5 billion, or 7%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.36, or 9%. Turning now to 2023 and the financial outlook for the Company. Let me first point out that our approach to guidance in 2023 is fundamentally different than prior years. Given the expected transition to commercial markets for our COVID franchise, and away from an Advanced Purchase Agreement environment, our guidance reflects our best estimates for revenues and profits for these products for the full year, not just what has been contractually secured. On a total company basis, we expect revenues of between $67 billion to $71 billion, reflecting an operational decline of 31% at the midpoint. Importantly, we expect that revenues from our business excluding COVID will grow between 7% and 9% on an operational basis in 2023. That growth is projected to be split between contributions from our new product launches, our recently acquired products, as well as our in-line portfolio. The total company revenue declines are entirely driven by our COVID products, which are expected to go from their peak in 2022 to their low point in 2023 before potentially returning to growth in 2024 and beyond. While patient demand for our COVID products is expected to remain strong throughout 2023, much of that demand is expected to be fulfilled by products that were delivered to governments in 2022 and recorded as revenues last year. I want to point out that our total company revenue guidance range is wider than what is implied by the 7% to 9% operational growth rate range for the business excluding COVID. The wider guidance range reflects the potential volatility that we see in our COVID product revenues, given that they can be significantly impacted by factors outside of our control, such as the infection rates and the severity of the virus, as well as the timing for transitioning to a traditional commercial model here in the U.S. Now, you can see on this slide our cost and expense guidance for 2023. As I mentioned in my remarks at our investor event in December, both SI&A and R&D expenses are expected to be significantly higher in 2023 versus 2022, despite the fact that our overall revenues are coming down. Higher investments in SI&A are significantly focused on the successful launches of the large number of potential new products that Albert highlighted, as well as recently acquired assets. Additionally, the expected commercial launch of both Comirnaty and Paxlovid in the U.S. will require additional investments as we transition away from the government market. These investments are squarely focused on supporting the Company\u2019s 2025 to 2030 growth aspirations. We also intend to invest significantly into our research efforts this year, with multiple exciting and potentially high-value programs receiving additional funding, including our oral GLP-1 programs, elranatamab, and respiratory combination vaccines. All of this spending to support our commercial and research activities, we believe, will not only yield an attractive return, but will also contribute toward setting us on a path to achieve our long-term growth goals. I\u2019ll point out that when you exclude revenues and expenses related to COVID products, our expected operating margin profile this year is largely consistent with the prior year. This reflects incremental investments in SI&A related to launch products and R&D, as well as lower acquired IPR&D. In 2023, we are investing in both R&D and SI&A in advance of revenue contributions from new products. Looking longer-term, we expect this spending will be maintained, with the P&L growing into this cost base as new product revenues begin to be fully realized, with margins improving as a result. Given that 2023 is both a year of investment and transition, I thought it would be helpful to outline many of our key assumptions built into our guidance. I don\u2019t intend to walk you through all the elements here, but both slides 19 and 20 outline many of the details. In summary, these assumptions include : strong revenue growth of 7 to 9% in our business excluding COVID products; additional investments in SI&A and R&D to support Pfizer\u2019s near- and longer-term growth plans; continued patient demand for our COVID-related products worldwide, with vaccination rates declining slightly and utilization of treatments slightly increasing; rephasing of the European Commission Comirnaty contract over multiple years versus full delivery in 2023; and, finally, U.S. commercialization of the COVID products in the second half of 2023. In summary, as we enter a new year, our business is extremely strong, with many in-line, acquired and expected launch products capable of driving strong growth with an attractive pipeline of potential products coming in the future. We believe 2023 will be an important year for Pfizer, and that is why we are deploying our resources into quality execution in order to fully realize the growth opportunities we see within our portfolio and pipeline, which have the potential to impact our growth outlook through 2030 and beyond. So, with that, let me turn it over to Mikael. Dr. Mikael Dolsten : Thank you, Dave. Today, I want to set the stage for an anticipated catalyst-rich 18 months. As Albert mentioned, we are in a position of unprecedented strength in our history and I\u2019m excited to share a high-level overview of an evolved strategy for Pfizer R&D to focus our resources on transformative programs which could be most impactful for patients, drive improved return on R&D investment and create the most value. We will leverage and continue to innovate our powerhouse capabilities in medicine design, and continue to innovate light-speed drug development to further improve our industry-leading success rates and cycle times. We have rethought our approach to rare disease and will move from having a standalone research unit to aligning key programs with other therapeutic areas. We plan to externally advance rare disease programs that do not fit into a core therapeutic area of focus. At the same time, we plan to tap into the expanding external innovation ecosystem by actively pursuing biotech innovation and emerging innovation that fits strategically and accessing external assets that are differentiated. Taken together we believe these actions will help position us to lead the industry in reaching more patients with the most impactful near-term blockbuster breakthroughs while driving forward the next wave of innovations. I\u2019m pleased to share some examples with you today. We are pursuing potentially transformative efficacy in our inflammation & immunology franchise, with the potential launches of etrasimod in ulcerative colitis and ritlecitinib in alopecia areata, which both have the potential to be blockbusters, and a planned Phase 3 study start of anti-interferon Beta in dermatomyositis and other idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. Our next wave of innovation includes two monoclonal antibody candidates for atopic dermatitis which exemplify our multispecific platform and in-house biomedicine design expertise. Two assets currently in Phase 1 clinical trials each target three cytokines in a single therapeutic, so we refer to them as trispecifics. On the right are Phase 1 pharmacokinetic profiles of the average plasma concentration. For both molecules, the profiles suggest that once-a-month, or even less frequent, subcutaneous dosing may be supported. There is potential for improved efficacy with more potent interleukin 4 and interleukin 13 neutralization plus an expanded breadth of efficacy by blocking Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin to potentially cover more endotypes, or by blocking interleukin 33 (sic) [interleukin 33] to potentially enhance itch reduction. The Phase 1 studies continue. We aim to bolster our 30-year experience in hematology with a strong pipeline that complements our in-line portfolio and collectively has blockbuster potential. I will talk more about elranatamab and GBT-601 in a moment, so will highlight here that we expect multiple data readouts for TTI-622 in hematological malignancies, two Phase 3 readouts for inclacumab in sickle cell disease in the second half of 2024 and a Phase 3 readout for marstacimab in patients with hemophilia A or B in the second quarter of 2023. Marstacimab has FDA Fast Track designation for both, hemophilia A and B with inhibitors. If successful, we project submitting for the non-inhibitor indication in both A and B hemophilia in the third quarter of 2023. We recently announced positive top-line results from a Phase 3 study of our hemophilia B gene therapy candidate and expect a pivotal readout for our hemophilia A gene therapy in the first half of 2024. We recently presented strong updated Phase 2 data on elranatamab, our investigational B-cell maturation antigen, or BCMA, CD3-targeted bispecific antibody, for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in heavily pre-treated patients who had received at least three classes of prior therapies. This candidate, which has the potential to be a leader in the BCMA bi-specific class, demonstrated a high objective response rate of 61% in patients with no prior BCMA-targeted treatment, early and deep responses, and a manageable safety profile. Given factors currently limiting the availability of novel therapies in the triple-class exposed setting, elranatamab has the potential to reach a broader and greater number of patients as an off-the-shelf option with reduced dosing frequency that is administered subcutaneously, offering more convenience than intravenous administration. With FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation granted last year, elranatamab could potentially be approved this year. As there is blockbuster potential and patient value beyond the triple-class refractory population, our clinical strategy aims to move to earlier lines of therapy and combination approaches with the potential, if successful, for multiple approvals to expand eligibility and duration of therapy. Now, to our next generation oral, once-daily, hemoglobin S polymerization inhibitor candidate that\u2019s in a unique class and has the potential to expand the prophylactic treatment of people with sickle cell disease. Standard-of-care treatment rates have typically been low due to side effects, poor efficacy, or both. While Oxbryta made substantial progress in preventing hemoglobin polymerization, or sickling, GBT-601 is a potentially best-in-class candidate which may improve both hemolysis and frequency of vaso-occlusive crises. The most recent data from our Phase 1 multiple ascending dose study showed improvements in hematocrit and hemoglobin levels over time, mean hemoglobin occupancy of more than 32% for the 100 milligram maintenance dose and more than 41% for the 150 milligram maintenance dose, and improvements in red blood cell health with the higher maintenance doses. The maintenance doses were well tolerated. We believe these results may be transformative for patients, with a potential to achieve 35% to 45% hemoglobin occupancy, which is considered optimal for both hemoglobin oxygen affinity and preventing sickling, and approaches levels seen with gene therapies. This asset is also being studied in an ongoing Phase 2 study with a seamless Phase 2/3 design. We plan to start the Phase 3 part in the second half of 2023. Next, we aim to expand our leadership in breast cancer with a pipeline of complementary next-wave candidates. Our CDK4 inhibitor targets improving on CDK4/6 inhibition standard of care by maximizing CDK4 coverage. We are studying it in Phase 1 in hormone receptor positive/HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer as a single agent and in combination with endocrine therapy. The majority of hormone receptor positive breast cancers express low CDK6, while CDK4 is likely to be a major cell cycle driver. We have seen that CDK4/6 inhibition can lead to neutropenia that requires more frequent blood test monitoring, mostly driven by CDK6 inhibition, and that complete CDK4 inhibition by CDK4/6 inhibitors is challenging due to dose-limiting hematological adverse events. In the Phase 1 combination study, the confirmed objective response rate in combination with fulvestrant or letrozole reached nearly 30% and the clinical benefit rate was approximately 50% in 21 patients with measurable disease. The median progression-free survival was more than 24 weeks in 26 patients including 5 without measurable disease. All participants were heavily pre-treated with a median of four lines of prior treatment. All patients received prior CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment and 67% received prior fulvestrant. The asset was well tolerated with CDK4 drug showing only 15% Grade 3 neutropenia and no Grade 4. Here, we show a scan of a patient who achieved partial response and was on treatment for 47 weeks. She had received six lines of prior treatment, including CDK4/6 inhibition and fulvestrant. We are currently engaged in dose optimization, enrolling CDK4/6-na\u00efve cohorts, and planning to start a randomized study in second-line treatment of estrogen receptor positive/HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer this year. Additional data readouts from our next wave of breast cancer candidates are anticipated in the first half of 2023. In addition to the assets I spoke about today, we anticipate multiple milestones over the next 18 months. We expect a pivotal IBRANCE readout in hormone receptor positive/HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer, a pivotal study start for ARV-471 and a Phase 2 readout for our KAT6 inhibitor. We have achieved incredible advancement in our vaccines portfolio, including candidates that harness our leadership in mRNA, with an unprecedented number of milestones expected. In addition to the expected launches shown here, we expect a Phase 3 data readout from our modRNA flu candidate vaccine, and a potential respiratory combination vaccine study start. A Phase 1/2 study of our shingles candidate, the first mRNA-based shingles vaccine program, began last week. In inflammation & immunology as well as internal medicine, key catalysts include potential launches of potential blockbusters, a planned pivotal study start with anti-interferon Beta and data readouts in metabolic disease. We\u2019re also making good progress in our anti-infectives portfolio, including anticipating full approval for Paxlovid, and planned study starts for both our second-generation COVID-19 antiviral candidate, which may have no or limited drug-drug interactions, and our RSV antiviral candidate. In closing, we are very optimistic about the many transformative catalysts emerging from the pipeline. Pfizer scientists are working with urgency and commitment to help the most patients as quickly as we can. Thank you. Let me turn it over to Chris to start the Q&A session. Chris Stevo : Thank you, Mikael. Chelsea, why don\u2019t you poll for questions, please? We\u2019ll take as many questions as time permits and Investor Relations will be available after the call to answer any detailed questions that we\u2019re not able to address on the call itself. Operator : Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Louise Chen with Cantor. Louise Chen : So first question I have for you is due expect your COVID/flu combo to be on an mRNA platform? And then, I wanted to ask you on this RSV vaccine, there\u2019s a few players in the space. And just wondering if you think anybody could potentially get a preferential recommendation from ACIP or is that really hard to achieve? And the last question is on your trispecific monoclonal antibodies. Is atopic dermatitis still a key focus for you? And if so, are you moving the focus to this monoclonal antibody, or are you still focused on etrasimod for atopic dermatitis and also you had an oral PD -- sorry, a topical PDE4 that was in development? Thank you. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Louise. Clearly, for the ACIP, will depend on the data and it\u2019s difficult now to say if preferential could be achieved or not. But for both questions, COVID/flu is mRNA, RSV is not, Mikael, and then also what about the trispecific antibodies? Dr. Mikael Dolsten : So, as Albert spoke about Cibinqo\u2019s expansion, we think there\u2019s room for many opportunities in atopic dermatitis. We wanted to highlight this as a really novel pioneering approach to go beyond the current antibodies in atopic dermatitis with potentially many other allergic diseases. But there is room for several products in our pipeline in both oral and topical segment, as you mentioned. So, this is an area, I think, we will excel in. Dr. Albert Bourla : And what about COVID/flu that is mRNA and RSV that it is not mRNA? How do you think about it? Dr. Mikael Dolsten : Well, I think it actually offers an opportunity when you have the breadth to have a pipeline with different platforms. We think that the COVID/flu, which contains six components, and we have made a real good progress in enrolling the study in which start to share data in the near future has, by itself, of course, a Fast Track forward pending data. But for the use of a potential triple vaccine, rather than adding up more and more mRNA with the current technology that we have seen can lead to ritlecitinib limitation and less tolerability, we think this flexibility to add on a protein may give you the perfect balance between efficacy and tolerability. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael. And also to -- as you know, we are mastering multiple technologies in vaccine. So, we are using fit for purpose here. Every time we feel that the technology is appropriate for the problem we\u2019re trying to solve, we apply this technology. Flu and COVID, they are -- speed is of essence because there are variants that are coming. So mRNA is ideal position to address this challenge. With RSV, the virus is not changing that often. So, a protein approach that has a brilliant tolerability profile, almost like -- when we saw the data, the responses of the vaccine arm compared to the placebo arm were very difficult to separate, with very, very high efficacy in our case. I think it\u2019s the best way to move forward. That\u2019s the benefit having multiple approaches and multiple technologies. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question will come from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Terence Flynn : Maybe two-part for me. I was just wondering if you can provide any more details on European vaccine -- the European vaccine contracts that were extended. Just wondering if you were able to secure a higher average price, given some of the headlines in the press earlier this week. And then, latest thinking on Paxlovid commercial pricing in the U.S. as well, was wondering if you could weigh in on that. And then the second question relates to economics with BioNTech on a combo vaccine. Just wondering how that will work in the event that you do go forward with a combined COVID and seasonal flu messenger RNA vaccine. Thank you. Dr. Albert Bourla : I\u2019ll take the last one and then Angela will answer the European vaccine and the Paxlovid. As you know, the flu vaccine that we are developing, BioNTech also have an economic position into it. And of course, the COVID vaccine, it is a vaccine that we are sharing with them. So, we are not ready to make any comments regarding the economics about the potential COVID and flu vaccine. Angela, what about the European situation and Paxlovid pricing? Angela Hwang : So, for Comirnaty in Europe, as you know, this was a multiyear contract that we entered into with the Commission and the member states. And so I think the pricing there is what it is for the contract. And we\u2019re in discussions with the European Commission regarding \u201823 and what the deliveries will look like. Specifically for Pax, I think that was your next question, that is going commercial only later in this year. So, we are now preparing what those pricing scenarios could look like, and we\u2019ll share more at the right time. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Angela. And also to repeat, I think David has mentioned it already that in our guidance for this year, we factor only a portion of the European contract. So, we spread the volumes into multiple years, although no agreement has been reached yet. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question will come from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist. Robyn Karnauskas : So just to drill down a little bit on Paxlovid. It looks like a IQVIA numbers are implying about 9.3 million versus say the 12 million that you mentioned for 2022. So, I was wondering if you think about the split going forward ex U.S., could it be somewhat similar? Do you think it\u2019ll be more skewed, be more even to the U.S. and ex U.S.? And then my second question is, it also could imply that about half of your 20 million contracts were used in 2022. So, how do you think about -- could it be very minimal revenue as you draw down that Paxlovid and will that go into a stockpile? Thanks. Dr. Albert Bourla : Angela? Angela Hwang : Well, let\u2019s start with the U.S. Paxlovid. So, in 2022, when we launched Paxlovid, we -- the first quarter of Paxlovid, the first quarter post launch, we did not really have sufficient supply because we were still ramping up. So, the total number of doses that were used in the U.S. for Paxlovid is actually less than the demand. So, that\u2019s why you see -- we used about 8.6 million, 8.9 million doses in the U.S. when actually demand was much more than that. Then you asked a question about IQVIA, the difference. As you know, IQVIA doesn\u2019t capture all the channels, so you\u2019re not going to see an exact match. But I think that in general for 2023, the number of doses that you will see for the U.S. and for ex U.S. is just going to be a function of the contracts that were made, the deliveries that we have to make in each of the countries and also the timing of the commercialization. And it just looks different in every single country. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Angela. And also to emphasize that the 12 million, calculation is a global number, not a U.S. number. It\u2019s a global number. So, I believe the 9 million of IQVIA is approximately in the U.S. And -- but I don\u2019t know if they have also estimations for outside the U.S. So, next question, please. I\u2019m sorry for the -- it\u2019s a global number, excluding China, well that I mentioned. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question will come from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Geoff Meacham : Just have two. The first one is on COVID. When you look at the 2023 demand and beyond really for both products, I guess, I\u2019m trying to better understand the volume side of the equation. Are you guys baking in the emergence of, say, a new variant or maybe a change in behavior towards boosters? That\u2019s the first question. The second one is, from a BD perspective, Albert, you have a lot of cash to deploy. If your COVID assumptions don\u2019t quite play out, does that inform the number of deals or the size of deals? I guess, I\u2019m trying to get a view about where BD fits in your strategic priorities. Thank you. Dr. Albert Bourla : Of course. First, what is the assumption about the disease because that\u2019s a fundamental assumption behind all these projections that we are doing. It is that the disease will continue in the foreseeable future, manifesting clinically the same way that it has the last 6 to 9 months. So there will be mutations and there will be infections over there. And -- but the vaccination rates will be coming down because of lack of compliance but will stabilize to a certain degree of people, but they believe in vaccinations and they feel they are at high risk and they want to make their vaccines. At the same time, the infections were slightly going up because when you have waning immune protection for the population, then you will see more infections are actually more severe infections. So, these are the assumptions that we are using. We are not using assumptions that all the variants will have -- will escape in the protection of the vaccine. But we are using the assumptions that people will be getting 1.3 in the beginning and then going down 1.1, 1.2 doses per year as a normal booster. What was the second question? On the BD, yes, clearly, business development is, by far, one of our biggest priorities, something that I personally take care of and something that we have a very big team screening all the opportunities. I would like to ask Aamir, who is responsible for that area, to make some comments about our priorities. Aamir Malik : So, Geoff, specifically to your question, you heard Albert described, we set this aspiration goal of $25 billion in 2030 from BD. We\u2019re over 40% of the way there with approximately $10.5 billion of that number through the deals that we\u2019ve done. And we feel very confident that we\u2019ve got the financial flexibility on the balance sheet and the firepower to complete what we need to, to achieve that goal. And we\u2019re going to continue to be disciplined about how we pursue that. Dr. Albert Bourla : I think we can move to the next question. Operator : Our next question will come from Steve Scala with Cowen. Steve Scala : Thank you. I have a couple of questions. On page 4 of the release, Pfizer reiterated that non-COVID revenue growth in 2023 will be 7% to 9% and anticipates it will be split between launch, acquired and in-line products. That implies about $3.5 billion in incremental revenue growth. But in 2022, Prevnar alone grew $1 billion, and Eliquis and Vyndaqel together added another $1 billion. So with the launch in acquired products growing well, what does this guidance imply for the base business in 2023? It seems like a substantial slowdown is implied in the base business in the current year. Second question, has Pfizer learned anything from the Zeposia performance to date that would either increase or decrease its confidence in etrasimod? Thank you very much. Dr. Albert Bourla : I would say, Dave, do you want to say how is allocated the growth between in-line, new products and acquired products? Dave Denton : Yes, a really good question. I think if you look at each one -- each of those 3 buckets, we see growth from acquired products, we see acquired from new products and importantly, we see growth in our in-line portfolio as well. We do not anticipate nor do we see a slowdown in that perspective. Dr. Albert Bourla : It\u2019s approximately 1/3, 1/3, 1/3. And Angela, what about etrasimod? Angela Hwang : I think we\u2019re really excited about etrasimod as a new entry you see. It\u2019s a market that has been heavily dominated by biologics and then followed by of these JAKs after the biologics. But really, in the earlier treatment positions, there really hasn\u2019t been much innovation, and that\u2019s where we see etrasimod fitting in. I think the safety profile of etrasimod and its efficacy allows it to be used very well as an agent prior to the use of biologics. And that\u2019s where we see the ability to tap into a new segment and to grow. Dr. Albert Bourla : And because I\u2019m very excited about the product, William, would you like also to add something about it? Dr. William Pao : Yes. I would just say we\u2019re excited about the best-in-class profile with the study that we did, had a treat-through design. We hope and anticipate that we\u2019ll have no black-box warning. We don\u2019t anticipate any required for titration, the once-oral dosing, 100% of our patients were in complete remission after a year and that we\u2019re in complete remission after one year with steroid-free. And we also have quick lymphocyte recovery after discontinuation. So, we feel all of these features potentially make etrasimod a best-in-class profile. Dr. Albert Bourla : Sure. That\u2019s exactly the point. Best-in-class in an area that it is poorly served right now with current solutions, so we see a lot of opportunity. Let\u2019s go to the next question, please. Operator : Our next question will come from Colin Bristow with UBS. Colin Bristow : I guess, first question on COVID and to sort of piggyback on what Geoff was asking. Some of your slides and comments, you\u2019re clearly expecting a sort of stable vaccine utilization rate, when in the last 12 months we\u2019ve seen this number decline on a backdrop of a virus that is evolving to less clinically severe variants. And so, what underpins your confidence in these longer-term assumptions? And then also in terms of your COVID \u201823 guidance, you mentioned you\u2019d guided to a sufficient range of variations in infection rates, et cetera. I was just wondering how much an allowance you\u2019ve made for the potential timing or reduction in contractual orders that is the current situation with the Brussels negotiation? And then, maybe just a quick one on the pipeline DMD, this feels noticeably in the background versus other assets at the similar stage. Just, could you update us on your level of enthusiasm and commitment to this program, especially in light of the potential competitor approval in May of this year? Thanks so much. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you. DMD, Mikael? Dr. Mikael Dolsten : We continue to be enthusiastic about gene therapy in DMD. I think we have actually published the strongest data on the two drugs with efficacy as well as a lot of biomarkers from our Phase 1 across a much broader age group than anyone else. And I can\u2019t comment when possibly someone else will get it registered. But, we expect data readouts within possibly less than a year. And we think that this could be a very important drug. And we will have randomized data, which is not the case for any other application currently to have at that size and scope. Dr. Albert Bourla : As regards the assumptions of our COVID protection vaccines, for example, we are dropping the numbers. So for example, 31% of people receiving a vaccine, that was the actual in \u201822. We are going to \u201824. Then you are reaching a level of really people that they are really committed to the idea of getting vaccinations and they are looked by physicians that don\u2019t really believe in the vaccination, the value of vaccinations. We are also dropping the number of doses there. So, we\u2019ll go to 1.3. And then eventually, as the years progress, the number of doses that people will receive is small. Keep in mind that to get numbers like 1.2, you need a very, very small percent of population 2 doses, so that you can achieve something like that. Maybe 5% of the population to get a second dose, and then you will go to these numbers, as you will see, if you include also primary doses and children. So, we believe the assumptions are very reasonable with the expectations that COVID will remain as it is right now, so nothing more severe and nothing that will make it less disappearing and we take into consideration that the compliance with the recommendation of the health authorities also because of the fact, will be less. Clearly, pivotal moment will be the introduction of combination vaccines because the convenience of something like that and the fact that people are presenting themselves to receive flu vaccines, given that a combo vaccine would be in the same injection and will cost zero co-pay, likely will become the choice of many to get this full coverage. So, we have quite confidence on these assumptions. And of course, there are only assumptions. We need to wait and see. The other thing, it is -- on the Europe, you asked a few questions. I know that there are rumors, but I don\u2019t think that it is appropriate for us to make any comments while we are in negotiation with our partners in Commission and with the member states. So, we only said that we factor on part of the deliveries in this year instead of all the deliveries because we are in the middle of negotiations, but we can\u2019t make other comments. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question will come from Trung Huynh with Credit Suisse. Trung Huynh : Hi, guys. Good morning. It\u2019s Trung Huynh from Credit Suisse. I have a quick clarification on COVID and then my question. So just on the clarification in those long-term COVID vaccine and Pax slides. Do you expect any U.S. government sales in \u201824 and \u201826? It just looks like commercial sales on your slides. So, does that mean Medicaid, Medicare populations are bought at a commercial price? And can you comment on the margin change for the vaccine and Pax as you step up to that commercial price? And secondly, just following on from the base business question from Steve, we saw lower revenues ex U.S. for some important base business drugs. So, Eliquis was down 19% ex U.S., IBRANCE minus 22% ex U.S., Prevnar, there was also a decline there. You\u2019ve noted some product-product related issues. But are you seeing anything more broadly in the U.S., which is making it for a more difficult environment? And going forward, should we expect more normal levels ex U.S. for these products? Dr. Albert Bourla : A quick one because that\u2019s easy, we do not expect \u201824 and \u201825 and beyond to have governmental sales in the U.S. In fact, we think that not even this year, other than some small deliveries that we have still pending with the U.S. government from the -- before, we will not see any U.S. purchases. That\u2019s our assumption right now that we will move into a commercial model that will cover all channels as with all other vaccines and products. Margin changes, we haven\u2019t said anything yet about Paxlovid. So, I can\u2019t comment, if you can calculate. We set there is price, you can calculate the net and then you can make your assumptions on margins. We don\u2019t give margins on specific products. Now, a little bit on the lower revenues -- about the revenues ex U.S. Angela, do you want to make any comment on that? Angela Hwang : Sure. As you said, there were some specific reasons for why we saw what we saw for Eliquis, IBRANCE, PCV. I mean, Eliquis specifically was the loss of exclusivity and our patent challenges that led to some generic increase at risk in both the U.K. and Netherlands. I mean, IBRANCE is a mature product. And so, it goes through sort of the reimbursement and the sort of the pricing regulation that it typically goes through in Europe. And I think PCV in general, what we\u2019re seeing is that, at least on the kid side, not on the adult side, but on the kid side, vaccinations are still -- are not back up to where they are where it was prior to the pandemic. So, I think in all three cases, there were very specific reasons for what you saw. And we don\u2019t anticipate anything extraordinary or different in 2023. I think it\u2019s sort of business as usual. Operator : Next question will come from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Tim Anderson : Thank you. I think one of the challenges for analysts modeling Pfizer is to try to understand what the flow-through to profitability is from Paxlovid and Comirnaty. So, I\u2019m hoping directionally, you can tell us how that looks going forward once you get past this transitional year of \u201823. So, in \u201824 and beyond, is the profitability of that combined franchise likely to be higher, less or the same as what it was in 2021 and 2022? And then, a second question is on SG&A. How much of that increase was driven by inflation in 2023? And just any quick comments on your European austerity measures on pricing. Dr. Albert Bourla : Dave? Dave Denton : Yes. So on -- maybe on the COVID franchise, obviously, we don\u2019t give profitability for each product. But you can imagine, as we stated before, on the vaccine, we split our gross margin with BioNTech. So therefore, that would obviously carry a lower profitability mix compared to a typical product. And Paxlovid is probably the opposite in the sense that we share that -- the economics of that fully. So, that\u2019s probably a bit on the larger -- higher margin side in general. Dr. Albert Bourla : You can predict that, for example, in the first years, \u201821, \u201822 had very high R&D expenses also. We maintain our R&D expense to COVID. Very big part of our expenses in \u201823 is for COVID because we are investing. But you expect over time, those unless if we bring new products that will not be as high as. On the contrary, prices are going up, but margins could improve but also SI&A, promotion expenses are going up, right? So, without wanting to give direction from what it used to be \u201821, \u201822, we expect going forward to be higher, the margins. But all of these equations will be in play. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question will come from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Mohit Bansal : Maybe one question, if I can ask. So regarding the expenses for COVID business, Dave, you mentioned that you will be essentially relaunching these products with the commercial scale and everything. So is there -- so how much cost, given that your COVID business is declining significantly this year? Are you modeling any kind of cost cuts in that business or should more -- or dollar basis are still the same? And is there any synergies you can achieve, especially for vaccine with your existing Prevnar business because the channels are similar or not? And last part is, do you think you can do more share buybacks, given the stock price at this point? Thank you. Dr. Albert Bourla : Let me take the first two quickly. Of course, as you saw, the business is going down because of COVID, the average is growing. Expenses are going up because we are promoting new launches, including COVID. So right now, moving into Comirnaty in commercial and Paxlovid with commercial channels, now we treat them like normal promotional products, very sensitive in promotions at the beginning of their launch. So, we are going very hard with promotions, TV, field forces and all the other educational measures that we are taking when we do this type of launch. So there is -- clearly this speaks. What about, David, are we going to buy back? Dave Denton : I think as we look at capital allocation at this point in time, we actually see a lot of opportunities to invest back into our business, both from a research perspective and importantly, getting behind our launches to make sure that we\u2019re doing all that we can to ensure that our growth trajectory in \u201825 and \u201830 and those goals and aspirations become reality. So, I think our best and highest use of capital right now is investing in our business, both internally as well as from a BD perspective. I would say never say never to an incremental share repurchase, but that\u2019s not high on the priority list at this point. Dr. Albert Bourla : And Mohit also, you asked also about the synergies. Clearly, there are a lot of synergies right now both. In the Paxlovid -- Paxlovid is covered by a lot of physicians, and we have very, very strong primary care field force and we have very strong also vaccines field force that is covering all these physicians that we have, either vaccinate or prescribing Paxlovid. So, clearly, a lot of synergies in retail and in the medical profession also. Let\u2019s go to the next call, please. Operator : From Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Chris Schott : Just building on some of the OpEx discussion here. I just want to make sure I\u2019m understanding the OpEx dynamic is properly over time. So, I guess, should we think about 2023 as more of a onetime step-up in OpEx and then much slower growth in \u201824 and beyond? Or should we be thinking about this a couple of year process as you really get the pipeline and new products ramped, and then it\u2019s maybe more second half of the decade before we think even about margin -- bigger margin expansion or is that OpEx slowing? I just want to make sure I\u2019m understanding those dynamics properly. And then the second one was on the COVID/flu combination. I guess, is your expectation that the tolerability of that will be similar to what we see with Comirnaty, or is there some trade-off of we could see maybe slightly higher kind of side effects for the six components you mentioned but that\u2019s offset by the convenience? I\u2019m just trying to make sure I understand what your expectations are for that program. Thanks so much. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much, Chris. To this scientific question to Mikael, first. Dr. Mikael Dolsten : Yes. We think that the tolerability will be well on par with vaccines used in the target population and be perceived as tolerable and convenient. As you described, the combination will attract the high volume of flu people to also be able in shot to renew the COVID coverage, particularly with more and more variants coming. So we\u2019re very positive and think we\u2019re right in the balance of those and opportunity there. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you. And, of course, Dave will say, but right now, this is the profile that we are targeting. And we think it\u2019s easy to do it with two viruses, so to load enough so that we have very good efficacy and good tolerability profile. We believe it will be more challenging, but of course, needs to be seen. And that\u2019s why we believe that our RSV -- protein and having such a good tolerability profile offers better combination of a triplet than triplet all with mRNA. Dave, also there was this question that I think you touched upon it earlier in your script about how we see going forward, the expenses of SI&A. Dave Denton : Yes. So importantly, 2023, we\u2019re seeing a step-up in SI&A and it\u2019s really, again, investments around the launches and the products that have been acquired, which we think are really important to really drive growth in the back half of the decade. So, we\u2019re already focused on that. We do think \u201823 is probably the big year of step-up from expenses. And then post \u201823, those expenses will grow more moderately after that. Operator : Our next question will come from David Risinger with SVB Securities. David Risinger : Yes. Thanks very much. Thanks for all of the additional details that you\u2019re providing. So, it seems like the 2023 guidance is conservative, which is encouraging. But looking to Paxlovid longer term on slide 11, I guess I\u2019m surprised that the percentage of symptomatic patients that you expect to be treated with an oral therapy would almost double from 12% to 22% between \u201822 and \u201826, even though the pandemic is being viewed as being over. So, I\u2019m hoping that you could talk a little bit about those assumptions and what the denominator is. So, when you say symptomatic patients, is that high-risk/elderly that you\u2019re calculating the 12% on going to \u201822, et cetera? And then, in terms of the Paxlovid share, it was approaching 91% at the year-end of \u201822, according to this slide but only declining to 80% in \u201826 when there are several companies, both large and small, ranging from Gilead to smaller companies that are planning to develop agents to compete aggressively and that could have implications for both, volume and pricing longer term. So wanted to understand that. Dr. Albert Bourla : David, very good questions. Let me try to explain a little bit. First of all, it\u2019s not 12% going to 22%. It\u2019s really 17% going to 22%, right? The 12% which is in \u201822,it is a partial year, so it didn\u2019t include the full year. The real demand, it is, let\u2019s say, \u201823 full year, it is 17%. And it\u2019s going up because of two factors : one, it is a small increase in infections. And as I explained, the assumption is that COVID will not disappear, will be there. But vaccine rates, vaccinations are going down. So that will create -- will wane the protection -- the protection of the population. And that will manifest with a small increase, which you factor, 2% based on our modeling, a small increase of both the infections and eventually also the severity. So, that\u2019s one. So, the second is that the more introductions of new entries rightly will not happen before \u201825 -- \u201824, \u201825 in the U.S. at least. Will depend if EUA will still be available, which will depend if we will be in a state of emergency or not for EUA. But if we will not be in a state of emergency, which could be like a scenario, there will be no EUAs, we don\u2019t see, in \u201824, any introduction, actually we see in \u201825 the introductions. The introductions though, also, as always, are increasing the overall cost. So, fact, it\u2019s what also is driving. We are dropping markets share but we are increasing the volume. The last is are we dropping the market share aggressively enough or are we, let\u2019s say, very optimistic in dropping. The assumption here it is that we are the only one, we have right now for years presence in the market with a label that is extremely strong with 86% clinical efficacy against hospitalization and against deaths -- high action against deaths. So, it\u2019s very difficult for anyone to reproduce this data right now, The studies will run forever likely and will be very large. So, very, very difficult to reproduce something like that. So as a result, given that for years, we will be among -- we will be basically the lion market share, plus the excellent profile, the loyalty that will be developed. All of that are telling us that it is very reasonable with -- to maintain very high market share, you can see that in first-in-class and it\u2019s in every treatment, from cancer to that compared to the second and third, it\u2019s easy to maintain 60%, 70% of the relevant conditions. Now that we have all these advantages, we think maintaining at 70%, 75%, I think, is reasonable. Of course, we\u2019ll have to see. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question will come from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. Chris Shibutani : Two questions, one on Paxlovid cross-currents there between China in terms of the million doses that you described for your first fiscal quarter and a potential transition into a private market in China, and then, U.S. where a similar transition will occur to the commercial. Can you help at all frame what you think the relative contributions could look like in \u201823 and how that could progress? And then in particular for the COVID franchise products, can you share any early color on the discussions or engagement that you\u2019re having with payers? What kind of dynamics? Any color there would be helpful, particularly in the broader context of a global pharmaceutical opportunity with many different therapeutics that will be on their list of budget items, obesity, Alzheimer\u2019s, et cetera. So, any color on the discussions with payers would be helpful. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Angela? Angela Hwang : So I think for Paxlovid, again, the time period, the way to think about it is in two time periods from now until April, which is a reimbursed market, which gives us access to both public as well as private channels, and then after April, private channels only. As you heard, we have included in sour guidance what we believe we can do in the first three months of this year. But given the fact that the back half of the year, we will -- it\u2019s going to be highly uncertain. It will be a very dynamic market. We\u2019ll continue to make sure that we have supply, but we\u2019ll have to just wait and see what happens there. On the side of U.S., similarly, we will be transitioning this year. We will have a year where some of the revenue will be made through the completion of contracts that we made with the U.S. government in 2022. And then part of the year, the revenues will come from the commercialization of Paxlovid. So, you\u2019re going to see that play through -- both of those dynamics play through. And then I think you had one more question. Dr. Albert Bourla : Yes, the payers -- what is the reaction with the vaccine or... Angela Hwang : Yes. So it\u2019s still early days, especially in the U.S., right, because that\u2019s only happening middle of the year. But what I can say is that we have had some early discussions already with agencies and reimbursement agencies outside of the U.S. who have given us, I guess, earlier feedback. And even if you take a country like the U.K., we actually had very favorable feedback on the pricing that we provided, and they agreed with the cost effectiveness of our Paxlovid. So I think we\u2019ll -- obviously, that\u2019s good feedback, and we\u2019ll be taking those learnings and those value arguments to multiple countries around the world. Operator : Our next question will come from Carter Gould with Barclays. Carter Gould : Thanks for taking the questions. And David, thank you for all the transparency on the underlying assumptions. I guess, two for me. First off, just in terms of the upcoming, I guess, messaging around the end of the public health emergency. Can you talk about the potential impact you see on your EUAs, access as well, specifically thinking about Paxlovid populations in this period before we switch to a commercial market where you\u2019re still -- the government is still, I guess, working through the inventory they have in hand? And then, going to the COVID/flu combination, just trying to better understand some of your assumptions here. Because I guess when we think about that \u201826 40% adoption number, -- it\u2019s some -- I guess, either the incremental bump from \u201824, 15% or the 40% absolute, just kind of what that implies about how you think the underlying flu market will change. I guess, that complies 30% to 80% share within two years, but just wanted to understand kind of the underlying drivers there and how you think about that market evolving. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Maybe I try myself quickly because we\u2019re running out of time. If there is an end of emergency, we don\u2019t think that will have any impact on current in U.S., will have an impact on issuing new in U.S. I don\u2019t think that anything changes in the way that -- emergency or not, whether the inventories will be managed or the access that patients will have in any of these treatments. Now, as regards of COVID/flu, if the introduction of combination for products would change the flu market, I think, yes -- well, would say it\u2019s a major flu market was always a single market until now. And suddenly, there is a chance that other respiratory cases like COVID or RSV will come. So I think that would change. But now, the step-up, it is clear we expect that around 24%, 25%, it is a population in the U.S., that believes needs protection and is diligent enough -- not believes, more belief, but they are diligent enough to follow the recommendation and go and get their annual booster for COVID. When they will present themselves -- excuse me, when the flu people will present themselves and they will be asked that question, if you want flu single or flu with a combo, and they will be given the information that will protect them in a single injection at the same time, zero co-pay, for COVID as well, we believe it\u2019s reasonable to expect that the 25% stable will become 30%, so we\u2019ll add another 5% of the population. And that over time, that will move closer to the 50%, we project 40 over there. So, those are the assumptions that we\u2019re using. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question will come from Kerry Holford with Berenberg. Kerry Holford : A couple of questions on vaccines please. Firstly, on RSV, can you confirm you\u2019re on track to provide that second season of data ahead of approval and reimbursement discussions in May-June for the older adult vaccine? And can you confirm whether you\u2019ve now filed your maternal RSV vaccine with the regulator? If not, are you waiting for the approval in the older adult setting first? And then just on the flu/COVID combo, if we assume you have positive flu Phase 3 data in the second half of the year, positive Phase 1 combo data in the first half, would you expect to move the combo into Phase 3, or is that the possibility you will not need a full Phase 3 combo study to proceed to filing an approval? Thanks. Dr. Albert Bourla : Mikael? Dr. Mikael Dolsten : Yes. I mean, we always follow multi-seasonal vaccines and we\u2019ll share the second season data as soon as it\u2019s available. Of course, there are many ways this can play out with combination vaccines and which could lead to more regular vaccination rather than protracted. And on -- you also asked about the, let\u2019s say, the flu/COVID combo here. Chris Stevo : Will we need a full Phase 3 trial or\u2026 Dr. Mikael Dolsten : So if we need a full Phase 3, if we have both flu and COVID? We expect that you need a Phase 3 that is based on immunogenicity and safety and not a large trial based on events. So, we think we can complete that fast. And if anyone can do it first, it\u2019s we. So, that\u2019s very high on our list currently pending data to move with light speed in. Dr. Albert Bourla : Right. And there was a question on reinvestment of RSV question I think. Dave Denton : Yes. I think, Kerry, you asked the second season durability data, how that will impact reimbursement discussions\u2026 Dr. Albert Bourla : Yes. I think it will impact ACIP recommendation in vaccines. Once you have ACIP recommendation or not, you\u2019re getting automatic actions with all formularies without co-pay. So, that, I think it will be the key what ACIP will say. And let\u2019s go to the next question, please. Operator : Our next question will come from Andrew Baum with Citigroup Andrew Baum : On Paxlovid, following commercial approval and the withdrawal of the EUA, will pharmacist prescribing remain intact? And then a couple for Mikael. Could you just explain the reasons for the out-licensing of the TL1A inhibitor to Roivant? I apologize if I missed it. And then second, in relation to your multispecific antibodies, your trispecifics, this has been tried previously, I think AbbVie and J&J previously tried in RA, and I think in psoriasis with TNF IL-17s but they ran into an issue with binding affinity and they didn\u2019t have efficacy. Do you think you\u2019ve managed to solve the issue here? Dr. Albert Bourla : Andrew, the first one is simple, I don\u2019t know if the pharmacist will. It\u2019s very unlikely, I think. But I don\u2019t know, we don\u2019t have it in our assumptions right now. And let\u2019s go to Mikael. Dr. Mikael Dolsten : I\u2019ll start with, Andrew, great question. You touched my heart today. We have cracked it. These antibodies that I shared today have, first of all, pharmacokinetics like an excellent single antibody but 3-in-1 product and have very high potency, which you asked about, actually exceeding the marketed product substantially. So, we think it\u2019s really something that we will move very quickly as we learn more of it. And you asked about TL1A. We think we have a very good partnership with Roivant that helps us to do more things within our pipeline. And you\u2019ve heard Aamir Malik earlier alluded to that we have commercialization rights ex U.S., Japan. We have about half of the value of this product. And we have a follow-on bispecific TL1A p40 that\u2019s active mechanism of STELARA. So, we think we have such a richness in this space and really enjoy to build the ecosystem with others and maximize what we bring to patients. Dr. Albert Bourla : Aamir, you want to add something here? Aamir Malik : The only quick thing I will add, Andrew, is if you look at how prolific our R&D engine has been, the total funding demand from all of the R&D programs that were generated would significantly exceed what we guided to as our R&D spending in \u201822 and \u201823. So, in that context, we are going to be very thoughtful about how we prioritize. We have a robust process for that. And consequently, from time to time, you\u2019re going to see programs like the TL1A that have very clear scientific merit, but we think we\u2019re sharing the cost, the risk and capabilities with the partner is the best way to create value. And that\u2019s what we did in that situation. And we\u2019ve had a long history of doing that in a number of other situations as well. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Now, let\u2019s move to the last question. Operator : Our last question will come from Evan Seigerman with BMO. Evan Seigerman : Thank you for squeezing me in. And I\u2019m not going to ask a COVID question because I think they were all asked. So, just looking at business development, when you hit Biohaven, what were some of the characteristics of the deal that you want to bring forward in kind of your go-forward approach for BD? How should we think about potential holes in your pipeline that you could fill with external deals? Thank you. Dr. Albert Bourla : Aamir, why don\u2019t you take this one? Aamir Malik : Sure. The Biohaven deal for us represented an excellent opportunity to leverage our capabilities. And specifically, where were capabilities in terms of our global commercial footprint, that Biohaven as a company alone could not maximize but where application of those capabilities could take Nurtec and the follow-on product to places and reach us for patients that they couldn\u2019t have gotten to alone. And also the way in which we structured that transaction, began with an ex U.S. partnership, which we then expanded to take on the full global CGRP franchise and also excluded some assets that were less relevant to us strategically that created a newco. And I think what you can take away from that is that we\u2019re going to continue to look for things that are scientific breakthroughs where we can add capabilities and we\u2019re also going to be creative and disciplined about how we structure our deals. And we think that\u2019s going to serve us well as we complete our ambition against our $25 billion goal. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Aamir. So, thank you, operator. In summary, let me close by saying, first of all, I feel extremely proud for the team at Pfizer that was able to deliver -- break all records in 2022, the highest-ever revenue, the highest-ever profits, the highest, more importantly ever number of patients, that we protected or treated with our medicines. The best-ever reputation for our company, the most productive wave of R&D with 18 -- 19 products launching in the next 18 months, the best R&D machine in terms of multiple measures, all of that were able to achieve in 2022. Clearly though, I believe that the best years of Pfizer are ahead because we are building on a significant capital position that we know how to deploy to create growth. We are building on an R&D engine that it is more productive than ever in the history of this company, a manufacturing engine that it is the envy of the industry, commercial envy -- commercial engine that it is around again and again and again as the best commercial engine in the industry. And, of course, a mindset in Pfizer that is characterized but nothing is impossible. We can make everything possible. So with that in mind, I think that we are moving ahead, hopefully, to an even more successful 2023. Thank you very much for your attention, your interest in us and your support as shareholders. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude Pfizer\u2019s fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. We appreciate your participation, and you may disconnect your line at any time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to Pfizer's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chris Stevo, Senior Vice President and Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Chris Stevo : Thank you, Chelsea. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Pfizer's first quarter earnings call. I'm joined today by Dr. Albert Bourla, our Chairman and CEO; Dave Denton, our CFO; and Dr. Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development and Medical. Joining for the Q&A session, we also have Angela Hwang, Chief Commercial Officer and President, Global Biopharmaceuticals Business; Aamir Malik, our Chief Business Innovation Officer; Dr. William Pao, our Chief Development Officer; and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel. Before we begin the call, I wanted to remind you of some of some logistical items. Materials for this call and other earnings related materials are on the Investor Relations section of pfizer.com. You see our forward-looking statements disclaimer on Slide 3. Additional information regarding these statements and our non-GAAP financial measures is available on earnings release and our SEC forms 10-K and 10-Q under Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Information and factors that may affect future results. Forward-looking statements on the call are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, speak only as of the call's original date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of the statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Albert. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Chris. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Q1 was a solid, foundational quarter in what we expect to be an exciting year for Pfizer and patients. Our financial results were as we anticipated. Our non-COVID revenues grew 5% operationally compared with the year-ago quarter, while overall revenues declined 26% operationally, primarily due to a previously communicated and expected decline in Comirnaty revenues. Even with Comirnaty's decline, our COVID franchises remained significant contributors to the business with a combined $7.1 billion in revenues during the quarter. This growth was driven primarily by recently acquired products, Nurtec for migraine and Oxbryta for sickle cell disease, our anti-infective Sulperazon, Eliquis, in the non-valvular atrial fibrillation indication in the U.S., and our Vyndaqel family of products for the treatment of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy ATTR-CM. We also continue to be proud of our patient impact. During the first quarter, more than 250 million patients were treated with our medicines and vaccines. With this solid start to the year, we remain on track to grow our non-COVID revenues by 7% to 9% operationally in 2023. That's because the majority of our potential near-term product launches, as you can see mapped out on this slide, are expected to occur in the second half of the year, following regulatory approvals where not yet secured. As such, we expect our non-COVID revenues to grow at a faster rate in the second half of the year than in the first. Overall, we are in the midst of an 18-month period in which we expect to launch up to 19 potential new products and indications. Over the first four months of the year, we have made excellent progress toward this goal with the approval of Zavzpret, an expanded indication for Cibinqo to include adolescents, and last week's approval of Prevnar 20 for pediatric use, all in the U.S. We also have secured regulatory filing acceptances for elranatamab, for Braftovi and Mektovi for non-small cell lung cancer, and for our RSV maternal vaccine candidate, which if approved would be the first vaccine for administration to pregnant individuals to help protect against the complications of RSV disease in infants from birth through six months. In addition, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration has granted priority review and the European Medicines Agency has accepted our MAA filing for review of Talzenna for use in combination with Xtandi for patients with newly diagnosed metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, based on the TALAPRO2 results. Regarding our COVID-19 franchises, we continue to expect 2023 to be a transition year as the virus continues to mutate and we move from advance purchases under government contracts to more traditional supply arrangements in a commercial model for both Comirnaty and Paxlovid in the U.S. As previously discussed, in 2023 and 2024 we expect vaccine utilization to decline compared with 2022. Then starting in 2025 and continuing in 2026 and beyond, we expect to see an increase in COVID-19 vaccination rates, assuming the successful development and approval of various COVID combination vaccines. Outside the U.S., we expect these general trends to be similar -- with some variations from country-to-country. Regarding Paxlovid, we continue to expect the government inventory that was built around the world last year to be absorbed by the end of this year. We then expect that in years 2024 and beyond, the courses sold and courses used will more closely align. With its robust efficacy, consistent safety profile, and potential to help mitigate the burden of COVID-19 on patients and their families, health systems and society, Paxlovid is proving to be an important and durable complementary tool to vaccination strategies for the estimated 40% of the global adult population at high risk for progressing to severe disease. Now let's take a look at Pfizer's next potential moonshot : the battle against cancer. Oncology remains a core therapeutic area for Pfizer, and we believe the proposed acquisition of Seagen will enhance our position in this important space. Integration planning is already underway, and we continue to expect the deal to close in late 2023 or early 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. By combining Seagen's category-leading antibody-drug conjugate technology with Pfizer's scale, expertise and capabilities, we believe we can accelerate potential breakthroughs in cancer medicines and introduce new solutions to patients around the world. The potential combined commercial infrastructure for Pfizer and Seagen will be 3x the size of that of Seagen alone in the U.S. and 4x, 5x larger globally. As a result, we believe acquiring Seagen could contribute more than $10 billion in 2030 risk-adjusted revenues, with potential significant growth beyond 2030. Even with the Seagen deal, given the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows, we continue to have the flexibility to take additional actions to create shareholder value. Dave will provide more details on this during his presentation. One of the key areas of focus for Pfizer in 2023 is continuing to build trust, which is a key asset for every biopharmaceuticals company. Since the beginning of the year, we have received two accolades that demonstrate we are doing just that. In February, Pfizer was named to the Top 10 of Fortune's Most Admired Companies List for the second year in a row. And in March, Ethisphere recognized Pfizer as one of the world's most ethical companies, also for the second year in a row. At Pfizer, trust is everything. It gives us our license to operate, allows us to attract the best talent and enables us to deliver breakthroughs that change patients' lives. With that, I will turn it over to Dave. After Dave, Mikael will provide an update on our R&D pipeline. Dave? Dave Denton : Thank you, Albert, and good morning, everyone. I want to begin with Pfizer's capital allocation strategy before we dive into additional commentary about our quarterly performance and outlook for the remainder of 2023. As you know our strategy includes three pillars : reinvesting in the business; growing and paying dividends; and repurchasing our shares. In the first three months of 2023, we have invested $2.5 billion in internal R&D and returned $2.3 billion to shareholders via our quarterly dividend, and importantly, allocated approximately $43 billion for the proposed Seagen acquisition. Over the last few years, we have reinvested heavily into our business to drive long-term growth and enhance long-term shareholder value. We have invested in Pfizer's own science, while acquiring the best external science to supplement our pipeline. Since 2022, we've invested approximately $70 billion, including Seagen, in business development. In addition, we have continued to grow our dividend. For the past 14 years, we have raised our dividend annually. Since 2010, our quarterly cash dividend grew from $0.16 a share to $0.41 a share in 2023. Looking ahead, as we exit this unprecedented period of anticipated launches, we would expect to achieve margin improvement over time. As we begin to de-lever our capital structure after the closing of the Seagen transaction, we expect to return to a more balanced capital allocation mix between our three pillars. While we will continue to invest in our business, we do expect more balance between that priority and returning value to our shareholders via increased dividends and value-enhancing share repurchases. Our capital allocation strategy is squarely focused on driving shareholder value while at the same time remaining committed to a high investment grade Tier 1 commercial paper rating. Now turning to the quarter, as Albert said, our results were in line with our expectations, albeit slightly better than consensus. As expected, overall revenues declined 26% operationally, primarily driven by the anticipated decline in Comirnaty, which was partially offset by strong Paxlovid sales. I want to point out that our COVID-19 products produced $7.1 billion in revenues in the first quarter alone. Our non-COVID operational revenue growth was solid at 5% year-over-year. Primarily driving this growth was the inclusion of Nurtec ODT and Oxbryta, and an increase in Sulperazon revenues in China. Revenues for Eliquis in the U.S. and the Vyndaqel family globally also contributed to this growth. Now, I want to remind you of the seasonality of some of our products. In the first-quarter, Nurtec ODT and Oxbryta typically have lower sales quarter-on-quarter due to annual copay reset dynamics, with higher sales anticipated in later quarters. Most important, both products continue to experience strong growth in demand. Sulperazon revenues increased more than $100 million year-over-year, due to higher demand in China during the quarter, which we do not expect to be sustained going forward. The demand was due to increased bacterial infections from more patients being hospitalized for COVID. To help ensure the success of the expected launches of our large number of new and acquired products and indications, we increased our investments in SI&A. These investments are squarely focused on Pfizer's 2025 to 2030 growth aspirations. Moving to the bottom-line, reported diluted EPS this quarter declined by 29% to $0.97, while adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.23 declined 20% on an operational basis during the quarter. Once again this quarter, foreign exchange movements significantly impacted our results, reducing first quarter revenues by $730 million, or 3%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.07, or 4%, compared to LY. Now turning to the full year financial outlook for the Company, our full year 2023 guidance remains unchanged. On a total company basis, we continue to expect revenues of $67 billion to $71 billion, reflecting an operational decline of 31% at the midpoint. With 5% operational growth in our non-COVID revenues this quarter, we are on-track to achieve our non-COVID revenue guidance of 7% to 9% operational growth for the full year. Given that a large number of launches are expected to occur in the third and fourth quarter of 2023, we anticipate our quarterly revenues will not be linear this year and that our non-COVID revenues will grow more quickly in the back half of the year versus the first half of 2023. In terms of our COVID products, Comirnaty and Paxlovid, we expect sales to trend more seasonally in this year. Given these dynamics, we expect significantly lower sales contributions from our COVID products in the second quarter versus the first quarter. In fact, given the anticipated timing of approvals for a fall vaccine with strain change, we would expect more substantial vaccine deliveries to start in September, which is late in the U.S. third quarter and the beginning of our international fourth quarter. With respect to Paxlovid, we continue to expect 2023 to be a transitional year as we anticipate shifting to a commercial market in the second half of this year. We are reaffirming our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $3.25 to $3.45 per share. On a full year basis, we expect that foreign exchange will have an unfavorable impact compared with full year 2022 of approximately $0.13, on adjusted diluted earnings per share. We are also reaffirming the remaining components of our full year 2023 guidance, which you can find in the Appendix of the Q1 2023 earnings presentation. So in closing, this is an exciting period for Pfizer as we continue to invest to drive long-term growth and importantly enhance long-term shareholder value. With that, now let me turn it over to Mikael. Dr. Mikael Dolsten : Thank you, Dave. Today I\u2019d like to start off with one of the four pillars of our oncology portfolio, which are breast, urogenital, blood cancers and precision medicine. Within urogenital, prostate cancer is an area in which we have strong momentum. Recent positive study results further strengthen our franchise, building upon the global standard of care set by XTANDI, and underscoring our long-standing commitment to the pursuit of breakthroughs that define new standards of care in prostate cancer. I\u2019ll highlight data from two Phase 3 studies, EMBARK and TALAPRO-2, as well as early, but promising signals from our EZH2 inhibitor, each of which has the potential to reach broader patient populations across the treatment continuum in prostate cancer. Final analysis from TALAPRO-2, evaluating our potential blockbuster PARP inhibitor TALZENNA in combination with XTANDI were presented at ASCO GU. Results showed significant and clinically meaningful improvement across the all-comers population in radiographic progression free survival, or rPFS, in men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer, with or without homologous recombination repair or HRR gene mutations. There was a 37% reduction in risk of disease progression. Median rPFS in patients treated with TALZENNA and XTANDI was not reached at the time of analysis versus 21.9 months for placebo plus XTANDI. A trend in overall survival favoring TALZENNA plus XTANDI was also observed, though these data are immature. The final OS data will be reported once the predefined number of survival events has been reached. Treatment with TALZENNA and XTANDI resulted in statistically significant improvement in overall response rates, which suggest a potential cooperative effect between the two treatments. The U.S. FDA has granted Priority Review for our sNDA for TALZENNA in combination with XTANDI for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer, with a decision expected in 2023. The ongoing TALAPRO-3 study, if successful, may further expand the reach of this potential blockbuster into the HRR-deficient metastatic castration sensitive population. We recently presented data from our Phase 3 EMBARK study evaluating XTANDI plus leuprolide in men with non-metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer with high-risk biochemical recurrence at the American Urological Association's 2023 Annual Meeting. The study met its primary endpoint with statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in metastasis-free survival, with a 58% reduction in risk for radiographic progression or death. Key secondary endpoints were met including time to PSA progression. These results suggest XTANDI, the only novel hormone therapy approved for three disease states of prostate cancer in the U.S., has the potential if approved to expand to patients in the hormone-sensitive, or castration sensitive setting, for the first time. Next, I'd like to share early data from one of our next-wave candidates, a potential first-in-class and best-in-class EZH2 inhibitor, which we shorthand as 1497. EZH2 is an epigenetic transcriptional repressor that is frequently over expressed in prostate cancer. We believe that inhibition of EZH2 may provide synergistic effects in combination with XTANDI, with the potential to address unmet needs of patients with androgen-sensitive and resistant disease. Here are data from our ongoing Phase 1/2 study evaluating \u20181497 in second line mCRPC patients with prior abiraterone and/or XTANDI, and up to one line of chemotherapy. On the left are updated data from a Phase 1 dose escalation study shared at ESMO last year. These encouraging results show durable anti-tumor activity in both XTANDI-na\u00efve and experienced patients, with all XTANDI-na\u00efve patients having received prior abiraterone. Importantly, this suggests that the addition of our EZH2 inhibitor has the potential to sensitize XTANDI resistant tumors, which is an increasing clinical unmet need. The early rPFS data are also highly encouraging, reaching 8.7 months in the XTANDI experienced patients. and 17.1 months in XTANDI-na\u00efve both of which are notably longer than historical controls. For example, in the control arm of the CARD study, rPFS for XTANDI alone was 4.8 months in XTANDI-na\u00efve patients. And although cross-trial comparisons cannot be made, these results, in combination with the emerging objective response rate and PSA50 response, are supportive of the contribution of our EZH2 inhibitor candidate in driving these responses. From a safety perspective, the combination was generally well tolerated, with mostly Grade 1 and 2 events. The randomized Phase 2 study in second line mCRPC is ongoing, with data expected in early 2024. Now, we turn to the potential for near-term growth across our respiratory vaccine franchise. Prevnar 20, our 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, is now approved for children aged 6 weeks through 17 years. We are confident in our ability to maintain leadership in the pneumococcal vaccine space with Prevnar 20, which offers the broadest serotype coverage of any pediatric pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, helping to protect against the 20 serotypes in the vaccine. We have strong momentum with our RSV vaccine candidate, having received a positive VRBPAC Committee vote supporting potential approval to help combat RSV in older adults and PDUFA dates for our Older Adult and Maternal indications in quick succession in the coming months. Just last month, the New England Journal of Medicine published results from the two positive Phase 3 studies. Emerging data from the middle of the second RSV season in the Northern Hemisphere in the Phase 3 Older Adult study support meaningful durable vaccine efficacy; we will share the data once complete. In the coming months, we plan to start a Phase 3 study of the RSV vaccine candidate in 18- to 60-year-olds at high risk for RSV and in immunocompromised adults 18 and over, and a Phase 1 study in 2 to 18-year-olds at high risk, with the potential to broadly expand the reach of our vaccine candidate both to those aged 18 to 60 with high-risk conditions as well as to pediatrics and adolescents. Our RSV-Flu co-administration study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating non-inferiority for all four flu strains and RSV A and B strains. This suggests the RSV vaccine candidate, if approved, could be co-administered with flu vaccinations and add an important component of seasonal protection against respiratory pathogens. Finally, the FDA recently updated the EUA for our Omicron BA.4/5 bivalent COVID-19 vaccine to enable those at higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness, including the elderly and the immunocompromised, to partner with their healthcare providers to be proactive in helping protect themselves against COVID-19. We anticipate another update from FDA in June that will provide guidance on COVID-19 vaccine strains and vaccination timing for the 2023 fall and winter seasons. Beyond vaccines, anti-virals are an important component of our strategy in respiratory viruses. Here we share data for the first time from our second generation oral COVID-19 antiviral candidate, a potent and selective SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor that is currently in Phase 1. We designed this candidate to achieve clinical exposures that would have similar anti-viral activity to PAXLOVID, but without the need for ritonavir boosting and with the potential for reduced drug interactions. Early results from Phase 1 dose escalation are encouraging, with no dose limiting safety or tolerability findings. Dosing achieved concentrations many-fold over in vitro EC90 and is therefore expected to have similar antiviral activity to PAXLOVID. On the right are preliminary results from a Phase 1 pharmacokinetic study of midazolam drug interaction, which is a well-known standard for indicating CYP3A4-mediated drug-drug interactions. These data show there is a lack of such drug-drug interactions, suggesting there may be no related restrictions of co-dosing with drugs metabolized by CYP enzymes. Based on these encouraging data, we are planning to advance to a Phase 2 dose ranging study in the first half of 2023. In addition to the assets I spoke about today, we continue to make progress on the pipeline with more than 25 milestones recently achieved or anticipated through the first half of 2024. In inflammation & immunology, the FDA has approved our sNDA for CIBINQO, enabling a label expansion for adolescents with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. In internal medicine, ZAVZPRET migraine nasal spray has received FDA approval, expanding our migraine portfolio. Recently, the FDA Advisory Committee voted in support of PAXLOVID\u2019s favorable benefit-risk profile, with a soon PDUFA date in May. In closing, we are very excited about the potentially transformative catalysts expressed across the pipeline as we work with continued urgency to bring breakthroughs to patients. Thank you. Let me turn it over to Chris to start the Q&A session. Chris Stevo : Thank you, Mikael. All right, Chelsea, please queue up the list for Q&A. We have at least 30 minutes for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Umer, your line is open. Umer Raffat : I have two here, if I may. First, your expectations on the system eligible in the EV--302 trial especially because it's so significant to the acquisition you are going on to track on? And then secondly, based on my\u2026 Dr. Albert Bourla : Umer, can you repeat the question, I'm not sure we understood it. Umer Raffat : Sure. On the Seagen trial on Pfizer EV--302, I know there's been a huge emphasis on cohort K, which is at this time ineligibles. My question is, this ongoing trial also has says plan eligibles, which is two thirds of the target population. What's your expectation there? Because it was I felt like it was not a coincidence, you never showed any data disclosure from the eligible part A? And secondly, for the guidance for the full year, I noticed there's perhaps $1 billion or so worth of contribution from new launches. And I'm just trying to make sense of that in light of the fact that these are going to be launches, sort of in fall of this year, I realized that important read like RSV, route map, but is it reasonable to expect a billion dollars or so or lean to the launch from those? Thank you. Dr. Albert Bourla : Yes, thank you very much. Angela, why don't we take the second question about the guidance --p about the 1 billion estimated sales in the last quarter. Angela Hwang : So from a launch perspective, I think the two big ones to look out for this year are Prevnar 20 EPS, and RSP adults. And as you know, it goes through the typical ACIP process or recommendation, and then launches can really only happen or commercialization after the publication of the MWR. So if you consider all of that, that puts us into fourth quarter, which is when Prevnar 20, as well as when RSV older adults will actually be commercialized, and revenue being generated. And so yes, we are anticipating that there's going to be a big bolus of revenue because, first of all, if you think about Prevnar 20 Peds, that is going to be a conversion from Prevnar 20 Peds and Prevnar 13 today has a significant market share, right, in the pediatric pneumococcal, is 80% margin share. So, we are going to be converting those accounts, the physicians, the inventory, all of that from 13 over to 20. And so if you look at, I guess a good analog for that would be our Prevnar 20 adult launch, which was the conversion of the Prevnar 20 adult launch, and there it went really well. Today, we have what, over 95 market share. And then of course the second one is the RSV adult, and there, it plugs into an already established commercial infrastructure that we have built around COVID, around the Prevnar franchise, the adult franchise. It comes at a great time during the fall and the winter when vaccinations for respiratory vaccines actually increases. So, there is a lot of reasons to believe why their fourth quarter and it'll be a really big quarter for both Prevnar Peds as well as RSV adults. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Angela. On the question about the season asset although should be very careful, because we can't comment on that. But maybe you can make William, quick comment, general speaking. Dr. William Pao : Yes, sure. I would say we are just very excited about the recent approval in the first line Seagen in eligible population, which Seagen has got, which is about 8,000 to 9,000 patients in the U.S., and we are excited to see additional data coming in first line Seagen eligible EV--302 study, which as you know is Peds plus Prevnar versus platinum gemcitabine. We can't comment any further as a Seagen. And if that positive, that would increase the eligible population by another 10,000 to 12,000. Dr. Albert Bourla : No doubt, the population that excites us, but of course, we can comment on the Seagen products. Next question please. Operator : Our next question will come from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Evan. Your line is open. I think we will go to the next question. Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Go ahead, Evan. Unidentified Analyst : Terrific. Thanks for taking our call. This is Keith on for Evan. Maybe just shifting to M&A execution, thinking about your recent acquisitions with Nurtec and Oxbryta, you've done a great job describing the plans to add value to drive commercial and clinical synergies. We are seeing the outcomes on our end. Could you comment on how this is going from your end? And then could you talk about specifics for operationalizing the same for Seagen integration and how this would differ from recent examples? That would be great. Thank you. Dr. Albert Bourla : Again, Angela back to you. Angela Hwang : Sure. Yes. So we are incredibly proud of the work that we have done with Nurtec since the acquisition. As you know, in July of 2022, we had already begun and copromote with Biohaven to ensure that we were copromoting the product early. And I think that has really paid off. If you really look at what has happened from it, just leading indicators as well as actuals. Today, Nurtec is the leading product in the oral CGRP class with over 47.5% market share. It is also the leading product when it comes to new to brand prescription share at a high of 46%. It also has the highest number of prescribers at over 110,000 prescribers and 80% of new CGRP prescribers choose Nurtec. So, I think we've demonstrated in the time that we've had it, that we are able to drive performance and drive excellent education and awareness of the product. And we're seeing that consistent great metrics as it pertains to Nurtec. And of course, the opportunity is huge, right because we have so pan Japan launching later this year. And we also know that, as a whole, there are over 1 billion migraine sufferers and only 18% of them are using CRPS today. So, we have a great opportunity to expand the class of CGRP with specifically Nurtec. Operator : Our next question will come from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Mohit Bansal : If I may ask two questions here. On European negotiation, just one -- because there was some news this week, just how much can you comment on that? And the real question there is that I know you when you provide guidance in the beginning of the year. You anticipated some of that, but so far as the negotiating reach to the guidance as a negotiation that finalized in that? And the other question I have is more about your demand chart for Paxlovid and vaccinations both, it seems like you are assuming both Paxlovid and vaccination, utilization going up into time 24 plus timeframe? Would it be both demand going demands going up? Or you think it will be either or as vaccinations come down, probably the demand for Paxlovid will would go up? How do you how should we think about that? Dr. Albert Bourla : Maybe I can answer those questions. So, the EU negotiations, they are still ongoing. So, we can't comment on that. Yes, we can include part of -- included our estimation of how these negotiations will end up in our guidance. And still we are not close, so I can make any comment on that. It wouldn't be appropriate as the discussions are still ongoing. As regards the demand for Paxlovid or for vaccines, as we had said, we expect that the demand for vaccines will go down. We gave the estimations that will go down to approximately 24% of people in the U.S. and relevant numbers a different country by country as underlying demand that for boosters and things I think are progressing towards that goal, we will have to see as most of these will happen in the last in after summer, when it is the traditional period that flow is also vaccinations are happening. Demand for Paxlovid right now is following very, very accurately, the infection rates. So, when we monitor it on a weekly basis, and really it is going when we have almost equal percentage of infections is equal percentage of the case Paxlovid. So, we expect that we'll continue going like that because we have less compliance with the vaccination recommendations across the world as people are tired with COVID and we expect that fewer people, as I said this year will get the vaccine compared to last year. And so, this means that the immune protection of the population will go down. As a result, we expect that we will have more infections and that will drive more use of Paxlovid. But of course, that's what our logical models are telling us, we'll have to see what eventually will happen in real life. Thank you for your question. We may go to the next question, please. Operator : Next, we have Robyn Karnauskas with Truist Securities. Your line is open. Robyn Karnauskas : Just two big picture ones. Just first on for vaccine franchise, as we think about the competitive landscape. A couple of things, what do you think is going to be the most important differentiation for you versus the competition that will drive the most uptake as people have different options? And have you developed any new LNP technology that might reduce the biggest pushback with the vaccines as people still stick still when they got them for some of your products? And then lastly\u2026 Dr. Albert Bourla : I didn\u2019t hear which product you spoke about? Robyn Karnauskas : I was just talking about the [indiscernible] vaccine franchise for RSV and flu and COVID. Thinking big picture, how you are differentiated? And what do you think is going to be key because you're all competing to determine who's going to be the winner? And the second question is there's the big proposal at a Europe for new legislation for drugs. And since you're launching new products in Europe, just want to get your thoughts on whether or not you think that legislation may hold or what kind of impact that might have? Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you. And maybe I can give you a very general answer. And then if Angela wants to chime in, please. On the COVID, we are right now, all right, we have the big markets there. And then we plan to maintain that. So, I think we are then. When it comes to RSV, we are the only ones but we have both or we have positive data on both, on adults and on maternal. And we have already approved for the adults and then we are expecting approval for the maternal. So, that the strength of our data with efficacy and safety profile that we think is differentiated, will provide us with what we hope also to be the winners in that one. As flu on mRNA technology still the results, we are very optimistic with the totality of the data that we are having from our flu vaccine, and we will wait to see of course how that will continue. And then of course, the winners, there will be also those that they will be able to build from the maze of all of that. So, the fact that we have all three of them or we have a good chance to have all three of them, if the studies are successful and if the products are approved or of course also provides a good differentiation. In addition to all of that, I think the trust to the Pfizer brand name, which has been very, very strong I think also play a key differentiator. Now as regards the EU legislation what we haven't just seen in recent days, we are noticing the positive things of EU trying to be more competitive in attracting reserves and creating the regulatory framework for more rapid approvals. Clearly, we are also concerned at the same time with provisions that would like to reduce the exclusivity of data and other provisions. So, we hope that there will be an open dialogue with the EU so we can create a framework, but really will enhance innovation. Angela anything that you want to add to all of that? Angela Hwang : Maybe just to add to your question specifically about the adult portfolio, I really do believe that, this plays into our sweet spot. Through the last several years, both from or the Prevnar franchise for vaccinating adults throughout work in COVID, we have learned that, the clinical profile is one thing, but you really need reliable supply, you need a commercial infrastructure, you need a great ability to educate, raise awareness and drive people to vaccination. And I think on all of those counts, Pfizer is a winner. And so, we look forward to having a growing and a very robust respiratory portfolio that really leverages off of this incredible commercial machinery. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we have Louise Chen with Cantor. Your line is open. Louise Chen : Hi. Thank you for taking my question. So, I want to ask you about margin improvement. You talked about that in your opening remarks. I'm curious, when we might start to see that and does that include the Seagen acquisition in your comments? And second question I had for you is. What are some of the key steps that you have taken already to transition Comirnaty and Paxlovid to the commercial markets? And when will you know how the season will shape up? Thank you. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much, Louise. Dave, do you want to take the margin improvements and then Angela, a combination of products. Dave Denton : Yes, thank you for your question. It is our expectation that, as we integrate Seagen in either late '23 or '24, early '24, we will begin to see margin improvement, and that will happen as we continue to improve our performance from a top-line perspective. At the same time, we are going to be very efficient and really work to minimize our SI&A investments going forward. So I think we should start to see that post the integration and the closing of the Seagen transactions. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you, David. And, Angela, how are we preparing to transition commercial commitment? Angela Hwang : So, Louise, as you know, both of these products, both Comirnaty and Paxlovid, our products are very familiar to us. They fit very well in the the existing portfolio of products that we have. So the ability for us to move from an EUA into a full launch or into its business as usual for us, right? So, the typical things that we would always do which is awareness building with physicians and with patients that has begun and is well on the way. The things that you would do as a regard to our discussions with payers to demonstrate value and to create your value arguments for reimbursement and access that has begun. We have done a tremendous amount of work, as it pertains to retailers and making sure that, we have our distribution and our supply chain, well-oiled and the ability to be able to supply and to vaccinate to administer these products at both at a physical site, like a retailer or even in the case of Paxlovid getting telehealth and sort of remote health capabilities set up. So all of these capabilities, many of them, in fact, have been underway throughout the entire time of the pandemic. So I think we are in a very, very good position to seamlessly transition into commercialization. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Angela. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question will come from Akash Tewari with Jefferies. Your line is open. Akash Tewari : Can you talk about your next gen CDK4 program? You'll have first in-human data in ASCO. What is your team believe just hitting CDK4 allows you to improve on hyper-intense efficacy? And are there any plans to combine that drug with our venous cert given the DDI that's been shown up with IBRANCE? And then on your next gen Paxlovid program, can you confirm that it can achieve multiple-old over the EC91 adjusted for plasma protein binding? And is that for timelines on that product? Is the earliest possible commercial entry 2026 or is there a path for expedited approval? Dr. Albert Bourla : Mikael, I think both questions can go to you. Dr. Mikael Dolsten : We are very excited about the next gen CDK4 inhibitor. It's looking really good in two aspects. You can dose and get the activity of the patient's Pal CDK4/6 because you deal with higher inhibition of this mechanism, and you have a better tolerability with no -- with much less neutropenia, less risk for infections. We expect media to report out and we have an aspirational target to start Phase 3, late this year posted earlier. At the same time as you asked, we are now running combination study CDK4 with CAT6, another inhibitor that has nice single agent activity and seem to combine well. We have a second combination with CDK2 and we think this would allow us next year to pick one or two combinations to advance up the lines with more potent treatment than what's available today. Similarly, we're looking at combination with 471, as you alluded to in order to benefit from Arvinas' collaboration. Next gen Paxlovid, yes, as alluded to in my introductory remarks, we have manifold above EC90. And as you know, for Paxlovid what's unique with that drug that the many fold exposure above EC90 as these four lead to no detectable meaningful emergence or mutations, which is always what you fear in antiviral single agent therapy. And this has been unique for Paxlovid versus other agents that have been used to for whether antibodies or antivirals. And this is exactly the profile for the next gen, but without the DDIs that allow us to improve and also to move into other supplementary segments. We're planning soon to start a Phase 2. And pending data possibly move quickly to Phase 3. And of course, we would like to see that agent introduced as soon as possible, I think we can hope to move swiftly pending event rates of COVID that will happen in the fall and further on that influence enrollment. So I think you said '26 and I would certainly hope we'd be ahead of that. Operator : Next we have Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Terence Flynn : Maybe two for me because I'm not sure you'll be able to answer one of them. I guess any would love your latest thoughts on your seasonal flu mRNA vaccine. Just in light of some of the Moderna data on the B antigen side just how should we think about your profile there? And then there's been some focus on this et cetera searches Opdivo, first-line Hodgkins lymphoma data that's going to be presented at ASCO. Just wondering if you can offer your high-level perspective on how you see that frontline landscape evolving? Thank you. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Mikael, why don't you take the flu question and then the oncology question, we'll go to William. Dr. Mikael Dolsten : You know, we are very pleased what we see so far the totality, date of our few mRNA. As you know, we have reported out very high antibody titers to A, similar or possibly lower to the B antigens versus standard flu vaccines. But in contrast to standard flu vaccines, we have very nice T cell activity. And I think we are the only mRNA platform that has those CD4 and CD8 T cells of significance. We do think that could offer a unique profile for flu and the tolerability with our dose is very encouraging. So, the trial is in the last leg for readout. Hopefully, we'll be late to this for to share an update. And we are very encouraged and we are in parallel at least investing in combination opportunities with this and COVID and RSV in various combination as Albert early alluded to. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael, and William on the oncology front. Dr. William Pao : Yes, sure. So again, this is a molecule for Seagen and such as, which is the CD30 ADC. It's already been approved in Hodgkin's lymphoma, post-transplant, and then previously untreated Hodgkin's lymphoma now with chemotherapy with cisplatin, vinblastine and dacarbazine. And it's already we anticipate, actually later this year that label will be updated for overall survival. Now the data you're talking about is from the SWOG S1826 study with Nivo AVD versus Adcetris AVD, and I believe there'll be presenting PFS data. But this is a curable disease. And we believe that the OS update with the Adcetris label will show that Adcetris is the favorite product at this time. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Our next question will come from Colin Bristow with UBS. Your line is open. Colin Bristow : Maybe first of all, [indiscernible] in the upcoming data. Could you just walk us through what are the key efficacy and safety thresholds you're looking to meet to move this forward. And sort of with regards to the threshold, how you think about them in light of it that this is big dosing and how does that potentially impact the sort of commercial opportunities? And then just second, a quick call on your DMD Phase 3 CIFFREO trial, you've guided to completion of recruitment in April of this year just could you give us a quick update here? And then how you view the opportunity and positioning in light of the fact that there's a potential competitor approval at the end of this month? Thank you. Dr. Albert Bourla : Mikael? Dr. Mikael Dolsten : Yes, we are very excited about our two oral GLP, the 1532 and Danuglipron 1530 called Lotiglipron, and we're looking for a differentiated profile that will be a combination of rapid onset, high control of HbA1C bringing it down, and bodyweight loss at various doses to be very competitive, and a more easily tight treble drag that can optimize a preferred profile versus injectable when it comes to nausea and other well known effects. So, we look forward very much to data. Maybe later this year or possibly early next year and cherry pick the winner here. You also asked about the DMD, well if there is approval, it is based just on surrogate markers and in this area, I think it's very important to report out data, when it comes to real patient benefit. And we expect possibly already late this year, alternatively next year to have data from the first randomized study that if positive could show favorable benefit for patients doing better according to the North Star scale. So we feel really positive about our own DMD program and I think the entry will be competitive with the real data that patients need. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael. Next question please. Operator : Our next question will come from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Your line is open. Geoff Meacham : Good morning. Thanks so much for the question. Just have two. The first Angela on the I&I landscape, can you talk about your expectations for category growth just looking this year and next in light of the Humira and Stelara biosimilars to come? I'm asking just in the context for the elranatamab launch as well as Cibinqo? And then, Albert, I know this question has been asked, but the different way though. I know you expect this year for COVID to be a down year. But when you think about your scorecard outside the U.S. with payers, as you have transitioned to commercial, what's been the initial feedback from a sort of from a price and volume perspective, obviously, that's key to your assumptions in 2024 and beyond? Thank you. Dr. Albert Bourla : Let me answer the COVID question and then Angela will answer the I&I landscape. We expect to have commercialization in the U.S. I think likely the U.S. Government will stop purchasing outside the normal sandals products. We do not expect that to be the case in most of the countries international. We think that most of the countries will continue having governmental practices. And most of them, we have already long-term contracts. So, I don't think there will be much fluctuation over there in the price given the longevity of the product and the contracts expire prices option will be adjusted. Now let's move to the question about I&I and Angela, please. Angela Hwang : Sure. Well, I think to answer that question you really have to look at each product and the specific disease that they are in. So, let's start with elranatamab, which is UC. There, we believe that we have an advantage from a clinical profile perspective. We believe that we have the best class S1B inhibitor, but there are also other great benefits such as the fact that, it can be used steroid free that we have convenient dosing. We also offer an oral option in a world that is very prevalent with injectables. And even with all of that, that's out there, we still have 50% of people that have not achieved remission. So I think that the unmet need in UC is clear. And for us, in particular, given the profile of elranatamab, what we think is the greatest opportunity for us is in earlier lines of treatment where there has not been as much transmit, right? There's a lot of anti-TNF, there is a lot of biosimilars, there's JAF, there's other mechanisms, but in earlier lines of treatment. There really is not enough. And so that's where we think we have an opportunity to meet an underserved need today and that's where we're going to be -- that's where we're going to be positioning, elranatamab. ritlecitinib is a different story when you look at that particular indication for alopecia that is really an under developed market. The 3 million people today, they're no great options for adults and there are absolutely no options for adolescents and children. And so the profile that we have with ritlecitinib, it's the best-in-class JAK, it's the best JAK. And I think that we're going to compete well. In addition to the fact that we're going to be the only JAK compared to ritlecitinib that has an indication for adolescents. So, I think in this regard because it's a new disease or a highly undeserved disease, I think education and awareness, education at the level of the prescriber, the patient, but also with the payers is going to be key to our ability to access this market. Operator : Our next question comes from Trung Huynh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Trung Huynh : I have two, if I can. So first one a few days ago, you saw the FDA advisory committee vote on Lynparza's PROpel trial. In that the committee voted against the approval in all-comers. So TALZENNA and TALAPRO2, what's your expectations for your label here given the strength of your data? And could that affect your $1 billion peak sales number that you gave in December? And then for the RSV flu co-administration study, what flu vaccine did you test that with? Is that the high dose or the low dose? And if it's the low dose, could you be approved for use with the high dose, which is more relevant today? Dr. Albert Bourla : William, would you like to take TALAPRO part question? William Pao : As Mikael said, the study showed with enzalutamide plus TALAPRO versus Tala versus enza, we showed a 37% reduction in the radiograph of progression free survival. Notably, in the same presentation, we also showed the hazard ratio in the HR deficient population of 0.48, a significant P value and then the HRR non-deficient unknown population HR of 0.7 with a P value of 0.04. So, we remain confident about our data and the outcome or population obviously, we can't compare to PROpel. Notably in TALAPRO2, we have prospective testing for HRR deficiencies including BRCA1 and 2. I also want to point out that our control arm of XTANDI reaffirmed XTANDI is best-in-class NHT for the indication with a radiographic PFS of 22 months. And in the treatment on tala, our rPFS was not reached. So, we expect that the HR population, which is 25% will be compelling with the data and we'll also continue to present additional data in HR subpopulation at ASCO in 2023. And notably, we did get prior to review and we're currently in registration. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you, William. And Mikael, about RSV and flu. Dr. Mikael Dolsten : Yes. We are extremely excited about the RSV vaccine and we'll provide data on co-administration of that vaccine with the advent of flu. We expect you to be available and generalize to all flu vaccines. And then when it comes to longer term, we also are already in combination study with our RSV and using our internal portfolio of COVID and mRNA flu, so we see this as an event developing a very strong portfolio this year with co-administration opportunities next year, possibly our own flu vaccine and then combination thereof. So stay tuned. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you Mikael. Next question please. Operator : Next question will come from Andrew Baum with Citi. Your line is open. Andrew Baum : Just coming back to the, your oral GLP-1 portfolio. Lily has called out an anticipated weight loss that first two weeks from memory of around 14%, 15%. They hesitate to give baseline. Given the competitive nature of the field, you're late to market and the cost of running CVOT trials in this setting. Where does the relative weight loss need to be from your Phase 2 for you to advance given the benchmark that Lily seems to be setting? Dr. Albert Bourla : That's a good question for Mikael. Dr. Mikael Dolsten : Yes. No, we agree completely with you that we should have an ambitious profile. And we have certainly seen patients up to 15% weight loss, depending on different dose regimens. So for obesity, that's a really good ambition to have up to 15%. And for diabetes patients, of course, it's about having a very strong HbA1c lowering maybe 2% or even more. So, we think it's feasible with all roles. And we think that will open up a very large place. And we think that pending data readout that we may have a differentiated profile for our full agonists. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael. So we are waiting to see the data that will speak. Let's go to the next question, please. Operator : Next, we have Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Chris Schott : Just a two questions for me. Maybe first on the capital allocation comments, I guess the more balanced capital allocation post-Seagen de-levering. Just for up front, where do we need to see leverage go to before we can think about that balanced allocation? And in the meantime, what is the capacity and appetite for further deal? So can we think about kind of Biohaven size deals while you're delivering from Seagen or is it really smaller transactions? And then my second question was just one on RSV market development. So quickly, do you see this market developing? I guess I'm just trying to get my hands around how much education this require? And do you worry at all about vaccine fatigue? I guess, just given all the boosters that this population has received during the pandemic, is that slow at all the uptake versus kind of a normalized environment? Thank you. Dr. Albert Bourla : Good questions, Chris. Dave, capital allocation. Dave Denton : Yes. So thank you, Chris, for the question. Obviously, we have invested heavily back into our business. Here's all with the focus of growing our business from both from a top line perspective and importantly from a bottom line perspective. And I think now as we begin to cycle into, I'll say, post the peak of these reinvestment in the business. We should begin to harvest if you will, some of the cash flows coming out of the investments that we made and capitalize, if you will, on the returns that we expect out of these investments. So having said that, we expect because of that we should get ourselves back more balanced into the three pillars, again, reinvesting back in our business, growing our dividend and doing a value enhancing share repurchases. From a leverage perspective, obviously, we want to maintain our high investment grade rating in access to Tier 1 commercial paper. That would say that, we would probably be in the low 3x levered ZIP code from that perspective. And then from M&A perspective, we are still active in the M&A market. Obviously, first and foremost, on our objective now is close and begin to integrate Seagen. So that's priority number one. Having said that, we will still look at the M&A marketplace, understand if there is assets that meet our criteria to supplement our business, and we could theoretically execute against that, given our capital rupture. Having said that, in the near-term, those will probably be smaller, little tuck-in type deals given our leverage ratio in the very near-term. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you there. Angela, what about RSV and the educational efforts that the market would need? Angela Hwang : Well, with all launches, education is really important and that's why we have already begun our unbranded disease education with physicians laying the groundwork for the importance of vaccinating with or vaccinating for RSV. But of course, with all launches and with all new diseases, an education is important to consumers, it's important to caregivers, to payers and so on all of those fronts. Those discussions have either begun or are beginning, and we plan to obviously implement a robust market development plan like we do for all of our vaccines. However, I think that the biggest advantage here is in the synergies of RSV together with our other adult vaccines, right. We have now 20 adults. We have had COVID. All of these vaccines follow a very similar pattern in terms of the commercial needs that they have. And I think that we have the opportunity to quickly and seamless bring RSV on into our portfolio and use the very same approaches and mechanisms and the same conversations that were -- whether it's with a retailer, whether it's air, whether it's with our points of vaccinations to bring RSV on. So actually, I think that this is a very exciting time, and we feel very confident about the ability to seamlessly introduce RSV as another vaccine in our respiratory portfolio. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from David Risinger with SVB Securities. Your line is open. David Risinger : Yes. Thanks very much. First, could you discuss the Paxlovid private market sales potential in China, after March 31st that isn't included in your Paxlovid guidance for the year? And also could you comment on the late stage competitive threats from Sanofi's 21-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate vaccine in adults and infants and Merck's 21-Valent in adults? Thank you. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Angela, Paxlovid equity in private market in China. Angela Hwang : Sure. So, after April, we continue to have Paxlovid available and but it will be assessed through an out of pocket payment mechanism. So if you are a private patient, you can get it. If you're a public patient, you can get it, you just need to be able to pay up pocket for it. And we intend to continue to work with the public and with the Chinese Government to ensure its access. Dr. Albert Bourla : We can't give now guidance for a particular product in a particular country. So -- but, as I'm explaining the dynamics, Mikael, very quickly on the competition of pneumococcal. Dr. Mikael Dolsten : Yes. I mean, we are extremely excited about the PCV20 recent pediatric approval with a Stellar label reflecting the strengths of our data. We monitor carefully competitor activity, as you alluded to, and are planning ourselves to enter next year further expanded PCV vaccines, followed by additional expansion a few years later, including optimization of the conjugation procedures, including different carriers, and possibly for the adult also had adjuvant that we think could be useful. So this is a market where we have been the leaders were having a unique platform, and we monitor and feel very confident that we are going to have a bright future, although you mentioned competitor, which is a nature of markets that are becoming of course more saturated like the adult market, but there will also hope to benefit from our broader portfolio of respiratory vaccines from COVID flu RSV, that cannot be much harder at the moment. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael. Next question please. Operator : Our next question will come from Steve Scala with Cowen. Your line is open. Steve Scala : I have to follow-ups. First on pneumococcal vaccine. So Pfizer just started a study of a vaccine, including a new ingredient. Is the new ingredients and adjuvant is it more valence or is it something else? And then follow up on the Opdivo versus Adcetris study? Can you say whether you were aware of the data at the time of announcing the Seagen acquisition? And why should we not view this as a significant risk? Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Mikael, what is the secret ingredient? Dr. Mikael Dolsten : The secret sauce in this particular trial is a new adjuvant that we think could play and potential nice role in the PCV adult market as you go to increasing balance in this face. As I said before, in parallel, we are working on looking at different carriers, different chemistries, and we will shortly reveal for next year a start of a broader expanded PCV vaccine that will cooperate all these learnings. So stay tuned. Dr. Albert Bourla : And William again on the Opdivo study. William Pao : Sure. So again, on the Opdivo study, that SWOG study has been ongoing for a while we were not aware of the data that's going to be presented at ASCO. I would reiterate again, it's early PFS data from what we see and the most important measure of activity in Hodgkin's lymphoma would be overall survival. And again, we expect Seagen to get an updated label showing overall survival benefit in first line Hodgkin's lymphoma. Operator : Our next question will come from Kerry Holford with Berenberg. Your line is open. Kerry Holford : Two questions on the RSV vaccine. The only older adult vaccine on Slide 22, you know emerging mid second season data supporting durable vaccine efficacy. I wonder if you can elaborate a little more here. What data do you have in hunt today and you want to act against that second phase of data in front of the FDA approval? Assuming do you see protection into that second season? How might that influence your pricing in the U.S.? And secondly, on the maternal vaccine, you have thought scheduled in Q4 on Slide 6, implies that that may not happen till the first quarter of next year. So could you just provide more clarity on when you could launch that maternal vaccine? Dr. Albert Bourla : Yes, Mikael was about the RSV vaccine. Dr. Mikael Dolsten : Yes, we were very pleased to get our first data chunk from second season mid-season data for older adults. And it clearly shows that robust data that we shared, for example, we shared high 80% reduction in lower respiratory tract infections with three symptoms. We see also on this and similar on other endpoint, a very robust, very meaningful protection also in the second season. Now, as you know, at the same time, we are preparing for the future combination vaccines. And we think in general that you will see an evolution in the adult market with simplified vaccination schedule, and your revaccination of COVID flu RSV. For those that for some reason, these are vaccination, we think the second season data will be very good. On the maternal, we are preparing for an advisory committee, we think we have great data, we are the only one that have been able to conclude the maternal vaccination, we're the only one that we're able to construct an RSV vaccine without using an adjuvant. And we think it's a differentiated product, and I assume will be sooner after a potential approval and opportunity for Angela to launch to very eagerly awaiting community of increasingly attentive pregnant women and maternal clinics to protect the newborn. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mike. As we said, in our slide, we expect to be approved in this year in the last quarter. So good launch, we expect the publication of the MMWR likely to happen beginning of the next year. So that plays also a key role in the uptake with the vaccine. But keep in mind the launch of vaccines starts before the approval, right? We have done a lot of educational efforts and there are a lot of investments that we are doing in that field. So in that aspect, the launch already has started from our side at least. Operator : Our next question will come from Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is open. Carter Gould : I guess, first on the decision to establish a new operating segment and specifically launched this Pfizer IGNITE offering. Can you talk about what drove that? And if there's sort of like an aspirational target, and how meaningful have a driver that could be? And then secondly, sort of on the decision to divest Bavencio, did that reflect the sort of a signal you got from FTC or a proactive move in your mind or are there other factors we should think about? And the fact that we haven't seen other divestments to that sort of reinforce our confidence that you think that the deal can go through without other issues? Thank you. Unidentified Company Representative : Thank you very much. On the Bavencio question, the discussions to return the rights for royalties, in exchange for royalties, it started well before Seagen, so it has nothing to do with the acquisition of Seagen. It was something that was ongoing between us and Serrano for the benefit of the product and for simplicity reasons. It just was completed after we announced the deal shortly after, but it had started way, way before. Amir, would you like also to explain the IGNITE business? Aamir Malik : Yes, Carter, thanks for the question. I think you have seen us collaborate with the biotech ecosystem lots of different ways, and Pfizer IGNITE is another way in which we can effectively do that. Frankly, there is a lot of interest and demand on the part of particularly Biotec for working with us to access some of our distinctive research and clinical development capabilities. And we think IGNITE gives us a platform to do that, to work with these companies, get closer to the science, which over time also then improves our ability to access that science and make determinations about what we would like to bring in-house. So, we think this is a excellent way for us to continue to collaborate with the Biotec ecosystem and add to our growing and compelling pipeline overtime. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Our next question will come from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Chris Shibutani : Thank you. On Paxlovid, the U.S. commercial opportunity, can you update us on any framing of what you are thinking in terms of pricing, and when we will know that? And in particular with the commercial availability, are you anticipating much in the way of sort of payer engagements in terms of thinking about how that process will unfold utilization management wise? And then on the business development front, if we go to the $30 billion that you had outlined for a while now, and think about what is remaining from that unadjusted target in terms of 2030 revenues. Let's say, approximately $5 billion is left. As we are thinking about, how you guys are contemplating what areas to go into in terms of verticals or therapeutic areas or modalities? Would it be fair to expect that at this stage a consideration might be to minimize the then that you would have to rebuild or sort of refurbish on the SI&A front given your margin objectives longer-term? Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Angela, on Paxlovid commercialization. Angela Hwang : Sure. Hi, Chris. Yes. We are preparing for launch now. But as we have said, we have shared before the date of launch and exactly how that's going to happen is still very much subject to our discussions with the U.S. Government. So, we are going to align with guidance from them in terms of how that's going to happen. Of course, in the meantime, we are preparing for the commercialization of Paxlovid and payer discussions around the world is critical. So, those have begun. Obviously, it's too early for me to share the price of Paxlovid. But suffice to say that, the price ranges that we have brought to our payers together with the value arguments that we have been able to develop through robust real world evidence from the number hospitalizations, the number of deaths that we have been able to avert through the treatment with Paxlovid is very much supportive of the pricing ranges that we are talking about. So, I think very soon we will be able to share more. Dr. Albert Bourla : And Amir about what is the profile of [indiscernible] BDA activities. Aamir Malik : Yes. Chris, as you mentioned, we have a goal of $25 billion in risk adjusted you by 2030, and I should remind everyone that is a 2030 goal. We with the deals that we have done have remaining balance of less than $5 billion against that goal. And I think our strategy to pursue that is going to be consistent with what we have employed to-date. First and foremost, it's going to be about compelling science that we can add value to. That's also going to contribute growth in the 25 to 30 period and take lots of things into consideration, including the impact on the P&L profile. So, that will continue to be our focus and will continue to be disciplined and the opportunities that we look for. And as Dave mentioned earlier, our priority right now is ensuring that we close out and successfully integrate the Seagen transaction, as well as drive value from the other deals that we've done and will continue to actively look for opportunities. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you, and we are a bit out of time, so last question, please. Operator : Our last question will come from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Tim Anderson : A couple of questions. The first is, how much of your future COVID vaccine revenue forecast are tied to the ability to have a combination product, if something like mRNA flu ends up not being viable, and a knockout of flu COVID combo, would that impact your anticipated uptake in 2025 and beyond? Or can you get to those longer term guidance levels regardless of whether you have any combos or not? And then last question, Albert, I'm guessing, there's some frustration among management with what the stock's been doing, a tough 2023, 2022 wasn't a great year. This is despite Pfizer helping lead the world out of the pandemic, which was a remarkable accomplishment. Even today, the consensus stock is down a little bit. So as you talk to analysts and investors, what are you hearing are the biggest concerns that you think could explain this? And what do you think analysts and investors are missing or misunderstanding? Albert Bourla : Let me start with the first one. We do expect that if there are successful combinations with flu that will drive the fluctuation of the corporate vaccine much higher, as you know, in our estimations will be expect, for example, in the U.S. around 24%, 25%, in the next few years of COVID vaccine. The flu right now utilization around 50. So, there is a big gap. So, that's why we believe that the combination between flu and COVID will arise also to the COVID. And eventually, we can call the way up to the same utilization like flu, particularly given that there are no copays in approved and recommended vaccines. Now as regards to the frustration, for the 2023, clearly, I believe that the stock price right now does not reflect the value that half Pfizer has. The fact that we are so proud because of our contribution in saving the world, I don't think, but we expect the stock price increases because of that. We did it because it was the right thing to do. And I think we are very, very proud of that. But we expect to see stock price increases as we are executing our plan, which is to create sustainable top line revenue growth that will allow us to leverage the bottom line that will grow faster than the top line. And I think we articulated the plan about that and that plan was to invest in acquiring good scientific substrate that will allow us to launch products that will give us $25 billion revenues by year 2030, and we have done tremendous progress on that by having already according to our calculation of $20 billion. We are also invested in R&D in the last in the past few years, and we have now an unprecedented launch of new products. And I think the street is expected to see how those launches will evolve. Clearly, I think there is overhang over the COVID revenues. There is uncertainty, if there COVID revenues will materialize, we don't have any precedents to show that we know how to predict it well. So our predictions are based on epidemiological science, and based on trends that we are testing with market people. So I think that from my perspective, what I said was that we are very committed to creating value for the shareholders. We know that everything we do, we do it with their money it's not our money. And we want to be very good stewards of that. So, it's not enough to save the world. I think also, we need to increase their surprise and are highly committed to do that by explaining better the strategy more importantly, executing on it. So with that, I think, gave me also team a good segue to close. In summary, we believe that was a solid quarter we deliver on our commitments, we exceeded actual expectations, we know from history. And we will continue doing so with a compass that we will create serious value for patience and that we are certain will translate into value for shareholders. We are executing our plan and we will remain very committed to doing that. Thank you very much to all and have a nice day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's teleconference and we appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at any time and have a wander day.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chris Stevo, Senior Vice President and Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Chris Stevo : Thank you, Chelsea. Good morning. Welcome to Pfizer\u2019s second quarter earnings call. I\u2019m joined today by Dr. Albert Bourla, our Chairman and CEO; Dave Denton, our CFO; Dr. Mikael Dolsten, Chief Scientific Officer and President of Pfizer Research & Development. Joining for the Q&A session, we also have Angela Hwang, Chief Commercial Officer and President, Global Biopharmaceuticals Business; Aamir Malik, our Chief Business Innovation Officer; Dr. Chris Boshoff, our Chief Oncology Research & Development Officer; and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel. Before we begin the call, I wanted to remind you of some logistical items. Materials for this call and other earnings related materials are on the Investor Relations section of pfizer.com. And of course, my favorite, our forward-looking statements, please see our forward-looking statements disclaimer on slide 3 and additional information regarding these statements and our non-GAAP financial measures is available on earnings release and our SEC forms 10-K and 10-Q under Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Information and factors that may affect future results. Forward-looking statements on the call are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, speak only as of the call\u2019s original date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Albert. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Chris. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our second quarter financial results were solid and in line with our expectations. Non-COVID-19 revenues grew 5% operationally compared with the year-ago quarter. Total revenues declined 53% operationally, primarily due to the anticipated revenue declines in both Paxlovid and Comirnaty. Even with these declines, our COVID-19 portfolio remained a significant contributor to the business with more than $1.6 billion in combined revenues during this quarter. Of course, our patient impact data are equally important because patients are the reason we exist. Through the first six months of the year, more than 356 million patients around the world were treated with our medicines and vaccines. We continue to make progress towards our goal of executing an unprecedented number of launches of new products or indications. In fact, Pfizer is more than halfway of its goal of launching 19 new products or indications in an 18-month span. In addition to the six approvals and five launches that occurred prior to 2023, we had six approvals and four launches in the first six months of 2023. For the second half of 2023, we expect six additional approvals and six additional launches, including the two launches that occurred in July. Then in 2024, we expect one approval and four launches, which, if approved and recommended, would raise the total to 19 new launches in approximately 18 months. As you can see in this chart, for this year\u2019s launches, we expect the revenue contribution to occur largely in the second half of 2023 because the first-half launches occurred late in the second quarter. And then in 2024, with the additional impact of next year\u2019s expected launches, we anticipate an even greater total contribution for our 19 launches. It\u2019s important to note that 18 of the 19 potential launches have been largely derisked from a technical perspective at this point, with the only one remaining being our RNA flu candidate. Equally encouraging is that our pipeline is expected to continue generating breakthrough treatments and vaccines long after the 19 we have been discussing. We recently reported milestones from several exciting pipeline candidates with the potential to be significant future value drivers. These include : Phase 3 data from marstacimab, a novel antibody being studied for the treatment of hemophilia A and B; regulatory filing acceptance for our hemophilia B gene therapy candidate; the publication in the New England Journal of Medicine of Phase 2 results for our vaccine candidate for maternal immunization against Group B Streptococcus; and first-in-human data from our pipeline of potential next-generation breast cancer treatments, including our novel CDK4, CDK2, and KAT6 inhibitors. Now, I would like to provide some commentary on our COVID-19 portfolio. As you all know, during the pandemic, Pfizer demonstrated impressively the power of our research and manufacturing capabilities by bringing to the world the first and most widely used vaccine and oral treatment for COVID-19. These scientific breakthroughs have played a significant role in bringing the global health crisis under control, and we are very proud of our contributions. The profits these products have generated to date have enabled us to invest in acquiring Arena, ReViral, Biohaven and Global Blood Therapeutics, which together we expect to contribute approximately $10 billion of revenues in 2030. In fact, the acquisitions of Biohaven and Global Blood Therapeutics are already contributing to our operational growth, while the acquisition of Arena is expected to start generating revenues toward the end of this year. We also remain very excited about our planned acquisition of Seagen, which, if approved, is expected to contribute more than $10 billion in 2030 revenues. As a result of the positive momentum of our non-COVID-19 revenues and, more importantly, the success of our COVID-19 portfolio, Pfizer\u2019s overall revenues have increased exponentially compared with our 2019 revenues, pro forma for the divestitures of Upjohn and our consumer business. This allowed us to increase investments in R&D and SI&A to support this new revenue base and our expected new product launches. The increased investments we are making in R&D and SI&A this year were sized based on certain revenue assumptions we made in January for both our COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 products. These assumptions also were incorporated in our 2023 financial guidance. Clearly, there is a higher level of uncertainty regarding the demand projections for our COVID-19 products than for the rest of the business. For example, in January, we shared our expectation that approximately 100 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines would be administered in the U.S. this year, of which we estimated Pfizer to capture 60% market share. In the first six months of 2023, 12.4 million doses were administered in the U.S. While the 12.4 million doses are behind our earlier projections, our market share for COVID-19 is ahead of our previous expectations at 65%. However, the vast majority of respiratory vaccinations happen during the fall and winter respiratory disease season, which starts in September, and we expect COVID-19 vaccinations to follow this pattern going forward. The uncertainty of the exact timing of Comirnaty commercialization was largely removed with the decision by the FDA and CDC to request a change in the composition of the vaccine to address the Omicron XBB 1.5 strain. We believe this will allow us to commercialize the vaccine in September, assuming the updated vaccines are approved and available by the end of August. In the European Union, the uncertainty regarding the vaccine\u2019s revenue contributions for 2023 and beyond was removed when we renegotiated successfully our long-term agreement. This agreement spreads the agreed volumes over four years, and while it puts pressure on this year\u2019s volumes, we believe it also provides longer-term revenue certainty in this important market. Similar to what we are experiencing with the vaccine, the second half of the year will play a bigger role in informing our expectations for the long-term demand for Paxlovid, the utilization of which follows very closely the COVID-19 infection rates. We expect a new COVID-19 wave to start in the U.S. this fall, and this expectation is supported by the increase in infection rates we are already seeing. Obviously, the severity of disease and people\u2019s desire for treatment also will be factors, as will the ongoing dialogue with the U.S. government regarding when we will transition to a commercial model for Paxlovid. These are the uncertainties. We are acutely aware that all these uncertainties are making it difficult to project the future revenues of Pfizer in this area and at large at Pfizer and also affecting our stock price, as a result. The good news is we will have much more clarity and certainty regarding how our COVID-19 products will perform in a commercial market, by the time we report our third-quarter financial results, and we expect the uncertainties to be largely eliminated by the end of the year. This is because we expect the vaccination and treatment rates from the upcoming respiratory disease season to be a reliable predictor of trends in subsequent years, with some potential upside of course, if a combination flu and COVID-19 vaccine is brought to market in the future. Additionally, by that point the timing of transitioning to full commercialization of both Comirnaty and Paxlovid should become clear. Despite this uncertainty, we will continue to invest in our COVID-19 portfolio this year in advance of the upcoming respiratory disease season. This is very important. But given the uncertainty, we are also preparing to have the ability to adjust our 2024 total cost base to align with various future COVID-19 revenue scenarios. In fact, we have already identified specific areas where we can make adjustments, primarily within our COVID-19 cost base, if demand comes in lower than expected. Dave will provide more details during his remarks. Next, I wanted to share a few quick updates of our planned acquisition of Seagen, which we believe will be a major driver of our future success. Seagen\u2019s shareholders recently overwhelmingly approved the planned acquisition, and we have already raised most of the external financing needed to fund the transaction. We also continue to work closely with regulators, including the Federal Trade Commission and the European Commission. In the meantime, our integration planning continues, which will allow us to hit the ground running following an anticipated close later in 2023 or early in 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Last week, we announced that Chris Boshoff has joined Pfizer\u2019s Executive Leadership Team as Chief Oncology Research and Development Officer and Executive Vice President, reporting directly to me. In this role, Chris will lead a new, end-to-end Oncology R&D organization and be the single point of accountability for the entire oncology pipeline, from discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development. This is similar to the structure we currently have in place for our Vaccines R&D organization, which has proven to be very productive. Pfizer and Seagen share a common vision to deliver life-saving treatments for people living with cancer, which is why I am so pleased that, after closing, Chris\u2019s Oncology leadership team will include talented, purpose-driven and highly productive leaders from both companies. And we made already announcements about the people that are joining Chris\u2019s leadership team. We believe this new structure will help further accelerate the delivery of cancer therapies, which is critical because in the battle against cancer, time is life. At Pfizer one of our core business principles is the belief that \u201cTrust is Everything.\u201d I\u2019m proud to share that in recent months, we have received some wonderful accolades that speak to the trust we are building with external stakeholders. We were named one of the 2023-2024 \u201cBest Companies to Work For\u201d by U.S. News & World Report. We were listed in Newsweek\u2019s list of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Greatest Workplaces 2023.\u201d For the third year in a row, Pfizer has earned a top 100 score in the 2023 \u201cDisability Equality Index.\u201d And our own Rady Johnson received the Disability :IN 2023 Executive Sponsor of the Year Award at the National Conference in July. Lastly, our PGS site in Ascoli, Italy is being recognized by the United Nations for the \u201cWelcome Award - Working for Refugee Integration.\u201d These recognitions are very important because they strengthen the unprecedented brand equity that Pfizer built during the COVID-19 pandemic. Before I hand it over to Dave, I want to quickly comment on the situation at our facility in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. First, all of us at Pfizer were relieved that no colleagues were seriously injured when the tornado struck. That said, our facility sustained substantial damage, as did the neighborhoods where many of our colleagues live, unfortunately. The local leadership team has done an incredible job responding to this devastating event, and we are proceeding with both, urgency and caution to determine the best way to get the site back online as quickly as possible, so as to minimize any impact on patients. Of course, we are also aking steps to ensure the continued safety of our colleagues and contractors, which remains our top priority. And with that, I will turn it over to Dave. And after Dave, Mikael will provide an update on our R&D pipeline. Dave? Dave Denton : Thank you, Albert, and good morning to everyone. Over the past 24 months, Pfizer has made important investments to position it squarely on track to achieve profitable and sustainable growth particulary in the back half of this decade. We have strategically invested to expand our commercial portfolio and our late-stage pipeline, strengthen our market launch capabilities, and enhanced innovation through internal R&D and business development actions. These deliberate efforts continue to solidify Pfizer\u2019s ability to overcome upcoming LOEs and drive sustainable revenue growth all while enhancing long-term shareholder value. To further support our long-term growth objectives, we are executing a capital allocation strategy designed to effectively deploy our cash. Our strategy is focused on three main pillars : first is reinvesting in our business; second is growing our dividends over time; and finally, making value-enhancing share repurchases. In the first half of 2023 alone, we\u2019ve invested $5.2 billion in internal R&D returned $4.6 billion to shareholders via our quarterly dividend; and allocated approximately $43 billion towards the proposed acquisition of Seagen. During the second quarter, Pfizer successfully completed a $31 billion unsecured debt offering across 8 tranches. The net proceeds of this debt offering will be used to substantially fund the Seagen acquisition. The new debt carries a weighted average yield of 4.93% and a weighted average maturity of 16.3 years, consistent with our expectations. On a full year run rate basis, the annual financing cost associated with the acquisition is expected to be nearly $2 billion. With the completion now of this debt offering, the company is now positioned to close the Seagen acquisition immediately upon post regulatory approvals. While we plan to continue investing in our business, we expect to de-lever our capital structure following the closing of Seagen transaction. As we de-lever it is our expectation to return to a more balanced capital allocation strategy inclusive of share repurchases. Now, with that, let me briefly cover a few highlights of our quarterly financial performance. As Albert said, our Q2 results were solid and in line with our expectations from both a top and bottom-line perspective, albeit slightly better than EPS consensus. As expected in our guidance, our overall Q2 revenues declined 53% operationally. The contraction of revenues was driven by the anticipated decline in Paxlovid and Comirnaty sales. We expect these products to transition to a commercial market in the second half of this year. Our operational revenue growth excluding our COVID products was in line with expectations at 5% versus Q2 of LY, with strong contributions from the inclusion of Nurtec and Oxbryta, as well as the continued growth from the Vyndaqel family. During Q2, adjusted SI&A expenses were $3.4 billion and grew 20% operationally versus LY. We continue to invest in support of our upcoming launches and grow our recently acquired products. While it\u2019s clear that these near-term investments are dampening our current profitability levels, we are laser-focused on maximizing the longer-term performance of these products. Now, moving to the bottom line, reported diluted EPS this quarter declined by 77% to $0.41, while adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.67 declined 65% on an operational basis. Earnings compressed at a greater rate than revenues, primarily due to the steep and anticipated contraction in Paxlovid sales during the quarter. Once again, foreign exchange movements continued to unfavorably impact our results, reducing second quarter revenues by approximately $280 million, or 1%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.05, or 2%, compared to last year. Now that we are at the halfway point of our 2023 financial plan, I\u2019d like to take a moment to reflect on how we are executing across our business while navigating within an incredibly unique and dynamic environment. As a management team, we remain committed to transparency and sharing our assessment of the evolving marketplace given the magnitude of launches; the ongoing shifting nature of the COVID landscape; and the continued integration of acquired assets. Let me begin by elaborating on our full-year 2023 financial guidance. We are narrowing our expectations for revenues to between $67 billion to $70 billion and maintaining guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.25 to $3.45 for the full year. For our more durable and predictable non-COVID revenues, we are updating our guidance range to 6% to 8% operational revenue growth. From a launch timing standpoint, I\u2019ll point out that the majority of our 2023 launches are anticipated to occur in the second half of 2023 and our commercialization schedule remains materially unchanged. As a company, we always strive to achieve the highest revenue level possible while maintaining a realistic view of key inputs that inform our outlook. Regarding RSV for older adults, the shared decision-making recommendation by ACIP is likely to slow its uptake in the U.S. In addition, the recent approval of Talzenna in the U.S. results in a more narrow patient population than originally planned. These factors coupled with the impact of the damaged Rocky Mount manufacturing facility presents near-term revenue challenges. However, we expect positive revenue momentum as we exit 2023 and head into 2024. Importantly, the long-term outlook for our non-COVID business remains intact relative to our 2030 ambitions. Turning now to our less predictable and more variable COVID portfolio. Year-to-date we have booked slightly over 40% of the $21.5 billion full-year revenue forecast for both Comirnaty and Paxlovid with the important fall vaccination and respiratory infection season ahead of us. We are acutely aware that COVID demand depends on many evolving market variables making the range of potential revenue outcomes increasingly large and difficult to predict with certainty. These variables include overall levels of vaccination and infection rates; the speed of draw-down of government inventory levels; and the mutating nature of the virus itself, just to name a few. In the interest of public health and with the important fall season ahead of us, we are maintaining our COVID revenue outlook for the year while continuing to invest, largely on a variable expense basis, to support our COVID products in 2023. These variable investments are important to support our efforts to reach as many patients as possible, helping to ensure the most at-risk individuals are both vaccinated and treated while maintaining our leading market share. We are proud of what we have achieved through the COVID portfolio, and this has allowed the Company to invest in support of its growth agenda for the back half of this decade. Our visibility into future COVID revenues and demands should improve through the remainder of 2023, as we gain clarity on a more typical annual revenue run-rate. We are well aware that our 2023 profit outlook is currently being dampened by incremental costs in support of our launches, as well as higher R&D investments aligned with the Company\u2019s current revenue base. We remain committed to both defending and growing our overall level of profitability. As Albert mentioned earlier, we expect this fall\u2019s performance of our COVID-19 products to help us more effectively forecast future sales performance. To that end, if our COVID-19 revenues are less than what we have assumed, we are prepared to launch an enterprise-wide cost improvement program aligned with the longer-term revenue projections for our business. This program would be designed to support our objective of growing our operating profit margin and we would expect it to begin to yield results in 2024. We look forward to sharing specific details of this program in our upcoming earnings calls. In closing, this is an extraordinary time for Pfizer. Our confidence and our commitment to our strategy and to achieving our 2030 goals is unwavering. We will continue to focus our efforts to drive growth while enhancing long-term shareholder value. And with that, let me now turn it over to Mikael. Dr. Mikael Dolsten : Thank you, Dave. Today, I will provide updates from a few different therapeutic focus areas, starting with breast cancer. We are working to deliver the next wave of innovative therapies for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. The pillars of this strategy are three-fold: establishing our investigational CDK4 inhibitor as a next-generation cell cycle therapy backbone, establishing vepdegestrant as a next-generation endocrine therapy backbone and establishing novel mechanisms like our investigational CDK2 inhibitor and KAT6 inhibitor candidates as next-gen combination partners to enhance efficacy. Our clinical strategy entails first developing assets for the metastatic setting in which Ibrance is currently the leader and unmet need is high, followed by an opportunity to expand to earlier-stage breast cancer including the CDK4/6-na\u00efve population and adjuvant/neoadjuvant settings. Data presented at ASCO from three key investigational medicines from our next-gen portfolio demonstrated anti-tumor activity in heavily pre-treated populations of patients with breast cancer. As a reminder, the majority of hormone receptor positive breast cancers express low CDK6, while CDK4 is likely to be a major cell cycle driver. We have seen that CDK4/6 inhibition can lead to neutropenia which requires more frequent blood test monitoring, mostly driven by CDK6 inhibition. Across the CDK4/6 inhibitor class, approximately 30% to 60% of patients experience severe neutropenia. On the left : In a Phase 1 dose escalation study in patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER 2-negative breast cancer, all of whom had previously received a CDK4/6 inhibitor, treatment with our CDK4 inhibitor in combination with endocrine therapy resulted in a confirmed objective response rate of 29%, clinical benefit response rate of 52% and median progression free survival of nearly 25 weeks. The combination was well-tolerated, which may enable maximal CDK4 inhibition. We are actively planning the Phase 3 randomized study. In addition, I\u2019d like to highlight encouraging data from the Phase 1 dose escalation study of our novel CDK2 inhibitor which showed monotherapy activity, including confirmed partial responses, in breast cancer patients who had previously received a CDK4/6 inhibitor. Also, durable confirmed clinical responses were observed in a Phase 1 trial of our novel KAT6 inhibitor as a monotherapy and in combination with endocrine therapy in heavily pretreated patients with breast cancer. Turning now to blood cancers, Elrexfio, also known as elranatamab, subject to regulatory approval, is expected to be the anchor of an anticipated multi-billion-dollar franchise. An FDA decision for the potential first indication in the triple-class relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma population is expected this year, and we continue to advance the MagnetisMM clinical programs to expand into earlier lines of treatment. In addition, the development of maplirpacept, also known as TTI-622, is underway, including in combination with Elrexfio, to support potential indications in myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia. Here, we show Elrexfio data presented at EHA from the MagnetisMM-3 trial in patients with triple-class refractory multiple myeloma who had no prior exposure to BCMA-directed therapy. On the left, we observed highly meaningful survival with Elrexfio monotherapy, with a 15-month overall survival of 57%. In patients who achieved a complete response, 15-month survival was remarkably 93%, underscoring the potential for deep and durable responses. We can see evidence of broad activity in multiple myeloma on the right, with the graph showing a single agent complete response rate of 35%, which rises to 46% in the subset of patients with two to three prior lines of therapy. Our ongoing randomized trials are in less pretreated to newly diagnosed populations. Subject to approval, Elrexfio may have key differentiators such as 50% lower hospitalization time during the step-up dosing period per protocol and an extended dosing interval that moves from once weekly to once every other week dosing beyond week 24. Turning now to hemophilia A and B, the pivotal trial of marstacimab met its primary endpoints, with statistically significant and clinically meaningful effect on annualized bleeding rate, or ABR. There was a 35% reduction in ABR compared to prophylactic factor replacement and 92% reduction in ABR versus ondemand factor replacement. Marstacimab offers a differentiated mechanism of action and dosing regimen compared to standard-of-care therapy. If approved, it has the potential to be the first once-weekly subcutaneous hemophilia B treatment for patients without inhibitors, and the first hemophilia A or B treatment administered in a patient-friendly pen as a flat dose. Regulatory submission is expected in the second half of 2023. Next, Litfulo, also known as ritlecitinib, is the first medicine to receive FDA approval to treat severe alopecia areata in both adults and adolescents 12 years and older. It also recently received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency\u2019s CHMP recommending body but is not yet approved. It has the potential to redefine the standard of care for alopecia areata. Litfulo is a first-of-its-kind kinase inhibitor with a unique mechanism that inhibits both the TEC kinase family and transiently JAK3, pathways that have been implicated in the alopecia areata pathophysiology. In addition, we are exploring how its unique mechanism of action could potentially be applied across immune disorders including vitiligo, in which a Phase 3 study is ongoing, and other potential indications. Finally, we are making excellent progress on the milestones we had set out through the first half of 2024. As Albert noted, we recently received FDA approval for Prevnar 20 in the pediatric population. We have robust strategies in place to potentially improve the protection provided by current pneumococcal vaccines. I look forward to sharing more about this in the coming quarters. In addition, we recently published Phase 2 data in the New England Journal of Medicine showing our Group B Streptococcus maternal vaccine candidate was generally well-tolerated and generated robust antibody levels. The journal also published a natural history study which was used to determine protective antibody levels at birth. These two studies indicated that the vaccine candidate may offer meaningful protection to infants born to immunized mothers. We were highly encouraged that Dr. Carol Baker, an infectious disease expert from the University of Texas Health Science Center, wrote an independent NEJM editorial highlighting the important future prospects of our GBS vaccine candidate. The progress of the GBS vaccine candidate dovetails nicely with the positive results and anticipated upcoming regulatory decisions for our RSV vaccine Abrysvo for administration to pregnant women. Abrysvo recently received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency\u2019s CHMP for both older adults and maternal immunization to help protect infants. Abrysvo is approved for older adults in the U.S. and under regulatory review for the maternal indication. In addition, we remain excited to see Phase 2 data from danuglipron by end of 2023, which we expect will enable us to finalize our Phase 3 plans. Finally, I\u2019ll call out the Phase 3 trial start of our anti-interferon Beta candidate for the treatment of inflammatory muscle myopathies, which has received a Fast Track Designation from FDA. Thank you. Let me turn it over to Chris to start the Q&A session. Chris Stevo : Thank you, Mikael. Chelsea, if you could please queue up the callers. We have at least 30 minutes for our Q&A session now. Operator : Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist Securities. Nicole Germino : This is Nicole on for Robyn. So just a quick question first. Can you -- on RSV, can you share what you expect the share decision making to slow the uptake in the U.S. would be? What we want to know if they can elaborate -- if you guys can elaborate on why you think this is the case the peak in annual sales is slower than previously expected? And how do you think ex-U.S. sales might be impacted if at all, given the ACIP decision. Dr. Albert Bourla : Maybe Angela can answer that. The question was, do you expect the share decision to have a big impact on RSV and also do we expect in the U.S. and also do we expect any impact, excluding the U.S.? Angela Hwang : Sure. So first of all, we\u2019re really excited about the approval for our RSV older adult vaccine. And the way I would see this shared clinical decision-making is just that it is a step towards the full routine recommendation that we anticipate, so. And I think that there is -- the way to look at it is that it\u2019s a short-term effect. We do expect that with more data that will emerge -- be emerging out of our clinical program, that we\u2019ll have an additional opportunity to go back to the ACIP and actually get the routine recommendation that we hope for. So, over the next year or so, as we collect and finalize our data, that is really the anticipation of it. So, it doesn\u2019t change the full opportunity for this particular vaccine. It doesn\u2019t change the peak. It just means that it takes us a little bit longer to get to the peak because of the shared clinical decision-making that -- that extra step that we have to take right now. Dr. Albert Bourla : And what about the ex-U.S.? Angela Hwang : Ex-U.S., actually, we had a different filing. We were able to get both maternal and older adult at the same time. So I think you see slightly different dynamics there and that here in the U.S., our maternal vaccine will be launching later. But in ex-U.S. and in Europe, they will be launching at the same time. And those vaccine technical committees have not opined yet on those recommendations, in particular in terms of the utilization. And so, we\u2019ll await that. But I think what you have that\u2019s different and that\u2019s really a great upside is the fact that we have both indications at once. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much, Angela. I hope we gave what you asked, Robyn. Operator, the next question please. Operator : Next, we have Umer Raffat with Evercore. Umer Raffat : I know I heard two different things on the cost cut just now. One was that it would be enterprise-wide, while Albert, I think, used the word within the COVID cost base. So I was just trying to reconcile the two. And also on danuglipron, is it reasonable to expect that if it\u2019s below mid-teens weight loss, you wouldn\u2019t move forward? Dr. Albert Bourla : Let me clarify. Of course, it would be enterprise-wide, but what I said is that the COVID part is going to be the biggest one. Right now, you need to know that R&D and SI&A cost of COVID is billions, it\u2019s not a small amount. So, it\u2019s -- there\u2019s a lot over there. Mikael, can you speak a little bit about the prospects to move ahead at danu? Dr. Mikael Dolsten : Well, we really look forward to get the data. And as you know, we have in parallel developed activities also for modified leads. I think we really need to look at the totality of data, its performance on important metabolic parameters in diabetes, its ability to deliver weight loss as you alluded to, and also, of course, its tolerability in general. These three implicate how well the drug can perform. And I remain optimistic that oral drugs in this class can have a profound effect on weight loss. Of course, one needs to be maybe a little bit caution to drive weight loss too far, as you have seen also some concerns in public media about side effects that may arise from that. So we will really integrate all of that data and make a decision, and we really look forward to that moment. Operator : Our next question will come from Evan Seigerman with BMO. Evan Seigerman : Kind of a follow-up from Umer\u2019s, I want to focus on the GLP-1 franchise. Can you talk about the competitive profile of danuglipron in its current form, considering safety, twice-daily dosing and efficacy? And maybe remind us on the time lines to potentially get more on a once-daily formulation of this asset? Dr. Albert Bourla : Mikael? Dr. Mikael Dolsten : Yes. As I said in my prepared remarks, we expect data at the later part of this year. We are absolutely encouraged and confident that it has a different profile when it comes to adverse events as the danuglipron that we sold. So we don\u2019t see that as an issue. And I spoke to that we will put together the totality of data to pending readout, prepare a potential Phase 3 program. And it\u2019s a very big sector, diabetes and obesity. We have considerable expertise in treating cardiometabolic patients. So, we look forward to share more data and more plans with you as we move to further quarter. Thank you for your great interest in this important space. Operator : Next, we have Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Terence Flynn : Maybe two for me. Dave, I was just wondering how we should think about steady-state operating margin here. Looking back pre-COVID, the Company was around mid- to high-30% range. So, is that how we should think about this when you gave us some of the parameters but just maybe how to think about steady state? And then, on the messenger RNA Phase 3 seasonal flu vaccine program, it looks like that trial was upsized based on clinicaltrials.gov. So just wondering, Mikael, if you can talk through timing of data and help frame expectations there. Thank you. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Terence. Let\u2019s start with Dave Dave Denton : Yes. So, great question. As we think about our operating margin long term, clearly, our objective is to expand that over time. Clearly, it is our expectation to get back to, at a minimum, pre-COVID levels with one caveat is that we -- as we go forward, we do have a different mix of products within our portfolio, particularly the vaccine related to COVID. As you know that the vaccine, given the cost share that we have or profit share that we have with our partner, does dilute that product from an operating margin perspective. So a mix adjusted, you should see us back to those levels over time. But obviously, as we cycle into \u201824, we\u2019ll give you a lot more clarity on all the puts and takes as we integrate Seagen, as we roll forward from a COVID franchise perspective, how that looks as well as all the developments that we have coming out the pipeline at this point in time. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you, David. Mikael mRNA flu. Dr. Mikael Dolsten : Yes. First, the totality of experience we have with mRNA for flu makes me very encouraged that this will be new modality as it was for COVID but now for flu, that engages two mechanisms, the B-cells and the T-cell that we should aspire for, having better efficacy than what we have seen with the old flu. We are continuing with the study because we just wanted to have more events and particularly have additional flu B type of events, which were scarce in the U.S. part of the trial. And we look forward to update you, hopefully, be able to conclude the study later this year. But we also are putting mitigations as adding immunogenicity studies that can be supplementary for getting a total good data package of activity against flu A and flu B. But as I said, I remain very optimistic that the mRNA is going to be the next important platform to deal with flu. Operator : Next, we have Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. Chris Shibutani : Two questions, if I may. On the potential enterprise-wide cost program, you would have some opportunity outside of the COVID programs to consider. Can you help us with the relative weighting potentially of R&D versus SG&A or some other component of that? And I ask that in part because you\u2019ve announced some changes, for instance, in kind of the structure at the top tier of management of the R&D with the anticipation of the oncology in Seattle Genetics. And then secondly, if I could, on the Rocky Mount facility, it\u2019s reassuring to hear in terms of your own staff. But I think folks are looking to get a sense for the scale of the damage and perhaps what potential gating factors for getting more information on the timing? I know that you guys have communicated with some of your hospital-based customers, but any additional insights in terms of magnitude of the impact and timing of the recovery, and what that could look like from a progress standpoint would be helpful. Dr. Albert Bourla : Let me say a few words about the Rocky Mount, and then I\u2019ll ask Dave to answer the question about the cost adjustment program in case we have a significant reduction on our revenues because of the COVID. The Rocky Mount, it was severe, the damage of the hurricane, but the damage was mainly concentrated on the warehouse, which means that we lost a lot of inventory that was about to be sent to the markets. The facilities per se, the production facilities were not impacted by the hurricane. So, the buildings are standing there. However, because the utilities were discontinued, the facilities had to stop operating. And in this highly sensitive, sterile environment, when you are losing power, it\u2019s not easy to switch on and switch off. It takes time and a lot of processes so that you can start. And the additional challenge will be some of the inventories of materials that were also destroyed, particularly glass and other stuff. We need to make sure that we will replace in time. So, what I want to say is that we feel very confident that the whole thing will go back to life. But still, we are assessing how long that will take. And we are doing anything we can to make sure that we will minimize the shortages in the marketplace because of that. Now, let\u2019s move to some more color on the cost adjustment program. Dave Denton : Yes. So, thank you for the question. Clearly, as we develop this program in the back half of \u201823, we look forward to sharing a lot more details as we cycle into \u201824 and give you a lot of, I\u2019ll say, milestones as you think about both our cost and investment structure going forward. Importantly, as you know, we\u2019re extremely excited about the Seagen acquisition that\u2019s upcoming here. Upon approval, this will allow the Company to refocus its efforts and its investments to make sure that we\u2019re squarely focused on battling cancer going forward. And we think there\u2019s a big opportunity as we align our resources against that franchise in that battle to fight cancer and an opportunity for patients and importantly, an opportunity long term for Pfizer. Having said that, we will be informed in the back half of the year of our revenue performance, specifically as it relates to COVID. That will inform us the level of opportunity we have to expand our margins into \u201824 and \u201825 and beyond. That will allow us to step back and make sure that all of our costs, all our investments are aligned with those Seagen objectives as well as aligned to maximizing the performance of our in-line portfolio as well as the launches that are occurring as we speak in the back half of this year. So, again, we look forward to sharing a lot more to this from this. This will be balanced, as you well know between SI&A and R&D, and we\u2019ll give you that specific breakdown and that specific information later this year and into next year. Operator : Next, we have Louise Chen with Cantor. Louise Chen : I wanted to ask you first on these COVID scenarios that you think could unfold in the second half \u201823. Any way you could share some of the big ones that you anticipate could potentially happen? And then, secondly, seeing a lot of headlines in the ATTR-CM space. I\u2019m just curious if you anticipate any potential competition or meaningful competition to Vyndaqel and Vyndamax. Dr. Albert Bourla : All right. So, on the COVID, I will say a few words and then I will ask Angela to comment on both. Look, the COVID scenario, it depends what are the uncertainties? I think I articulated. Let\u2019s start with the vaccine. The biggest uncertainty is vaccination rates. I think market share is pretty much, I think, well established. Vaccination rate is what we are going to see in the fall that is coming. So, that will be a big uncertainty. Another uncertainty was the time of commercialization in the U.S. because, of course, you go with new inventories, new sales to the market and with higher prices. That has been resolved. We know that it\u2019s very likely that we launch in September because FDA and CDC, they asked us to change the inventories basically by creating a new vaccine. So, that will happen. And also, the other uncertainty that existed about the COVID vaccine was the European contract. That was a very long -- very big contract. And now we have the certainty that it has been negotiated, a little bit less for the year because it\u2019s spread over four years, but let\u2019s say, renegotiated. So all of that are -- the key, of course, there is how much the Japan, Latin America and other countries will purchase, it\u2019s not the only ones, but let\u2019s say, those are the fundamentals. And we will know pretty much the trend in the third quarter. And we will know pretty much quite accurate what is the situation in the end of the year, but I think will be a very good predictor of what we should expect going forward with the only upside if we have a combined vaccine with flu or with RSV, that will increase the vaccination rate. On Paxlovid, a little bit more uncertainty because, of course, we are having the uncertainty of treatment rates and infection rates. And we don\u2019t know how that behaves. We don\u2019t have any benchmark to see how that goes. We know that the treatment rates are following very close the infection rates, and the infection rates are rising right now, but that remains to be seen how that will go. Of course, also the sales of Paxlovid are rising as we see in the market, the scripts on a weekly basis as always do when the infection rates are going up. But we have some more uncertainty, which is the timing of launch, which will depend on how we will agree for the interest of public health to transition this launch with the U.S. government. So, all of that remains to be seen. And these are the scenarios that we see for COVID. And the key message is the uncertainty will go away at the end of the year. We will know what COVID will contribute on a stable basis in Pfizer\u2019s revenue and we will go from there. Now, Angela, maybe if you want anything to add to that and also about the next question -- the other question. Angela Hwang : Louise, I think when you talk about Vyndamax or Vyndaqel, the biggest and our biggest differentiator that we\u2019re extremely confident about is just the totality of our data really along four dimensions. And whether that\u2019s clinical data or real-world data, we have all-cause mortality and CV-related hospitalization data. Our data is also relevant in both hereditary and wild-type ATTR-CM, so that\u2019s unique. We\u2019ve also demonstrated significant survival benefit at five years through our real-world data. So whichever way you look at it and you compare that with any competitor program, I think that we have a highly differentiated and an extremely valuable molecule that stacks up well against any competition. Operator : Next, we have Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Mohit Bansal : Maybe a follow-up to this one a little bit. So, thank you for all the transparency by the way. So, is it fair to say that in COVID trends that you have seen so far, at least sales trend that has been below your expectations, and you want to see one more quarter before you adjust expectations. I\u2019m asking this because if I look at the -- it seems like you still expect 88 million or so vaccinations in the second half of the year in the U.S. and the number was actually, by our calculation, 44 million or so in terms of administration, 111 million in terms of shipments. So, just trying to understand, is it like -- is it something where you are -- where we could get better update in third quarter on the COVID numbers? Thank you. Dr. Albert Bourla : Yes. Thank you for the question. I think the answer is yes, we should get way better feeling. It\u2019s not that we just want to see another quarter. We want to see the big quarter of good respiratory season. COVID, we always said and everybody, I think, thinks that that is a common sense that will follow going forward the seasonality of the other respiratory vaccines, thus becoming more and more and more clear, right? And the majority of these vaccinations are happening in the third and fourth quarter for the year. So it\u2019s not that we are just another quarter. We\u2019re awaiting the main quarter. If COVID vaccinations go anywhere close to the flu vaccination rates, then we have a very big bit of what we expect to have. If they are a small fraction of what will happen for flu, then of course, we have a mix. So, that\u2019s why we are going to see how that will evolve. So it\u2019s a very, very important quarter. The rest, although for the first half of the year, we have quite significant contribution towards the total growth. So, we don\u2019t need -- not much of inventory if we get the utilization over there to make sure that we know how big the COVID franchise will become. And as I said, in the EU, we have adjusted very well. We will have high certainty, Paxlovid also. It\u2019s a very, very good market. We don\u2019t know how in the next wave the Paxlovid will be used. We have the rest of the world, but the inventories, they were also last year. So we are now expecting that products will start being going -- other expiring or product will start more reordering from many more countries. So that\u2019s why the infection rates on the Paxlovid will be extremely, extremely important. And all of that are happening now. So, once we know them, we can predict way more accurate. Thank you very much. Operator : Next, we have Trung Huynh with Credit Suisse. Trung Huynh : You commented the long-term outlook for your non-COVID business remains intact relative to the 2030 ambitions. How are you thinking about the midterm 2025 guide because if you assume the midpoint of your ex-COVID \u201823 guide at 7%, in order to achieve the 6% 2020 to 2025 guidance ex-COVID, on our calculations, you need to do high single-digit growth for that base business for \u201824 and \u201825. That looks tough especially as you\u2019ll have more LOEs. So, do you remain confident in that midterm guide? Dr. Albert Bourla : Yes. Thank you. The LOEs are coming basically from year \u201826, right? So, all the way to \u201825, I think the impact will not be that high. Also, the guidance that we gave was 6%, yes, we feel quite confident that we will be there. So, we\u2019ll continue and we are at 6% right now all these years, right, year-to-date. So yes, the non-COVID business, I think, clearly, the success of the launches is very important. So we\u2019ll see a lot of things coming ahead of us. But it is a way better predictable. And I think we are there. So, I don\u2019t think there will be any variability. Operator : Next, we have Colin Bristow with UBS. Colin Bristow : Another follow-up on danuglipron. I don\u2019t think I heard the answer in terms of when we\u2019ll hear about the once-daily formulation. And I\u2019d just like to understand your level of confidence here that you can make this a once-daily formulation without negatively impacting the AE profile, presumably given an increase in Cmax? And then more broadly, can you just talk more about how you\u2019re going to compete here, given I think it was previously referenced you\u2019re behind the competition, the clinical differentiation, the potentially less convenient dosing and essentially a therapeutic category in which you don\u2019t have a major presence. And then just maybe one other quick one on the pipeline item on DMD gene therapy, it\u2019s a late-stage asset that doesn\u2019t seem to get much air time. Is your enthusiasm waning on this program or is it just that others are sort of a bigger priority? Dr. Albert Bourla : Yes. Thank you. So, Mikael, again, clearly the obesity market and the size of it is creating a lot of interest in danuglipron. And so the question was about the one day formulation. And then also tell us a little bit about where we are with DMD. Dr. Mikael Dolsten : I hear your interest in a once-daily product, and I would say I don\u2019t see any technical barrier for us in creating that. We have tremendous experience in modified release formulations. And our early data, as we now have initiated a while ago, tells us we should be encouraged that when it relates to once-a-day modified release for danuglipron, I believe we will have such a formulation in a reasonable future in our hands. When could it come to the market if the drug continues and makes a great Phase 3? Well, I think we can have it at launch or shortly after launch. So I wouldn\u2019t worry about that. But I agree with you that once-daily modified release can sometimes actually improve the tolerability profile by a slew than the variability and exposure, which typically reduce GI side effects that have been seen as limiting this drug. So that\u2019s why I can see a potential twofold advantage of MR goes from twice a day to once a day and may also help uniquely to create a tolerability profile within the structure of GLPs. [Ph] DMD gene therapy, I\u2019m encouraged that FDA took a very positive angle on that drug when it comes to its urgency to get into the market. Chris, you and I have worked very closely on that, and we expect today we\u2019ll look relatively soon to conclude the trial. I\u2019ll also ask Chris to pitch in on it. Dr. Chris Boshoff : Thank you, Mikael. So the DMD program is obviously very important for us, not just for the importance of gene therapy but for patients and families with this absolutely devastating disease. And we do have an interim analysis later this year for the CIFFREO trial. The CIFFREO trial, all patients have now been enrolled in the study. The interim analysis will be based not on a surrogate biomarker end point but on truly functional end point. So, we believe that\u2019s the best way to measure the benefit of gene therapy in this disease is with a functional end point. And that should come later this year, and we\u2019ll update you with the final analysis for the study then in 2024. Dr. Albert Bourla : That was terrific. I just wanted to add that we have, like you heard Sarepta, ample biomarker that look very robust in our hand. But as Chris said, we want to provide patients with even more experience about the potential benefit. Operator : Next, we have Kerry Holford with Berenberg. Kerry Holford : A couple of questions [Technical Difficulty] savings. It\u2019s clear that demand for your COVID assets will influence whether or not you go down this route. But given the potential you\u2019ve highlighted previously for a COVID flu combination vaccine, I\u2019m interested to understand whether the upcoming Phase 3 data from your mRNA flu vaccine trial will influence your decisions on that cost saving program in any way. And then, secondly, on hemophilia, your anti-TFPI filing second half of the year for non-inhibitor patients. Should we assume you would seek to launch in that patient group only next year, or would you wait for the data in the inhibitor patient group before you proceed to market? And perhaps you can just discuss how big an opportunity you see in that drug. Dr. Albert Bourla : Let me start with the COVID and then Mikael also can comment. But for example, we are very excited about the combinations, right? And the combinations will be flu and COVID and then hopefully also flu, COVID and RSV. And we are working on that. And we believe actually that the fact that if we have a combination with the non-mRNA included over there, we\u2019ll have likely that we expect to have the benefit of better safety profile because we don\u2019t have to load three products RNA into a single injection, but we will be using only two, COVID and flu, and then we\u2019ll use the protein-based vaccine, which has very -- profile in RSVs. All of that are working very well. Now, the question is what will happen if the COVID market is seen to be very -- as monovalent as very, very low. I think that will play a key role in our decision about controlling the cost. Because if it is very, very low, although we expect an upside in the combination, we will assume at this stage that the medical need for COVID is not that high. And as a result, we will reduce our investments in the area and also will temper our expectations for sales. And then if the combinations come and we are way more successful, that\u2019s a different story. You want also -- what was your second question? Yes, about marstacimab, Mikael? Dr. Mikael Dolsten : I\u2019m very excited about marstacimab. I followed this projects for a long time. And as you know, we reported our very encouraging data. We had 92% reduction in annual bleeding rate versus on demand. We had really no safety events as had been associated with other products, including Hemlibra. It\u2019s active against both in A and B. It\u2019s administrated with a pre-fill pen. I think it can be, from a medical point of view, a very large product, a single option for hemophilia A and B. Of course, when I think about how Hemlibra has been such a promise for in A patient and I see this profile that it\u2019s so good, I\u2019m optimistic that it can do well in both segments. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much. Let\u2019s move to the next question, please. And we are a little bit -- the time is flying, so a lot of interest. So let\u2019s try to be more -- 1 question, please, each one. Operator : Our next question will come from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Geoff Meacham : Just had two real quick ones. Angela, on Prevnar, what does long-term growth look like? Clearly, you may have a tougher competitive environment. Just if you lose share, what do you think the TAM growth could look like to offset that? And then, Mikael, you talked a little bit about next-gen CDK. I know it\u2019s super early in development. But is there a risk-benefit hurdle you have in mind? I\u2019m just thinking about cost benefit post the Ibrance LOE and also considering the competitive landscape. Dr. Albert Bourla : So Angela, how concerned you are with the competitive environment? I know with respect to our competitors, but we have some realities that maybe you want to discuss. And also, I would like actually Chris Boshoff to answer the question of CDK4 since we have him here in his new capacity. Angela? Angela Hwang : Well, I mean, I want to begin by just saying how I\u2019m incredibly proud we are of the performance of the entire Prevnar franchise. If you look at the adult indication, we have grown -- not only have we grown 23% since last year this time, we are doing all of this growth prior to the fall vaccination season, which is what you typically see. So the fact that we\u2019ve been able to bring these vaccinations will tell us a lot about the work that we\u2019ve done in pneumococcal disease, how well appreciated it is, but also how well our machinery is working, not to mention the fact that we have 96% share of the adult indication. In peds also, of course, being that we went from 100% of the market, today, we share some of that market share with PCV15. But I just want to remind everyone that that is to be expected, and we are exactly where we thought we would be. And so from that perspective, we\u2019re also really proud of how Prevnar 13 has competed with PCV15. I think the important thing here to realize is that given the ACIP recommendation that we\u2019ve just got for Prevnar peds what we are beginning to see now is a sort of reversal of that decline and the reclaiming of market share. And so, we have -- the fact that we\u2019ve seen some accounts purchasing PCV20 peds now, we\u2019ve seen some account switching from PCV15 to our own Prevnar 20, the fact that our federal contracts had added Prevnar 20 to their register, which means that public vaccinations can begin. And then maybe the one thing I will mention about Prevnar peds, which is unique compared to any other pneumococcal vaccine, which is that we were given the recommendations to vaccinate -- well, kids 2 to 18 immunocompromised. So that is a whole new population that we\u2019ve never had before. So, when you kind of bring all of this together and you factor that this quarter alone, Prevnar franchise generated $1.3 billion in revenue, just this one quarter, I think that order of magnitude gives you a sense of the scale and the competitiveness of our portfolio, and we\u2019re really excited about what Prevnar can do over the next coming quarters. Dr. Albert Bourla : And that is under the competition of PCV15, which I think was around 150 million, if I\u2019m not mistaken. Chris, can you please speak about the CDK4 and the franchise in general over there? Dr. Chris Boshoff : Thank you for the question. So, as you know, ER-positive breast cancer is the most common cancer globally for women, and we were very proud that we can build on our leadership in cell cycle inhibition with Ibrance, and with 3 first-in-class potential assets, CDK4-specific inhibitor, CDK2-specific inhibitor and a KAT6-specific inhibitor, all through the significant potential to transform treatment in the future for ER-positive breast cancer. For CDK4, we have seen more complete and continuous CDK4 target coverage and potentially improved tolerability due to reduced CDK6 inhibition. And as Mikael has pointed out, CDK6 leads to the hematological vulnerability. We know that epithelial cell specifically highly expressed CDK4, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to specifically target CDK4. And what we\u2019ve seen, as Mikael has pointed out, is Grade 3 neutropenia are 15% of our CDK4 inhibitor, and that\u2019s versus 60% as expected with other CDK4/6 inhibitors. We\u2019ve also not noted any Grade 3 diarrhea. And again, that\u2019s very different from what you know from some of the other CDK4/6 inhibitors. We\u2019re accelerating our registration strategy with the first study in second-line post CDK4/6, where we\u2019ve recently shown 30% overall response rate in a heavy pretreated population, and we\u2019re also starting populations with CDK4 plus CDK2 as well as CDK4 with our potential next-generation backbone, ARV-471 or vepdegestrant, which we are codeveloping with Arvinas. Operator : Next, we have Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Tim Anderson : If I could go back to the COVID guidance, investors have been cautious not only on the level of your prior guidance for \u201823 but also the shape of the future revenue curves beyond \u201823. So, my question is on the latter, shape of the future curve. Are you confident still in saying that 2023 should be the trough, and then you\u2019ll rebound to some higher level of sales in 2024 and beyond and see kind of continued growth from that point forward, or is that now more uncertain, too? Dr. Albert Bourla : Yes. I think that this year\u2019s utilization at the marketplace will form the basis that we can predict reliably for the next years. I don\u2019t think it will be any much different because there will be no different categories in the marketplace. Vaccination rates will settle and then the treatment and infection rates also would be, after a new year, indicate what we should expect periodically. Clearly, we will have to deal with some inventories movements, and this year was a transition year because we are going to give prices, and we are going to absorb some of inventories, et cetera. So that should be for the accurate number for \u201824 and beyond, but should be the base and likely should be higher than what you should see this year. But that -- provided that we have a reasonable vaccination and treatment range of Paxlovid. So that\u2019s why I say that let\u2019s wait to see what would be the actual in this year and clearly, what will be the utilization, as I said. Because next year, all these inventories and price adjustment things will be very clear what it will be. So thank you very much for the question. Let\u2019s move to the next question, please. Operator : Our next question will come from Carter Gould with Barclays. Carter Gould : Good morning. And thank you for taking the question and for all the transparency on your thought process on the COVID side. Plenty of good -- great questions asked this morning. I guess, one I want -- didn\u2019t get addressed is you out-licensed TL1A late last year, your partner, then turns around and sells it for quite substantially more. I guess, so to be a bit provocative, Albert, were Pfizer shareholders well served by this course of events? I would love to give you the opportunity to address that publicly. Thank you. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Carter, for giving us this opportunity. And also thank you for recognizing the transparency. I think that\u2019s very important, particularly when there\u2019s uncertainty. We should all know what the scenarios and the parameters are and what the actions that could be potentially triggered for different scenarios. Now let\u2019s go to TL1A and let\u2019s see what is the situation, Aamir. Have we served the shareholders the best of our knowledge or not? Aamir Malik : Thanks for the question, Carter. And obviously, I\u2019m not going to comment on the rumors and speculation or the potential prices attached to different transactions. What I will say is we\u2019re very pleased with our TL1A Telavant partnership with Roivant and we do think shareholders were well served. So, as a reminder, why we entered this? We entered this as an R&D portfolio prioritization decision. So from time to time, we make decisions as part of our disciplined process to our partner R&D programs, where we think it is better to share the risk or the cost with a partner. And in this case, Telavant covers all of the R&D costs going forward. And that frees up significant R&D capacity for Pfizer to invest in high priority programs. But we still retained value in this program in three different ways. We had a 25% equity stake in Telavant. We have full ex U.S. and ex Japan rights and we earned royalties on the U.S. and Japan sales. So, taken together, this collaboration allows us to keep more than 50% of the total value of TL1A with zero incremental R&D spend. And for a Phase 2 program, we feel this is a very sound move for Pfizer shareholders. Dr. Albert Bourla : Mikael, anything to add here? Dr. Mikael Dolsten : Aamir, said it well. And I just wanted to punctuate among the very many options, we have a strong platform in bispecific in many therapeutic, including in immunology and we do have TL1A antibody. That would be very interesting, where we own an even greater share. We have triple specifics that are going into atopic dermatitis. So it just punctuates. Even in the very same therapeutic area, we have so many things going on. And near term, we expect soon approval for etrasimod and another readout [indiscernible]. So a lot to start there. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael. Don\u2019t tip competition too much about what we have in our pocket. So let\u2019s go to the next question. Operator : Next, we have Steve Scala with Cowen. Steve Scala : I just have an observation than a question, but the observation is that it\u2019s still not clear what has changed in your long-term COVID expectations versus when you first gave the $30 billion guidance 6 months ago since in the prior 6 months, nothing really has changed other than FDA action, which doesn\u2019t impact the long term. So, that\u2019s just an observation. But my question is on Vyndaqel. Vyndaqel has become a very important franchise, yet its exclusivity is not long in either the U.S. or the EU. Are there any strategies to get around the LOEs, or is it simply similar to Eliquis where post LOEs, Pfizer -- move on to other products? Dr. Albert Bourla : Yes. So, why don\u2019t you take the question, Angela? Angela Hwang : Yes. Well, it is, as you say, an incredibly important product, and we\u2019re just so proud of the fact that it\u2019s still growing 40-something percent this quarter. I think when it comes to LOEs, just from the perspective of how we see it, our composition of matter at patent expires in 2024, but we are -- patent term extensions that get us through December of 2028; in the EU, it\u2019s 2026; in Japan, it goes right up to 2029. So actually, I feel like we still have a good runway as it pertains to this product, more diagnoses that we need to do and more patients that we can capture on to Vyndaqel, especially with the incredibly competitive and differentiated profile that we have. As you say, we\u2019re always, and working with Aamir, looking at opportunities as to what might be good fit into what might fit well into this franchise in this portfolio. But I guess from my perspective, with or without it, we see an incredibly strong opportunity for us to continue to capture growth. Operator : Next question comes from David Risinger with Leerink Partners. David Risinger : So my question is on Pfizer\u2019s mRNA flu vaccine candidate, please. And Sanofi had stated at its recent Vaccines Analyst Day that first-generation mRNAs against flu will not deliver sufficient strain B efficacy, given mRNA technical issues in targeting strain B. So, could you just comment on that and your expectations for your vaccine\u2019s southern hemisphere strain B efficacy results later this year? I know that there wasn\u2019t the emergence of strain B in the northern hemisphere, but I\u2019m curious about your expectations for demonstrating that strain B efficacy in the southern hemisphere. And then in addition, if you could just comment on your expected reactogenicity profile for mRNA flu versus Comirnaty\u2019s reactogenicity profile? Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much, David. Very good questions. Mikael, so are technical issues that Sanofi is having, are we experiencing as well. Dr. Mikael Dolsten : Well, I think the difference between maybe the pioneering mRNA companies Pfizer and of course there is Moderna that have worked on this technology in many years. We have ourselves been 5 years into it and make ample improvement across the entire mRNA chain. And I think it just gives us a big leg up and an what experience we had with COVID vaccine. So, I can\u2019t really comment on the issues that Sanofi are facing. I share a much more positive -- I have a much more positive outlook that we have in our capability to design mRNA vaccines that will be powerful against flu A and also against flu B. And let\u2019s wait as we accumulate data and see the outcome. But, I\u2019m optimistic about that and realize it\u2019s a field that requires a lot of capability to enter. Dr. Albert Bourla : What about the reactogenicity? Dr. Mikael Dolsten : The flu reactogenicity has actually been moderate, been really good. So, that\u2019s not an issue at all at end of the doses that we have been testing in young or older patients. Operator : Next, we have Andrew Baum with Citi. Andrew Baum : Could you talk about the impact of price negotiation under the IRA? Expressly, could you talk to whether you\u2019ll be able to collapse the rebate to PBMs in order to offset the impact of, let\u2019s say, Eliquis price reduction, following the price negotiations and therefore, protect your earnings, or do you think you\u2019ll have to still pay the PBMs their pound of flesh, even though they\u2019re being able to buy the drug at a much reduced price or fund the drug at a much reduced price? And then separately, for Mikael, given the recent acquisition of Seagen, to what extent -- or planned acquisition of Seagen, to what extent do you believe that there is a potential to review your existing pipeline in order to make room or further optimize your R&D spend to put behind Seagen\u2019s additional assets? Dr. Albert Bourla : Yes. So, why don\u2019t we go first to answer about what IRA will mean in terms of changing the rebates, et cetera, which it\u2019s quite a new situation. So, we have to see how it plays. But if you want to speak a little bit about it, Angela? Angela Hwang : Yes, sure. So, that\u2019s exactly right, Albert. I think there\u2019s just -- it\u2019s a new policy and lots to understand in terms of how it\u2019s going to play out. As you say, there will be price negotiations, but at the same time, I think that what we also have to remember, Andrew, is that there\u2019s a mitigating factor of the fact that more patients likely will be able to get on Eliquis because of the co-pay threshold and that sort of cap we\u2019re going to have as a function of IRA. And so, I think it\u2019s a dynamic situation. There\u2019s a lot for us to consider as it pertains to pricing, rebates, but also patient utilization of the drug and all of this will play out. I guess, as it pertains specifically also to Eliquis, just to remind everyone that those obviously one of our largest drugs, its LOE will be around that \u201826 time frame. So, whatever the impact is, will not be long lasting on our portfolio because it\u2019s losing patent anyway around that time. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much, Angela. It\u2019s an evolving environment, so we need to really see. Also, Andrew, very quickly on the pipeline issue, we have made very clear about the Seagen acquisition will mean nothing to the pipeline assets. So, no pipeline assets will be eliminated or reduced or increased as a result of -- actually, would be increased because of the combination but will not be any reductions on pipeline assets as a result of this acquisition. Operator : Next, we have Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Chris Schott : Just a two-parter on Comirnaty. Can you just help me a little bit in terms of, I guess, with the updated vaccine being commercialized in September, how much of your remaining COVID revenue should we think about in 3Q versus 4Q? And I\u2019m just trying to get my sense of when we get this 3Q update, will that be based on the sales we\u2019re seeing in the quarter or more your interpretation of the trend we\u2019re seeing for vaccinations, so just setting expectations? And the second part was on the EU contract renegotiation. Just any additional color you can provide on how different, I guess, the terms end up being for 2023 relative to what was reflected in the 2023 guidance? Dr. Albert Bourla : I can take it very quickly. Look, if you see, we will have basically July, August, September in the third quarter. So the vaccinations with the new will start in September, hopefully. Of course, what we expect is that we will have approval by the end of the August. And we are ready with product already now. So we have -- so the production will not be an issue. So normally, we should have also in Q3, most of it in Q4. But what really will clarify us at the end of Q3 plus also the month that takes after Q3 until we give -- we present our Q3 results. It is really vaccination rate. That is what will inform. And the net price, right? Because everything after all, we\u2019ll know way better what the net price. Also very big part of this uncertainty for Comirnaty will go away. On the EU contract renegotiation, I don\u2019t know if you noticed, I did say that when we gave our guidance, we were expecting that we will have incorporated assumptions that we will renegotiate the EU contract. And our assumptions were assuming that we will do over three years. Now we did over four years that creates a pressure to our guidance, but then we had some contracts that we didn\u2019t expect, guidance in Latin America, particularly but offset very big part of that. So that\u2019s why there\u2019s no -- that\u2019s but by itself is not a reason to change the guidance one way or another. Really, as I said, vaccination rates, it is what will define what is the potential of these vaccines for the years to come. Thank you very much, Chris. And then, we\u2019ll go to the next question, please. Operator : Next, we have Rajesh Kumar with HSBC. Rajesh Kumar : Just one for me. You\u2019re doing a lot of acquisitions. You\u2019ve done a large one, Seagen recently, it\u2019s not completed. But as we look forward, how do you think the -- what are the sort of integration challenges you see, both on the execution, commercial side but also on the scientific side? What are the things that get you excited versus worried? Dr. Albert Bourla : For the Seagen acquisition, right? Yes. Let me start\u2026 Rajesh Kumar : Multiple acquisitions before that as well. So just you\u2019ve got multi integrations going on sort of, that\u2019s why I asked the question. Dr. Albert Bourla : Yes. So let me start with what excites us with Seagen. And I think there\u2019s the science behind this company. The ADCs are playing a key role right now, more and more in our research and in our fight against cancer. And Seagen has one of the two leading platforms and we believe it\u2019s actually a better one. So, I think that excites me a lot. Also what excites me a lot is that Seagen was able to achieve all this greatness with limited resources relatively compared to what we are bringing on the table. And what we are bringing on the table on the research front, of course, is not only the capital but also a significant expertise in designing the molecules. And particularly in the small molecules, we are very, very, very good. So when it speaks about payloads, I think we can contribute significantly into that. Secondly, we are thinking that there is such a nice way of being able to commercialize those products of Seagen that are already in the market or we can because as we look at global presence, that Seagen is lucky. And also in the U.S., we will almost triple our resources, once the whole thing is integrated. So, there is a lot of things to be excited. Now, as you rightly pointed out, things happen in integration but you need to be very aware. And not only we -- I do have our fair share of things that we did wrong in the past and we have our fair share of things that we did right in the past. So, I know what is extremely, extremely important is to make sure that, first of all, there will be no cultural clash as we are putting together the two organizations. To that end, we are very, very lucky because oncology companies tend to have very, very similar cultures, irrelevant they are small or big, they\u2019re oncology companies. And that was evident in the chemistry of our scientists compared to the Seagen scientists. Actually, where it is really evident, it is how many of the great scientists of Seagen raised their hand to join Chris\u2019s leadership team as we\u2019re going forward. And those scientists we have published this information, who will be coming from Seagen. Actually, many of them will lead the global oncology business, not only \u2013 acquisition, not only the Pfizer one but they will lead the global -- not only the Seagen one but the global, which is Seagen plus global. The second thing that we need to be very careful is that we don\u2019t slow down things, and we don\u2019t increase cost of things. This is something that we have seen when big companies are acquiring small that many times cost goes double and the time lines goes also double. So that\u2019s something that we must avoid. And in order to avoid, we are doing tremendous pre-integration planning to make sure that innovation will be enhanced dramatically after we are putting the two together. And I have full trust on, of course, Chris, that is leading this integration on this planning for months now. And last but not least, many times, when you have an integration, it could go wrong and it\u2019s good if the CEO, which is the one who can resolve conflicts in a corporation and make decisions fast, has very high visibility in what was happening. So I went very fast. This is our biggest investment for many decades. That\u2019s clearly the biggest investment under my watch. And we take it very seriously as one of the most potential exciting opportunities to grow but also, we are very cognizant that we should make sure that nothing goes wrong. So I\u2019m personally on it and Seagen is going to be one of our biggest bets as you can see going forward. So we are using all our experience and the best people and are very, very pleased. I\u2019m very, very pleased because chemistry of the two teams is unbeatable right now. And they are working like one and they are all coming to see the new Seagen/Pfizer oncology portfolio growing faster than when we were alone. And with that, we will move to our last question. Operator : Our last question will come from Michelle Rivera with inThought Research. Michelle Rivera : What\u2019s the status of the DMD gene therapy program? Have you finalized dosing patients? I read a statement at a recent conference that you finalized screening patients. So, I was not sure whether that meant that the trial had been paused. Just some clarity around that and when we should expect data would be helpful. Thank you. Dr. Albert Bourla : Yes. Chris, you were running DMD until recently. Now, you of course, provided to Mikael the responsibility. So, can you give us a little bit very quickly what is the status of DMD? Dr. Chris Boshoff : Yes. Thank you. So the -- as I mentioned earlier, the cynical trial has now completed enrollment. And as you pointed out, we halt dosing for the last couple of patients due to a protocol amendment, but we\u2019re very confident that we will go ahead and have the interim analysis later this year based on the functional end point which will be substituted also or which will be -- yes, with the biomarker data, so we\u2019ll have both functional data as well as biomarker data later this year, and then the final analysis for the full study in 2024. We\u2019ve also fully enrolled now the earlier age group patients between the ages of 2 and 3 years old, 10 patients enrolled in that trial. So yes, we\u2019re looking forward to share the data later this year for you. Dr. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much. In summary, I think we had a solid quarter. Continue to invest to support our unprecedented 19 potential launches in an 18-month period. These are doing very well. The plan is executed as the time lines, in our pipeline and in value-creating revenue-generating business development opportunities like Seagen, which, as I articulated just in the question before that, it is clearly our big bet and our very, very big opportunity moving forward. Over the next three months, we look forward to moving beyond the current uncertainty related to our COVID-19-related revenue. So, we\u2019ll have better clarity. And by the end of the year, we\u2019ll have -- the uncertain will be removed almost largely. To that extent, but any adjustments to our cost base for \u201824 and beyond, we are ready to make. I want to reemphasize that the biggest uncertainty in terms of the long term is vaccination rate, some shorter uncertainties like when commercialization will be, I think it\u2019s just a question of time. But the vaccination and treatment rates that we are going to see, I think, will inform what is -- what we should expect for the years to come, with only upside if we the combination vaccines. Putting all these factors together, we remain confident in our ability to deliver a robust operational growth and deliver meaningful shareholder value through the end of the decade and beyond. And now, we will bring our call to a close. Thank you for joining us, and have a great rest of your day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude Pfizer\u2019s second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. We appreciate your participation, and you may disconnect at any time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to Pfizer's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer and Senior Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am. Francesca DeMartino : Good morning. And welcome to Pfizer's earnings call. I'm Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer. On behalf of the Pfizer team, thank you for joining us. This call is being made available via audio webcast at pfizer.com. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the third quarter of 2023. Our earnings materials can be accessed on the IR website at investors.pfizer.com. I'm joined today by Dr. Albert Bourla, our Chairman and CEO; Dave Denton, our CFO; and Dr. Mikael Dolsten, President, Pfizer Research & Development. Joining for the Q&A session, we will also have Angela Hwang, Chief Commercial Officer and President, Global Biopharmaceuticals Business; Aamir Malik, our Chief Business Innovation Officer; Dr. Chris Boshoff, our Chief Oncology Research & Development Officer; and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel. Before we get started, I wanted to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements. I encourage you to read the disclaimer on slide 3. Additional information regarding these statements and our non-GAAP financial measures is available on earnings release and in our SEC Forms 10-K and 10-Q under Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Information and factors that may affect future results. Forward-looking statements on the call are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, speak only as of the call's original date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Albert. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Francesca. Hello, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. Pfizer continues to have a far-reaching and positive impact on human health. Through the first nine months of the year, more than 457 million patients around the world were treated with our medicines and vaccines. Compared with the first nine months of 2022, we have reached more patients in several key therapeutic areas, including oncology, cardiovascular disease and anti-infectives.  Patients will always be our North Star, and these figures serve as a testament to our leadership in innovation and our commitment to understanding and serving patients' needs.  During the third quarter, we were encouraged by the continued strong performance of Pfizer's non-COVID products, with revenue from these products growing 10% operationally compared with the year-ago quarter. We saw significant contributions from new launches and robust year-over-year growth for several key in-line brands.  Our recently launched respiratory syncytial virus, the RSV, vaccine \u2013 it's called ABRYSVO \u2013 contributed $375 million in US revenues. With the recent approval of the maternal indication, Pfizer is the only company with an RSV vaccine approved for preventing RSV in older adults and in infants via maternal immunization. We believe ABRYSVO will be a significant and growing contributor to revenue as many customers have indicated to us that protecting both populations with one vaccine is desirable and a competitive advantage for ABRYSVO.  In the US alone, there are approximately 80 million adults over age 60 who are eligible for RSV vaccination, and an estimated 1.5 million pregnant women are eligible for maternal immunization with our RSV vaccine between September 2023 and January 2024. Nurtec, Vydura and Oxbryta, which were acquired in the fourth quarter of 2022, contributed $233 million and $85 million in global revenues, respectively. For Nurtec, in the US, oral CGRPs represent about 17% of the migraine market, and the unmet need is high. We believe oral CGRPs can ultimately be the first-line therapy for migraine and could eventually account for as much as 40% of the overall migraine market.  Primary care is a clear source of potential growth in the migraine marketplace. Year to date, primary care healthcare providers wrote more than 6.1 million prescriptions for Triptans compared with approximately 1 million for oral CGRPs, which highlights a significant potential opportunity for growth. Regarding Oxbryta, there is significant burden of illness and unmet need for patients suffering from sickle cell disease. An estimated 12 million people around the world have SCD, sickle cell disease, with the highest prevalence in countries with the lowest resources. While in the US, 95% of children survive to adulthood, 99% of children in other regions will die before they reach their 5th birthday, many without ever being diagnosed. Our Vyndaqel family of products, including Vyndaqel, Vyndamax and Vynmac, recorded 47% operational growth globally compared with the third quarter of 2022. This growth was driven largely by continued strong uptake of the transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy indication, primarily in the US and developed Europe. We estimate there are between 120,000 and 150,000 people suffering from ATTR cardiomyopathy, with the majority still not yet diagnosed.  The largest unmet need continues to be the lack of general understanding and ability to diagnose this deadly disease, which is why we are focused on educational activities to expedite diagnosis and get appropriate patients on to treatment with the product as the proven standard of care. Such efforts significantly contributed to this quarter's revenue increase in the US. And our Prevnar family of products, Prevnar 13 and Prevnar 20, saw global revenue rise 15% operationally compared with the year-ago quarter. This increase was driven primarily by strong patient demand for Prevnar 20 Adult in the US, the US approval of Prevnar 20 Pediatric and associated stocking, and growth of Prevenar 13 Pediatric in certain emerging markets. These were partially offset by anticipated lower market share in the US for Prevnar Pediatric due to competitive entry. Of note, Prevnar 20 Adult remains the category-leading pneumococcal vaccine for adults in the US with a 95% market share in the third quarter.  Year-to-date, revenues for our non-COVID products have grown 7% operationally, and we remain on track to deliver 6% to 8% operational revenue growth for these products for the full year.  We continue to progress toward our goal of executing an unprecedented number of launches of new products or indications. Recent milestones include US and EU approvals and launch of ABRYSVO in pregnant individuals; US approval and launch of Elrexfio in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma; US approval of our Braftovi+Mektovi combination in BRAF-mutated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer; US approval of VELSIPITY for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis; EC approval of Litfulo for severe alopecia areata; and US approval of PENBRAYA, the first and only pentavalent vaccine that provides coverage against the five most common serogroups causing meningococcal disease in adolescents and young adults 10 through 25 years of age. To date, we have now executed 13 of the 19 originally identified potential launches, with four other products approved and preparations being made for their launch. In fact, five of the six remaining potential launches have been largely de-risked from a technical perspective. The only one remaining would be our mRNA flu candidate.  Given our recent positive results from our next-generation mRNA flu/COVID combination candidate and pending results for our 65-and-older first-generation Phase 3 standalone mRNA flu study, timing for our standalone mRNA flu is now expected after 2024. If successful, our next-generation mRNA flu/COVID combination candidate is expected to market in 2025. Mikael will share more about these programs shortly.  We remain excited about our proposed acquisition of Seagen and the dramatic impact we think this combination can have on human health. One in three people will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime. So, conquering cancer would have an almost unimaginable impact on humanity.  We recently gained unconditional antitrust clearance from the EC, and we continue to expect the transaction to close in late 2023 or early 2024, subject to customary closing conditions, including clearance by the US FTC. We have raised $31 billion in acquisition financing so far and continue to expect incremental 2030 risk-adjusted revenues in excess of $10 billion and expected cost efficiencies of $1 billion to be realized by the end of year three post-closing without impacting any R&D programs.  With that, I will turn it over to Dave. After Dave, Mikael will provide an update on our R&D pipeline. So Dave? Dave Denton : Thank you, Albert. And good morning. Before I review this quarter's results, I will address a couple of topics that have been top of mind with investors since our announcement on October 13th. These topics relate to our future US government Paxlovid revenue forecasts, as well as our multi-year cost realignment program.  With respect to revenue recognition associated with the amended agreement, the US government is expected to return an estimated 7.9 million EUA-labeled treatment courses and, in return, will receive a volume-based credit at an approximate value of $4.2 billion at the end of 2023 for future treatment courses. Pfizer will also provide an additional 1 million treatment courses into the US strategic national stockpile.  As a result of all that, Pfizer has an obligation to deliver an estimated 8.9 million treatment courses for which we will record approximately $4.2 billion of revenue beginning in 2024 as we deliver treatment courses. It is important to note that there is no cash compensation for the estimated 8.9 million treatment courses delivered.  Regarding our cost realignment program, I want to reiterate that we expect to achieve at least $3.5 billion of net cost savings by the end of 2024 versus the mid-point of our August 1, 2023 SI&A and R&D guidance. We expect $1 billion of targeted savings in 2023 and expect an additional savings of at least $2.5 billion in 2024. In a moment, when I review the components of our full-year 2023 guidance, you will see that we have lowered the midpoints of both our SI&A and R&D guidance ranges by $500 million, respectively.  Now, turning to the quarter, our Q3 results, both top and bottom line, were significantly and negatively impacted by our COVID products. Revenues declined 41% operationally, the result of the decrease in both Paxlovid and Comirnaty sales, while adjusted diluted loss per share was also significantly impacted by $5.6 billion of non-cash inventory write-offs of COVID related inventories.  I want to emphasize, as Albert stated previously, that the operational revenue growth of our products in Q3, excluding both Paxlovid and Comirnaty were strong at 10%. Contributing to this strong performance was our newly approved RSV vaccine and the families of products associated with both Prevnar and Vyndaqel. Additionally, our recently acquired products, Nurtec and Oxbryta, also contributed to this strong growth.  Our reported diluted loss per share of $0.42 and adjusted diluted loss per share of $0.17 in the quarter are primarily the result of the decline in Paxlovid and Comirnaty sales and the non-cash charge related to write-offs of COVID-related inventories. The inventory write-off of $4.7 billion for Paxlovid and $900 million for Comirnaty negatively affected adjusted loss per share by $0.84.  Foreign exchange movements had a de minimis unfavorable impact on third quarter revenues and increased adjusted diluted loss per share by $0.04 or 2% compared to LY.  Now, let me briefly touch on our full-year guidance. Given we updated our full-year revenue and EPS guidance on October 13th, I am just going to hit a few of the highlights. Total company full-year 2023 revenues are expected to be in the range of $58 billion to $61 billion versus previous range of $67 billion to $70 billion. Importantly, we continue to expect 6% to 8% full- year operational revenue growth for non-COVID products year-over-year. As anticipated, the majority of this growth is occurring in the second half of the year, given the timing of new product and indicated launches.  I want to remind you that, beginning in Q4, we will overlap the acquisitions of Biohaven and GBT last year, which we completed on October of 2022.  Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be in the range of 41% to 43%, primarily the result of the $5.6 billion non-cash charge related to inventory write-offs for our COVID products.  Adjusted SI&A expenses are expected to be in the range of $13.3 billion to $14.3 billion, and adjusted R&D expenses to be within a range of $11.9 billion to $12.9 billion. The mid-points of both ranges are now $500 million lower than our original guidance.  As a result of all these, the company now expects full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.65 versus the original guidance range of $3.25 to $3.45. All additional components of our guidance are included in our press release that was issued earlier today.  As discussed in prior quarters, our capital strategy is based on three core pillars. First is reinvesting in our business. Second is growing our dividends over time. And third is making value-enhancing share repurchases. In the first nine months of 2023, we invested $7.9 billion in internal R&D, returned $6.9 billion to shareholders via our quarterly dividend, and allocated approximately $43 billion towards the proposed Seagen acquisition.  Lastly, in addition to our completing a $31 billion unsecured debt offering in Q2 of this year, we are ready to execute the remaining short-term financing to complete the proposed Seagen acquisition upon fulfillment of the required closing conditions. We expect to de-lever our capital structure following the completion of this transaction, and as we de-lever, we anticipate returning to a more balanced capital allocation strategy, inclusive of share repurchases. In closing, I want to reiterate that our product portfolio remains very strong. We continue to be encouraged by the momentum of our non-COVID products in Q3 and are committed to the successful execution of our new product and indication launches. We expect that the cost realignment program will improve our operating margins, enhancing long-term shareholder value.  And with that, let me turn it over to Mikael. Mikael Dolsten : Thank you, Dave. Today, I will share important updates from our robust respiratory vaccine portfolio.  Our respiratory vaccines are built upon three cutting-edge platforms that enable us to bring the right science to the right pathogen. These include our mRNA platform in partnership with BioNTech targeting highly variant viruses, our subunit platform targeting viruses that remain relatively consistent season to season, and our conjugate vaccine platform designed to help prevent bacterial infections.  We have achieved FDA approvals of vaccines derived from each platform within the last year and aim to further expand our leadership with additional vaccine candidates in development.  Today, I will provide information on our standalone flu vaccine candidate, flu-COVID combination vaccine candidates and next gen pneumococcal vaccine candidate. We are pleased to announce that we achieved both primary endpoints in the 18 to 64-year-old cohort of our ongoing Phase 3 flu trial. In the trial, our first-gen mRNA flu vaccine candidate demonstrated non-inferiority and superiority to a licensed flu vaccine at the time of the primary analysis. This represents the first and only demonstration of efficacy and superiority for an mRNA-based flu vaccine candidate.  In this age cohort, efficacy was maintained through the trial's end of season analysis, with our candidate remaining non-inferior to the licensed comparator. Safety was similar to standard flu vaccine. The primary and end of season efficacy analyses considered both influenza A and B cases collectively. The vast majority of cases recorded in our trial, and during the 2022/2023 flu season overall, were flu A cases.  Immunogenicity data showed robust antibody responses against influenza A compared to licensed flu vaccine. Humoral responses against influenza B were lower than those achieved with the comparator. Recall that our standalone flu vaccine Phase 3 study also includes a 65 and older cohort that we previously shared encouraging T cell data for all four strains from the Phase 2 study in this cohort. Our belief is that the ability of the vaccine candidate to induce T cell responses may contribute to the improved efficacy over current seasonal flu vaccines, particularly in those 65 and older. We expect a readout from this age group later this year.  To address the lower B responses seen with our first-gen standalone flu candidate, Pfizer created next-generation reformulations. These were incorporated into our mRNA flu candidates in combination with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, which I will review now.  In positive Phase 1/2 topline data announced last week, we observed that reformulation of the lead flu candidates resulted in improved immunogenicity against influenza B, allowing us to meet all criteria for advancement to Phase 3. In the trial, our lead candidate formulations induced robust immune responses, with point estimates for Geometric Mean Titer ratios that were consistent with criteria applied to approved vaccines for all matched flu and SARS-CoV-2 strains.  Notably, point estimates for Geometric Mean Titer ratios with selected candidate formulations were greater than one relative to the licensed comparator for all matched flu vaccine strains. The safety profiles of evaluated candidates were consistent with Pfizer and BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine. Following these positive immunogenicity data, we plan to initiate a Phase 3 study in the coming months.  Successfully developing a broad seasonal vaccine franchise anchored around a modFlu mRNA vaccine is a key priority, as it may allow us to tap into the nearly 50% annual flu vaccination rate in US adults. We are taking a differentiated approach in pursuit of this goal, leveraging both mRNA and protein subunit technologies. Our development program includes double and triple combination vaccines to potentially help protect against flu, COVID-19, and RSV.  Now, turning to PREVNAR, I'll start by reminding you that this is the only PCV business with an FDA indication for pneumonia in adults. Providing protection specifically against pneumococcal pneumonia is critical. It's the most common form of pneumococcal disease in adults, leading to 150,000 US hospitalizations each year. The prevalence of nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia is more than 15-fold greater than that of invasive pneumococcal disease in US adults 50 and older.  PREVNAR's pneumonia indication is supported by the CAPiTA trial, which was enabled by a pneumococcal vaccine-na\u00efve population and proprietary assay. These innovative characteristics make it challenging for others to conduct a similar study, given the high level of pneumococcal vaccine coverage that exists today.  CAPiTA's innovative design and landmark results helped establish our leading and differentiated position in the PCV space. To solidify this position, we are committed to pursuing continued innovation. Our goal is to potentially maximize valency and improve immunogenicity while maintaining coverage of the serotypes clinically demonstrated to protect against pneumonia.  In line with this commitment, we have been developing a fourth-generation PCV candidate that builds on the PREVNAR business' 20-year-plus of innovation. Our next-generation technology leverages cutting-edge conjugation chemistry, carriers, and reformulations.  Using these new proprietary vaccine technologies, we observed a several fold improvement in select serotype immunogenicity in a monovalent Phase 1 study. Based on these data, we are confident that when we move this technology into our multivalent 4th generation candidate, we have the potential to achieve increased valency with improved serotype immunogenicity. We are now advancing our fourth-generation candidate into a first-in-human trial, which is expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2023.  Finally, I will leave you with our list of milestones and call out the recent approvals of VELSIPITY for ulcerative colitis and PENBRAYA, the first pentavalent meningococcal vaccine.  Pfizer has delivered more than a dozen regulatory approvals this year alone. I'll also note the recent launches of ABRYSVO for maternal immunization and ELREXFIO in multiple myeloma.  Thank you. Let me turn it over to Francesca to start the Q&A session.  Francesca DeMartino Thanks, Michael. With that, let's start the Q&A session. We will answer as many questions as time permits. And I will be available after the call to answer any follow-up questions. Operator, please assemble the queue. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist Securities. Robyn Karnauskas : I think I have a big picture question on your new launches, which is extremely important for your growth. Are you seeing any impact given, I think, vaccine fatigue that we've seen with COVID impacting RSV and pneumococcal vaccines? And how do you think about that impact as you think about 2023 and 2024? Do you think that will dissipate? Albert Bourla : First of all, I think it's good when you have a portfolio. And we have a quite strong portfolio because we have RSV, we have COVID and we have pneumococcal in the respiratory front. But I think the biggest impact will be when and if we have combination products. We think that combination products will \u2013 because of their convenience, because of vaccines are preferred by payers with zero copay will increase basically the volumes and vaccination rates of all vaccines because of the convenience of one injection. And I think this is why you saw from Mikael all our efforts right now are in developing multiple combinations, so that consumers and physicians will have choice which ones to administer, always with the same convenience. Operator : Our next question will come from Huynh Trung with UBS. Trung Huynh : I have one on flu and then just one on danu. So on flu, can you confirm the comparator in the 18 to 64 and also the 64 age groups was the low dose flu vaccines? Is there a risk FDA is going to need data against high dose flu vaccines? And from a commercial perspective, do you think you still need high dose flu data, the comparator against high dose flu data given that's what's recommended by CDC in the older population?  And then on danu, should we just \u2013 just on the data that we expect before year-end, what do you need to show in that in order to move it into Phase 3 trials? Is something similar to the Phase 2 we saw earlier this year enough to move it to Phase 3. Albert Bourla : On the flu comparator, I can confirm that it is the low dose on the younger population because that's the only one that's allowed. So on the older population, we are having studies now with a very low dose, but we will do also with the higher dose. So we have both. On danu, it's not much to say. We need to wait to see the data. Clearly, when you are moving ahead with a program like that, you need to see the totality of the data and we are working now intensively to be able to have those data presented before year-end. Operator : Our next question will come from Umer Raffat with Evercore. Umer Raffat : I wanted to continue on the oral obesity theme for a second. I noticed there's a new molecule, 522, that you moved into Phase 1. And my question is, is the chemical structure and the chemical series akin to the danu GLP-1 programs?  And also, Albert, you mentioned you want to wait to see the danu GLP-1 Phase 2 data, but I realized the trial has been wrapped up for a few weeks now. Have you not seen it yet? Albert Bourla : Michael, would you like to take the question about the new molecule and the danu? Mikael Dolsten : We are building a platform around the GLP-1 area and also obesity in general with multiple different mechanisms and compounds. We remain focused on the danuglipron readout, as Albert mentioned, as our main opportunity here for getting data to review for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. But there are many indications where GLP may play a role outside the typical metabolic. So this one gives us just more options to explore and have interesting data. And you will see more new mechanism also coming from Pfizer. We have a pretty strong effort here. Operator : Next we have Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Terence Flynn : Maybe two for me. I was just wondering, on your RSV launch, how we should think about the potential for revaccination in 2024. And then, on your DMD gene therapy program, I think you've previously talked about having interim data by year-end. Is that still the case and does the recent competitor data make you more or less optimistic in your program? Albert Bourla : First of all, let me make a comment that the recent data that we saw about the DMD failures is a very, very bad news for patients. We are really [indiscernible]. I hope there will be a solution for them with the discussion with the FDA, although I can't comment. Now, on our DMD program, I will ask Mikael to comment on that. And then, on the RSV, Angela. Mikael, why don't you start with the DMD? Then Angela, go through RSV? Mikael Dolsten : [indiscernible] we also always said and when someone fails a study. We are very encouraged about getting to the readout. You are right, there is an opportunity for an interim analysis around year-end with final analysis second half of next year. And overall, I think our interim read for DMD have shown a very consistent effect across biomarkers and functional endpoint. And what has been differentiated it so far is that when you look at the functional data we have reported, it has been giving encouraging signals in both the younger and the slightly older boys. And that has not been seen with the other company you referred to. So, in a way, I remain, as earlier, very positive about looking forward to the readout and let the data tell the story. But of course, this makes our gene therapy, in a way, the main game to us. Albert Bourla : Then there was a question, Angela, on the RSV. Angela Hwang : Well, as you heard, during the HCIP discussions, our recommendation for ABRYSVO today is really one around shared clinical decision making. But we also were \u2013 we were asked to bring additional data when they are ready. And so, just to confirm that we will have additional data in vaccine effectiveness in broader populations, we will have safety data also in broader populations, we will also have immunogenicity data in younger populations. All of this will be, I think, available in the next year when we plan to bring this back to the CDC. In addition to that, actually omitted to mention that we'll also have second season efficacy data. So, we'll be able to bring this totality of data together to determine whether the recommendations will change, but also what the vaccination schedule will be. So that's to come in 2024. Operator : Next, we have Steve Scala with TD Cowen. Steve Scala : As was just noted a couple of minutes ago, the danu data has reached its primary completion. It was a while ago. Albert, when you were asked, you stressed the words totality of the data, implying that you could have seen some part of the data. Mikael, when you were asked, you talked about different indications. These are not confidence building statements. So, I'm curious, what have you seen? And, Mikael, you've said in the past, you were absolutely encouraged and confident in the profile of danu? Are you still absolutely encouraged and confident? So that's the first question. Secondly, a competitor spoke to potentially COVID derived decrease in diagnosis of inflammatory diseases, such as UC, and I'm wondering if you've seen any of that. Albert Bourla : I think you likely misunderstood my comments on the totality. It has nothing to do with any data that I have seen because I haven't, right? So, the data have not been presented to \u2013 I don't think [indiscernible] has been completed yet. So, I will ask also Mikael to comment on that, but don't bridge with anything on the totality of the data. What I meant it is that we are doing this, we are doing the release formulation, which will make it once a day. There are multiple things, but we need to wait and see. We see how competitors are doing before deciding what we will do. But the most important thing is to see what is the efficacy and safety of the study that will read out. So, nothing to read in my comment on historical data. So, Mikael, you want to add\u2026 Mikael Dolsten : Yeah, I can just echo what you said so well, Albert. We and I remain very enthusiastic to look forward, to see the data. We have not seen the final top line report coming out. So today, the study is still ongoing but will be available before year-end. Danuglipron has shown, as you know, some really interesting profile as a full agonist and it's our main opportunity and effort for obesity and Type 2 diabetes.  We got earlier today a question about new molecules that are coming in. And that's when I mentioned that our additional indications to pursue for such new molecules and we'll also have new mechanisms that are validated that's coming in in oral version. So it just punctuates our big effort we have around both these class and obesity and other disorders. Albert Bourla : In essence, he's still excited. Operator : Next, we have Louise Chen with Cantor. Louise Chen : I wanted to ask you on this fourth generation PCV, how much additional serotype coverage will you have? And then, also on ABRYSVO, will that be available to pregnant women in the pharmacy? Or do they have to go to their OBGYN? And then lastly, just on danuglipron again, here, will you also have the modified release data before year-end. Albert Bourla : Monadelphous, you want to take the PCV question and danu, but also, Angela, very quickly, ABRYSVO is available at the pharmacy. Angela Hwang : Yes, it's going to be available in pharmacies and doctors' offices and OBGYN offices. I think we have a real stocking advantage here, Louise, because anyone just needs to stock one product for two indications for both populations. So I think the uptake is to come. And certainly, the next few months, being that it's the winter, is when we begin to \u2013 we believe we'll see some good uptake. Mikael Dolsten : On the PCV fourth generation, I hope you looked at today's data. And what you could see is that we are really the first company that have been able to put in place a whole set of new technology that can bring immune responses to a higher level than have been seen and that allow us to go with even more comprehensive coverage than the current 20. I'm not going to give your curiosity an answer how many serotype. I can just tell you it's considerable more than the 20.  On danu, we look upon danuglipron as the once-a-day QD molecule because of the reformulation technologies that were put in place and already generated some clinical data on and are now concluding. So that's really how we look upon danuglipron and we'll have final data on the best formulation option early next year. But as Albert said, we're enthusiastic to look forward to the efficacy data later this year. So very exciting time. Operator : Next, we have David Risinger with Leerink Partners. David Risinger : I have another question on danuglipron since it appears to be the company's number one pipeline candidate based upon your forecasts. So regarding the Phase 2b results that are expected soon, how should we expect Pfizer to share those results? And then, with regard to the once daily formulation that you just mentioned, Mikael, will that be ready for the Phase 3 start assuming that the company moves to start Phase 3 shortly after the Phase 2b results are generated? Albert Bourla : The first question, given the importance [indiscernible]. But with a press release, we've made them publicly available. Now, Mikael, you want to take the second part of the question of David? Mikael Dolsten : Yeah, I can first echo what Albert and I said, we look forward with enthusiasm to get the danuglipron obesity data later this year. And of course, as Albert said, pending totality of reviewing everything we have, we have made a lot of progress and been able to accelerate the QD danu. Now, we're waiting for some more clinical data early next year, but I think it's within our reach. If we decide to do, to start the pivotal study next year to do it with an once a day molecule. Operator : Next, we have Chris Schott with J.P. Morgan. Chris Schott : Just two for me here. First, can you just comment a little bit more on what we're seeing with Nurtec and the ramp relative to your expectations?  And maybe just as part of that, just any color on pricing we're seeing within the market today and how we should think about that going forward. And then my second question was on 2024. I know you're not giving guidance today. But as you look at where consensus has kind of shaken out post the COVID and cost restructuring updates, and if the earnings are in kind of low $3 range at this point, I guess just are there any directional kind of pushes or pulls in the numbers that you feel the Street isn't capturing properly and should be kind of thinking about before we get your kind of formal guidance as we look to early next year? Dave Denton : Obviously, it's a little over 2024. I would just say that, clearly, we had a clearing event as it relates to our COVID expectations for this year. So a lot of that risk is behind us as we think about the balance this year. I do expect that the balance of this year will be very informative, particularly in the US as we think about utilization trends, both for vaccination rates, importantly Paxlovid, here in the US that will allow us to have a better clarity as we cycle into 2024 of the utilization around those specific products, which will still be meaningful to us at an enterprise level.  Clearly, when we get to providing guidance, we'll give you a lot of information beneath that, so you can get a good sense of our \u2013 importantly, our non-COVID products which continue to trend very favorably and very well. And we can layer on, I'll say, the optionality associated with our COVID franchise as we cycle into next year.  So, obviously, a lot more to come. We're looking forward to sharing those very specific details after the first of the year. Mark Southey : And then, Angela, about Nurtec launch \u2013 not launch, about the Nurtec performance in the marketplace, including the price. Angela Hwang : Thanks for the question, Chris, because it's a great opportunity for us to share that we are seeing Nurtec perform just as we expected. In fact, with some really strong performance indicators that I'd like to share with you.  First of all, from a TRx perspective, we grew 28% compared to last year this time, and sequentially, we grew 6% versus last quarter. In fact, on October 20, we saw the highest week of TRx's and NRxs to date. That growth is also seen in the number of prescribers. Just this quarter alone, we had 73,000 prescribers writing Nurtec. And we are now moving at a clip of about 23,000 writer a week which is 30% more than Ubrelvy and double that of Qulipta.  Another good place to look is also in new to brand starts, right, NBRxs. And when you look at that, NBRx growth for Nurtec is higher than Ubrelvy and Qulipta in all the deciles of physicians, but particularly in the decile 8 to 10, which, as you know, is where the highest prescribers are or who are the highest prescribers. And then, when you look at pill count, we see something interesting there too. We have been very intensely or intently driving our pill pack toward the larger pill pack size, which is the 16 pack because of our prevention indication. And so, when you look at the totality of all the pills or the total volume of pills, we have a leading market share there, more than 50%.  And so, I think when you look at all these indicators, at least from the way that we're looking at it, it's very positive story. It's exactly how we see it. The expansion into primary care, as you heard in Albert's comments, is what it is that we're after. And today, only 17% of the entire market is oral CGRPs, which tells you that most of the market is still an opportunity for us and represents growth that we're really, really looking forward to. And I think that we put the right investments in the right places to generate this growth in the future.  From a pricing perspective, obviously, it's a product that is rebated, and so I think the way to think about it is that, from a patient perspective, which is where we really put a lot of focus, we want to make sure that our patients are able to get the scripts, are able to get access for Nurtec, especially as you consider that we're trying to mobilize people away from Topiramate and away from triptans on to all CGRPs.  So the gross to net effects here are significant. And you see that quarter-over-quarter because we are making sure that we're able to provide access to patients who deserve and are eligible for [indiscernible]. Operator : Next we have Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Mohit Bansal : And I have a question regarding your S1P etrasimod. Would love to get your thoughts on the labels. It seems like you could avoid a lot of cardiac monitoring, but at the same time there is this new requirement of eye exam as well as skin exam. How do you think about uptake, considering these examinations before the start of the treatment, given that these doctors are not used to it? Mikael Dolsten : I'm happy to start on it. I think we have a very robust label for etrasimod. It's the only S1P in this drug class [indiscernible] that have a simple flat dosing and immediate start without any prior need for, let's say, cardiac rhythm exams, like the other prog in this class. All S1P have various eye exams to monitor. And I think our label similarly has a recommendation to do that. So it's really nothing new. And our efficacy data, and you see, has been very favorable. So we are very optimistic that this can be a true best-in-class ulcerative colitis. Angela Hwang : I was just going to add to that that, competitively, we believe that we have an excellent efficacy and safety profile. We don't have a need to titrate up, as Mikael said. And also, our assessment of standard versus our competitors at the initiation of therapy. So I think that this is a level playing field that we're in. Certainly patient support is an area of focus for us, right, to ensure that patients are getting the assessments that they need. But we feel that we're \u2013 this is pretty standard practice and we'll be able to launch this product as planned. Operator : Next, we have Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Geoff Meacham : Just have a couple of quick ones. First, I know Seagen obviously hasn't closed yet. But there's all the emphasis on the ADCs from ESMO. Does it affect how you guys prioritize the pipeline or maybe investments you could make today commercially?  And the second question on danu, Mikael, I know a lot has been asked on the upcoming data, but from a commercial perspective, like where do you see the bigger opportunities for differentiation and metabolic? Is it really just oral administration in obesity? Or do you guys look more aggressively at related indications like cardio, renal, et cetera. Albert Bourla : Chris, do you want to take a question about the Seagen and the pipeline? Chris Boshoff : Obviously, we remain very confident that we will close Seagen towards the end of this year, beginning next year. As you pointed out, there's a significant interest now in ADCs because of the potential that they could replace most of the chemotherapeutics in the future for most cancer types.  Seagen obviously has a significant track record with both the current approved ADCs from the laboratories and, as you've seen, three potential registration phase trials just read out and passed up to Kaiser [indiscernible] but also with the small molecule to Kaiser.  They recently started two Phase 3 studies, one with tisotumab vedotin in combination with pembrolizumab in advanced metastatic, HER2 positive or HER2 low bladder cancer. This is a program that we're very excited about. Already tisotumab received previously breakthrough therapeutic innovation in the US. And they're also just about to start another Phase 3 program in non-small cell lung cancer with the B6A integrin beta-6 antibodies. So we remain very confident in their portfolio and the depth of expertise they're bringing to the development and discovery of ADCs. Mikael Dolsten : I think you asked about how could a new oral GLP in obesity be positioned for maximal attractiveness and using danu as one example, pending, of course, our excitement to see the data. Well, clearly, as obesity and Type 2 diabetes with overweight are moving from being treated from an endocrinologist and metabolic physicians increasingly now to primary care, particularly with the impressive effects of this drug class on obesity and bodyweight. Oral agents in general are preferred. So I think, once a day drugs such as the new reformulated potential danuglipron would have an interesting role there.  I think there is also a growing discussion among opinion leaders in the field that the patients regain weight when they stop the injectable. And in general, they are only available for maybe a year. So an oral agent that could be taken for a longer period could also play a really interesting role to maintain body weight at a low level.  And finally, you're absolute right, the new data for this drug class suggests that patients could benefit from both cardiac and renal protection. And oral agents allow you to build combination with drugs that already are used in this population, such as the 52, to protect the heart etc. So I think that's why there is such a big interest in drugs in this class. Operator : Next, we have Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Tim Anderson : I have a couple of questions on danuglipron. Early dataset showed a QTc signal. Do you think that was a red herring that won't show up in later data? To me, when I just think about drug classes and seeing QTc signals, seems like it often persists in later datasets.  Second question on mRNA flu. You mentioned that safety is the same as licensed vaccines. Does that mean tolerability was as well? I usually think of safety and tolerability as technically being different from each other. Albert Bourla : Mikael, both questions for you. QTc for danu and tolerability of flu vaccines? Mikael Dolsten : We have, I think, more than 1,400 patients on danuglipron and it's a very safe drug. It's a very safe drug. And we look forward to the readout on efficacy, as we have said. before year-end. So that's very straightforward. mRNA flu, you had a very good comment, particularly in initial studies, tolerability is really what we focus on. And tolerability was similar to standard of care available vaccines, or the other mRNA vaccines experienced from Pfizer. And we haven't really had any concerns about safety. So on both tolerability and safety, the statement stands that it looks like previous versions of our vaccines. Operator : Next, we have Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. Chris Shibutani : Two questions, if I may. On the cost savings program, you've been outlining what the plan is for 2024. But if we look at the pattern of the spending for R&D and SI&A, in the quarter you just reported, I would observe that the magnitude of reduction in the R&D spend was greater than expected relative to SI&A, how should we be interpreting this numbers or anything to read across in terms of the relative amount of cost reductions coming from SI&A versus R&D on the forward?  And then a question on ABRYSVO. First quarter sales were solid. Can you just elaborate how much may have been attributable to, for instance, inventory stocking versus actual demand? And if we look at prescription data, looks like from the retail setting, there was about a 30% market share. Is this similar to what you're observing in the broader market? And how is this conferring with your expectations? Mark Southey : Let me ask David to answer the question about the R&D and SI&A expenses. And then Angela will take ABRYSVO. Dave Denton : Chris, on the cost program, I would not read into the allocation of savings in 2023 as it relates to 2024. Obviously, we have a fairly robust program up and running today. We're working aggressively on those programs and beginning to implement those programs. As we cycle into 2024, we'll give you and the markets specific color on how to think about those cost savings as we wrap into next year. Mark Southey : Angela? Angela Hwang : We're really pleased with our performance on ABRYSVO. It has exceeded our expectations. You first asked whether this is all about stocking. And I can say that it isn't. Of course, there was stocking effect in the beginning because this was a new vaccine. But we're also closely tracking vaccination rates and uptake. And what you see is that there is very fast uptake that really benefit from the fact that this was approved and in market prior to the vaccination season actually happening. So it was able to ride off the coattails of flu vaccinations, which you know are very high. Right? September, October. We have about a 70% co-administration rate. The performance we're seeing on ABRYSVO is truly driven by vaccinations. To your comment about market share, yes, we are seeing a similar market share to what you have just said. That is because, right now, the retail setting is driving a lot of the vaccinations. But don't forget that that's not where all vaccinations are taking place. We also have non-retail settings such as health systems, doctors' offices, those are also being engaged. And those particular settings, Pfizer actually has a leading preference. They are smaller in proportion, but still. So I think we have to look at all channels of the market.  Finally, I think that, just from a momentum perspective, we expect things to continue. The vaccinations really are happening throughout this time now \u2013 October, November, December are big vaccination months. From where we are right now, RSV is only 5% of the entire vaccination rate of the eligible populations. So I think that the conclusion is we're very early in the innings of this launch. It's doing better than we thought. But where we are going to be, I think, is a place where there's tremendous opportunity for driving uptake in older adults, but also maternal, which, as you know, we just got the approval for. Operator : Next, we have Carter Gould with Barclays. Carter Gould : Maybe if you go back to oral danu, when we do get the Phase 2 data, what should our expectation be around communicating plans for Phase 3, which I guess is just a quicker way of saying, what's a reasonable expectation for how quickly you could turn around the Phase 2 and start a Phase 3 and how much work Pfizer has already done on that front? And then, maybe just coming out of ESMO, on the back of the EV-302 data and the response with Pfizer saying that reaffirms their expectations or represents upside to their expectations when the deal was originally announced. Albert Bourla : On the danu, let me take it, so I can spare a little bit Mikael's time. We are expecting the data to show up before the end of the year. And of course, it's an important event. So we will have to make it publicly known when we know the data. And of course, when we are ready with our Phase 3, and we hope that the data are good, so that we can move into Phase 3. And I hope that we are going to do it in an expedient manner because speed is of essence in this battle between competing molecules. But we will announce our plans for Phase 3. I know the interest is very high right now. But I want to be very prudent in not saying things without the data. The data or the click of the data, we haven't seen it again.  Now, let me move to Chris, so that we can discuss about the ESMO. Chris Boshoff : Thank you for raising 301. It's a truly monumental data for the field of bladder cancer, and urothelial cancer. And as you pointed out, with overall survival and median \u2013progression-free survival nearly double, moving median overall survival for this population now nearly towards three years, we expect the final data to be above \u2013 longer than 31.5 months. So this just reaffirms our belief that antibody drug conjugates could become a standard of care across the treatment paradigm for many, many different tumor types. Operator : Next, we have Akash Tewari with Jefferies. Ivy Wang : This is Ivy on for Akash. Our question is also on danuglipron. So, [indiscernible] release version, is there any possibility to do a bridging study for QD formulation? And also, for danu, I think as we've heard a lot of times on the call that the trial [indiscernible] completed in October. I know you haven't seen the top line data. So at this point, are we waiting for data from this lower four week titration cohort? So would it be fair to say that you will have to continue the program already if there were any clinically significant theories, issues with danu? Mikael Dolsten : On the once a day reformulated danu, we have initially tested a standard swellable core technology, and could show that it worked very well with danu. Now to be able also to incorporate a more sophisticated technology, we worked on a matrix technology, and all data suggests it's going to a really intriguing alternative because, as you know, in diabetes oral drugs and obesity, you will over time end up with incorporating different trials to prevent different downstream effects. And that's the beautiful of having these type of novel technology that you have a potential in the future to go to fix those combination. And we are really masters in developing sophisticated formulations and we will have this available in 2024. Mark Southey : And there was a second part I think, or not. There was a second part on danu? Operator : Next we have Kerry Holford with Berenberg. Kerry Holford : Two questions on vaccines for me, please. First on RSV, in August, GSK filed a lawsuit against Pfizer alleging patent infringement. So I wonder if you could just talk to the next steps here. Perhaps a timeline that you anticipate for this? And should we think that this could ultimately result in some form of royalty payments from Pfizer to GSK?  And then, on PENBRAYA, how does the recent ACIP recommendation set against your expectations for the sales ramp and peak potential for this vaccine? If the vaccine is effectively only used for dose two of three, does that significantly reduce the commercial opportunity you had anticipated for the vaccine? Doug Lankler : It's very, very early stages with respect to the RSV litigation. We have patents, we feel strongly about our own intellectual property. And it's certainly too early to say whether one party or the other will be required to pay any royalties or otherwise. Very early stages in that regard. Angela Hwang : We continue to feel confident about the peak sales. The reason is that, right now, we have the first set of recommendations, but the ACIP has also told us that we will have the opportunity again to come back next year when we have additional data, which is when we will have the opportunity to look at the schedule or how [indiscernible] are being \u2013 the schedule that they're being delivered today. And we'll have an opportunity again to take a look at the benefit of PENBRAYA in this population. So I feel like it's great that we have an opportunity to get out now and to begin vaccinating our teenagers. We'll have a second bite at the apple, which will allow us to achieve our peak sales. Operator : Next, we have Andrew Baum with Citi. Andrew Baum : A couple of questions. Would you comment on your stake in RVT-3101, the TL1A, pending the approval of the licensing of the asset to Roche? Will you hang on to it? Or is that subject to divestment?  Second question for Chris. Just looking at the recent EV-302 data and with \u2013 you seem to have the Seagen portfolio, when you think about the combination of ADCs with pembro or with a PD-1, do you believe the efficacy that you're seeing is associated with that hedging or do you think it's true synergy through an immunologic mechanism of increased cell death? Aamir Malik : I think we're very pleased with the outcome of the TL1A program. When we created Televant, we did this as an R&D prioritization decision. Just as a reminder, this was a Phase 2 program that required significant Phase 3 investment. And so we held on to a 25% stake. We also had rights to royalties on US sales, as well as the full ex-US and ex-Japan rights. And we did that all without any R&D spend. So Roche's proposed acquisition of Televant will give us access to about $1.75 billion of pretax cash, which is the translation of our stake, and we still retain all the other rights. So we're looking forward to having Roche as a partner. We're looking forward to the investments that they're going to make in advancing the clinical stage programs on TL1A and benefiting from the outcome of those. Chris Boshoff : That's a very good question. As you know, Seagen pioneered the MMAE auristatin-based payloads, and we see this potential synergy in combination with a PD-1 with [indiscernible]. Although Seagen does have the next generation of ADCs with topo 1 that will enter the clinic this year \u2013 next year, we don't know yet if the topo 1s are going to show the similar type of immunogenicity as what appears to happen with the MMAE auristatin based payloads. So I think we're very confident that Seagen has both topo 1 as well as auristatin based payloads in case with topo 1s we do not see what appears [indiscernible]. Operator : Our last question comes from Evan Seigerman with the BMO Capital Markets. Evan Seigerman : I have one on danu and then a bigger picture one. So, a point of clarification on danuglipron. Mikael, is the ultimate goal to develop the fixed dose combination with, say, an SGLT2, other anti-diabetes drugs. You kind of mentioned that in your commentary. And taking a big step back, how should we think about how you risk adjusted your long term revenue guidance? Did you plan on updating this figure as you have clinical or regulatory successes or failures, for example, with the approval of etrasimod? Mikael Dolsten : The near term goal is really look at the data, as we have said, both Albert and myself, and pending review, of course, there's an option with a once a day danu to move forward in obesity and diabetes.  I think we have commented that the upside with oral drugs are many in the sector. That's why it has been such a big interest. And that includes fixed dose combination, which aren't available with injectables. But we will keep it simple and clear. We'll review the data and take a decision about potential in obesity and diabetes once a day danu. That's the near term. Albert Bourla : And also about your question, if we are going to change the $20 billions or the $25 billions that we have declared, first of all, the $25 billion is billions that we're going to acquire revenue in 2030. According to our estimates, we have acquired, pending Seagen acquisition, $20 billion so far. If you see the analyst expectations for this acquisitions, at the end of 2030, are very, very close to what we have right now. And I think this is trending very nice.  When you see the internal pipe, the launches that we are having from our internal pipeline, which we declared $20 billions, there is a gap between what we believe and what the analysts believe. And this is where we are focusing our attention right now. It's very early with the launches. Some of them are doing better than what we thought. Some of them are doing worse than what we thought. And if we realize that the totality of $20 billion is not anymore what we think will be, of course, we will update. Dave Denton : But I think what is important is that is if you look at our business, our core business is performing nicely. We continue to make traction. We have obviously a lot of launches that we've completed and still several ahead of us. We're excited about what Seagen could potentially bring to the company as we think about our focus now in oncology. And then importantly, I think we've rebaselined, if you will, the COVID franchises. Think about utilization in the back half of this year and cycle into next year. We will then take a step back and look at what would be prudent as we think about the revenue in totality of this company as we cycle into 2024 and beyond. So I think you look forward to, as we begin going into 2024, those expectation of laying those out specifically. Albert Bourla : Okay, thank you very much. I would like just to say that if you walk away from today's call with just one takeaway, it should be that I think Pfizer's future remains bright. We have rebased our COVID expectations, and now I think it's very easy for everyone to be able to model what I think will be stable COVID revenues going forward. And with the recent \u2013 particularly with the recent amended Paxlovid supply agreement. And of course, we are having very strong performance of our [indiscernible] and new products portfolio excluding COVID. It's 10% growth this quarter. And that position us to be able to have growing things going forward.  So I will now bring this call to an end. Thank you for joining us and have a great rest of your day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's Pfizer third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. We appreciate your participation and you may disconnect at any time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to Pfizer's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer and Senior Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am. Francesca DeMartino : Good morning. And welcome to Pfizer's earnings call. I'm Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer. On behalf of the Pfizer team, thank you for joining us. This call is being made available via audio webcast at pfizer.com. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2023 via press release that is available on our website at pfizer.com. I'm joined today by Dr. Albert Bourla, our Chairman and CEO; and Dave Denton, our CFO. Albert and Dave have some prepared remarks and we will then open the call for questions. Joining for the Q&A session, we will also have Dr. Chris Boshoff, EVP and Chief Oncology Officer; Alexandre de Germay, EVP and Chief International Commercial Officer; Dr. Mikael Dolsten, Chief Scientific Officer and President of R&D Doug Lankler, EVP and General Counsel; and Aamir Malik, EVP and Chief U.S. Commercial Officer. Before we get started, I wanted to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements and discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. I encourage you to read the disclaimers in our slide presentation, the press release we issued this morning and the disclosures in our SEC filings which are all available on the IR website on pfizer.com. Forward-looking statements on the call are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties speak only as of the call's original date and we undertake no obligations to update or revise any of these statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Albert. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Francesca. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to discuss some of the highlights from the fourth quarter and full-year 2023, and of course, a compelling year we have ahead. I\u2019d like to begin with a few reflections on 2023. As you know, we missed our initial internal projections and Street expectations predominantly related to our COVID products, which affected our stock price performance. Despite however this challenging year, there were a few great things that happened in 2023 that may have gotten lost amidst the mixed expectations. First, in 2023, Pfizer impacted the lives of more than 620 million people approximately around the world. We believe there is no other company that can reach as many people and patients as Pfizer. If you multiply this with our brand equity and awareness, it creates a connection with consumers that can be a very strong asset for us. Second, despite the decline in revenue from our COVID products, as of the reported results for the first nine months of 2023, we were the number 1 pharmaceutical company in terms of revenues from pharma-only products, a marked improvement from our fourth position in 2019. Next, 2023 was a record year for FDA approvals with nine new molecular entity approvals on Pfizer and many more approvals for new indications in already approved products, marking a very productive year of pipeline execution for Pfizer. Finally, we closed the Seagen acquisition. In the current regulatory environment, being able to close such a large acquisition demonstrates our ability to successfully engage with regulatory bodies. Our deliberate and strategic efforts throughout 2023 created a strong foundation to support us. We are now focused on maximizing the opportunities that have positioned us for success and our team is driving confidently as we start 2024. From the advent of penicillin to the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, Pfizer has been at the forefront of medical and pharmaceutical breakthroughs for the past 175 years. This year is our 175th anniversary. That can not only change patient lives but has changed history. Our strategy to continue to build on our proud history of innovation and commercial excellence is supported by the power and strength of our unmatched global scale and footprint, spanning commercial, financial, medical, regulatory, manufacturing and government relations. We have a clear view on how we will deliver operational, commercial and financial success across our business. Our confidence stems from the opportunity we have to bring additional focus to our business by executing five strategic priorities. We will get into each in more detail but the five key priorities for Pfizer this year is here are : First of all, to achieve world-class oncology leadership, to deliver the next wave of pipeline innovation, to maximize the performance of our new products, expand margins by realigning our cost base, allocate capital to enhance shareholder value. I\u2019m confident that Pfizer is well positioned to execute and that we can deliver meaningful value for our patients and our shareholders. Let's start with our first priority which is to achieve a world-class oncology leadership, which I believe we are in a strong position to do. As a reminder, one in three people will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime. Oncology represents one of the largest and fastest growing therapeutic areas. Completing the acquisition of Seagen doubled our oncology research and resources overnight, and meaningfully extended the reach and medical impact of our U.S. commercial and medical footprint, with a range of portfolio expansion opportunities boosted by Seagen's broad and deep pipeline. Seagen's in-line medicines are expected to immediately enhance Pfizer's top-line growth, and our combined portfolio provides the opportunity to lead genitourinary cancers and be a leader in breast cancer and deliver at least eight potential blockbuster products by 2030. We look forward to providing more information about our oncology platform at our Pfizer Oncology Innovation Day on February 29. As we build our leadership position, we have multiple potential key oncology catalysts in 2024 that we are acutely focused on. On the commercial side, the PADCEV launch in locally advanced/metastatic bladder cancer in combination with pembrolizumab and XTANDI launch in nonmetastic castration-sensitive prostate cancer. We are excited by the strength of the PADCEV EV-302 data and recent FDA approval, as it represents an opportunity to broaden the reach of this potentially practice-changing, platinum-free regimen to even more patients in the frontline metastatic urothelial cancer setting. Essentially, the recent approval doubles the addressable population, which had already doubled this past spring. We are also looking forward to Phase 3 Data readouts from Vepdegestrant in second line HR+ metastatic breast cancer and Braftovi in first line BRAF colorectal cancer. We also plan to advance our late-stage pipeline with Phase 3 starts of CDK4i in post-CDK4/6 metastatic breast cancer and B6A in non-small cell lung cancer. Building on Pfizer's potential medicines, the pipeline across breast cancer, genitourinary cancer, hematology and CRC, our CDK4 inhibitor could be a compelling follow-on to IBRANCE. And finally, in the early-stage pipeline, we look forward to initiating first-in-patient studies of four new ADC candidates this year, where we believe we have acquired the expertise to be a leader. Our second priority is to deliver the next wave of pipeline innovation with discovery and development across our therapeutic areas outside of Oncology in Vaccines, Anti-Infectives, Internal Medicine Metabolic Diseases, and Inflammation and Immunology. In 2024, we plan to continue to make meaningful investments in R&D. In fact, Pfizer's R&D budget is one of the highest in the industry, and supports our robust pipeline. We are pursuing cutting-edge science across modalities and platforms to deliver the next generation of potential breakthroughs. We are also leveraging AI and other digital tools across the value chain to increase speed and success rates. Starting first with our 4th-generation PCV vaccine candidate, which recently entered the clinic and received FDA Fast Track designation. Building on our deep heritage with PREVNAR, we aim to solidify our leadership in the pneumococcal vaccine space by increasing valency and serotype immunogenicity while maintaining our unique FDA label, which includes both IPD and pneumococcal pneumonia in adults. Respiratory vaccine combinations are another area where we are poised to lead, building upon our successful COVID vaccine. With the first-generation standalone mRNA flu vaccine, data demonstrated superior relatively efficacy versus a recommended flu vaccine in 18-to-64-year-olds, but did not meet success criteria for immunogenicity for the B strains. Our second-generation flu vaccine was tested in a Phase 2 COVID/Flu combination study for 18\u201364-year-olds and has shown encouraging results in both the A and the B strains. This new construct has now moved already into a Phase 3 COVID/Flu combination trial. Moving next to GBT-601. Our next-generation and potentially best-in-class HbS polymerization inhibitor represents a potential step-wise evolution over Oxbryta for sickle cell disease. Recent data presented at ASH 2023 demonstrated multiple blood parameters approaching normal ranges with treatment, suggesting GBT-601 may have the potential to deliver strong efficacy with the convenience of a once-daily pill. We have reaffirmed our commitment to our emerging cardiometabolic programs, with several early clinical development compounds. On the other end of the weight management spectrum, we have Ponsegromab, our GDF15 neutralizing antibody for cancer cachexia with Phase 2 data expected later this year. Ponsegromab has the potential to be first-in-class and the first FDA-approved treatment for cancer cachexia, which accounts for 20%, 30% of all cancer deaths significantly. Our third priority is of course to maximize the performance of our new products and core franchises through a relentless focus on execution, to continue growing our top-line. To do this, we are prioritizing and focusing, while leveraging data to make changes quickly and adapt. Our Pfizer U.S. Commercial and our Pfizer International Commercial organizations will leverage a more focused, efficient structure to drive executional excellence in their respective markets and expand reach to drive growth over the next several years. To discuss a few examples, we continue to be very enthusiastic about the potential of Nurtec to help the more than one billion people living with migraines worldwide. As access and prescriptions in the U.S. and globally continue to increase, we will continue to focus on direct-to-consumer marketing and reducing barriers to access and affordability for healthcare practitioners and patients. With Oxbryta, we will continue to educate healthcare practitioners and patients on the importance of proactively treating the underlying cause of sickle cell disease by reframing treatment goals to chronic/proactive treatment. With Abrysvo, we are focused on increasing overall RSV market growth and market share by establishing RSV vaccination as a year-round discussion and expanding our retail contracting and offerings. With Elrexfio, we are focused on educating healthcare practitioners in both academic institutions and in the community, awareness building and new patient trialists. Coming off the initial launch of Velsipity, we are focused on helping ensure patient access to Velsipity as a first-line advanced therapy oral option. With Litfulo, we continue to accelerate the consideration of advanced systemic treatments for appropriate alopecia areata patients and further unlock access to Litfulo. In addition, of course, we continue to protect and grow our core franchises and key blockbusters, including Prevnar, Vyndaqel and Eliquis, while exploring further opportunities to advance a number of innovative combination regimens. We believe we are well positioned to bring our global commercial manufacturing and supply capabilities to accelerate current and future marketed products. We believe all these components support our growth potential through 2024 and drive growth potential into 2025. We plan to provide updates throughout the year on how we are advancing these strategic priorities. And with that, I will turn the call over to Dave, who will discuss our financial performance, our initiative to realign our cost base, and our capital allocation strategy to enhance shareholder value. Dave? David Denton : Thank you, Albert, and good morning, everyone. As we enter 2024, we are clearly focused on a small number of critical priorities. These priorities include building a world-class oncology organization, ensuring the next wave of pipeline innovations, maximizing our new product portfolio performance with a more efficient commercial structure, and finally right-sizing our cost base. With that said, I\u2019ll start this morning with our full-year and our fourth quarter results, then I\u2019ll touch on our capital allocation priorities. I'll finish this morning with a few comments on our 2024 guidance and the near-term expectations that set this year as a foundational year to drive our growth potential in the latter half of the decade. For the full-year 2023, we recorded revenues of $58.5 billion, achieving 7% operational growth, solidly in line with our expectations when excluding contributions from both Comirnaty and Paxlovid. The significant sales decline in our COVID products, including a $3.5 billion revenue reversal for Paxlovid, were the primary drivers of an overall 41% operational decrease year-over-year. And with the expectation that Seagen will be a substantial growth contributor in 2024 and beyond, our full-year and fourth quarter results include approximately $120 million in Seagen product revenue after the close of the acquisition on December 14. On the bottom line, we reported full-year 2023 diluted EPS of $0.37 a share, a 93% year-over-year decline, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.84, down 72% versus year-over-year. This decline is primarily due to a significant decrease in sales for both Comirnaty and Paxlovid; the impact of the $3.5 billion revenue reversal for Paxlovid revenues in the fourth quarter related to an expected return of an estimated 6.5 million unused EUA-labeled treatment courses from the U.S. government; and finally a non-cash inventory write-off and other charges of $5.6 billion recorded in the third quarter for Paxlovid and to a lesser extent Comirnaty. Now turning to the quarter, I\u2019d like to highlight that we delivered a solid 8% year-over-year operational revenue growth, again, excluding Comirnaty and Paxlovid. Contributing to this strong performance were our newly approved RSV vaccine as well as Vyndaqel and Eliquis; partially offset by lower revenues for Ibrance and the Prevnar Family. However, our Q4 results, both top and bottom-line, continued to be significantly, and negatively, impacted by our COVID products on a year-on-year basis. Revenues declined 42% operationally, the results were significant decrease in both Comirnaty and Paxlovid sales. Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased by 12 percentage points driven primarily by the $3.5 billion non-cash Paxlovid revenue reversal, and to a much lesser extent, unfavorable changes in sales mix. Overall, our adjusted operating expenses declined 10%, compared to Q4 of last year. Adjusted SI&A expenses increased 1% operationally in the quarter, primarily driven by the timing of marketing and promotional activities, including those related to recently launched and acquired products. And consistent with our strategy, we have been focused on re-prioritizing our R&D spending to enhance overall returns. Adjusted R&D expenses decreased 24% operationally, driven primarily by lower spending across both vaccine programs and certain acquired assets, as well as lower compensation-related expenses. Both our reported diluted loss per share of $0.60 and our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.10 for the quarter were negatively impacted by the $3.5 billion Paxlovid revenue reversal, which dampened EPS by approximately $0.54. Continued declines in both Comirnaty and Paxlovid sales also negatively affected our performance in the quarter. Foreign exchange movements had an immaterial impact compared to last year's fourth quarter. As we are increasingly focused on prioritizing our investments to drive forward-looking growth, our GAAP results include a $1.4 billion intangible asset impairment charge associated with etrasimod, based on changes in development plans for additional indications and overall revenue expectations. But I will point out that this product is still projected to contribute over a $1 billion in peak annual sales. Additionally, we recorded a nearly $1 billion intangible asset impairment for Prevnar 13 reflecting a transition to vaccines with higher sero-type coverage. As discussed in prior quarters, our capital allocation strategy is designed to enhance shareholder value and is based on three core pillars. First is growing our dividend. Second is reinvesting in the business. And finally is making share repurchases after de-levering our balance sheet. For 2023, we returned $9.2 billion to shareholders via our quarterly dividend, we have invested $10.7 billion in internal R&D and finally, we have invested approximately $44 billion in completed business development transactions, net of cash acquired, essentially all for the acquisition of Seagen. Our expectation is to maintain and grow our dividend while de-levering our capital structure, with a gross leverage target of 3.25x and a goal to preserve our credit rating and access to Tier 1 commercial paper. Upon achieving our de-levering goals, we anticipate returning to a more balanced capital allocation strategy, inclusive of share repurchases. Now given that we issued our full-year 2024 revenue and adjusted diluted EPS guidance on December 13, let me just hit a few of the highlights. We expect total company full-year '24 revenues to be in the range of $58.5 billion to $61.5 billion, which reflects our expectation of strong contributions across our product portfolio. Importantly, excluding Comirnaty and Paxlovid, we anticipate operational revenue growth of 8%-10%. We remain confident on delivering at least $4 billion of net savings from our cost-realignment program by the end of the year. We believe right sizing the cost base will put us on a strong footing towards margin expansion and increased operational efficiency moving forward. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.05 to $2.25 a share for the full-year 2024 and as a reminder, this range is inclusive of an anticipated $0.40 of earnings dilution from the Seagen acquisition, and again with the vast majority of this dilution resulting from the financing costs associated with the deal. Cycling into 2024, we have significantly invested in our business to fuel our longer-term growth, and the foundation is set to deliver on our commitments to enhance long-term shareholder value. We are acutely focused on driving near-term performance while solidifying our growth expectations for the back half of the decade. And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Albert to begin our Q&A session. Albert Bourla : Thank you. With that, let's start the Q&A session. Operator, please assemble the queue. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist Securities. Robyn Karnauskas : So maybe I'm stupid on this question, but if I'm doing your math for your guidance of margins in low-70s for fiscal year '24. By my math, the margins for other biopharma would have to drop to about 60% in order to balance out the other margins. Can you just help me understand your guidance and triangulate that with your top-line and bottom-line guidance and triangulating that with your margin guidance? David Denton : This is Dave. Correct. Our guidance for gross margin, although we don't provide it specifically, we give us some color around the fact that it's approximately 70%. Obviously, our focus going forward is to improve our margin rate and more importantly, improve our operating margin rate to the bottom-line. As we look here at 2024, there's a few things that have compressed our margin rate. First is, as COVID has declined year-over-year, that has served to, I'll say, delever, if you will, the P&L as COVID takes up and cover some fixed overhead. But importantly, what's happening is we are in sourcing products that we've recently acquired. That in sourcing requires time before we get up to peak yield and performance so that in the short-term, dampens gross margin rate, but has a trajectory to improve gross margin rate over time. And then secondly, we have new launches that are coming online late in Q3 -- late in the second half of 2023 and moving into '24. Again, those are not at peak performance yet. That will ultimately improve gross margin rate as we cycle into later years. And then finally, I will say that over the last several years, we have absorbed some amount of inflation within our cost of goods sold. That is an area of opportunity for us as we think about improving performance longer term. So I hope that gives you some color. Operator : Next, we have Carter Gould with Barclays. Carter Gould : Maybe another kind of finance question here. Certainly, R&D in 4Q was meaningfully below kind of where you guys had set the guide there. How should we think about that? Does it just reflect sort of faster cost cutting? Is it just more an artifact of the later integration of SGen? And clearly, you're reaffirming your guide but just maybe if you can just sort of check that box for us, that would be helpful. David Denton : Sure. Probably not much to read into that. Obviously, R&D came in a little favorable than our expectations previously. Part of this is the fact that we are very focused on our -- realigning our cost base so consistent with the program. And then secondly, there probably is some timing that's dampening R&D in the fourth quarter that will slide into 2024 and into 2025. So there is some timing implications to that performance level. But I think importantly, back to my prepared remarks is our focus is on delivering net savings of $4 billion. And if you look through the end of 2023, about half of that we've achieved already. We're now focused on achieving the additional $2 billion or so as we cycle into 2024, and all eyes are on that objective. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Dave. We have high confidence on the number that we gave. Operator : Our next question will come from Louise Chen with Cantor. Louise Chen : Sorry, I was muted. Wanted to ask you on your Prevnar franchise. First of all, for the fourth-generation PCV, could you give more color on how it compares in contrast with Prevnar 20? And then just on the Prevnar order timing issue, was that U.S. or ex U.S.? Albert Bourla : Aamir, why don't you take the Prevnar question? And then maybe Alexandre, you can add a little bit color on the situation in the U.S. So what is the situation in Prevnar with the orders? Aamir Malik : Yes. So Louise, with regards to Prevnar, with the pediatric business, we often see some lumpiness in quarterly revenues, given the timing and impact of CDC orders, so it's difficult to kind of map that all out quarter by quarter. So you should expect that on the pediatric business. But the pediatric business, otherwise, we're very happy with how our launch is progressing and the growth momentum that we see there. On the adult business, I think it's different in the sense that we have a 96% market share that we closed the adult business with at the end of the year. But it's really important to keep in mind that we are operating in a market where the patient pool is steadily decreasing. There was a big catch-up opportunity versus the prior recommendation, and we've worked through that catch-up opportunity already. So the remaining patients are generally those that are aging into the 65-plus population as well as those with underlying medical conditions, and those are harder to activate patients. So we expect that business to continue to face that smaller patient population going forward. And we also expect competition with V116 emerging that will make the adult market more competitive, but we see a lot of growth potential in the pediatric market. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Alexandre, how was the Prevnar situation in the last quarter or in the year in international markets? Alexandre de Germay : Yes. Louise, good question. As you know, the majority of our ex-U.S. business is driven by tender. And of course, we book the sales when we ship the product. It doesn't reflect utilization. And then the government schedule their campaign in their respective markets. The reality is that we continue to have an IP exclusivity in 130 markets around the world. And at the same time, we continue to progress both on the pediatric, as you saw last week, the CHMP positive opinion, and now we're going to go into the final approval and then vaccine technical committees and pricing in all those markets, so that will take a bit of time. But at the same time, we see some positive traction on the adult franchise, where we have launched in over 30 markets. And we see some very good developments with the recommendation of the Vaccine Technical Committee. To give you an example, we used to have very limited access on our Prevnar 13 in country like Germany or France and UK. And we just received a recommendation from the VTC in Germany that actually recommended usage of Prevnar 20 in old adults over 60 as well as at-risk population from 18 to 59, which we believe we have a significant growth opportunity in increasing vaccination in the adult population ex-U.S. Albert Bourla : And Mikael, to conclude what about the fourth-generation Prevnar? Mikael Dolsten : Yes, I'm very pleased that the fourth generation has entered clinical studies. It has a Fast Track designation from U.S. FDA, indicating a unique product offering. And it includes some of the new technology we have developed that gives us a really cutting-edge tool box, whether it's chemistry carriers or reformulations. And of course, it relies on the unique Pfizer platform to have potential prevention of both invasive disease, which is the smaller disease burden and pneumococcal disease, which causes more than 150,000 hospitalizations. And to the best of my knowledge, we are the only one that can address both of them. So we feel very good about that entry. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael. So to summarize the Prevnar, which I know it is in the minds of all, let's start with the commercial front. In the U.S., clearly, the adult opportunity, we have taken the cream basically of the catch-up opportunity. This is happening once you are getting a recommendation from CDC for a catch-up. This market, the pool of patients has been largely exhausted. We have already 96% market share of that. So this is not a market, the adult now that we expect that will continuously grow in the U.S. Pediatric, very different story because our market share is now growing, and we have indications that we'll continue growing very strongly. So we expect in the U.S., the Prevnar situation to be a strong growth story in pediatrics. International, both, we expect to see growth because the products have just been launched, and then the recommendations are following. So there is a delay in international higher than usually there is in the U.S. So we expect to see growth in adult and pediatrics. I want to reemphasize that we have basically exclusivity of Prevnar 13 in more than 100 countries, 113 countries in of tenders. And we plan to convert that now to 20. And then on the fourth generation, we are moving full speed. We think that our expertise will allow us to build a polyvalent vaccine that will really compete very, very nicely as a fourth generation and will do that successfully and fast. So that's the story and let's move to the next question, please. Operator : Next, we have a question from Trung Huynh with UBS. Trung Huynh : Trung from UBS. Two, please. So in your prepared remarks, you noted you took a $1.4 billion impairment charge associated with etrasimod. Can you add more color here? What prompted that reevaluation? And any feedback of how that launch has gone? Secondly, on Abrysvo, so can you give us some color on how your contracting has evolved in '24 versus '23? And based on that, what's your market share do you think you can capture this year versus the 35% last year? Albert Bourla : Thank you very much. Why don't you take the impairment question and then I will move to commercial? David Denton : Yes. So on etrasimod, keep in mind that this product, we still anticipate to be over $1 billion in peak sales. As you know, there are multiple indications attributed to this medicine. And financially, as you look at that medication, there were additional indications that met the financial criteria for an impairment of which we took in the quarter. Clinically, obviously, clinically, there's still some work that will be ongoing in support of the asset. So with that... Albert Bourla : Thank you very much. So Aamir, maybe etrasimod commercially, how the launch is doing and the Abrysvo? Aamir Malik : Sure. So I'll start with etrasimod or VELSIPITY as we call it. So just in terms of the product value proposition, we think this is a very promising oral option for moderate to severe UC patients. It's got strong efficacy that patients and physicians we've exposed this to. They want to start transitioning from conventional therapy to advanced therapy. And it gives them an option also to maintain once-a-day oral routine, which many are already on instead of beginning with an injection or infusion. So about 80% of those patients that haven't progressed to an advanced therapy prefer an oral option, but only about 10% of those patients actually get one. So there's a very clear need here that VELSIPITY can help us fit. And the benefit risk profile for VELSIPITY is also very, very strong. So we approved -- we received approval at the end of last year. And so we've invested efforts in building HCP and patient awareness on the label and on the value proposition. But I just want to remind you that with any immuno-inflammatory product, it takes time to get broad national access. And that is where our focus is right now is ensuring that we secure VELSIPITY access as a first-line advanced therapy oral option, and that's going to take some time to put in place. And when we have that in place, we see upside momentum from the launch. Albert Bourla : What about Abrysvo? Aamir Malik : On Abrysvo, I'll comment briefly on the adult and then on the maternal. On the adult vaccine, I think the market was clearly ahead of everyone's expectations and not limited by shared clinical decision-making versus a routine recommendation. We would like to do better than the 30-some percent share that you referred to as well. So we're very focused going forward on retail contracting for the '24, '25 season. But I will also mention that we are doing that with real thoughtfulness on ensuring that we secure a profitable share in those contracts and also differentiating using our maternal indication. We also see opportunities in the non-retail setting, where for example, with the system and with IDNs, we have strong share. And we're going to also focus on new opportunities that we're currently studying with Abrysvo, adults aged 18 and older with underlying medical conditions as well as a new packing presentation to better fit our customer needs. So we see momentum there. And on the maternal side, we're only a few months in, but we're encouraged by what we're seeing as the first maternal vaccine to prevent infants from birth to six months when they are the most vulnerable. More than 65% of women prefer to get the maternal vaccine versus having their infant immunized with a monoclonal antibody. And we think that the label provides us opportunity to grow that segment as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Terence Flynn : Two for me. I guess the first one is just Comirnaty rest of world was ahead of consensus expectations this quarter. Just wondering if there were any one-time benefits in that number, if that's a fair go-forward sales level to think about through 2026, given the existing EU contract? And then the second one is, I noticed that Danuglipron wasn't mentioned in the PR or the prepared remarks. Just wondering if that once-daily PK trial completed yet and what the next steps are there? Albert Bourla : Thank you very much. Maybe very quickly on Danuglipron, we didn't mention because we don't have anything to say more. So that's the only thing. There is a program, which is composed with a lot of experiments that we are doing now. In terms of moving it to once-a-day and we will speak only when we have data. We don't want to become now the focus again of another earnings call. But that being said, I'm moving it to Alexandre to discuss about Comirnaty in the rest of the world outside the U.S. What are the dynamics of Comirnaty? Alexandre de Germay : That's why there are several elements playing out on the Comirnaty franchise. First, what we see is restrictions on vaccination guidelines, right? So versus the previous years, we see that the guidelines are really focusing on the older population as well as the at-risk population. But we have, as you know, already signed several contracts with the European Commission, Canada, UK and Australia. And following the approval in August last year, we started to execute on our contract with the European countries. As a matter of fact, some countries have decided to advance some of their order in 2024 into 2023 so that they can execute their activation campaign properly. The other trend that we see is that actually, we don't see major vaccination uptakes in the future year. We think that what we have seen in 2023, 2024 campaign is really the type of acceleration we will see, and that will be carried on the next few years. The only area where there is a potential future growth in terms of vaccination uptake is, if we can increase our co-administration with the flu vaccines where in all our key markets, the rate of vaccination in flu is actually higher than it is for Comirnaty. So we believe that there is potentially here an opportunity. The last point that I want to say is, as you see that the Comirnaty self-pattern is evolving towards a seasonal pattern. So you saw you have a very strong Q4, like you expect in flu vaccination type of markets. And that\u2019s what we see also to be expected in 2024. And actually, as I was reading some of your models in the financial community, I think there is some confusion that we will have higher Q1, Q2, which I believe will be more towards the second part of the year, but of course, in line with the guidance. Operator : Our next question will come from Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Umer Raffat : I was looking at SEC filings from Cerevel and they disclosed that Pfizer was open to putting out a bid on Cerevel after Phase 3 data, which would have been in 2024. Meaning I also noticed that you were saying you're not open to a buyback in 2024 and deleveraging remains a top priority. So I just want to balance those two, especially also in the context of where the stock stands. Albert Bourla : Look, I will ask Dave to speak about it. But the fact that we are looking everything and we are engaging in everything doesn't mean that, that's our obligation. We are doing all the work. It doesn't mean that our intention is to deviate the capital allocation strategy that we have just articulated. And that is the number one priority is our dividend and the growing dividend. Then it's a year of execution. We try to delever as David said. And then once we bring our deleverage to the levels that we are aspiring, we will start also moving into share buybacks and, of course, M&A, which means that for '24, we will see everything in existence because we never say never to business development opportunities could come. But our strategy, it is that you will not see anything major in business development in terms of dollars. David, did I say it well? David Denton : You said it well. You are correct. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much. You are a good teacher. Thank you. And the other question, Umer? I think that was it, right? Operator : Next, we have Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Tim Anderson : Maybe for Aamir. So Eliquis is the biggest drug on the initial list of 10 drugs for IRA. CMS has until February 1 to provide you the initial proposed negotiated price so that's two days away. So two questions here. Can you confirm you haven't already received that initial proposal yet? And second question, can we expect that at some point between now and September 1, which is the deadline that they have to make the final price public, that you'll give some investors some sort of directional information on how those discussions are going? Are we going to be kind of in the dark until September 1? Albert Bourla : So Aamir, are you planning to give light to more? Give us. Aamir Malik : So Tim, as you can appreciate, this whole price setting authority in Medicare, this is new and pharma companies obviously beginning to understand this process of the federal government. The rules are complicated, so we\u2019re wrapping our mind around it. Our alliance partner, BMS, is taking lead and engaging with CMS and an official process to determine the price for Eliquis in Part D that will begin in January 1, 2026. And also, as I\u2019m sure you can appreciate, we\u2019re not going to comment on an ongoing price-setting process and negotiation. Albert Bourla : Yes, it\u2019s very difficult to comment on these things because they are ongoing. So it\u2019s very inappropriate and absolutely could complicate things. I understand that there is a need for people to understand because that\u2019s an important product. And we will try as soon as possible and practical to be able to provide the level of details that we are looking at everybody is looking so that we can model it appropriately. Operator : Our next question will come from Andrew Baum with Citi. Andrew Baum : A couple of questions, please. First to Aamir, under your new leadership and commercial focus, what key products would you guide us to of recent launches that we should look for in terms of acceleration of rollout trajectory? And it doesn't have to be recently launched, established ones as well. And then second to Mikael. Could you just share a little bit more information about your next-generation PCV vaccine, specifically how many serotypes? And I'm assuming that given it's a new technology, you will lose the ability to grandfather the pneumonia claim from the CAPiTA trial into the profile as it matures. If you could confirm, that would be great. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much, Andrew. Your assumption, I don't think it is correct, but Mikael will answer that. But let's first go to Aamir to basically give us a view how you see in '24 the priorities of the commercial execution in the U.S. Aamir Malik : Yes. So Andrew, I'll take a step back and let me start by saying, I've been very excited about this role and this opportunity. And also to do it with the team that we've built, which is a mix of both seasoned Pfizer leaders as well as experienced leaders from outside of Pfizer. I mean, my focus and we can talk about specific products, we've touched on many of them already. But my focus overall is on execution excellence, right? So in our primary care and specialty care portfolio, we have a lot of great brands. We have some really enduring franchises, VYNDA, Eliquis, Prevnar. I spent quite a bit of time talking about that. Our focus there is to defend and grow where we can and we do see some opportunities. And we also have to acknowledge that we have some brands that have great value propositions, but they happen to be in highly competitive categories with some very, very well entrenched competitors. So in a situation like that, my focus is principally, let's really prioritize the actions that can grow each of the brands and we can talk about the individual launches. There's a lot of operational focus on blocking and tackling, including contracting. And then when we look at our main resources, we have our field force, our advertising and promotion dollars and our medical capabilities just prioritizing exactly where we put those. That is what I'm focused on with me and my management team. And as I mentioned, we see opportunities in some of the core franchises and defending and growing our share but then also in a number of our launches. And Albert mentioned in his opening remarks what we hope and expect to do with Abrysvo, with Nurtec, with Litfulo, with Sabinko. Those are all brands that we're going to continue to focus on, including some of our recent acquisitions like Oxbryta as well. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Aamir. Andrew, let me take the liberty to ask also the other commercial leaders to comment a little bit on their priorities because that will give you better sense of the whole picture. Alexandre, in international, as you are taking over, what are your key priorities? Alexandre de Germay : Thanks for the question, Albert, and the opportunity to share my priorities. My main focus is really to focus on the area where we can generate material growth with improved return on investment. This is my mantra. How are we going to do that? My top four markets in the order, China, Japan, Germany, and France represents 40% of our international divisions. So it's quite concentrated. Those four markets will report directly to me so that we can have the resources and support the country to execute on their plan at best and to generate the most growth. Our top 15 country represents 70% of our total international. So it's, again, quite concentrated. What I'm actually doing currently is in each of those markets, we are selecting drivers of growth. What are the key in-line and the key new products where we can have material impact with improved return investment? So I give you an example, of course, is going to be different from one country to the other because the archetype and the dynamic of those markets are different. So last week, I was in Japan. And so for instance, Vyndaqel, diagnosis rate is half the diagnosis rate that we have in the U.S. and in France. So we reviewed last week the plan to go and catch those increased diagnosis rate. And we're going to continue to, of course, track on execution. In Germany, Eliquis has a very strong Eliquis franchise. We believe we have got untapped opportunity. And I'm next week in Germany to actually review the plan on the Eliquis precisely. And we'll do the same thing on the new product. And it's going to be, for instance, LORBRENA in China. As you know, lung cancer in China is unfortunately affecting a large proportion of the population. And as a matter of fact, the proportion of the lung cancer that can benefit from LORBRENA in the worldwide community is about 1.7%. In China, it's actually 7%. So we believe we have a huge opportunity. What are we doing is actually developing a plan, last week when I was visiting China, to quickly get LORBRENA to those patients that could benefit from the clinical outcome. So this is really what I'm doing in each of our top 15 countries. Then frankly, the rest of the year will be simply tracking our execution, tracking all the metrics both from activities, medical activities and KPIs for each of our key products. Albert Bourla : And then maybe, Chris, also on the commercial front? How do you think of the oncology in the U.S. evolving? Chris Boshoff : Thank you, Andrew, Albert. Our biggest priority right now is obviously continuity of the business. We've done a lot of work during the last nine months during integration planning. And we don't want to miss a peak and it's now moving towards flawless execution with immediate priorities, obviously, the PADCEV launch for advanced/metastatic bladder cancer from the EV-302 study, the launch of XTANDI in non-metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer from the EMBARK trial, the early launch, and also focus on access and awareness during 2024 for Abrysvo in late-line multiple myeloma. And for TALZENNA where up to 25% of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer would be eligible in the U.S. for the -- from the indication. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Chris. And then let's go to Mikael Dolsten, if you can make some comments on the next generation as much as you can share about sales. Mikael Dolsten : Yes. I think we have a very strong position with good momentum in the PCB conjugate. And I think Alexandre, you mentioned just the positive recommendation we got for PCB 20 in Europe. Now we're building on that unique platform. And as Andrew did say here, we are able, what you call, grandfather in unique claims for the higher segment for penumococcal pneumonia. It's really the major burden with 150,000 U.S. hospitalizations. And to the best of our knowledge, the Pfizer platform with a new fourth generation, as was with the third generation, will be the only one that can that claim based on, as you said, the original CAPiTA studies. Now the new generation will contain more serotypes, has applicability for adults and possibly pediatric as we have done with all of ours. And it also will include improvement on existing serotypes to, all together, get a very good increased coverage versus the PCV20. And I do think we are the one that really can continue this expansion of more serotypes, but you need communication chemistry to carry some reformulations. And I am cautious to abandon Neseritide where you work on infant and adults as the characterization what caused disease, for example, pneumonia is not very well described, so maintaining the coverage as we have uniquely and it's not really happening with the other product is a unique differentiation. So I feel very good about the fourth generation. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael. Operator : Our next question will come from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Geoff Meacham : Albert, the oncology franchise following Seagen, I suspect, will probably be one of your bigger growth drivers for Pfizer going forward. The question is, is there an intermediate or long-term target as a percent of revenue that you're looking to achieve for this segment? And then are there technologies beyond ADC that you think could be additive to the pipeline? Albert Bourla : Yes. Very general, then I will ask Chris to comment a little bit on the technologies that we are having here. I can't say how much oncology will contribute. But clearly, we have given expectations about Seagen, and we say that we expect it to be at $10 billion by year 2030 from $3.1 billion we gave guidance in 2024. And actually, we feel very good about the $10 billion. The more data coming, when we gave the $10 billion, we were not aware of some of the readouts that follow that projection. So we feel very, very good about that. Now, I have to say that the Pfizer pipeline in oncology, I think was also among the strongest in our therapeutic areas. So I think the combination, in general, is giving us, let's say, a lot of strength. But Chris, why don't you comment a little bit about how you see the R&D evolution of oncology, the platforms you are going to base your strategies? Chris Boshoff : Thank you. So with the modalities we want to focus on for now are those where we see we have significant strength and capabilities, including with medicinal chemistry, our protein engineering as well as our strength in cancer biology. We therefore want to focus on small molecules, especially from our La Joya site, bispecifics, both La Joya and the new Seattle site and ADCs in Seattle. So small molecules, biologics. As you know, we do have an interest also in allogeneic CAR T cells with the formation of Allogene, the company we still follow and have a significant interest in. But we're now focused on those three modalities where we see significant opportunity also for combinations, for example, doing small molecules, ADCs, but also potentially in the future between ADCs and bispecific. Operator : Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Mohit Bansal : Maybe a question on Nurtec, the trends in market share as well as pricing. Just wanted to make sure that is there a significant price delta between Nurtec price versus the competitor price, I mean, the discounts that they are offering, given that your competitor has multiple offerings in the headache market. And if there is a delta, do you expect this to grow or decline over 2024 on pricing? Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mohit, very much. Aamir, about Nurtec and in general, the migraine franchise. Aamir Malik : So Mohit, thanks for the question. So we were encouraged by Q4 for Nurtec, and I'll also include some comments on ZAVZPRET as part of my response. We were up more than 30% versus the prior year and 20% -- over 20% versus the prior quarter. And there's a few things that are encouraging. Nurtec continues to be the number one prescribed CGRP, so we have leading TRx volume and share. Interestingly, more than 90% of new prescribers in the category, many of whom are primary care physicians are prescribing Nurtec. And our pills per Rx has also, over the last several quarters, been steadily writing. So we continue to see opportunity. And there's a few things to keep in mind. One is, there's still a lot of unmet need. Albert referred to it in his written remarks. But there's a lot of patients undiagnosed. Very few get an Rx therapy. Oral CGRPs are still only less than 20% of the Rx market. But as you point out, this is also a very competitive category with Qulipta and Ubrelvy. And I won't comment specifically on their pricing strategies versus ours and GTMs play a role in all of it. But our focus for Nurtec, one, I think we want to be sharper and more competitive in our patient engagement and activation. Two, we have an opportunity with our field force to focus on both the most relevant CGRP writers, and as I said, PCPs. PCPs write two-thirds of triptans but only about a little over one-third of CGRP so there's an opportunity there. And then patient access and experience, there's an opportunity to really reduce the friction there. And I will also mention ZAVZPRET because with an intranasal, we think we can have a very nice complement to an oral for either rapid pain relief, and there's also an unmet need for patients that have nausea and vomiting from the use of an oral. So we want to continue to invest in growing our Nurtec and ZAVZPRET franchise. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Scala with TD Cowen. Steve Scala : Two questions. First, on Danuglipron, I know Pfizer doesn't want to provide an update. But clearly, the company has greater insight than we do into how the once-daily version is performing in the Phase I PK trial. So I'd like to ask how would you characterize that performance so far? In the absence of any visibility, it's kind of hard for us to be confident in the outlook for this program. Second question is a new weight loss agent was added to Phase I, designated 6016. Can you tell us what the mechanism is, please? Albert Bourla : Yes. Steve, I'm going to disappoint you because you are asking things that we have said we are not willing to disclose at this stage for multiple reasons. Clearly, on Danu, we have more information than is very normal with everything that we are doing because we're having a very complicated, as I said, multiple experiments plan right now. But because we don't have new data, we're not going to comment on that. And on the new weight loss molecule also, we said that unfortunately, we are not going to disclose the mechanism of action. The reason is because, first of all, it's too early. We don't want to keep competition, nothing strange about that. So I'm sorry to disappoint you but there is not much to offer at this stage. Hopefully, as we said, mid-year is where we expect to have more information on that. Operator : Next, we have David Risinger with Leerink Partners. David Risinger : Thanks for all the updates. So I have two questions, please. First is for Dave. Could you please discuss the '24 gross margin [indiscernible] some detail. I think on the last call, you had discussed potentially a low 70% gross margin. But if you can comment on that in more detail, that would be helpful. And the second question is for Mikael. If Danuglipron once-daily does have a profile that you're looking for, would the company then conduct a Phase 2A dose ranging study to assess the efficacy and tolerability in order to design a dose to advance Phase 2B or Phase 3? Albert Bourla : Thanks, Dave. Very quickly, Mikael, resolve Danu and then we'll go to Dave. Mikael Dolsten : Yes, you heard Albert say that we are running a number of clinical experiments to garner insight in that molecule, and we have a second lift. Pfizer has always been open to consider different types of clinical study design. And in general, we tend to move into directly whenever data is supportive, if there is a large safety database into Phase 3 with a lead-in phase. But we have to look at each program by program. So when we have all the data, we will be able to share with you. Albert Bourla : Yes. Let's go to the gross margin where we can serve a little bit more information. David Denton : So David, this is Dave, and I'll be very brief here. Obviously, we've indicated our '24 gross margin expectations are in the low 70s as we discussed previously. As you know, as we cycle into '24, there's a few things that are happening, as I indicated earlier. One is, as COVID comes down, we're kind of deleveraging as COVID had absorbed a lot of fixed overhead. So that's compressing gross margins. Secondly, we're in the process of in-sourcing many of the acquired products over the last couple of years. And as we in-source, the short-term effect of that is dampening on gross margin, which gives us an opportunity to improve gross margins as yields improve over time. And then finally -- or two things finally here is new launches have that same characteristic, as we launch a new product, yields and performance in -- are not at peak performance. That will be an opportunity for us going forward. And then finally, we have absorbed some inflation over time that is an opportunity for us to take out over the next several periods. So again, an opportunity for us to enhance performance over time. But again, we're in this roughly low 70s for 2024 is our expectation. Albert Bourla : And David, let me add a little bit more color here, but the Comirnaty and Paxlovid are big products, but they are manufactured in the same facilities, but they are separate facilities so they are not affecting the margins of the other products. So the margins were really absorbing in those facilities when you had such a huge volume production and value reduction, of course, the margins were seriously -- those products are seriously taking a lot of the overhead. Now, as we are reducing our expectations for COVID into very realistic within targets, this doesn't mean that we have eliminated our capacity to produce more if the demand is there because that would be not responsible, first of all, from a public health perspective but also from our investors' money perspective. So that's why so far, we maintain all this capacity although the revenues are down. So there's a significant. The second thing that David said, keep in mind, all basically our new acquisitions that brought so many new products, they were from smaller relative companies. They didn't really have their own manufacturing. So these were all outsourced and outsourced, of course, is way more expensive than when you are able to bring it. There are plans for everything, in-source, but in manufacturing, that takes three years, right, to be able to reduce the margin. And the last but not least, we have disproportional amount of new loans. And those new loans are coming with a very big cost when you build infrastructure or something new to be developed, but of course, you build it for your PIK revenues. But of course, you start with very low revenues and then those are going up. So as the infrastructure is there, but then higher revenue for these new products are coming, it\u2019s always the case with new products, but margins are expected. So it\u2019s not something about gross margins. You can see it in months. You see it in years the improvement. But clearly, this is an area that we know why it\u2019s happening what\u2019s happening and how we can improve it. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Chris Schott : And maybe just for Dave and Albert, just kind of building on mid- to longer-term margin piece of the equation. It sounds like we should think about margin recovery as a gradual process versus a snapback? Is that fair? And I guess, the bigger picture question I was asking is just how do we think about reasonable longer-term margins, maybe not giving specific time lines, but can we think about kind of like mid- to high 30% operating margins as still a reasonable target for Pfizer? Or just kind of factoring in some of the dynamics we're seeing now, do we need to kind of rethink where margins can go over time? David Denton : No, I think you're absolutely correct. Mid- to high 30s is a reasonable target for us, with a slight caveat in the sense that the vaccine program, Comirnaty, has a shared, as you know, gross margin level with our partner. And so that\u2019s dampening to gross margins and operating profit. So I\u2019ll say, slightly mix adjusted for that product. And then from a progression standpoint, yes, you can think about this as a gradual steady improvement story over the next several periods. Operator : Our next question comes from Rajesh Kumar with HSBC. Rajesh Kumar : Just on the medium-term margin profile. Thank you for the color you've provided. If you think about the growth aspirations you have, does that require you sacrificing some of the margins? So if you were to say, at the top end of your growth profile would we be looking at mid-30s gross margin or lower? Or what is the balance there? And the second one, you briefly touched on your capital allocation priorities earlier. Obviously, cost cutting and deleveraging is a priority for 2024. In the medium term, which are the therapy areas where you would deploy more capital after 2024 deleveraging exercise done? Albert Bourla : David, why don't you take that? David Denton : Yes. So maybe on the margin discussion, obviously, what we've said is we have invested pretty substantially in our business over the past couple of years. So largely, the investment phase at least from a business development standpoint is behind us. We have work to invest to improve performance going forward, but the big dollars are already invested now. It's an execution story and a continued improvement story. So you should expect that to occur over the next several periods. Obviously, the higher the revenue, the better performance because you get to leverage your fixed costs. So clearly, the higher those revenue targets and achievements happen, the better improvement from a margin perspective you should expect from us. And then from a capital allocation perspective, I think you said it right. We are, at the moment, focused on executing our plan, focused on supporting our dividend growth over time, but importantly, beginning to delever as we cycle into an integration of assets. And then from a priority standpoint, clearly, we've made a significant investment in oncology. You should expect us to put the investment thesis behind that franchise going forward. Clearly, that's number one at this point. Albert Bourla : And I would add that following the oncology, where clearly, we have right now the biggest part of our R&D expenses and we have a significant also part of our SI&A expenses. The other areas that we are putting a lot of emphasis when it comes to reserve, clearly, vaccines, it's vaccines and we plan to have significant productivity. In internal medicines, our metabolic franchise, it is an area that we are very excited. Obesity is part of that. We do believe that obesity is a big market and it's growing. And we do believe that Pfizer has the capabilities that allows us to play and win in that area. So that's an area that we will continue investing. Immune inflammation, we have significant investments is the other area. And of course, we have -- we are among the few that they have antiviral and on the effective still investments. So those are the areas that we will put money in, oncology, number one, then vaccines, metabolic diseases, immuno-inflammation antivirals are the ones that we are continuing to invest in. Operator : Next, we have Kerry Holford with Berenberg. Kerry Holford : Just a couple of pipeline questions for me, please. Firstly, on RSV. Can we expect you to announce the date for Abrysvo following that third season in Q2? And then also on the two Phase 3 starts, you've highlighted today B6A in lung and CDK4 in breast. When can we expect Phase 3 data readouts for these two products? Albert Bourla : I'm not sure -- what was your question on RSV? Kerry Holford : To understand when are you going to publish the data from the following the third season, third winter season of RSV? Albert Bourla : Yes. Yes, I got it. Thank you. Why don't you take that, Mikael, on the Abrysvo? And then, Chris. Mikael Dolsten : We continue to accumulate important RSV data and expansion of how the -- this important vaccine can be used. So you should expect this first half of the year, likely Q2, that we share more from our clinical trials, including full second season but also expansion in traditional age groups, as you can know, on clintrial.gov, we have active trials, and we think that will very nicely allow high-risk groups across a large age span to be addressed. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael. And then, Chris? Chris Boshoff : Thank you very much for the question. So the immediate readouts for this year, second half 2024 will be the [indiscernible] in second-line hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer, the VERITAC-2 study, also second half 2024. We expect to anticipate results from BREAKWATER, very important indication, up to 12% of colorectal cancer with BRAFTOVI in first-line BRAF CRC. The new study starting right now is CDK4, B6A and dasitumab in Phase 3 programs and then also later this year for ECH2. Those will appear in clinicaltrials.gov and primary completion dates beyond 2025 and 2026, but obviously, there could be interim results with earlier results. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. Chris Shibutani : Two questions, if I may. Aamir, with your prior role, you had talked about a $25 billion in revenues by 2030 that the company was looking to deliver based upon M&A. We have the impairment with Arena. Is there an update for that? And now that you're in the role of U.S. Chief Commercial Officer, non-oncology, non-COVID, what would be on your wish list in your currency in terms of where you feel an opportunity to expand those revenues potentially through business development that could work to hit that $25 billion target by 2030? Then secondly, with the M&A activity across the industry, investors are always paying attention to what's going on with the FTC. Having passed through this gauntlet with Seagen last year, is there anything you can comment about to help us think about how regulators are thinking about the M&A environment in terms of particularly size of deal or any other dimension that you think is worth being aware of that might have been your observations from your experience in '23? Albert Bourla : Thank you very much. Aamir, why don't you take the question? By the way, let me clarify that Aamir's responsibility includes COVID revenue. So go ahead, Aamir. Aamir Malik : Okay. So Chris, there's a lot in what you asked. Firstly, on the $25 billion goal that we put out there, I'll just remind that we guided to $20 billion for what we plan on getting to by 2030 for the deals that we had done. And I would also just remind you that the $25 billion was a 2030 goal, so there is lots of time between now and 2030 to achieve that goal, consistent with our capital allocation priorities that Dave described. On your second question, I mean, to be honest, yes, everyone's got a wish list, but my focus is on exactly what I described right now and what we talked about as a management team, which is delivering value from our launches and delivering value from the deals that we've done. So that's where my focus is. Now lastly, in terms of FTC, it\u2019s not appropriate for us to comment on what the FTC is going to do or not do. But what I can say is that we feel very good about how we have operated with all regulators in all regulatory sites across the world to get done all the deals that we did. And I think that just speaks to our patient-centric approach and our collaborative nature with regulator. Operator : Next, we have Akash Tewari with Jefferies. Akash Tewari : Fair point on the Prevnar comments with the impairment charge and kind of the moving parts between adult pediatric and international. Consensus had modest top-line growth over the next few years for the entire franchise. Is that a reasonable expectation for investors, given the increased competition from Merck and the U.S. pool shrinking? And then do you have an internal view on what the ACIP recommendation will be regarding Prevnar and VV116? Albert Bourla : Look, Aamir, why don\u2019t you take the -- is it the Prevnar expectations? We don\u2019t comment on what the expectations of the Street are, right? So are we -- and I think we gave a very good, let\u2019s say, high-level trajectory how we see this market. In the U.S., the adult opportunity, it is mainly as always in with the adult, a catch-up opportunity. So where you come, you have a pool of all the people that are eligible, but some of them would choose to make the vaccine. Usually, that happens in the first year and maybe a little bit then on the second year. We have exhausted, I think, this opportunity with a 96% market share. So right now, I don\u2019t think that we will see in the U.S. in the adult huge opportunity. Merck competition is coming into that. So this is not a very big growth area for us because, as I said, this is not where we plan to do it. It\u2019s huge when you launch them very quickly, goes down because then it is just the people that we are really graduate, they are going into this cohort in terms of age. The big opportunity is pediatric because it is four doses, it's not one. And because it is a huge cohort every year, way bigger the cohort of newborns than people that are becoming 65. So that\u2019s how we should see it. So there is nothing much to add into that. Operator : Our last question will come from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Evan Seigerman : Two questions from me. One, when you think about the additional $25 billion revenues by 2030, now that Seagen's part of this business, where are we in getting to that metric? And then my second question is really on Oxbryta on sickle cell disease. When you bought the asset, you really -- you noted that you plan to speed up the distribution of the drug to parts of the world most impacted by the disease. We haven't really seen much OUS, given recent competitive approvals of in the Middle East. How do you think about the OUS opportunity in context of the competitive updates there? So Seagen and then thinking about some Oxbryta comments. Albert Bourla : On Seagen, maybe I can take it because that's an easy answer. From Seagen, we expect to get $10 billion by year 2030. That was a number that we put out there when we announced the acquisition. Since then, a few things that have reinforced our confidence in this number have occurred. The first one, it is that ADC became the hottest thing on the M&A activity. Everybody wants an ADC, which basically our big bet was in this technology. So it looks like there is an overall consensus among investors, companies, analysts that this is a technology that will deliver a lot. So that gives us a lot of comfort that happened after we announced. The second thing that also happened after we announced this $10 billion was that Seagen came out with significant readouts or significant products that were beyond our expectations. But also what you don't see but we see, they are advancing a lot of stuff that some of them we will show you in the 29 of February. So also, it was a bet in the technology, a bet in the company, we feel that we did very well in both. So the $10 billion is $10 billion of the $25 billion but we remain -- we don't change it, but we remain confident that we can make it. Then of course, in addition to that, there was an additional $10 billion for all the other things that we have done, and this $5 billion that we could execute. Now on Oxbryta, how Oxbryta is doing, Aamir? Aamir Malik : Yes. So Evan, with regards to Oxbryta and then I'll comment on the acquisition as well since you referred to that. We're pleased with the U.S. performance. Q4 was up 30% over the prior year and 14% over the prior quarter. The prescription trends are very solid. We've made a lot of investments in customer-facing teams since we made that acquisition. So we like the momentum that we're seeing in the U.S., and we expect to see more. Right now, the rest of the world is a very small part of Oxbryta revenue and that is something that will take time to develop and we'll obviously look at that appropriately. And as you think about the GBT acquisition, it's important to look at Oxbryta, but I also would remind you that we're also very excited about GBT601, which we expect can bring a lot of value in addition to Oxbryta. Some of it will -- if it's successful from a clinical and regulatory perspective, some sales will be cannibalized, but there will also be room for Oxbryta in the market to continue to grow. So when you look at the combination of the momentum in the U.S., an opportunity that's yet to be developed outside the U.S. and 601, where we presented great data at ASH in December, we think that there's a lot of value to be gained from this acquisition. Albert Bourla : Yes. And I would add, it is the same exactly with the GBT acquisition. When we did the acquisition, we announced our projections for year 2030. Since then, things have improved in terms of our confidence to deliver these numbers. And I'm not talking only that Oxbryta is performing exactly as we thought it would, but the most important upside is that we had data that we didn't have when we made the acquisition on the 601 but has the potential to become a transformative therapy in the sickle cell and really, really brings to the next step change if that thing -- if the Phase 3, let's say, reconfirms the Phase 2 results. So also over there, I think what we announced, we feel now we're more confident but we should be able to achieve and hopefully exceed. So with that, I think we start to end the call. In summary, we are optimistic about the year ahead. We have defined our five key priorities that will keep us focused. And I repeat again, this will be a year of execution. I have a sample, a team, that are handy that I believe are the absolutely right leaders to execute. And I know that the whole world was impressed with the way that we executed our COVID strategies, how we were able to execute on the R&D front, on the manufacturing front and on the commercial front with two products, the vaccine with the highest market share, and with the product in oral antiviral. We plan to repeat the same execution excellence level as we are building oncology leadership, as we are progressing the next wave of our pipeline, as we are maximizing the performance of all these new launches that have happened, as we execute our cost realignment program starting this year with SI&A, but also which you will see the results. But of course, the program to improve the gross margin that you won't see results now because it takes long but we started now as we speak, and laser focus in maximizing value for shareholders with the way that we allocate our capital. The team is there to make sure that this will happen, and I think we should meet again in three months, and we will see how we are progressing against those stated goals. Thank you very much, all. Bye-bye. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's Pfizer's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to Pfizer's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer and Senior Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am. Francesca DeMartino : Good morning, and welcome to Pfizer's earnings call. I'm Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer. On behalf of the Pfizer team, thank you for joining us. This call is being made available via audio webcast at pfizer.com. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the first quarter of 2024 via a press release that is available on our website at pfizer.com. I'm joined today by Dr. Albert Bourla, our Chairman and CEO; and Dave Denton, our CFO. Albert and Dave have some prepared remarks, and we will then open the call for questions. Joining for the Q&A session, we also have Dr. Chris Boshoff, EVP and Chief Oncology Officer; Alexandre de Germay, EVP and Chief International Commercial Officer; Dr. Mikael Dolsten, Chief Scientific Officer and President of R&D Doug Lankler, EVP and General Counsel; and Aamir Malik, EVP and Chief U.S. Commercial Officer. Before we get started, I want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements and discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. I encourage you to read the disclaimers in our slide presentation, the press release we issued this morning and our disclosures in our SEC filings, which are all available on the IR website on pfizer.com. Forward-looking statements on the call are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, speak only as of the call's original date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of the statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Albert. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Francesca. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. In the first quarter, we had a solid start to the year, and we are cautiously optimistic about what we will achieve in 2024. I'm pleased and appreciate how our Pfizer colleagues are executing with discipline as they focus on the patients and others we serve. This helped us deliver a strong performance during the quarter in our non-COVID product portfolio, drive progress towards our oncology leadership, advance our pipeline and continue to strengthen our business. Today, we will discuss highlights from the quarter and provide updates about how we are continuing to make progress with the 5 strategic priorities we served with you at the start of the year. We are proud of the positive impact we achieved around the world with our deep capabilities and global scale. Through the first 3 months of the year, we reached more than 119 million patients with our medicines and vaccines. We will continue to build on Pfizer's 175-year history of driving medical and pharmaceutical breakthroughs as we maximize the opportunities in front of us. Our confidence in the year ahead comes from our focus on executing the strategic priorities that we believe will deliver operational, commercial and financial success across our business. The priorities are : achieve world-class oncology leadership, deliver the next wave of pipeline innovation, maximize performance of our new products, expand margins by realigning our cost base and allocate capital to enhance shareholder value. In the first quarter, we made notable progress with each one, and I will share some highlights. Many of you joined us in our Oncology Innovation Day in February, and I hope you found it to be a valuable opportunity to see how we are well positioned to achieve world-class oncology leadership. We are pleased with the excellence we have been able to achieve in both integration and commercial execution. With a strong mix of Pfizer and Seagen colleagues in the newly combined team, we believe we have one of the most experienced and talented groups of oncology leaders in the industry. We\u2019're also already seeing the benefit of strong commercial execution with our newly cross-trained sales and field medical teams. In the first quarter of 2024, our oncology revenues grew 19% operationally over the same quarter a year ago, driven in part by : the acquisition of the 4 in-line products from legacy Seagen\u2014, \u2014and then particularly, the strong ongoing launch of PADCEV in front-line locally advanced/metastatic urothelial cancer, regardless of cisplatin eligibility, following FDA approval based on the groundbreaking EV-302 data. We have an increased demand for XTANDI, which continues to be a backbone therapy across the prostate cancer treatment continuum. And we have continued growth from LORBRENA, which could emerge as the potential first-line standard of care in ALK-positive metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer. Earlier this week, we also announced the full FDA approval of TIVDAK to treat recurring or metastatic cervical cancer. TIVDAK is the first antibody-drug conjugate to have positive overall survival data for patients with previously treated recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. Going forward, we are guided by a strategy focusing on our greatest opportunities to make a difference for patients with cancer. With the power of our deep expertise, broad and diverse portfolio and global scale, we are confident we are well on our way toward our 2030 goals of doubling the number of patients treated with our innovative cancer medicines; increasing the number of blockbuster medicines in our portfolio from 5 today to 8 or more; and driving an anticipated tenfold increase in the proportion of revenue from biologics. This is important because it brings the potential to provide more durable revenue based on several factors, including Inflation Reduction Act considerations and the greater challenges of copying complex biologics. We will look forward to sharing continued updates with you on our progress in accelerating oncology breakthroughs.  Now I\u2019'll turn to our progress with delivering the next wave of pipeline innovation. In Oncology, during the quarter, we had three pivotal Phase III study starts, including the first Phase III trial for our selective CDK4 inhibitor, atirmociclib; our integrin-beta-6-directed ADC, sigvotatug vedotin\u2014; and the fourth Phase III trial for ELREXFIO in multiple myeloma. At the upcoming American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting, we will present data spanning each of our tumor areas of focus and core scientific modalities, including new 5-year progression-free survival data for LORBRENA, Phase III data for ADCETRIS in diffuse large B cell lymphoma and additional developments from across our deep and diverse pipelines. We are also driving continued execution beyond Oncology, with a sharpened focus on key value drivers expected to build potential multi-billion-dollar product portfolios. Through the first quarter, we are on track with delivering on our anticipated milestones and have important updates in both our growing Respiratory and Hematology portfolios. With ABRYSVO, we believe we have the opportunity to further expand what is currently the broadest approved range of patients for the RSV vaccine, including adults 60 years and older and infants from birth to 6 months via maternal immunization. We recently reported positive results from the Phase III MONeT trial, evaluating ABRYSVO in adults aged 18 to 59 at increased risk for RSV disease. The trial met its primary endpoints, and we intend to submit these data to regulatory agencies. We believe ABRYSVO has the potential to become the first and only RSV vaccine for adults 18 years and older. Hematology is another priority area. With the progress of recent and near-term milestones, we are confident that we could establish a potential multi-billion-dollar product portfolio across hemophilia and sickle cell disease. We recently received the first U.S. FDA gene therapy approval for Pfizer with FDA approval for BEQVEZ, a one-time gene therapy for adults with hemophilia B. This program builds upon our growing presence in hemophilia. We expect an FDA decision before year end for marstacimab, which has the potential to become the first once-weekly subcutaneous treatment for the hemophilia B market, and the first treatment delivered as a flat dose for both hemophilia A and hemophilia B. Moving to sickle cell. We recently started the Phase III study of osivelotor, our potentially best-in-class next-generation hemoglobin S polymerization inhibitor. We are committed to addressing the underserved needs of the sickle cell disease community, and we are leveraging our capabilities for potential breakthroughs for these patients. Now, I'll turn to our strategic priority of maximizing performance of our new products. While it may take a year to realize the full benefit of the changes we put in place, as we speak, to bring a more efficient structure to our commercial operations, we are pleased by the impact we are already seeing from our sharpened focus and Pfizer colleagues embracing our high-performance culture. Earlier, I mentioned the momentum of our Oncology products. Our Pfizer U.S. Commercial and Pfizer International Commercial organizations are also moving ahead in driving progress with growth in their respective markets. We have several potential key growth drivers for this year and into year 2025. With ABRYSVO, we\u2019 are very pleased with the positive data in the 18 to 59 age group that differentiates our product, and we a\u2019re encouraged by our opportunities to continue increasing overall RSV market growth and market share.  Another example of -- is our enthusiasm for the potential of NURTEC to help the more than one billion people living with migraine worldwide. With oral CGRP penetration leaving room for potential significant growth, we will continue to Focus on reducing access barriers for health care professionals and patients, as well as on education through direct-to-consumer marketing. With OXBRYTA, we will continue to educate health care professionals and patients on the importance of proactively treating the underlying cause of sickle cell disease by reframing treatment goals to chronic and proactive treatment. VELSIPITY is coming off its annual (sic) [initial] launch, and we are focused on ensuring patient access as a first-line advanced therapy oral option for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. And I will mention LITFULO. We will work toward continuing to accelerate the consideration of advanced systemic treatments for appropriate patients with alopecia areata and further unlock access to LITFULO. Additionally, we continue to protect and grow our core brands and key blockbusters, including PREVNAR, VYNDAQEL and ELIQUIS. In a moment, Dave will provide updates about how we\u2019re also making progress with two other strategic priorities, expanding margins by realigning our cost base and allocating capital to enhance shareholder value. When we consider what we achieved in the first quarter, along with our continued progress in executing our 5 strategic priorities, we are cautiously optimistic about the year ahead. We are continuing to focus on commercial execution, protecting and growing our products and driving strong starts with new commercial launches. With the progress we are making in advancing our cost-realignment program, as well as our confidence in the underlying strength in our business and our continued execution, we have raised our outlook for 2024 adjusted earnings per share by $0.10. We have confidence in our company. With some of the most experienced and talented colleagues in the industry, we have demonstrated many times before that we are very good at execution, and we expect to continue delivering life-changing medicines for hundreds of millions of patients globally and meaningful value for our shareholders.  Now, I wi\u2019ll turn it over to Dave to discuss the financial performance during the quarter as well as our progress in strengthening our business and enhancing shareholder value. Dave? David Denton : Thank you, Albert, and good morning. As we continue to navigate a challenging post-COVID environment, I\u2019'm pleased to share that this year is off to a solid start. We are protecting and growing our core brands while investing in building a more effective organization. Our relentless focus on execution is positioning Pfizer to improve shareholder returns.  This morning, I'll briefly review the highlights of our first quarter results, then I'll touch on our capital allocation priorities. I\u2019ll wrap up by outlining our 2024 financial guidance as well as our key priorities for the remainder of this year. Turning to the first quarter, let me walk down the P&L. Total company revenues for the quarter were $14.9 billion, reflecting an operational decline of $3.5 billion or 19% versus last year. As you know, our business continues to be negatively impacted by a declining COVID environment on a global basis. To that end, we expect our COVID products will continue to have an outsized effect on both our top line and our bottom line throughout this year. However, I do want to point out that we expect our COVID products will continue to be contributors to revenues and cash flows for the foreseeable future. Strong commercial execution across the enterprise drove 11% operational revenue growth in the quarter when you exclude COMIRNATY and PAXLOVID. Performance was positively impacted by our renewed focus on key products and markets, refined allocation of commercial field resources globally and further alignment of marketing resources into key priority areas. Contributing to this performance were our acquired products from Seagen, alongside in-line products such as VYNDAQEL, ELIQUIS and ABRYSVO. Dampening our growth in the quarter was the expected lower global demand for IBRANCE and SULPERAZON, driven largely by lower demand in China in the first quarter of 2024 versus last year. Adjusted Gross Margin for the first quarter improved by 530 basis points to 79.6% versus Q1 of last year. This improvement was driven by 3 factors. First were lower sales volume of COMIRNATY resulting in favorable sales mix. Second, in the quarter, we recorded a product return adjustment for PAXLOVID associated with our U.S. government contract, and I\u2019ll touch upon that in just a moment. And finally, we executed strong cost management across our manufacturing network. Improvements in our gross margin rate will continue to be an important focus for the company going forward. Total Adjusted operating expenses increased modestly by 1% to $5.9 billion compared to Q1 of last year despite adding expenses associated with the acquired Seagen business. This disciplined cost control puts us squarely on track to delivering on our $4 billion net savings commitment by the end of the year. Adjusted SI&A expenses increased 3% operationally in the quarter, driven by an increase in marketing and promotional expenses for recently acquired or launched products, partially offset by a decrease in expenses for PAXLOVID and COMIRNATY. Consistent with our strategy, we are prioritizing our R&D spending to enhance overall returns while supporting growth from our pipeline. For the quarter, adjusted R&D Expenses were $2.5 billion, a decrease of 1% operationally versus LY. The slight decline was driven primarily by a lower spending resulting from our cost realignment program and lower spending on certain vaccines program, largely offset by increased investments mainly to develop certain assets acquired from Seagen. Q1 reported diluted earnings per share were $0.55. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.82, which exceeded our expectations due to favorable gross margin performance as well as strong cost management across the enterprise. As I stated earlier, during the quarter, we recorded a favorable product return adjustment associated with our U.S. government contract for PAXLOVID. Recall that during Q4 of last year, we estimated the U.S. government credit for PAXLOVID was $3.5 billion. Earlier this year, the U.S. government announced that the EUA labeled product was no longer authorized for CUs and the agreed-upon return period had now expired. Given those facts, we can now finalize the total value of the U.S. government credit. This resulted in a favorable adjustment to revenues of $771 million for PAXLOVID and contributed $0.11 to the company's earnings per share. Now let me quickly touch upon our capital allocation strategy, which is designed to enhance long-term shareholder value. Our strategy consists of maintaining and growing our dividend over time, reinvesting in our business at an appropriate level of financial return and making value-enhancing share repurchases after delevering our balance sheet. During the first quarter, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders via our quarterly dividend, invested $2.5 billion in internal R&D and, as expected, business development activity was minimal in the quarter. We are committed to delivering our capital structure with a gross leverage target of 3.25x, which we expect to achieve over time. In support of that goal, during the quarter, we paid down approximately $1.25 billion of maturing debt. And in May, we will pay down another $1 billion of outstanding notes. And importantly, during the quarter, we began to monetize our Haleon stake through an initial sale of $3.5 billion, which reduced our equity position in the company from 32% to approximately 23%. Looking ahead to the next couple of quarters, I'd like to point out that we expect operating cash flow to be significantly below typical levels, largely due to the timing of certain payments. Despite this near-term pressure, clearly, our objective is to return to a more balanced capital allocation strategy over time. Now let me spend just a few minutes on our outlook for the remainder of this year. As we entered 2024, the company was highly focused on delivering on its financial commitments, and our performance in Q1 demonstrates that we are off to a solid start. With that objective in mind and the fact that it's still early in the year, we are modestly updating the earnings outlook for this year. We are raising our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance range by $0.10 to a new range of $2.15 to $2.35. Looking ahead, this increase takes into consideration both our improving line of sight to our cost savings targets and continued strength in our underlying business. As a reminder, our EPS guidance also includes an anticipated $0.40 of earnings dilution from the Seagen acquisition, largely due to financing costs. While the PAXLOVID revenue return adjustment moves us to the upper end of the revenue guidance range, our top line revenue expectations remain unchanged for the year. We continue to expect revenues in the range of $58.5 billion to $61.5 billion. In addition, even though COMIRNATY revenues continue to perform consistent with our plan, it is important to remember that we expect approximately 90% of our sales to occur in the second half of the year, mostly in Q4, given the seasonal nature of these products. Lastly, we remain on track to deliver at least $4 billion of net savings from our cost realignment program by the end of the year. Improving our cost base will put us on strong footing towards margin expansion and improved financial returns as we move forward. As you know, over the past 2 years, the company has made significant investments to drive growth in the back half of the decade, and we remain encouraged by the long-term growth outlook for Pfizer. 2024 is clearly a year of focus, execution and delivering on our near-term financial commitments. The foundation that we establish this year sets the stage to deliver on our commitment to enhance shareholder value, both this year and through the end of the decade. And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Albert as we begin our Q&A session. Albert Bourla : Thank you, David. Now let's start the Q&A session. Operator, please assemble the queue. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Louise Chen with Cantor. Louise Chen : I had a question for you on your RSV vaccine sales. Just curious what drove the downtick versus the fourth quarter. It looks like GSK had a similar downtick. And then how do you think about potential competition coming into the market for vaccines and treatments? Does that impact your future growth projections for this franchise? Albert Bourla : I think, Aamir, that's a question for you, then maybe Alexandre also, you can add because now we started already to register and approve the product in international markets. Aamir? Aamir Malik : Louise, thanks for the question. So it very much appears like the RSV vaccination market is following a seasonal trend, so you expect the dynamics in Q4 versus Q1 to be different. In Q1, what we saw for the market is for older adults, it certainly attenuated over the course of the quarter. So there was a peak in the second week of January, and then a steady week-by-week decline since then. Now in terms of the dynamics for our business and ABRYSVO, our performance was in line with what we expected. We think this will follow a seasonal trend. And we think we're very well positioned for the fall season for several reasons. One is we're progressing our retail contracting. Second is we have a real strength in the nonretail channel. You referred to GSK. They reported their revenues. When you look at the mix of U.S. revenues as reported, it's about a 60-40 mix. Our retail share is lower than that, but our nonretail share is much higher. And that portion of our business really doubled between Q4 and Q1 from about 9% to 17%. And I think that just speaks to our strength in doctors' offices and relationships we have with organized customers. And I'll also note that later this year, if approved, we will have a new presentation of ACT-O-VIAL, which demonstrates ease of administration, and also our clinical data, which Albert referred to in his remarks, for label expansion for ABRYSVO for 18- to 59-year-olds as well as -- that are at risk as well as durable efficacy through 2 seasons. I think the combination of these commercial efforts as well as potential label expansion really position us well for a fall season. Albert Bourla : Okay. Thank you, Aamir. Now, Alexandre? Alexandre de Germay : Yes. So Louise, thanks for the questions. On the international front, we actually made great progress on ABRYSVO. As you know, we got approval in the second half of 2023 in Europe and in the U.K. And since then, we've been working with the health authority and the experts to provide medical evidence and health care system benefits associated with the protection against lower respiratory tract infection, as with RSV, and through immunizations of maternal after the immunization of all the others. So we're making good progress. And actually, we have already received the recommendation in the U.K., in Australia, in Norway, and we are progressing and waiting some recommendations from the vaccine technical committee in many other European markets. We also had good progress from a regulatory standpoint because it was a milestone with the approval of older adults and MI during the maternal immunization in Japan in the first quarter as well as Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. So overall, they don't yet translate into financials because it takes time to get to the approval to get VTC and to get funding for those campaigns, but we see significant opportunity that we can address unmet medical need in the international. Just to give you 1 example, in Europe, for instance, half of the hospitalization due to respiratory tract infection in the first year of life were caused by RSV. So there is definitely a great opportunity. And the majority of those hospitalizations occurred for the first 3 months of age. And as you know, ABRYSVO is the only maternal vaccine that help protect infants from lower respiratory tract infection caused by RSV immunization from birth through to 6 months. So we see a great opportunity. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Alexandre. Operator : We'll take our next question from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Terence Flynn : Maybe just a 2 part from me. Just wondering if you can comment at all about potential impact in 2025 from the Part D redesign. We've heard a couple of other companies already comment here. And then one on the pipeline. Can you give us any update on danuglipron and your plans more broadly in obesity? Albert Bourla : Yes, thank you. Can you [indiscernible]? Let me take that one so to clear the way. It's not new. We don't have news on danu. Everything is as we have discussed before, so we are waiting around mid-year to get the totality of the data that relates to the once-a-day formulation. And then based on the data and everything else, we will make decision for future plans. So we'll speak about them when we have more to say. However, now let's go to Aamir about the Part D redesign in 2025. Did you expect them? Aamir Malik : Sure. Terence, thanks for the question. And as you can imagine, there's many moving parts to Part D redesign. I think relevant to our business, I think it's important to first note that as part of what already went into place with the redesign, there is no cost sharing imposed on vaccines. So that, given our significant vaccines portfolio, is a positive. And then, obviously, over the course of '24 and '25, there's other dynamics with out-of-pocket cost caps, which create better access for patients, and that is helpful to volumes, and we're starting to see that in '24 in some parts of our business, including on VYNDA. And then there's things to come, including a change in that cap as well as patient smoothing. So we'll see how that plays out. And obviously, there's also changes in how costs are shared between plans, manufacturers, government and patients. So how all of that gets implemented, we're tracking that very closely. We're not offering any specific guidance in terms of direct dollar impact on our business in 2025 because there's still a lot to come on this. And when we are ready to do that, we certainly will. Operator : We'll take our next question from Akash Tewari with Jefferies. Akash Tewari : On tafamidis, really strong quarter, but I wanted to ask on patent life. Given we've seen the EU patent office write-down multiple invalidity oppositions and on the U.S. side, it looks like defendants are conceding infringement. How should we think about IP for this product? Why shouldn't this patent fit out to 2025? And then number two, really strong quarter for PADCEV and you do have the pending TIVDAK launch in first-line cervical. Is there any possibility we could see CGM become accretive to Pfizer earnings by next year? Albert Bourla : That's very good questions. Why don't we go first to you, Dave, to speak a little bit about is doing very well. If you expect that can become accretive earlier. Also, I would like to hear some comments from Chris about the progress of the portfolio, and then Doug can comment on the IP situation, our customers. David Denton : Yes. So just maybe on Seagen from a financial perspective, obviously, clearly a very solid quarter and a very solid start to the year. I think we're not changing our expectations, both short term and long term for Seagen, but I think we're cautiously optimistic as we look forward. So probably nothing to update financially other than our continued commitment to the financial metrics that we've already established. And again, we're probably cautiously optimistic on the trends that we're seeing underlying that business at this point in time. Albert Bourla : You want to make some comments also, Chris, about the performance of the Seagen business? Chris Boshoff : Yes, I think just to add to what Dave has said, it's early days for as he pointed out, the 302, the data was -- we just launched early this year. We've already seen 164% year-on-year pro forma growth. It's early but we're very pleased that we've got NCCN Guidelines Category 1. We've got a New England Journal publication. We've got uptake in both academic and community settings. In fact, 70% of the current accounts on the community. And we're looking forward now because I think we're well set for the future in the muscle invasive bladder cancer setting and those 2 studies that we'll read out late in 2025, '26, '27. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much, Chris. Doug, what about the situation with the IP disputes? Douglas Lankler : Yes. VYNDAQEL and VYNDAMAX currently has U.S. patent exclusivity, excuse me, through the end of this year. But we have a patent pending patent term extension, which would take it out to December of 2028. And we may be filing additional requests for patent term extensions while that is pending. In major European markets, our patents expire in November of 2026. And in Japan, the patent expires in 2026, but there's regulatory exclusivity through March of 2029 for cardiomyopathy. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Doug. Thank you, Akash. Operator : We'll take our next question from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Evan Seigerman : I want to touch on gross margin. Obviously, a nice improvement in this quarter. And I believe, back in December, you had said, for the full year, it would be around 70%. Do you expect that we could actually see a better gross margin for the full year, given kind of the benefit we've seen? Or are there some other puts and takes that we should be aware of? David Denton : Yes, so this is Dave. We're always looking to improve our performance from both a gross margin and operating performance perspective. So I'll say we'll continue to focus on that. Obviously, as you know, there's 3 things that improved our gross margin rate in the quarter. Some of those are temporal. Some of those are more permanent. I think what is encouraging within our gross margin performance is the fact that our cost control element across our manufacturing platform was really strong. We expect that to be -- continue to be a focus.  But keep in mind that our COMIRNATY volume is very back half weighted. COMIRNATY, as you know, carries because of our profit share carries a very low gross margin rate. So that mix will reverse itself in the back half of the year, compressing and putting pressure on our gross margin rate. So you should expect that dynamic to occur as that product plays itself out through 2024. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim Securities. Vamil Divan : Congratulations on the quarter. The 2 products I want to just kind of touch on in terms of the sort of newer growth drivers. So one is NURTEC, which came in a little bit lighter than we expected. Obviously, the first quarter there tends to be impacted a lot by gross to net. I'm just trying to understand if you can just give a little more detail on what the dynamics in the quarter and any sort of change to your sort of expectation of that product outlook. And then the second one on the myeloma side, ELREXFIO. Just noticed in your slide presentation that used to be listed under the sort of key growth drivers in prior quarters. This year, on Slide 9, when your sort of key growth drivers is no longer listed there. So I'm just curious if -- it looks like it was an intentional change. I'm just curious, sort of what drove the decision to move that from the group of key growth drivers? Albert Bourla : Thank you very much, Vamil. Aamir, NURTEC, and then Chris, myeloma. Aamir Malik : Thanks for the question, Vamil. So I'm happy to talk a little bit about NURTEC. We'd like to accelerate the momentum of NURTEC, and we're taking several steps to do that. For the quarter itself, what we're encouraged by is the demand and the volumes that we saw. And then on the flip side, as you already alluded to, the performance in the quarter was impacted by gross to net. So on demand, a few points to just keep in mind. NURTEC continued its market leadership within the class with a 49% TRx share, and that was up 28% from Q1 of last year. Secondly, NBRx share, which we keep a very close eye on, that volume, as a whole, hit its high point since we closed the Biohaven acquisition at the end of '22. So that was up versus last year, but also, importantly, up versus Q4 of '23. And there were about 11,000 new NURTEC writers in Q1, and this is 90% of all the new writers within the oral CGRP class. So there's a lot about the volume and the demand that we're encouraged by.  Now on gross to net, there were 3 issues this quarter. One is you typically tend to see this dynamic in the first quarter of every year. We saw that last year, too, just given the benefit design dynamics. Secondly, we did have some payer mix issues between government and commercial channels this quarter. And then finally, there was an unfavorable onetime prior period adjustment to our GTNs in Q1.  Your question about the rest of the year, for NURTEC, we expect continued growth. We've talked about the fact -- the fundamentals in terms of untreated patients and undertreated patients remain strong. We also think that some of the gross to net that I described is going to be temporal and will slowly abate over the course of the rest of the year. And then we have made a number of changes in our commercial execution in terms of what we're doing with patient engagement and focusing our field force resources on physician awareness in a different way and also working to reduce friction for patient access. So overall, we do expect continued growth from NURTEC in the balance of '24. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Chris, about ELREXFIO? Chris Boshoff : Thank you, Albert. So the reason Albert didn't list ELREXFIO as a major growth driver, just to remind, so he pointed out  LORBRENA, XTANDI and PADCEV as the immediate biggest growth drivers for Oncology. But we're absolutely confident that ELREXFIO will become, over the next couple of months and years, a major driver for Oncology. Just a reminder, we've seen very promising efficacy data in highly refractory patient populations with deep and durable responses. And we've reported the longest reported median progressive-free survival in the recurrent relapsed/refractory setting of 17.2 months. Now of course, recognizing there's no definitive conclusion as there's no head-to-head studies. We're currently encouraged by what we've seen with the uptake, with the build of new patient starts as we have planned. And we remain very optimistic with the future from the current indication as well as from the future indications. And a reminder that we have 4 ongoing registrational studies in the next 12 months. The first Phase III study would read out multiple -- in the MM5 study. We've also recently received J-code for access, and we're smoothing the reimbursement process and continue to gain favorable positions on various pathways, and in some, the most favorable pathways. We're looking forward to update you very soon on more things from ELREXFIO. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Chris. And maybe Alexandre, you have anything to add about the product in international markets? Alexandre de Germay : Yes. On ELREXFIO, we actually have -- it's progressing very nicely because, as you know, we got approval in Europe in December of 2023 and in the U.K. in January, and in Japan in March 2024. So we are now moving into reimbursement, ABRYSVO. And we've got early access, considering the clinical profile, the exceptional clinical profile of the product. So that's why we got, in some market, early access, and that's why we started sales in the first quarter. But we are very satisfied by that. We could close the time-to-market gap versus competitor. And in some cases, like in Japan, we actually indeed became first-in-class approved. So then we are moving into registrational -- reimbursement discussion and introduction of the product later in the year. Albert Bourla : Yes. Overall, in most international markets, there is a gap between the approval and the access round. But because of the profile of the product, we saw early access, which is basically something that happens on an exceptional base if the product is unique. But some countries, before they approve the price, they are allowing you to have access to your own price and that they may be adjusted. So -- but there's a very good signs for this product. We are really feeling very bullish when we see the clinical profile and the opinions of the key opinion leaders. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Dave Risinger with Leerink Partners. David Risinger : Yes. So how many questions am I allowed to ask? Albert Bourla : You, Dave, you don't have a limit. David Risinger : Okay. So I have -- I'll keep it to 2. So first, regarding the company's cost structure. I'm just trying to get a sense of whether it bottomed out in the first quarter or if there are additional cost reductions ahead after March 30 such that the cost structure of the company is coming down after the first quarter. And then second, with respect to VYNDAQEL. I appreciate the comments in response to the question earlier, but I'm just trying to get a little bit better understanding of how to think about it.  So there was a comment about patent term extension potentially applying beyond December of '28. So if Pfizer is successful, what would the date be instead of December '28 for the U.S.? And then for the EU, the comment was November of '26. But I've heard that there was a positive EU patent development, and I'm trying to understand what that would extend the EU to. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much, Dave. So Dave Denton, please, you take the cost structure. David Denton : Yes. First, as you well know, rightsizing our cost structure is incredibly important for us from -- as we think of forward for margin expansion and improving our financial returns. As we look through Q1 and through the balance of the year, keep in mind that the cost changes that we've made in the U.S. are largely complete. Obviously, in ex U.S., some of those changes lag, but you will see changes in the cost structure ex U.S. for the balance of the year.  Those are probably not quite as large as we look forward compared to what has already happened at this point. But I would just say that this will be a constant focus for us as we think about cost and margin enhancements going forward. This is a -- now we're on a continual cycle of thinking about how we invest and what is the appropriate cost structure in support of our revenue objectives for this business going forward. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Dave. And Doug, can you please clarify a few things about VYNDAQEL to Dave Risinger's question? Douglas Lankler : Sure. Just to be clear, Dave, we shouldn't think beyond December 2028 on VYNDAQEL and VYNDAMAX. So we've got a patent term extension that is filed and is pending. And all I was saying was that, in addition to that patent term extension, which would take it out to December 2028 that we filed and is pending, we may file additional patent term extensions, again, though, just to take it out to December 2028. I hope that's clear. Albert Bourla : Thank you for clarifying that. Operator : We'll take our next question from Trung Huynh with UBS. Trung Huynh : Trung Huynh from UBS. One on the ACIP meeting coming up and just a clarification on the guide, if I may. So on ACIP in June, what's your expectation on the recommendation for the 50 to 59 population? Could this be a shared clinical decision like the 60-plus? Would you think this is going to be risk-based? Is there any chance you can get the 18 to 59 data on the agenda for this meeting? And just on the guide, a clarification here on the credit for the quarter bec you've kept your $3 billion guide for PAX. I appreciate the comment you're now going to be at the upper end of guide. But on PAX, do you expect to have $770 million less PAX sales than you imagined at the start of the year, given that you updated your EPS guide. Or was this expected? David Denton : Well, maybe I'll take that first. From a guide perspective, I would not -- we obviously did not expect this final adjustment. It was an estimate that we did at the end of the year. We're now finalizing the adjustment based on the returns that we've seen, and it is now complete. I would say that, as we look forward for the full year, both for PAXLOVID and for the full year of all of our products, we're cautiously optimistic about where we are.  I think PAXLOVID started off from a very solid utilization. And keep in mind that product will trend consistent with infection rates across the globe. And we're still cautiously optimistic that we will achieve our objective, and we do not expect anything less than our original expectation at this point in time. Albert Bourla : Thank you, David. And Mikael, on the ACIP meetings and the June-October recommendations, et cetera. Mikael Dolsten : Yes. First, to punctuate, good to hear you interested in our RSV vaccine. We have a lot of positive and informative data that's coming in 18 to 59. We have already been out sharing a robust outcome for that. And filing is imminent to happen in U.S. FDA. We also have data coming on second season, full second season and data so far that have been available show robust and probably best-in-class profile for us. And you heard AAMIR mention, we also have new delivery format. So there is a lot of positive things happening to further strengthen ABRYSVO.  For a formal decision on recommendation, ACIP normally wait until a product is FDA approved. We don't know exactly when FDA will potentially approve. We think, clearly, given this unique age range that it can happen to be meaningful for the fall, but that needs to be, of course, pending FDA's views. But we will certainly be very open to share data from several of these new important data sets that could help ACIP to understand the planning of the various RSV products. And we think that would be very helpful for ACIP as Abrysvo data set are robust and, in some sense, unique in a positive way. Thank you. Albert Bourla : Internal a couple of comments for those -- both of these questions. On the ACIP, we always don't speak for ACIP. So it's not appropriate, do ll do what they can to do. Of course, typically, as we say, they wait to see FDA approvals, and we hope that they will ask us to present the data in June, but it's something that we don't know. What we know is that whatever they decide, whenever they decide we have prepared our marketing and commercial plans in the U.S., as we do, of course, in other countries so that we can maximize the approvals or the recommendations or the data that we have. So that's 1 thing. The other thing, David explained that we are cautiously optimistic, of course, about -- that comes through the entire line of guidance that we gave. We are cautious in our revenues, cautious about margins. And of course, we improved, again, cautiously that we think the EPS. You need to see all of that in the context of who have been there last year with a big misalignment between what we were expecting to come for COVID and eventually what came. And that it is something that makes us to be double cautious when we speak about projections. We know credibility is extremely important for us. So everything we say, we feel rocket solid, but we will achieve. And we don't say anything more than that, we prefer to achieve rather than b safe. So that as a context to all the guidance that we have provided this time. Operator : We'll take our next question from Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Umer Raffat : A couple of financial focused questions, if I may. First, on gross margin. Dave, I remember last time you mentioned 2 specific things : in-sourcing of recently acquired products as well as new launches as being a drag on gross margin. Considering both those things were presumably baked into 1Q, and 1Q looked more like what the historic margin build would have implied, wouldn't that suggest full year margin is tracking meaningfully north of the full year guidance of 70%? Or were there one-offs like some inventory work down from recent acquisitions in 1Q that helped it? And secondly, and maybe this is for you and Albert both. Is there a potential for a significant monetization for some of your excess manufacturing capacity from over the years, be it fill finish or beyond, just considering what the broader environment is and some of the questions on dividend? Albert Bourla : I think David can take both of them. Dave? David Denton : Yes. On the gross margin side, as I said, there is a couple of things that impacted favorably our performance in Q1. The items that you listed of both new product launches and in-sourcing, the in-sourcing is probably a longer-term implication to us because those don't happen in an immediate quarter. So as you think about Seagen, it's probably a multiyear phenomenon that we have here. But I don't think that was an outsized impact to that. And obviously, the new launches, we plan for those to be compressing our gross margin rates, of which they did. I think we're off to a very solid start. But keep in mind what I said earlier, in the back half of the year, COMIRNATY sales will begin to ramp up. They compress our gross margin rate fairly significantly, given the partner contribution and payment that we have to our partners. So I would expect that to dampen our gross margin performance in the back half of the year. Umer, as you well know, we're focused on overdelivery, if we can. So I think we will do everything we can to continue to improve our performance there. And then finally, as we think about the balance sheet, first and foremost, I just want to reiterate that our #1 priority from a capital allocation perspective is both supporting and growing our dividend over time, and that is not at risk. Secondly, yes, we always look at the assets that we have across our platform and understand what's the best way to capitalize on those assets, and some of that may be monetizing some of that. Some of that may be operating more effectively. So everything is on the table from that perspective. Albert Bourla : Thank you, David. And although your answer was very complete, I will just reiterate something that you said because it seems like that some people, they want to hear it again. The dividend is a sacred cow for us. Dividend, it is secured, and we will continue our policy on dividend as we have promised repeating. And we don't have to monetize things to be able to see that. The reason why we are looking at all our assets is because we want to maximize return on the capital. And of course, we will see opportunities. I don't know when it makes sense, like the ones that we described, there is serious now issue with the sterile capacity that people are looking to acquire. We will look at everything, but it's not that we are looking right now on this or that because we need to support the dividend, all really to support the delevering opportunities or need to support the investments in the business, right? We can do that without doing any much. Thank you very much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Geoffrey Meacham : Just have 2 quick ones. The first is now that Seagen has been fully integrated, and you'll see some commercial leverage from the deal, would you expect to see more of a gradual impact on the PADCEV and et cetera, trajectories looking out a few years? Or could you have a more near-term inflection? And then the second question, Dave or Albert, the capital allocation commitment to the dividend is super clear. What we view on Slide 12 as dividend and deleveraging as the 2 highest priorities, or is bolt-on BD still in the mix for this year or next? Albert Bourla : Yes. Let's go to Chris to understand the commercial impact on Seagen and how that will take time. Chris Boshoff : Thank you very much. So as you know, we had a number of months planning prior to close to ensure we had a seamless integration. And we completed cross-training of our commercial field force teams in January, especially for breast cancer, between TUKYSA and IBRANCE, but also hematology between ADCETRIS and ELREXFIO. And we should start seeing that further playing out now over the coming months. As we've mentioned, we're obviously very pleased that there's been tremendous colleague retention, so we haven't had an issue with colleague retention, both from the legacy Pfizer and the legacy Seagen organization as we build a new business.  We expect PADCEV to continue to do well. There's significant enthusiasm from health care providers, from patients, from patient advocacy groups because of the groundbreaking data, double the overall survival. So we are confident that we'll continue to see PADCEV growth. We've also seen TUKYSA, for instance, 21% year-over-year pro forma basis growth. And in fact, the last quarter was the highest performance of TUKYSA. So overall, great confidence, and we started the first new Phase III study with an NME from the Seagen portfolio with a secret attack. and we hope to update you on other Phase III studies from the legacy Seagen portfolio. Albert Bourla : From my perspective, yes, of course, we have invested so much into this business, and we think that this is an area that we can make a huge difference to the world. I'm monitoring that very closely. I'm very impressed actually, I would say, nicely surprised on the positive side how well both on the Pfizer impact of day 1 plus 1 equals 3 rather than 2. But already, we'll start seeing it both in the research organization because we are putting now a lot of Phase III on starts. And you don't see but I have high visibility on what's going on in earlier stages where we put a lot of stuff in the clinic. And then also in the commercial, that you can see now stabilization for IBRANCE on the Pfizer side, and then high growth of the seeds and assets despite the fact that, as I said, you should expect a decline in the first 6 months. When you have an integration, always, we have a decline. I haven't seen a single integration that we have done, but it didn't face challenges because people are changing territories, people are changing let's say, jobs, marketers are moving around. All of that creates, let's say, a disruption here. We can be of -- we have very, very strong growth on both sides. So I'm really, really pleased. Not of course, will take time to see the full benefit. But certainly, under Chris' leadership, and he has formed a terrific team, we are off to a very good start. Now Dave, why don't you take or the next question? David Denton : So as it relates to your question regarding capital allocation, clearly, our first priority, our #1 priority is supporting both the dividend as well as delevering our balance sheet. So that is job 1 from my perspective. As it relates to bolt-on acquisitions, in the near term, you would not expect us to do much there. We are -- that is a lower priority in the near term until we get ourselves. I hope that helps. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Srikripa Devarakonda with Truist. Srikripa Devarakonda : Congrats on the progress. I have a question about your breast cancer franchise from the IBRANCE perspective. You have pivotal data from the estrogen receptor, PROTAC, the collaboration with partnership with Arvinas expected later this year. One is, what are your expectations for these data? And how important are these data for you to make decisions around either continuing or initiating combo Phase III trials, like whether it's CDK4/6 combo or CDK4 combo or both of them? Albert Bourla : Thank you very much. Chris? Chris Boshoff : Yes. Thank you very much for the question. Just a reminder to point out with IBRANCE that over 773,000 patients have now been treated globally with IBRANCE. So  it is currently still the CDK4/6 leader. We're very excited about 2 programs : vepdegestrant, which we believe to be best-in-class next-generation receptor degrader and also atimociclib, next-generation CDK4 specific inhibitor. For, as you point out, we'll get the data later this year for VERITAC-2, but we are planning additional studies at ROTH. You can expect to see first-line studies, both first-line study with atimociclib and standard of care endocrine therapy as well as a termocyclib-plus brand. [indiscernible] as you've seen in a heavily pretreated population, we've seen an overall response rate of 32% with medium progressive survival of 8.1 months. We're therefore highly encouraged.  I'm definitely very encouraged by the safety profile and we see more continuous dosing, very good compliance and more complete coverage of CDK4, and that's why we're confident to accelerate CDK4 into a registration strategy and the first study has already started, as you know, the second-line study. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Chris. Operator : We'll take our next question from Carter Gould with Barclays. Carter L. Gould: I wanted to ask a follow-up as I think it's important, and I fully respect the focus on '24 and Albert's commentary on conservatism around guidance. But to come back to the IRA impact for thinking about '25. When do you think you'll be in a better position to comment a little bit on you're contracting discussions are underway pretty late in the earnings season here, and most of your peers have already made comments and your Part D exposure isn't exactly a surprise. So any color there on time line would be helpful. And I guess for David, you talked about the operating margin improvement being sort of a multiyear process. Is there a risk that the IRA sort of presents a little bit of a hiccup to that in '25? Albert Bourla : Aamir, do you have any comments on that? Aamir Malik : Sure. So Carter, I think you heard us describe the dynamics. And later this year, we will have more clarity on what that means. And so we can certainly share that. I think there's also a specific question that comes up often about Eliquis, so let me just address that now because we are clearly in a live negotiation on that. BMS, our alliance partner, is leading that process. You've heard them describe, and we also described that there will be transparency around the outcome of that for impact in '26 in the September time frame. And so at that point, we'll be in a position to share more. David Denton : Yes. And I guess, as it relates to 2025 and the impact of the IRA from a margin expansion perspective, I would say, without giving any specifics on that is, as we look forward, we obviously run multiple scenarios around how our business might perform. And in those scenarios, we would model different impacts to the IRA because it's still unclear because it's still a lot of moving parts, specifically as we just spoke about. Under those scenarios, we will work hard to offset any implication we might have through improving our cost structure. Albert Bourla : And I want on the IRA, and also, we said something, but clearly, in 2025, we will have 2 events that are happening, which are -- we will have to contribute to -- as a pharmaceutical industry, so that will put pressure on the pricing, let's say. But also, because of the significant pains in the out-of-pocket dynamics, and which I hope that will be implemented, as the law says, immediately because I'm hearing efforts to try to play with that. But if that is the case, which we are certain because that's the law, we will see significant drug uptake, right, for everyone, not for us, of course, for everyone because there is a huge number of abandonment that is happening at the pharmacy level when people are asked to pay this very high out-of-pocket, particularly the first 1 quarter and maybe 2 when they need to exhaust their, let's say, their co-pays or the deductible. So that, I think, dynamic, you know that the industry always asks that we contribute to the out-of-pocket payments as long as the patients are paying less because there is a significant benefit for all : for health care system, for the patients, for us. And so I'm not that concerned about that for the industry as a whole. I'm very concerned for the industry as a whole with the mandatory cost reduction. There is no negotiation there. They are just cutting prices, but are occurring for biologics and for more volumes, particularly. One good thing for us, it is, first of all, that we have good exposure on vaccines, that they are a part of that, actually, they are benefiting from the IRA because there is no cost sharing. So we can see that in the volumes again. But on the small molecules where we do have exposure, I would say that we were like only 1 product that was selected for '26, we would have 3 or 4, and only 1 was selected. So Eliquis, as Aamir said, we will wait to see. We know, of course, but we can't discuss in the middle of negotiations about anything that's happening. And so we'll see the impact of whatever about this in 2026.  Then if next year, they bring some of the other products that they've been included and they were not in this year, that will be the IBRANCE of the world, that will be the XTANDIs, those are products that anyway, they are approaching their LOE. So even if they come into the IRA, the MPV risk that we have in place is not that big because really, we cut the price for something, but it will not be for a very lengthy period of time, but will be for smaller than others period of time. This doesn't mean that this is not very bad for the industry and for innovation, and we clearly opposing and he will try whatever we can to defend it. Operator : We'll take our next question from Rajesh Kumar with HSBC. Rajesh Kumar : First question is you very helpfully provided some color on the gross margin. What are the takes and puts there? If we look at your early 70s guidance and the gross margin you've achieved in Q1, do we see below 70s gross margin some point in some quarter this year? Or you sort of will get to early 70s with throughout the year, maintaining over 70% margin? And then the bit which is quite difficult to work out from the disclosures is, how did the PAXLOVID number impact the gross margin? So any help there so that we can model that right would be much appreciated. David Denton : Okay. Great. So yes, I think we just gave some color around gross margin being closer to 70% versus closer to 80% when we entered 2024. We are maintaining that color at this point in time. I would say that it's unlikely for our gross margin rate to fall below 70% in any given quarter. But I want to just emphasize the gross margin rate will fluctuate a bit, primarily given the mix of sales, specifically within the vaccine portfolio, which carries a lower gross margin, number one. Number two, when you look at our performance for gross margin in Q1, a dominant effect of that versus last year is the mix, the lower sales volume of COMIRNATY in the quarter in Q1 versus last year's Q1. Obviously, the final adjustment of the PAXLOVID reserve actually did also have a onetime positive impact on the gross margin rate in Q1, but that was less of an impact compared to the mix. So I hope that helps. Albert Bourla : And as I want to emphasize that on PAXLOVID, what really makes me pleased it is the underlying demand of the product, right? So it was approximately in the first quarter and in the U.S., 2 million scripts, right? So that's significant. And keep in mind that this was the quarter that we moved from a previous way of go-to-market approach to a commercial model, right? But I had a lot of mines in execution, but we didn't step into any of them. So it was Again, I'm very pleased how Aamir and the U.S. team executed on that. executive. So we have a very small transition with very low [indiscernible] commercial plans. For the vast majority of the insured lives and then at the same time, very good execution with thousands of participating, almost 90,000 pharmacies, if I remember Well, of 90% of the is participating into the Medicare part. And that went extremely well. And also I want to remind that the Medicare that goes clearly with different price level because it is through the credit of the U.S. government compared to the commercial plans, that they are at [ 1,000 ], it's a different list price. And that difference exists for this year. Next year, everybody moves to the list price, and of course, the discounts that we give any. Let you over to Case, please. Operator : We'll take our next question from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. Chris Shibutani : Two questions, if I may. The first on pneumococcal vaccines with Prevnar as well. Last quarter, you provided some commentary about your thoughts on the tone of the markets, particularly for adult being somewhat more mature. And obviously, competition is coming across the different categories, adult and pediatrics. Can you comment about your view, given that performance was relatively strong and how you're preparing for competition? The second question I have is on commercial models. There has been some nascent efforts in the industry to go more direct to consumers, for instance, Lilly has direct for their obesity products. Aamir, I'm curious about your thoughts about integrating this type of approach, particularly as I think about certain product categories that you have like migraines and NURTEC, how might this work? Where is Pfizer in terms of exploring these opportunities? Albert Bourla : Aamir? Aamir Malik : Okay. Chris, thanks for the question. So on Prevnar, you alluded to the commentary we provided around dimensionalizing the market, and I think it's worthwhile just reiterating that. So the adult market continues to contract and that's for 2 reasons. There are increasingly fewer eligible 65-plus adults. And then the 19 to 64 underlying medical conditions, population is obviously more difficult to activate. So that is a dynamic that is true for our business, but it's also true for any competitor that's going to come into the adult vaccine market. So I think that's important to note. Now for our overall franchise, we continue to expect growth. We did very nicely in Q1. We saw 6% growth. And the big driver of that is increased uptake as well as market share growth in the pediatric. So pediatrics in Q1 saw a lot of conversion, PCV 13 to 20. And our share exiting Q1 was at 80%, and that was from 71% at the time of launch of PCV 15. So we see good momentum on pediatrics. Now back to your question about the adult segment and competition. We're continuing to see very good performance where we are. We have 98% market share. We acknowledge that V116 is coming. And as Albert alluded to earlier, we're not going to speculate on what the regulatory outcomes or recommendations are going to be. But there are a number of things that we can do to defend our business in the adult segment. Firstly, we have a portfolio approach to contracting that we're deploying in the retail setting but also in the nonretail setting. And it's also important to note that in the nonretail setting, many organized customers have a preference for workflow management to stock 1 vaccine that satisfies all the current [indiscernible]. So until we know more, I think the best way to defend our share in the adult segment is to continue to do what we're doing. And that's to be laser-focused on maximizing the opportunity that we have in the adult segment, albeit contracting and then continue to drive growth in pediatrics. On your second question around consumers, look, engaging and activating consumers is, as you pointed out, a very, very important part of our business. It's true in vaccines. It's true in categories like PAXLOVID and NURTEC, just to name a few examples. And we're always looking at ways to enhance that connection. One example I'll point to is the work that we've done on VAXassist as a mechanism to help consumers determine their vaccine eligibility but also book appointments. And that's a really good example of value that we can bring. And to the extent that we can do more of that, create value for patients as well as for our business in other categories, we'll certainly look to explore that. Albert Bourla : Alexandre, very quickly, anything on PCV in international markets? Alexandre de Germay : Yes. No, we had a great quarter. As you know, we grew by 8% operationally. But more importantly, we also have achieved some key milestones. So we got the European approval of pediatric Prevnar 20 in Europe. We also got it approved in Japan, which are very important market in Australia and many others. So this is great because then we want to build on the very successful [ pre nup ] franchise around the world. As you know, we have exclusive NIP standards in [ 130 ] market, and now we're going to be able to build on that.  Just 1 comment on the adults. We still are in the process of getting VTC recommendation in most of the European markets. But where we got it in Germany and in France, we see a very nice pickup. And why? Because they extended the population covered by the Prevnar 20 outlook. For instance, in Germany, gave us 18 to 59 population at risk and all-comers, 60 and above. And since that and we got this remediation in February, we get very nice pickup in utilization in Germany, and we are about to launch in France as we speak. So in adults, as well, we see a great potential of growth. Albert Bourla : It's a very nice cadence of approval and recommendation. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Mohit Bansal : Maybe a question for Dave. Just wanted to understand the cadence of margin improvement as you are embarking on the cost management journey throughout the year because I mean, you had a really high EPS because of the onetime item, but if you think about margin profile over the year, how should we think about it? I understand fourth quarter could be impacted with COMIRNATY revenues. And then when we get into 2025, should we think about better leverage or do you think there could be more opportunity to  [indiscernible] expenses in '25 as well? David Denton : Yes, thank you for the question. I would say that without giving -- since we don't guide to quarterly expectations for gross margin, I would just say that the focus that we have around improving our cost of goods sold is a multiyear journey. And these costs that we are working to improve take time to adjust and to further implement ways to be more effective and efficient in this infrastructure. So I wouldn't think of that having a significant impact on 2024 but more -- if it would, it would be late 2024 but more '25 and '26. But more to come. As we know more and as we develop our plans more specifically, we'll be certain to share some specifics around that. P Albert Bourla : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Christopher Schott : Just 2 ones for me here. Just on Abrysvo, just really quickly following up on the earlier commentary. Can you just update us on where we are in terms of contracting efforts and progress in the retail channel, just addressing some of the market share issues you highlighted last year? I guess my specific question is, do you have line of sight on contracting at this point? Or is that still something that's going to evolve as the year progresses? And then the second quick 1 was just on VYNDAQEL. Obviously very strong numbers. Maybe just a quick update in terms of where we are with penetration in that market. And where do we -- how much higher can this go? Just how much more of a growth runway is there for that drug? Albert Bourla : Aamir? Aamir Malik : Thanks, Chris. So on Abrysvo, as I said, we're progressing our contracting conversations so we'll have more to share on that as we do later. And in terms of your question on VYNDA, VYNDA had a really strong quarter. We were up 96% year-over-year, but importantly, also 41% over last quarter. When you look at the drivers, I think there's a few things. Some of that is temporal. So there were some purchasing patterns with wholesaler and specialty pharmacies.  And we also made a lot of efforts towards the end of last year to ensure that the re-enrollment process for patients was very smooth at the beginning of this year. So all of that leads to a little bit of a Q1 bolus. But importantly at the heart of it, part of our strong performance on VYNDA is that the fundamentals around diagnosis and demand are really strong. So we saw a 33% quarter-over-quarter increase in new patient starts.  And diagnosis rates over the last several years, we had talked about getting into the 30% to 50% range. We're approaching the top end of that. And there is still significant opportunity to identify more patients. That's the biggest unmet need, and that's where we're concentrating our commercial efforts going forward. So we do think that we will sustain this momentum, probably not at the same rate that we saw in Q1 but we will continue to perform well with VYNDA. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Alexandre, anything to add? Alexandre de Germay : Yes, very quickly. On the international front, we also had a very strong quarter because we saw a 28% operational growth but a 43% volume growth, which is comparable to what we see in the U.S. Exactly as Aamir said, there is still opportunity because we basically have established VYNDAQEL as the standard of care. And we've worked with the health care professional to establish robust infrastructure so that we can screen, diagnose, and treat faster.  And the reality is we still have opportunity to grow because, yes, in markets like France, we are talking 50%, but in other like Italy, we are around 30%, Japan, 28%. So there is still opportunity to grow and increase rates. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much. Next question. We'll take 2 more questions because we are running out of time. Operator : We'll take our next question from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Timothy Anderson : So it's a busy pipeline readout year. I'm wondering, Mikael, can you just point to perhaps the 1 or 2 bigger upcoming readouts that excite you the most, where your confidence is high as that could be value creating? So I'm not looking for a description of everything reading out. Just maybe 1 or 2 that excites you the most. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Mikael, excite us all. Mikael Dolsten : Yes, yes. I'm excited about the potential approval for mastozimab for both hemophilia A and B to continue to grow our hematology franchise momentum. [indiscernible] in therapy, we actually today got the equivalent of Breakthrough Designation RMAT based on the early clinical data available, so we are super excited about that. And relatively near term, the readout is coming. COVID/flu combination vaccine, [ 859 ] readout Phase III. And then [indiscernible] pipeline onsegrimab  which I think pending readout has really a breakthrough mechanism. Albert Bourla : Anything from your side, Chris? Chris Boshoff : Perhaps just to mention again the potential unprecedented new 5-year data for Lorbrenla, which will be presented at ASCO. We could define the growth of Lorbrenla over the next decade. There's 2 other upcoming readouts. Albert Bourla : That's good if we are talking to that [indiscernible] Chris Boshoff : And there's 2 other readouts that's important to us, the 1 is Breakwater, which is the first-line opportunity in BRAF-positive colorectal cancer. A reminder that, that's up to 12% of colorectal cancer. Particularly poor prognosis so we're looking forward to that readout, Breakwater and then also, as mentioned earlier, VERATEC 2 in second-line ER-positive breast cancer, which can define also the to define the future path for. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much. Operator : Our last question will come from Steve Scala with TD Cowen. Steve Scala : I have 2 questions. In the Pfizer mRNA flu vaccine efficacy trial, was superior efficacy versus approved flu vaccine shown in the 65-plus cohort? This data was to have been presented last year but I don't believe we've ever gotten an update. And then secondly, your interest in obesity more broadly. So the outlook for danuglipron is not good. Bolt-ons don't look likely, but -- and this is just 1 very simple data point. There are post things on pfizer.com for obesity clinical lead position suggesting something is moving forward. So what exactly is moving forward in obesity at Pfizer? Albert Bourla : Yes. On the obesity and Mikael also can comment, of course, together with the mRNA flu vaccine. But I said multiple times that first of all, metabolic is an area that traditionally very big strength in terms of And this is an area that we have the right to win. So we are strong and to keep investing in the whole area because we have the infrastructure. And obesity is a very big part of it, even the of the market. So we will be very active in the obesity with current mechanism of actions and new mechanisms of actions.  We said repeatedly that we had 3 agents right now in the clinic, and we have multiple on the [indiscernible] but we are progressing. But we don't have anything to say per se right now because on waiting, some data and on the other ones, it's too early to speak about them. So that's why we are not commenting much of that. And we will, let's say, continue being very active in the obesity space and one we're in now. Now what about the mRNA vaccine and anything you want to add also to the obesity line? Mikael Dolsten : I think you said it so well on obesity. I'll focus on mRNA vaccine and just say that we did share that we had a very robust data for 18 to 59 in the outcome event trial on the first generation flu mRNA platform. We actually further refined that product in order to expand activity against these serotypes although the disease is dominated by A, we saw an opportunity to do that. And that technology is now with the COVID/flu combo vaccine running for 18 to 59 years old and relatively soon, we'll have a readout. We think that's really the near-term opportunity to bring both of the viruses under 1 simple administration approach. For the 65-plus, what you referred to was an early trial with the first generation. We have now moved focus to the second generation and are in preparation of subsequent clinical studies from them. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael. So thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for your interest. That was a very good call. In summary, we are very pleased with the solid start in 2024. We are cautiously optimistic about the year ahead. And with our continued progress in executing our 5 priorities, we are confident that we will continue to deliver for our patients, shareholders, and our company. Thank you again for your interest in Pfizer. We hope to have -- utilization in Fermany you have a wonderful day. Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time, and have a wonderful day.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer and Senior Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am. Francesca DeMartino : Good morning and welcome to Pfizer's earnings call. I'm Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer. On behalf of the Pfizer team, thank you for joining us. This call is being made available via audio webcast at pfizer.com. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the second quarter of 2024 via a press release that is available on our website at pfizer.com. I'm joined today by Dr. Albert Bourla, our Chairman and CEO; and Dave Denton, our CFO. Albert and Dave have some prepared remarks and we will then open the call for questions. Joining for the Q&A session, we also have Dr. Chris Boshoff, EVP and Chief Oncology Officer; Alexandre de Germay, EVP and Chief International Commercial Officer; Dr. Mikael Dolsten, Chief Scientific Officer and President of R&D Doug Lankler, EVP and General Counsel; and Aamir Malik, EVP and Chief U.S. Commercial Officer. Before we get started, I want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements and discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. I encourage you to read the disclaimers in our slide presentation, the press release we issued this morning, and the disclosures in our SEC filings, which are all available on the IR website on pfizer.com. Forward-looking statements on the call are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, speak only as of the call's original date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of the statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Albert. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Francesca. Good morning everyone. We are pleased to report that we\u2019ve had a strong first half of the year and our business is performing well. We drove progress in the second quarter with solid execution as we continue making a difference in the lives of patients around the world. Through the first six months of 2024, we reached more than 192 million patients with our medicines and vaccines. Today, I\u2019ll provide updates about how we continued advancing our key strategic priorities in the second quarter. I will also mention examples from just the past few weeks when we have achieved a series of regulatory approvals, pipeline advances and other positive developments that we expect to fuel our progress through the rest of the year. We are pleased with the strong financial results coming from our disciplined execution. In the second quarter, for example, we achieved year-over-year revenue growth for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2022 when our COVID revenues had reached peaked. Dave will talk about this and additional aspects of our financial performance, as well of course our outlook. And then, we will take questions. Before we go further, I will touch on some recent announcements about our leadership team and Board of Directors. I'll start with Mikael Dolsten\u2019s coming departure. It\u2019s hard to find words that do justice to the substantial impact Mikael has had during his 15-year tenure at Pfizer. Mikael transformed our R&D engine, ultimately delivering 35 approvals that have been meaningful for millions of patients globally. I thank my colleague, and my friend, for these tremendous contributions to human health. I look forward to working closely with him over the coming months as we search for his successor. Until then, Mikael will continue to lead as our Chief Scientific Officer and President of Pfizer Research & Development. I want to welcome Andrew Baum, our new Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer. Andrew brings deep clinical, scientific and biopharmaceutical sector expertise, and we are fortunate to have him to help shape and guide our strategy. While Andrew is not able to join us today because he is relocating with his family to the United States, he will be with us for future quarterly calls. I also want to mention the recent addition of Cyrus Taraporevala to our Board. We are committed to strong governance supported by directors with a breadth of unique experiences and skills, exactly like Cyrus. Cyrus was President and CEO at State Street Global Advisors until he retired, two years ago, and he brings vast experience in investment management and financial markets. We are thrilled to have him joining our board. Now, l'll turn to our performance. The five strategic priorities we shared at the beginning of the year remain unchanged. With our focus on the most important opportunities for advancing and strengthening our company, we are confident we remain on track in 2024. In the second quarter, our colleagues moved our business forward in each key strategic area. As a reminder, they are : achieving world-class oncology leadership, delivering the next wave of pipeline innovation, maximizing performance of our new products, expanding margins by realigning our cost base, and allocating capital in ways that will enhance shareholder value. We believe we are well positioned to continue creating value for our shareholders. I want to reinforce our commitment to maintaining and growing our dividend over time. And, as Dave will discuss in more detail, we are raising our full-year 2024 guidance ranges for revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Now, I\u2019ll turn to our progress towards achieving the first one world-class oncology leadership. Last year, we acted on our bold vision of combining Seagen's transformative ADC medicines with Pfizer\u2019s expertise, innovation and scale. We believed we could help people with cancer live better and longer lives and capture a differentiated opportunity to drive long-term sustainable growth for our company. At the halfway mark in 2024, we are on track to make this vision a reality and we are pleased with the continued success of our integration. We've had high rates of colleague retention and acquired Seagen products are contributing meaningfully to our revenues. In particular, Padcev is rapidly progressing toward becoming the standard of care for patients with frontline locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer. We are pleased with the strength of other key products across our oncology portfolio. Xtandi, Lorbrena, Braftovi-Mektovi combination, for example, continued as significant growth drivers during this quarter. Our robust oncology commercial performance in the first half of 2024 included full FDA approval for Tivdak and European Medicines Agency approval for the Talzenna plus Xtandi combination. We also received positive CHMP opinions for the Braftovi-Mektovi combination and for Padcev. The last one is a notable development because Pfizer receives royalty revenues for these products marketed in Europe by our partners. These highlights illustrate how we are already delivering breakthroughs that dramatically improve the lives of people with cancer. Of course, we are also working to develop future breakthroughs where we have opportunities to bring the most important new therapies to patients in need. I will review several recent pipeline highlights, starting with obesity. Earlier this month, we announced our plans to move forward with development of danuglipron, our oral GLP-1 receptor agonist that is the most advanced candidate in our robust clinical and preclinical obesity pipeline. In previously reported results from the Phase 2b study in obesity, danuglipron demonstrated what we believe is good efficacy in its twice-daily formulation. For tolerability, we previously reported the maximum rate of GI adverse events across all doses investigated. Looking at individual dose levels in our Phase 2b study, however, we observed tolerability profiles that are competitive for the class. Our efforts are now focused on developing the once-daily formulation essential to delivering a competitive oral product. We were encouraged by a pharmacokinetic study evaluating multiple modified release technologies and formulations. This strengthened our confidence in potentially delivering a competitive once-daily pill at dose levels expected to be efficacious. We plan to conduct dose optimization studies in the second half of the year that are intended to inform our registration enabling studies. Obesity represents a growing area of patient need and it\u2019s a key area of focus for Pfizer's R&D programs. We believe these study results, along with learnings from our previous Phase 2 studies and data that we have accumulated from 1,400 participating patients, leave us well positioned to execute on a registration-enabling study as we work to deliver a competitive product in a rapidly growing market. When we hosted our Oncology Innovation Day in February, we shared the pipeline milestones that would mark our success over the next year and we are already demonstrating progress. A highlight was our strong presence at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting last month, which was anchored by three positive Phase 3 readouts. Follow-up data from the Phase 3 CROWN study of Lorbrena in patients with ALK-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer showed 60% of patients on Lorbrena who are living beyond five years without disease progression. This strengthens Lorbrena\u2019s position as an emerging standard of care in the frontline setting. Data from the Phase 3 ECHELON-3 study of Adcetris in combination with lenalidomide and rituximab demonstrated a clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival for patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. And, data from Phase 3 study evaluating an additional Adcetris combination regimen showed progression-free data in patients with newly diagnosed classical Hodgkin lymphoma, while significantly reducing side effects compared to a standard of care regimen used in Europe in this setting. We have advanced our oncology clinical pipeline in 2024 with Phase 3 studies for sigvotatug vedotin, our integrin beta 6-directed ADC; atirmociclib, our selective CDK4 inhibitor; Elrexfio in the second-line setting in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma; and mevrometostat, our EZH2 inhibitor, which we are now moving to Phase 3 and anticipate enrollment beginning in August. We will continue working toward our 2030 oncology strategy goals of delivering eight or more blockbuster medicines and doubling the number of patients treated with our innovative cancer medicines. We also have momentum with our vaccine programs. In our next-gen PCV candidate, for example, we have advanced to a Phase 2 program in both adults and pediatrics, based on encouraging clinical data that we received that highlight our industry-leading capabilities in expanding valency beyond 20 serotypes. We expect to be highly competitive by offering the largest serotype coverage in a single vaccine while strategically addressing the persistent medical need across invasive disease, antibiotic resistance and challenging serotypes. In RSV with Abrysvo, I am pleased to report that yesterday we received an approval for Abrysvo's Act-O-Vial presentation in the United States, a presentation which offers advantages such as a never-frozen, unique system enabling one-step reconstitution highly valued by pharmacists. Additionally, we have submitted for label expansion in both the United States and Europe for adults 18 to 59. In our malignant hematology programs, we are also driving progress. Last week, we reported positive results from a Phase 3 study demonstrating the safety and efficacy of our one-time gene therapy candidate for people with hemophilia A. As we continue to advance our pipeline, additional milestones include expected updates later this year about our COVID/flu combination vaccine, marstacimab, for hemophilia A and B, and ponsegromab, for Cachexia, a wasting disorder associated with chronic disease. Now I\u2019ll turn to our strength with commercial execution of our business. Another strategic area of focus is protecting and growing our core product portfolios while we also maximize the performance of our new products. We continue to see encouraging progress with our team's execution. Nurtec is an example where we are rising to meet substantial demand. This product delivered strong results in the quarter with 44% year-over-year global operational revenue growth. We see additional opportunities for expanding share in both acute and prevention usage, as well as growth opportunities in international markets where we are making progress with our launches. I hope Alexandre will be able to touch based on this during the Q&A Session. Now, I will touch on a few additional product portfolio highlights. In the pediatric segment, Prevnar 20 continues to demonstrate strong performance that reinforces a leadership position among pneumococcal vaccines in the United States where market share grew to greater than 80%. During the quarter, the performance of Abrysvo was in line with seasonal vaccine trends. We remain confident in our full-year performance as we believe we are well positioned to help address the expected rising need later in the year among older adults at increased risk for RSV. Litfulo is a product we launched last year and we're encouraged by strong demand. Approximately one out of every two new patients on advanced systemic therapies is receiving a Litfulo prescription, a position we expect to grow as we continue focusing on execution. We view Velsipity as a promising and much-needed option for adults with moderate to severe active ulcerative colitis. We're encouraged by recently securing preferred coverage for Velsipity at our first large national payer. We expect to see the impact of this in 2025 and now we're working to build on this with additional payers. When we consider core products in our portfolio, we are also seeing positive impact from strong execution. The Vyndaqel family of products offers a good example of how we are making a difference for patients and our business. We are accelerating growth by working with physicians to drive improvement in identifying appropriate patients with ATTR-cardiomyopathy and helping patients to access and stay on the therapy once it is prescribed. With strong growth through the second quarter, we believe there is additional opportunity to identify more patients who could benefit from our Vyndaqel products because of high unmet need. It is estimated that nearly half of those with this progressive and deadly disease have yet to be diagnosed. Eliquis was another significant contributor to our results as we continued to claim greater share in a growing oral anticoagulant market. Now, let me briefly wrap up. First, I\u2019d like to thank my more than 80,000 colleagues for the dedication they are showing each day to our purpose of delivering breakthroughs that change patients\u2019 lives. We are confident in our business. With our focus and execution, along with our deep expertise in driving innovation and advancing our pipeline, we believe we are on track to deliver on our full-year financial commitments in 2024. I walked through our progress with three of our strategic priorities and now Dave will cover our work to expand margins by realigning our cost base and allocate capital to enhance shareholder value as he discusses our financial performance and outlook. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dave. Dave Denton : Thank you, Albert, and good morning, everyone. As we close out the first half of the year, I\u2019m very pleased by our second quarter results. We continue our relentless focus on execution, demonstrating our ability to both protect and grow our core brands while also continuing to advance our science-led transformation by investing in key TAs to build durable franchises. Our initiatives to right size OpEx and reduce cost of goods will result in a more efficient organization, setting the stage for strong capital returns and long-term improved shareholder value enabling our commitment to both maintain and to grow our dividend. This morning, I will briefly review our second quarter results including some one-time items, touch on our capital allocation priorities, and wrap up with an update on our 2024 financial guidance, our key priorities, and expectations for the remainder of this year. Turning first to Q2 performance versus the same period last year; let\u2019s walk down the P&L. Total company revenues for the quarter were $13.3 billion, reflecting operational growth of 3%. Our revenue and cash flow continue to be impacted by the post-pandemic COVID environment on a global basis but to a much lesser extent than prior quarters. Looking at the business excluding our COVID products, we demonstrated strong commercial execution across the enterprise, resulting in 14% operational revenue growth in the quarter. Performance was positively impacted by our continued focus on key products and geographies; refined allocation of commercial field resources globally; and further optimization of our marketing resources into key priority areas. Contributing to this performance was our acquired products from Seagen as well as Nurtec, alongside in-line products Vyndaqel, Eliquis and Xtandi. As expected, dampening our growth in the quarter were Xeljanz and Ibrance. Adjusted Gross Margin for the second quarter was 79%, compared to 76% last year, and was primarily the result of favorable sales mix from our non-COVID products, as well as continued strong cost management across our manufacturing network. Improvements in our gross margin rate will continue to be a focus for the company over the next few years as we execute on our recently announced Manufacturing Optimization Program. This new program and together with our cost realignment program is focused on returning the company to pre-pandemic operating margins on a mix adjusted basis excluding Comirnaty. Phase 1 of the Manufacturing Optimization Program, which focuses on operational efficiencies, is well underway now. This first phase is expected to deliver approximately $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2027, some of which is anticipated to be realized beginning in 2025. Total Adjusted operating expenses increased by 5% operationally to $6.3 billion and include spending from our legacy Seagen business. Looking at the components, adjusted SI&A expenses increased 8% driven primarily by marketing and promotional expenses for recently launched as well as acquired products. Adjusted R&D expenses increased 2% operationally driven primarily by increased spending related to the acquisition of Seagen, partially offset by lower spending primarily the result of our cost realignment program. Q2 reported diluted earnings per share was $0.01 and our adjusted diluted EPS was $0.60. Unique one-time items included in our GAAP results and excluded from our adjusted results, this quarter include a $1.3 billion charge related to our Manufacturing Optimization Program primarily for severance, and a $230 million charge for IPR&D asset impairment and other related costs associated with the discontinuation of our DMD program. Additionally, we expect to record a charge of approximately $400 million in the third quarter of 2024 after a decision was made in July to sell one of our facilities as a result of the discontinuation of the DMD effort. Now let me quickly touch upon our capital allocation strategy, which is designed to enhance long-term shareholder value. Our strategy consists of maintaining and growing our dividend over time, reinvesting in our business at an appropriate level of financial return; and finally making value enhancing share repurchases after de-levering our balance sheet. In the first half of 2024, we returned $4.8 billion to shareholders via our quarterly dividend; invested $5.2 billion in internal R&D and as expected, the completed business development activity was minimal. Our commitment to de-levering our capital structure to a gross leverage target of 3.25 times remains a key priority. In support of that goal, year-to-date, we have paid down approximately $2.25 billion in maturing debt, including $1 billion in May of outstanding notes. And though we did not monetize any Haleon shares in Q2, we expect to resume monetization of our 23% Haleon stake in the future. I would also note that once our Haleon ownership is less than 20%, our accounting will transition from recording equity income and will no longer be included in our adjusted results. This change is factored into our long-term financial planning and as well as our guidance. As we\u2019ve previously stated previously, we expect operating cash flow to be significantly below typical levels this year and particularly during the first half of 2024, due to the timing of certain payments and one-time expenses. We expect heavily weighting of revenues to the fourth quarter as our business has become more seasonal in nature with the potential that a high level of cash collections may carry over into Q1 of 2025. Despite this near-term pressure, clearly, our objective remains to return to a more balanced capital allocation strategy over time. Now, let me spend just a few minutes on our outlook for the remainder of the year. We entered 2024 focused on delivering on our financial commitments as well as commercial performance. With a successful first half now complete, we believe it is appropriate to update our full year earnings outlook to reflect our strong business performance. I\u2019ll remind you that our revised guidance assumes the seasonal cadence of our product portfolio, and that we expect Paxlovid results to trend with infection rates. With that said, we are raising our full year revenue range by $1 billion and our adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.30. We now expect revenues in the range of $59.5 billion to $62.5 billion and operational revenue growth excluding COVID products is projected to be 9% to 11%. COVID product revenues are now expected to be $8.5 billion for the year; $5 billion for Comirnaty and $3.5 billion for Paxlovid. Our guidance for adjusted SI&A and adjusted R&D remains unchanged while our effective tax rate on adjusted income is now expected to be approximately 13%; and, lastly, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.45 to $2.65 primarily reflecting the increase to the top line and the revised tax rate among other items. As a reminder, our EPS guidance includes an anticipated $0.40 of earnings dilution from the Seagen acquisition, largely due to financing cost. In closing, we remain on track to deliver at least $4 billion of net savings from our cost-realignment program by the end of this year. This improvement in our cost base alongside our new initiatives focused on manufacturing is expected to put us on strong footing towards margin expansion and improved financial returns. Additionally, our continued focus on execution and our recent investments have positioned the company for continued success moving forward. This quarter\u2019s results are a testament to the performance of our commercial business and our prudent approach to improving our cost base. Though we\u2019ve had a strong first half, we do not take lightly the continued focus needed to deliver in the second half considering the seasonality of our respiratory products. We are clearly striving to bring about improved performance on both the top and bottom lines through focus, execution and delivering on our near-term commercial and financial goals. 2024 is clearly a foundation year for Pfizer. Our achievements to date sets the stage for generating compelling shareholder value. Through our science-led transformation, we will methodically build off this base and with breakthroughs and innovation driving growth in the back half of the decade. And with that, I\u2019d now like to turn it back over to Albert to start our Q&A. Albert Bourla : Yes. Thank you, Dave. Let\u2019s start the Q&A session. Operator, please assemble the queue. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Louise Chen with Cantor. Please go ahead. Louise Chen : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. So I wanted to ask you on danuglipron, when do you expect to see the actual efficacy data and if this product moves forward as anticipated, how hard would it be for you to manufacture? Albert Bourla : Mikael, you want to address it very quickly. Mikael Dolsten : Yes. We are, as Albert said in the oral remarks, doing the dose optimization for PK and formulation to select potential doses for pending data progression to Phase 3 and we expect to share that first quarter. Albert Bourla : Yes. Thank you very much. Let\u2019s move to the next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Mohit Bansal : Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. And just thinking about the cost guidance, cost measures here, just wanted to understand, how should we think about the margin expansion for the rest of the year. And then how should we think about it going forward in 2025 and 2026, especially as you head into the IRA territory? Albert Bourla : Perfect question for Dave. Dave Denton : Yes. So Mohit, just a couple of things. As you recall in my prepared remarks, we are focused on actually launched our manufacturing optimization program, the result of which will begin to yield results in 2025 and to generate over $1.5 billion in savings by 2027. As we think about margin expansion, just given the guidance that I provided for the balance of this year, it would imply that margin \u2013 gross margin rates would actually improve versus the low-70s color that we\u2019ve given previously to probably mid-70s at this point in time. We do expect that all these investments, both our cost realignment program and our investments from a manufacturing optimization program are all designed to improve operating margins to get us back to pre-pandemic levels in the near future. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Dave. Operator, the next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Terence Flynn : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Was just wondering, had two on the new product cycle side, how are you guys thinking about this upcoming RSV season? As we think about patients coming back in for a booster, as well as maybe an existing new group of patients coming in. And then on Elrexfio and myeloma, can you give us any color on the launch, either sales or market share there? And if you're still confident in that $4 billion opportunity, thank you. Albert Bourla : Yes. Thank you, Terence, and very good questions. RSV, why don't Aamir and then Alexandre speak about the Royalty? And then Chris, you covered alerts. Aamir Malik : Hey, Terence, it's Aamir. For Abrysvo, I think we are very well positioned going into the fall season in the U.S. for three main reasons. One is contracting. So we've significantly strengthened our contracting position. Many of those decisions were confirmed shortly after the June ACIP and are set to take effect in August, commensurate with the beginning of the season. The second is the ACIP guidance itself, with a recommendation for a single dose for all adults over 75 and those 60 to 74 that are at increased risk. We think that is just clear and strengthens the directive for those who are eligible for a vaccine. And then thirdly, is just Abrysvo itself. We've got great data, including two seasons of durable efficacy data. As Albert alluded to earlier, we have both our current needle free reconstitution kit that is never required to be frozen or thawed, as well as our new active biosystem, which offers many advantages and including 80% storage efficiency, so there's good options for customers. And I will also remind you that there's many healthcare providers and pharmacies that prefer simplifying their vaccine management by having one vaccine for both older adults and maternal, which only a Abrysvo can offer. So the combination of contracting, the ACIP guidance and the value proposition of Abrysvo positions as well in the U.S. Albert Bourla : And Alexandre, what about international markets. Alexandre de Germay : Yes, Terence, good question on Abrysvo. We are making great progress as well on the international fronts following the approval, remember, in the second half of 2023 in Europe and in the UK. We already are progressing nicely with vaccine technical committee recommending positively Abrysvo. So we got positive recommendation in the UK, in France, in Canada, in Australia and several other markets and in Saudi Arabia as well. So we are moving very nicely. Delighted that actually UK authority have selected Abrysvo for RSV prevention in older adults as well as in maternal immunization for pediatric for the next two years with an option of additional two years. And we also were selected in Canada specifically also for adult vaccination. Albert Bourla : Good news for file and let's go to Chris now. Chris Boshoff : Thank you for the question on Elrexfio. As you saw, we recently demonstrated the updated median overall survival data for Elrexfio in the intent to treat 123 patient population in the late-line disease, where we see an overall survival of 24.3 months, which we believe is differentiated. Elrexfio also have a differentiated profile in terms of the safety profile as well as other factors including subcutaneous administration, flat non-weight-based dosing and a flexible dosing regimen overall. We've now launched in 16 countries and in fact in Japan, we were the first to launch and it's early days. We've also recently got approval in the EU and UK. In the U.S., total demand is plus 40% growth sequentially quarter-over-quarter and early next year or during 2025, you'll see the readouts for the bigger opportunities, which is MagnetisMM-5 in the double-class exposed population and then later in the year, potentially MagnetisMM-32, which is post-CD38. So overall, we remain confident that we've got a very differentiated molecule that could become a backbone across the continuum of care for multiple myeloma. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Chris. Operator, next question please. Operator : The next question comes from Alex Hammond with Bank of America. Alex Hammond : Thanks for taking the question. On Nurtec, can you walk us through the commercial strategy to expand share and acute and preventive usage, as well as the international markets. You've mentioned focusing on physician awareness in a different way and reducing friction for patient access any more color you can provide there. Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Great questions. Aamir and then Alexandre. Aamir Malik : Alex, on Nurtec in the U.S., I think there are a number of things that we've done in the first half of the year to strengthen our demand. So we revamp all of our consumer activation efforts. We sharpened the clinical value proposition and how we communicated that, including, but not only limited to the fact that we have an indication for treatment and prevention. We also realigned our field forces to ensure that we're really maximizing activation of both primary care and neurologist providers. And then we made a lot of efforts through the co-pay support and other means to just reduce friction in patients actually getting access to Nurtec once a script is written. And so what you see this quarter for us is a combination of all of those things starting to take effect. So Nurtec TRx was up 28% over the prior year. Revenues were up close to 39% in the U.S. We maintain leadership from a TRx and NRx perspective at 49% and 48% share, respectively. And there were 9,000 new Nurtec writers. So that's about 85% of all new CGRP writers. So as we look forward, we continue to see strength in Nurtec demand. We'll continue to manage the gross to net dynamics of that business, but we are optimistic about where we take it from here. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Alexandre? Alexandre de Germay : Yes. On the international front, we also have expanded access and the numbers of countries that we have introduced the product. As you know, the growth that you see in the second quarter versus the first quarter of 2024 is really the effect of the introduction of Nurtec in China at the beginning of this quarter. As of today, we have Nurtec reimbursed in 15 countries, including some of our key markets like UK, Spain. And what we see is once we get reimbursement, we had a significant uplift of the demand. And so our focus now is to increase access and reimbursement in some of our key markets. Moving forward, we see significant growth behind Nurtec. And the reason behind that is there is to the international level, less than half of the diagnosed patients that are treated with prescription medicine. So that's why we think we have an opportunity with Nurtec. Albert Bourla : And I believe, Alexandre, that this year, we got almost 55 countries registered Nurtec in international markets, 55 markets on [indiscernible] 15 received already reimbursement, and we are waiting for the remaining 40 to receive reimbursement. Let's move to the next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Akash Tewari with Jefferies. Akash Tewari : Hey, thanks so much. On next-gen Prevnar, your team has been fairly quiet on its profile. Let's say that the next-gen product only hits 27 serotypes and not 31 like some of your peers. Why should we feel confident that Pfizer can retain a lion's share position in this market? And you mentioned the next-gen product actually having the largest serotype coverage. Does that imply greater than 31 serotypes of coverage? Albert Bourla : Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : Thank you. As you know, we have worked over several decades in optimizing how to expand the number of serotypes while maintaining strong immune responses for as many as possible. We have not disclosed yet how many serotypes we have. We have recently pursued expansion of that next-gen into Phase 2 of both pediatric and adult and look forward to adult data to come quite soon, which will allow us to move swiftly in that indication. We have made significant improvement on existing and new serotypes through new technologies. And that is a deep capability. So it's not just about having the highest number of serotypes. It's really to show the consistency and the data before you can draw any conclusion. So we remain very confident in our ability to defend our leadership position and continue to expand it through these new technology tool bots. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much, Mikael. Next question, please. Operator : We'll take our next question from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. Chris Shibutani : Thank you. I want to ask you about your views on the IRA, in particular, implications on revenue outlook for 2025 and 2026. Obviously, your employees, your partner Bristol on Eliquis made commentary that I think has been interpreted by the Street as being that this is a dynamic that could be manageable. We appreciate your specific reflections on the Pfizer portfolio. Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thanks, Chris. I will ask Aamir to speak a little bit about the Eliquis specifically. And then, Dave, can you cover the general impact of IRA? Aamir Malik : Chris, as you noted, BMS led the discussions with CMS on Eliquis maximum fair price because they are the NDA holder, and they shared their perspective on that process during their earnings call last week. Honestly, we don't have much to add to what they said. We share their view that we have the ability to navigate the impact of IRA on Eliquis. And Eliquis will be an important drug in our portfolio for the foreseeable future. Dave Denton : Yes. And then I would just add to that, as we look at IRA across our platform, first, I think we were very fortunate Pfizer that we had one product selected. And secondly, if you look at the remaining products that are likely to be \u2013 that could potentially be selected, they are nearing the end of their patent protection life. So if you think about it from a net present value perspective, the impact on Pfizer is somewhat muted as you think about it economically. I will say this is a piece of legislation that clearly is harmful for supporting research and development in the sector. So we're hopeful that this could be changed in the future, but we will continue to actively manage our way through this. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Dave. Operator, next question, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Dave Risinger with Leerink Partners. Dave Risinger : Yes, thanks very much. And I guess I just wanted to start off by saying congratulations and best of luck to you, Mikael. So my questions are, first, could you please comment on your expectations for Phase 1 obesity candidates beyond once-daily danuglipron, including disclosures to watch over the next several months? And then second, Dave, could you just contextualize the $1.5 billion in COGS reductions relative to the current annual run rate of about $15 billion? It seems like you're going to cut 10%. But how should we think about net reduction i.e., net COGS declines over the next three years? Thanks so much. Albert Bourla : Yes. Mikael, why don't you give a little bit on the obesity candidates other than danu? Mikael Dolsten : Yes Yes. As you heard from Albert, danu is the more advanced drug with a large tolerability, safety and efficacy experience. As always, in our projects, we have additional drugs in the same class. It's in Phase 1, performing as expected. We have another mechanism of action that would combine with Oral GLP [ph] such as danu later in development of life cycle. And we have other mechanisms to protect part in kidney that could also be part of an internal medicine, larger cardiometabolic franchise. Thank you. Albert Bourla : And what about the cost reduction? Dave Denton : So let me just anchor us on a few facts here. First, the cost reduction effort that we currently have initiated is Phase 1 of a multiple-phase program. So this $1.5 billion savings is only a part of \u2013 or a piece of the story. We will tell more of the story as we define the program more specifically so you get more clarity on that. Secondly, if you look at the $1.5 billion cost improvement effort, and you think about that on our cost of goods sold platform, where it's probably closer to $16 billion versus $15 billion, this is at anchor point. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Operator, next question please. Operator : We'll take our next question from Kripa Devarakonda with Truist Securities. Kripa Devarakonda : Hey guys, thank you so much for taking my question. I have a question on the RSV in maternal market. How has \u2013 have you gained traction in the maternal market? Are you seeing any sort of setbacks? Just wondering if Pfizer needs to educate, build out or do some groundwork before the market really breaks open. And then a follow-up question on PADCEV, there are other radioligands and ADCs that are targeting Nectin-4. Are there \u2013 how do you see the competitive landscape shaping up? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Aamir about maternal RSV. Aamir Malik : Sure, Kripa. So thanks for the question. I think let me start by just underscoring the interest that we see on maternal vaccination. So when you talk to OB/GYNs, there's a clear preference that they have to vaccinate during pregnancy. And similarly, you hear the same from pregnant mothers. Greater than 60% prefer vaccination versus vaccinating the baby, maternal vaccination. So our launch on maternal did exceed our expectations. So we saw uptake rates through the end of January with about 11% of eligible mothers taking the vaccine. And that is significantly higher than other maternal immunization at the same point in the life cycle. I think key Tdap was less than 2% at the same time. So the other thing I will note is it does require education, as you know. And last year's maternal ACIP recommendation occurred just after the RSV maternal vaccination season began. So this season, we have the benefit of using the first half of the year to invest in that education of both HCPs as well as pregnant women, and we look forward to the season ahead. Albert Bourla : And international anything to add? Alexandre de Germay : Yes, very, very few points. Just to say that following the approval, we also have great progress on the vaccine technical committee on vaccination in maternal in the UK we receive positive recommendation as well as in France, in Australia, Belgium, Austria, Argentina, so many other, including an interesting one, which is the power for Latin America. And now we are progressing into access \u2013 final access into those markets. Albert Bourla : And about the competitiveness of Padcev, Chris? Chris Boshoff : Thank you for the question. We\u2019re very pleased that in this quarter, as you\u2019ve seen, we printed just shy of $400 million for Padcev with sequential quarter-over-quarter growth of 15%. Based on the claims data through the end of May, we are seeing U.S. first-line share increasing into the low 50% range. And as you know, the next opportunity is obviously in muscle invasive bladder cancer with two ongoing studies being conducted by Merck, which can expand the population to an additional 28,000 addressable patients. So overall, we are seeing that Padcev with pembrolizumab is becoming entrenched in the first-line setting as the standard of care and future studies, including future nectin-targeted medicines, radioligands or ADCs will likely have to do studies against Padcev plus pembrolizumab in the first-line setting, which could be challenging. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Chris. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Trung Huynh with UBS. Trung Huynh : Hi guys. Thanks for the questions. Firstly, on Prevnar, there wasn\u2019t so much commentary in your prepared remarks here. Just interested for the quarter, was that impacted by any one-offs? And has there been any stocking dynamics or destocking at play here, given the approval of [indiscernible] and that anticipated launch? And then secondly, just at ASCO, we saw some early KAT6 data in breast. The presenter was very, very excited. Can you perhaps talk about the opportunity here? How quickly can we get this through clinical studies? And when can we see the next set of longer-term data? Thanks very much. Albert Bourla : Aamir, what about this, the stocking? Aamir Malik : Yes. So on Prevnar, I\u2019ll just provide context on the U.S. performance dynamics. So the change year-over-year is predominantly a result of lower adult demand due to shrinkage of the opportunity size in that market. And the quarter-to-quarter change that you see is a function of the CDC order timing for pediatric vaccines, which tends to be quite lumpy as well as some of the adult vaccination dynamics of both shrinkage and seasonality. And I think it\u2019s important to continue to think about these two segments very differently in the U.S. So with pediatrics, as Albert had mentioned in his remarks, we exited Q2 with a share of 81%, which is up 71% in August. And then the adult market continues to behave differently in the U.S. in that it is contracting because there are just fewer eligible 65-plus adults and a more difficult-to-activate younger population. And that\u2019s the same population that Merck\u2019s V116 will be launching into. Albert Bourla : And in the international market? Alexandre de Germay : International, as you see first quarter, second quarter together for the first half, we grew by 2%, and this is in line with our expectation. What we see is, of course, we are going to capitalize on the very strong franchise that we are in Prevnar 13 with 140 exclusive NIP around the globe. And so as we get Prevnar 20 pediatric we are going to launch this product and switch from 13 to 20. Now in adults, it\u2019s a very interesting dynamic because in adults, our vaccination was in Europe and outside of the country is quite limited. Now that we see Prevnar 20 registered and validated by VTC, we see significant pickup. And let me give you an example. In Germany, we got VTC recommendations for 60 and above, all-comers and at risk, from 18 to 59. And there, in Germany, since the beginning of the year, we see significant growth. We see that we will have similar trends in other major markets in Europe. Albert Bourla : Thank you. And Chris? Chris Boshoff : Thank you very much for the question on KAT6. KAT6 is a first in category medicine. We\u2019re very proud that this medicine was conceptualized and discovered at our laboratories in Ohio. As you\u2019ve seen with the most recent data, objective response rate over 35% durable responses and well tolerated. We therefore plan to initiate a Phase 3 program over the next six months, and you\u2019ll learn more about that. But thank you for the question. We\u2019re also excited about KAT6. Albert Bourla : Thank you. We are very excited about it. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays. Carter Gould : Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first one, just a clarification. I guess when we think about the PK danuglipron data, the top line, on a month ago, are we going to see any of that data prior to the dose optimization data reading out early next year? And then as we think about timelines for danuglipron, some of your European peers have talked about potentially moving faster. And I think some of the timelines that are generally thrown out there, including potentially reaching market as early as 2028. Did Pfizer have sort of similar plans or think such plans would be feasible for danuglipron? Any color on that front would be helpful. Thank you. Albert Bourla : Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : Yes, for your questions, we\u2019ll likely present a comprehensive data set on PK after collecting all the data from the two studies, but we are looking into what\u2019s the best way to sharing it timely. We have some of the most aggressive timelines when we agree a protocol with regulatory agency and pending data. And as Albert has said, if that becomes the case that we move forward pending data, you can bet that like every Pfizer program, it will be very fast. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael. Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Chris Schott : Great. Just two questions for me. Just coming back to danu again. I guess just bigger picture, do you expect the once-daily formulation will have an improved tolerability profile versus the twice daily? And maybe part of it as we think about the additional data you\u2019re getting, will you get additional efficacy or tolerability data from these ongoing studies? Or is it really just PK, just as you\u2019re trying to make a decision here. I just want to try to better understand what you\u2019re going to have available to consider? And then the second question I had was just on RSV. It sounds like some encouraging contracting updates. But can you just elaborate a bit more on the market as a whole? Is this a market you expect to grow in the U.S. this year is on one hand I\u2019m balancing more visibility on who should be targeted and covered post ACIP. But at the same time there's no revax recommendation yet. And there could be maybe some challenges for pharmacies trying to figure out who's high risk and who's not in that 60 to 74-year old population. So just like balance those two together, do you expect the market as a whole is growing this year? Thank you. Dave Denton : Chris. Given that, for the interest of time let me tell you about Daniel. We have said it multiple times that is going to be PK data right now. We have done with Daniel 1,400 pace, so we feel very comfortable about the profile, we know the product. Right now the question is if we have a formulation that will allow us to take this product into Phase 3 registration enabling studies. We made an announcement because we feel that what we saw from the first round of testing multiple formulations, we felt encouraged that we have several that can deliver and one, but it was the preferred one and it is the one, but because it was the best of all, and now we are going to test it. Also we can speculate if tolerability will be better or not because of once a day compares to twice a day because we don't have the data. But as whis [ph], I said in my prepared remarks for DANUBE, the profile that the DANUBE right now has based on the 1400 patients that we have seen is very competitive both on tolerability and efficacy. With whatever we have seen from others in the oral space so far. And in terms of timing, right now with everything we know we are the only one with 2b data on an oral GLP-1 after, of course, Lilly. So right now for everything we know, we should be the second after Lilly if DANUBE progressed into registration enabling studies. Now let's go to RSV, Aamir. Aamir Malik : So Chris, what I would say is we are only in the second season now of a expanding market, right. So you had the first season last year, this year with the ACIP recommendation. As I mentioned earlier, we think that that provides clarity and it strengthens the need for those identified in the recommendation to get a vaccine. And we've had another six months plus of opportunity to educate HCPs as well as consumers, and we see growing relevancy and urgency of people to vaccinate. So we do think that the opportunity set expands. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Operator, next question. Operator : The next question comes from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Tim Anderson : Thank you. Going back to IRA, so CMS is bound to make the disclosure of negotiated prices on this first list of ten drugs a very big production, it will claim it's a major win over the industry. Of course, it depends on how those prices compare to net prices, not list. My understanding is it's possible we get this news from CMS earlier than September 1st, possibly this week ahead of the congressional recess in early August. Do you agree it's possible we might get this news early? Thank you. Albert Bourla : I don't know. They have the decision making, so they will do what they think. I can't comment on that. I know have discussed that thing, but \u2013 so I will emphasize once more, if CMS says that that was a big win for them against the pharma industry, what I would say it was the whole law of IRA. It is a very big loss for innovation and for the crown jewel of American industry, which is the Life Science Technology business. But it is what it is. It is the law of the land. And we are doing our best to make sure that we minimize any impact, particularly in the future, because for now, as Dave said, we were probably in the next few years, the NPV [ph] that are at stake for us, It's quite small because most, we were fortunate not to have up to four products selected only one. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Scala with TD Cowen. Steve Scala : Thank you so much. Two questions. First, do you expect VYNDAQEL to grow up to the LOE or will competitors pressure sales and take majority share before that? Certainly seems VYNDAQEL faces some significant challenge? And secondly, assuming no booster doses, does Pfizer still peg peak RSV vaccine sales at 2 billion plus? That was guidance first provided in December 2022 and do you think you can capture a majority share this fall? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Aamir, why don't you take the first one? Aamir Malik : Sure. So Steve, on VYNDA maybe what's going on now and then what's to come with competition. So VYNDA is continuing to grow at a very healthy clip. This is a result of multiple factors, a very important one of which is we focused on expanding our HCP base that we're targeting as well as really investing in diagnosing and identifying patients. Diagnosis remains the biggest unmet need in this condition because there's almost half of patients that are still undiagnosed. So we do see a lot of growth opportunity in VYNDA. Now for this year it may not continue as the same clip that we've seen in Q1 and Q2, because we had a big bolus of enrollment patients in the beginning of the year, partially as a result of some of the IRA reforms, and the incremental diagnoses become harder and harder to find. But we do expect continued growth with VYNDAQEL. As far as competition, there's still a lot that needs to be understood exactly about the competitors, their data, their profile, what actions they're going to take. But what I will say is that we obviously welcome more treatment options for patients, but there's a lot that we're very confident in with VYNDA. There's a body of clinical evidence that includes five-year follow-up clinical trial data, and real world evidence including statistically significant mortality and CV hospitalization data that is in our label, as well as quality of life benefits that we think continue to position VYNDA well. But of course, with competition coming in, we will take that into consideration and provide further guidance as things evolve. Albert Bourla : Thank you. And again, in the interest of time, Steve, for the RSV, when we provided $2 billion was in the frame of a pipeline asset. What is the key potential annually? We don't give once the products are registered, typically projections not even for the next year, not for the peak years, but what I would say if everything \u2013 if anything, things have become more promising since the time that we gave this $2 billions, because we were all surprised how much the medical community and the recommended authorities are putting emphasis on the disease. So that's my comment. Sorry I couldn't be more specific to you. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim Securities. Vamil Divan : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe a couple I could. One, you talked about the aggressive timeline that obesity. I assume for PCV next-gen, it's similarly aggressive. Maybe you just comment on sort of the time you think it would take to get that product to market, given you're now in Phase 2, and then the second one is more related to Paxlovid. In the first quarter, you had the big adjustment and you came in well above expectation, but to not raise the guidance now this quarter, you are raising the guidance. I'm curious if you can comment on anything you're seeing, sort of in the channels or what driving the confidence to raise the guidance now and then so tied to that, is that the main driver of, sort of the increased gross margin? So expectations. And is that just the product mix and cost management sort of combination, but just seeing if you can maybe parse out some of the main drivers of that impact. Thank you. Albert Bourla : Yes. For the next-gen, I\u2019ll make it easy. We announced that we entered into Phase 2 studies, both in pediatric, and so one can calculate, you can't comment how long we take because these are event-driven studies, particularly when you go into Phase 3, right. So we don't know how long that will take, but. And we don't comment at this stage, but let's go to Paxlovid and explain the dynamics, Aamir. Aamir Malik : Yes. So for Pax in the U.S., you pointed to the momentum in Q1, which I'll remind you was a combination of both the true-up as well as ongoing utilization that was very high given the wave of COVID infection. What happened then is in the first half of Q2 infections were low. And the very clear trend that we see with Paxlovid is when there is a COVID infection wave, we have healthy Paxlovid utilization. So starting in May, all the way through June, there was increased COVID infection waves and our Paxlovid utilization followed. So we had about 35,000 treatment courses a week in April and May, peaking to about 100,000 in June. So we have seen continued utilization. Now it is trickier for the wholesalers and end customers to manage utilization around the disease. That's a little bit unpredictable. So we did enter Q2 with higher than normal inventory levels, but the wave of utilization that we've seen in Q2 has helped normalize those inventory levels. And all of this dynamic combined with the fact that we've built a commercial model to successfully get Paxlovid to those who need it, including very healthy coverage with commercial payers, 90% of pharmacies across the U.S. already participating in our USG PAP program, and a simplified model for delivering that PAP program to patients when there is a COVID infection wave. We're confident about Paxlovid utilization. Albert Bourla : Yes. Thank you, Aamir. Dave Denton : And just real quickly, as you think about the guidance, I think your question was, was this, what was driving our improvement and guidance? This was one of many factors because our core business in general is doing quite well and our cost management programs are really taking hold. So this is one of multiple factors that drove that $0.30 raise. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Dave. And also Vamil, I realized that I misspoke before when I said that it is event-driven, the next-gen. It is not. It's immunogenicity. Also, I can offer another point for you to try to estimate the timelines that next year, we expect to have the regulatory discussions about how the program should look like, and then we will form better understanding when we can have the Phase 3 readout. Next question, please. And I think the last question, operator last question, please. We cannot hear the operator. Sorry for this technical problem. The technician just told me to wait a moment, please. Otherwise we will stop the call here. Operator : We'll take our final question from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Evan Seigerman : Hey, guys, thank you for squeezing me in at the end. I would love for some comments on VYNDAQEL given the strength this quarter; you really came in ahead of consensus. Do you expect this continuing in the back half of the year into 2025, and just given the IP in the next couple of years expiring, what can you do to extend this, given the strength of this franchise? Thank you so much. Albert Bourla : Aamir? Aamir Malik : Hey, Evan. So, a bit as I mentioned earlier, yes, we do expect to see continued growth momentum for VYNDA in the back half of this year and going forward for the reasons I described earlier. It may not be at the level that we saw in the first half of the year because of the Q1 bolus of patients, but the combination of what we're doing in terms of physician expansion, investment in driving diagnosis, and tailwinds from IRA reform do give us conviction around short term VYNDAQEL growth. Albert Bourla : Yes. And when it comes to, IP right now, it's very difficult, once the product is getting generic, to be able to fight with a new molecule unless you have substantial differentiation. And, VYNDAQEL has tremendous efficacy. So we do not expect that the market will continue being as big, particularly for us, after we see generics entering into it. So thank you for the question. So I want to make some just closing remarks that we had a very strong first half of the year, and we are confident that we will deliver on our full year financial commitments in 2024. We are driving progress with solid execution as we continue to serve patients and grow our business, execution makes the difference. Thank you for your interest in Pfizer, and we hope you have a wonderful. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer and Senior Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am. Francesca DeMartino : Good morning, and welcome to Pfizer's earnings call. I'm Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer. On behalf of the Pfizer team, thank you for joining us. This call is being made available via audio webcast at pfizer.com. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the third quarter of 2024 via a press release that is available on our website at pfizer.com. I'm joined today by Dr. Albert Bourla, our Chairman and CEO; and Dave Denton, our CFO. Albert and Dave have some prepared remarks, and we will then open the call for questions. Members of our leadership team will be available for the Q&A session, including Dr. Andrew Baum, who recently joined Pfizer as EVP and Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer. Before we get started, I want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements and discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. I encourage you to read the disclaimers in our slide presentation, the press release we issued this morning and the disclosures in our SEC filings, which are all available on the IR website on pfizer.com. Forward-looking statements on the call are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, speak only as of the call's original date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of the statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Albert. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Francesca. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Our team continues to execute, and we are pleased to report another quarter of strong performance. We are guided by our purpose of delivering breakthroughs that change patients' lives. And I'm proud that we have reached more than 270 million patients with our medicines and vaccines through the first 9 months of 2024. The focus on execution excellence is starting to deliver results with market share gains in the U.S. and international as well as robust growth in revenues and EPS. As a result, we are raising guidance ranges and for our full year 2024 total revenues and adjusted diluted earnings per share. In January, we presented the 5 key priorities that would guide Pfizer during our year of execution. Today, you will hear how we advanced our business in the third quarter with each of the strategic priorities. I will focus on highlights, showing our progress with the first 3. Dave will discuss our continued work to reduce our cost base, expand our margins and strategically deploy our capital. Then we will review our financial performance during the quarter and explain why we believe we are well positioned to deliver on our financial commitments and create long-term value for shareholders, and then we will take questions. So with that, I'll turn to our performance against our priorities during the quarter. Stated simply, Oncology is having a great year and delivered another quarter of strong performance, with 31% year-over-year performance growth resulting from solid demand across our product portfolio that includes legacy Seagen and legacy Pfizer products. We set a goal to achieve world-class Oncology leaders. In the U.S., we are already the third largest biopharma company in oncology by revenue through the first half of 2024, and we are proud of the progress we are making toward our goal. Demand continued to increase for XTANDI, the market leader for 4 types of advanced prostate cancer, grew 28% year-over-year. TALZENNA grew by 77% in the quarter versus the same quarter from a year ago. We are encouraged by the opportunity to further advance the prostate cancer treatment landscape based on the exciting overall survival data we announced earlier this month from the Phase III TALAPRO study. TALZENNA in combination with XTANDI demonstrated statistically significant overall survival benefit in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer becoming the first and only such combination to do so. Driving scientific breakthroughs in -- cancer is one of the key areas of focus in Oncology. The TALAPRO-2 results show how we continue innovating to improve survival for men with prostate cancer, which is the second most common cancer in men and the fifth most common cause of cancer death among men worldwide. We saw continued momentum during the quarter with the ongoing launch of PADCEV with pembrolizumab for patients with advanced metastatic bladder cancer, regardless of their eligibility to receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy. This combination has quickly become the most prescribed first-line treatment in the U.S. for locally advanced metastatic urothelial cancer. In thoracic cancer, we achieved 31% operational growth this quarter with LORBRENA, a treatment for adult with alpositive metastatic noncell lung cancer. Following the release of our 5 years of CROWN data during the ASPA Neal meeting, we are observing an acceleration of first-line new patient starts around the world and in particular, in our key markets of the U.S., China, Germany and France. Our BRAFTOVI and MEKTOVI combination also -- strong year-over-year growth in the third quarter of 32%, primarily driven by growth in the metastatic non-small cell cancer indications. And we continue to be pleased by strong performance with the launch of ELREXFIO, which had about 80% sequential revenue growth over the second quarter of 2024. In the U.S., we have more than doubled our new patient starts since January. In Japan, we were able to catch up with competition and launch as the first to market, BCMA bispecific, helping address an unmet medical need for patients with triple class exposed multiple myeloma. We believe ELREXFIO has the potential to be a transformative treatment option for people with multiple myeloma and we are continuing to advance development with 4 ongoing registrational studies in earlier lines of therapy, but if positive and approved, could support serving a way more expanded patient population. Now I will turn to some select highlights of our continued strategical advancing our pipeline. We are prioritizing opportunities where we have scientific leadership and deep capabilities to address significant unmet patient needs. Earlier, I spoke to the strength of our market Oncology medicines. Our pipeline, however, is what excites us the most. Lung cancer is the #1 cause of cancer-related death around the world. At the recent ESMO counts with our long-term follow-up results from FOREST trial, evaluating BRAFTOVI and MEKTOVI in patients with BRAF V600E mutant metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, which demonstrated compelling efficacy for patients. We are also rapidly advancing to next-generation ADC candidates with the potential to make significant impact on the more than 300,000 patients with non-small cell lung cancer in the U.S. The first is [indiscernible], which is now in Phase III, and we are planning additional -- trials in the coming months. The other one is a PD-L1 AV ADC. We are equally encouraged by the updated Phase I data we presented the ESMO for this ADC, and we are planning rotation enabling trials in 2025. Our [indiscernible] pipeline is expanding. We are studying another novel ADC, [indiscernible] in 2 ongoing registration intended trials in unfilial cancer. And MEBROMETOSTAN, our novel EZH2 inhibitor is another example of the progress we are making throughout our pipeline. This has been starting as a new potential treatment for men who have metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, and we are enrolling currently patients into Phase III studies. Finally, to build on the foundation for our drugs, we are making progress with development of 2 candidates we believe can replace the current backbones of HER positive HER2 negative breast cancer. Atirmociclib, our potential first-in-class CDK4 inhibitor is enrolling a second line Phase III trial, and we expect to start a first line Phase III study by early 2025. And we expect the first Phase III data in the coming months for vepdegestrant, an Eastern receptor [indiscernible] that we are codeveloping right now with [indiscernible]. Our fourth generation PCB candidate now in Phase II adult and pediatrics, covers 25 serotypes, including improved immunogenicity for serotype 3, very important, which is one of the largest remaining contributors of disease. We are focused on building on our leadership in the industry by continuing to expand balance sheet with our fifth generation candidate, which is in preclinical development that covers over 30 serotype. In the last several months, we have advanced the potential new vaccine against Seba, which is considered and urgent public health threat that lacks any approved vaccines. Leveraging experience from our previous STEP program, we have developed a new formulation for a second-generation candidate. After encouraging Phase I data with this new formulation, we have advanced our Phase II study already. We are also working to support significant need for about 90 million Americans and 200 million Europeans in areas with high incidence of lime disease. VLA15 is a vaccine candidate we are codeveloping that is intended to protect against the 6 most prevalent serotypes in North America and Europe. A Phase III trial is underway, and pending positive data and regulatory approval, VLA15 would become the only vaccine available to help prevent the acute severe and long-term health consequences of lime disease global. TAXICOVID is the standard of care COMIRNATY in oral treatment for those at high risk of progressing to severe disease. We believe, however, that there is an opportunity to expand both our therapeutic impact and market position where our next-generation oral antiviral candidate, EBUSATRELVI. In a Phase II study, we have demonstrated a robust antiviral activity at all doses and without the need for returnable boosting. We have addressed the drug-drug interactions and the metallic taste associated with TAXICOVID. We expect to start a Phase III study in the coming months. We are also moving forward with our Phase III program in nonsegmental vitiligo with ritlecitinib, a candidate with a differentiated JAK mechanism developed in-house at Pfizer that has the potential to be an expansion of indications for [indiscernible], which is currently approved in severe alopecia areata. Vitiligo, like alopecia areata , an autoimmune disease with high unmet need. It is the leading cause for skin depigmentation and affects nearly 3 million patients in the U.S. alone. We are also enthusiastic about our 2 first-in-class trispecific antibodies with early data demonstrating excellent 3-in-1 potency. We believe this program has the potential to deliver improved efficacy in atopic dermatitis with an ongoing Phase II study evaluating safety and efficacy. We had a Phase II readout of ponsegromab, which is another in-house discovered and developed by us. We are encouraged by the potential for a breakthrough for patients with cancer cachexia, who lack treatment options for this life whitening wasting condition that currently has no FDA-approved treatments. The Phase II study met its primary endpoints change from baseline in body weight compared to placebo across all dose tests. And the highest dose of [indiscernible], sought improvements for baseline in appetite, cachexia symptoms, physical activity and muscle mass. Based on these positive results, we expect to advance to a registration-enabling study next year. Our Phase II study in patients with heart failure related cachexia is ongoing. We remain on track with our dose optimization studies for danuglipron, our oral GLP-1 receptor agonist candidate and look forward to discussing more about this in early 2025. In our broader obesity portfolio, we continue to advance our early-stage candidates, including our oral small module GIPR antagonist, which is advancing to Phase II in 2024 this year. And in additional, all once daily oral GLP-1 receptor agonist in Phase I. The highlights, I mentioned today across important therapeutic areas show how we have made meaningful advancements with our pipeline. As we announced earlier this year, Dr. Mikael Dolsten, Pfizer's Chief Scientific Officer, will depart from Pfizer after 15 years of leading Pfizer's research efforts. Our progress for selecting a successor is not quite advanced, and we look forward to announcing an update soon. Now I will turn to our commercial performance. And another one of our strategic priorities is maximizing the performance of our new products. I'm pleased that the decisive actions we took to enhance our commercial organization at the beginning of the year are giving satisfactory results. With NURTEC, we saw 28% total prescription growth and continued leadership in the oral [indiscernible] class. Importantly, 85% of primary care clinicians writing CGRP prescriptions first time [indiscernible] NURTEC, 85%. This shows the progress we are making in primary care as well as our work with payers to remove barriers for timely patient access to treatment. Among our vaccines, we are very pleased with our performance since the launch of Prevnar20, which has already achieved 83% market in pediatric and 97% in adults. With last week's recommendation by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to expand adult pneumococcal vaccination to include all adults age 50 and older, we believe Prevnar20 is well positioned to serve and expand the population in the United States. Outside of the U.S., we are predominantly serving the pediatric market. And following the recent first quarter approval in Japan and EU, we are gaining vaccine technical committee recommendations and several market in programs. With ABRYSVO, we continued improving our U.S. market acquisition with strong commercial execution. Our market share of sales, retailers and clinics out of wholesalers has exceeded 50% for the quarter. And our market set of shots in arms in the [indiscernible] setting has increased for 9 consecutive weeks through mid-October, currently reaching 43%. Last week's FDA approval for ABRYSVO for patients 18 through 59 who are at increased risk of low respirable drug disease caused by RSV, could help a serve and expand the population over time. With the rise in COVID-19 infection in the summer and early fall, we have responded to increased demand for PAXLOVID as we launched in the U.S. commercial market at the beginning of the year. Our better-than-expected growth during the quarter for PAXLOVID reflects higher inflection rates and the strong commercial execution of our team. Our ability to execute effectively includes improving patient actions, raising awareness of this treatment option, expanding use of alternative sites of care and also continuing to educate health care providers. The demand for PAXLOVID have stabilized. In the slide, you can see the total number of patients treated with PAXLOVID in '24, which is very similar to the same period in '23. It appears to be closely correlated with its weight of COVID-19, but also appear to have very similar pattern in '23 and '24. The 63% operational growth in the third quarter of our VYNDAQEL family of products is a direct result of our progress in expanding the health care provider base and supporting clinicians in identifying more patients who can benefit from this therapy, as well as our work to improve patient access and adherence to therapy. Internationally, VYNDAQEL is reimbursed in 44 markets right now and more affected next year. While that integrates value across markets, the unmet [indiscernible] remains significant as restated by the 10% increase of patients on treatment in the third quarter versus the second quarter of 2024 in the U.S. We were pleased by the 74% quarterly operational growth and continued progress with expanding access with CIBINQO, a treatment for patients 12 and up with moderate to severe eczema who didn't respond to other treatments and 27% growth in the U.S. on the second to third quarters of 2024. With Litfulo, the first and only FDA-approved prescription pill for both adults and adolescents as young as 12 with severe alopecia areata. Now, and I will turn it over to Dave. Dave Denton : Thank you, Albert, and good morning, everyone. I will build on Albert's comments by reinforcing that we are very pleased with the financial results for the third quarter of 2024. These results demonstrate that our focus and our execution against our 5 strategic priorities are driving positive patient outcomes and continued financial and operational strength. In addition to our strong top line performance, our cost reduction programs are creating a more efficient organization, setting the stage for increased capital returns and supporting our commitment to both maintaining and growing our dividend, all while enhancing shareholder value. This morning, I will briefly review our Q3 P&L performance, I'll highlight our capital allocation priorities and touch upon our full year 2024 financial guidance. Additionally, as we approach the end of the year, I will also share several modeling considerations as we began to plan for 2025. Turning first to the third quarter performance versus the same period of last year. Let me walk on the P&L. Total company revenues were $17.7 billion, representing an impressive 32% operational growth. Our COVID-19 products were significant contributors with PAXLOVID generating $2.7 billion in revenue. This included $442 million related to delivering 1 million treatment courses to the U.S. Government Strategic National Stockpile. COMIRNATY, our COVID-19 vaccine contributed $1.4 billion in revenue. Our COVID-19 products were not the only drivers during the quarter. Our non-COVID products also exhibited robust performance with revenues of $13.6 billion, reflecting 14% operational year-over-year growth. This performance shows that our refined commercial approach is working. We continue to focus on key products and geographies, we've refined how we allocate our commercial field resources globally and we're further optimizing our marketing resources into key priority areas. We saw strong contribution from our recently acquired Seagen products, including Passive, which continues its momentum following the results of the EV302 study last year. Other key growth drivers included VYNDAQEL, ELIQUIS, XTANDI and NURTEC, partially offset by declines in Xeljanz and Ibrance. Adjusted gross margin for the third quarter is approximately 70%, primarily the result of a net unfavorable mix related to our COVID-19 products, primarily due to the COMIRNATY profit split with BioNTech and applicable royalty expenses, as well as a slight dampening due to the associated costs incurred with the withdrawal of Oxbryta. All of this was partially offset by our ongoing focus on cost management across our manufacturing network. We continue to expect gross margins to be in the mid-70s for the full year. And as previously communicated, long-term improvements in gross margins will remain a key focus for the company over the next several years. We expect to achieve savings from Phase I of our manufacturing optimization program beginning in 2025 and deliver approximately $1.5 billion in savings for the first phase by the end of 2027. In parallel, we continue to evaluate our strategy for both Phase II and Phase III, which will focus on network structure and product portfolio, respectively. And we expect to have more information to share on those components of the program once they become available. Total adjusted operating expenses decreased 2% operationally to $5.8 billion. And I will note that this amount includes spending acquired via our Seagen transaction. And looking at the components, adjusted SI&A expenses increased 1% operationally, driven primarily by marketing and promotional expenses for recently launched and acquired products partly offset by a reduction in the U.S. health care reform fees. Adjusted R&D expenses decreased 4% operationally, driven primarily by lower spending on certain vaccine programs as well as our cost realignment program, partially offset by an increased spending related to the Seagen acquisition. We continue to be disciplined with our operational expense management and remain on track to deliver at least $4 billion in net cost savings from our cost realignment program by year-end. Q3 reported diluted earnings per share was $0.78 in the quarter and our adjusted earnings per share was $1.06, benefiting from our top line performance and efficient operating structure as well as a favorable tax rate driven primarily by jurisdictional mix. As mentioned last quarter, unique onetime items included in our GAAP results and excluded from our adjusted results this quarter include a $420 million charge related to the expected sale of one of our facilities, resulting from the discontinuation of our DMD program earlier this year. Now let me quickly touch upon our capital allocation strategy, which is designed to enhance long-term shareholder value. Our strategy consists of both maintaining and growing our dividend over time, reinvesting in our business at an appropriate level of financial return and making value-enhancing share repurchases after delevering our balance sheet. In the first 9 months of '24, we returned $7.1 billion to shareholders via our quarterly dividend, invested $7.8 billion in internal R&D and as we expected, completed business development activity was minimal. Our commitment to delevering our capital structure to a gross leverage target of 3.25x remains a key priority. In support of that goal, year-to-date, we have delevered by approximately $4.4 billion, paying down approximately $2.3 billion in maturing debt and approximately $2.1 billion in commercial paper. And in October, we monetized another tranche of our Helion shares, which for reporting purposes is a Q4 event. We received approximately $3.5 billion in net cap proceeds, and our ownership in Helion was reduced from approximately 23% to approximately 15%. Year-to-date, we have received approximately $6.9 billion of net cash proceeds from the sale of our shares. We intend to monetize our remaining Helion investment in a prudent fashion considering our cash flow requirements and future market conditions. Overall, in Q3, we generated robust operating cash flows, which combined with the Helion net sale proceeds of approximately $3.5 billion, resulting in significant cash flow generation as we enter the fourth quarter. Our objective remains to delever and return to a more balanced allocation of capital between reinvestment and direct return to shareholders over time. Now let me spend just a few minutes on our outlook for the full year. Based on our focused execution and strong year-to-date results, we are raising our full year '24 revenue guidance by $1.5 billion and our adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.30. We now expect revenues in the range of $61 billion to $64 billion and operational revenue growth, excluding COVID-19 products is unchanged at 9% to 11% and takes into consideration reduction of sales associated with Oxbryta. COVID-19 product revenues are now expected to be $10.5 billion, $5 billion for COMIRNATY and $5.5 billion for PAXLOVID. Our guidance for adjusted SI&A, adjusted R&D and our effective tax rate on adjusted income remains unchanged. And last, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.75 to $2.95, primarily reflecting the top line increase and absorbing the Oxbryta impact. As a reminder, our EPS guidance includes an anticipated $0.40 of earnings dilution from the Seagen acquisition, largely due to financing costs. Now as we begin to look towards next year, I want to touch on a few modeling considerations. As we've previously discussed, there are several nonrecurring items included in our 2024 results. First, during 2024, PAXLOVID revenue included a U.S. government revenue credit true-up and the fulfillment of our obligation to the U.S. National Strategic Stockpile. Second, given our ownership of Helion is now below 20%, we will no longer record equity income from that investment in our adjusted earnings beginning in 2025. And finally, our 2024 tax rate on adjusted income was favorably impacted by timing with respect to the impact of Pillar 2 and to a lesser extent, audit settlements. All in, these items are expected to have a favorable impact on full year 2024 adjusted diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.30. In closing, I'm extremely pleased with our third quarter 2024 results and our overall performance this year. Our team remains dedicated to strong operational execution, and we believe our cost-saving programs will drive enhanced operating leverage over time that will enable us to consistently deliver on our financial commitments to our shareholders. We are committed to driving long-term value creation through scientific leadership, portfolio strength and productivity across all aspects of our business. And with that, I'll now turn it back over to Albert. Albert Bourla : Thanks, Dave. It's time for the Q&A. But before we take our first question, I want to briefly address the topic that I know is in the minds of many. We seek to be attentive to our shareholders and are always open to hearing their perspective. We had a meeting with Starboard Value 2 weeks ago. I was there with our Lead Director and our Head of Investor Relations. The meeting was constructive and [indiscernible]. They presented the same deck they made public last week. And given the proximity to our quarterly earnings day, we were mainly in listening mode. While we agree with some of the points they raised, we have vastly different views on many others. For example, they expressed dissatisfaction with our total shareholder return. We are not satisfied either, though we believe we are executing on the best path forward to increase shareholder return. On the other hand, they challenged our capital deployment for business development. We believe that our deals will produce significant shareholder returns, and some of them like Seagen or BioNTech have been transformational for Pfizer. The important thing is what we do to improve performance. In January, we presented a 5-point [indiscernible] aiming to create shareholder value that has guided our decision-making all year long. We remain focused on executing this plan and on delivering for our commitments, including driving long-term shareholder value. We will engage productively with our shareholders, including Starboard, and will consider all good ideas that are offering. And with that, operator, please assemble the queue to discuss our third quarter performance and pipeline. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. Chris Shibutani : I wanted to ask questions about the pipeline, particularly with regard to obesity, where we appreciate the additional insights into what you have in the clinic. Albert, you previously said that you believe that Pfizer could be the #2 company on the market with an oral. That would imply that danuglipron is the lead asset there, however, you do have 2 additional assets that we find intriguing at a GP-1 oral that is in Phase I that is once a day, but would clearly be behind. And then now an oral GIP antagonist, which I think is a source of debate. Can you frame what your strategy is, how important it is to be second to market versus perhaps having a differentiated approach with these 2 assets? Albert Bourla : Look, I will ask Mikael to comment because there is a lot of activities going on right now, all that. But my general comment is that, as I have said, if Daniel moves fast based on what we know right now, we should be the second oral into the market, provided that the first one will be successful and the other ones will not come before us. But so far, this is what the situation looks like. The market is very, very large. And there is a significant need for oral solutions. We know that. So there is no doubt that if successful, we will have our decent market share of oral. But the important thing it is that obesity market is developing, let's say, nicely also in terms of science, and we are exploring several other opportunities right now. The two that we have mentioned in the clinic, Mikael Michael can speak a little bit more, both about the danu and the other two, Mikael. Mikael Dolsten : Thank you, Albert. Yes, as you heard in Albert\u2019s remarks before the meeting, we continue to execute on our danuglipron plan, which includes a once-a-day profile with a modified release type of system. And we do believe that once a day with modified release could have some really special features and bringing that as a second oral would help really to have a strong foot into that market, in the same way, we have seen injectable being split etweenn 2 different products. I don\u2019t expect that the various oral will, in the end, differ that much in the GLP-1 class. So that\u2019s why we were keen also to move a GIFR, which could add better tolerability and more efficacy. And we\u2019re right now, initiating Phase II studies on the backbone of [indiscernible] engines. And these are our 2 more advanced bets, plus we always like to bring in this huge segment in drives and have more options as we advance. And you\u2019ve heard there are so many applications for GLP-1s, and that\u2019s why we have a second once-a-day again. Operator : We'll take our next question from Kripa Devarakonda with Truist. Kripa Devarakonda : I have actually a question on your recent data from fensegrumab program in cachexia. You reported positive Phase II data. And just broadly speaking, this program has been previously highlighted as well. For the registrational trial, would a trial that replicate your Phase II in a larger group of patients be sufficient? Or would you need to show outcomes like survival? And also, adding away details of the registrational trial, can you help us understand how big of an opportunity you see for this drug? Albert Bourla : Let's start with Mikael a little bit on the science, and then maybe Andrew can speak about the potential market size of the [indiscernible]. Mikael Dolsten : I think in general, for cancer agents, and this is more in the supported care, we're addressing segments of unmet patient needs, which relates to be able to regain the performance status with better body weight, have higher physical activity and be able to go through more treatment cycles, which should often translate to better long-term survival. As you know, that is always dependent on how patients cross over to different trials. So I do think initial registration will come from similar endpoint as in our Phase II studies, but we clearly aim to translate better patient performance to other outcomes that are more harder endpoint going through more treatment cycle and treatment that, call it, with better cancer outcome over time. And this is -- will be shown in multiple cancer types. So we do think similar to other product that earlier have been heavily used in support of cancer care, this could be a very large opportunity. And in addition to that, we are running a heart failure studies and looking at a third opportunity, also large chronic disease. And with that, Andrew, some comments on the potential of this molecule? Albert Bourla : Yes, correct. And building on Mikael\u2019s comments, look, Extia is a massive unmet medical need. It\u2019s 50% to 80% of patients with oncology, suffer from that, particularly, as you know, within pancreatic and non-small cell lung cancer. It\u2019s probably about 20% to 30% in heart failure and COPD. The size of the market really depends on whether it\u2019s viewed as a supportive care therapy. But also, obviously, as Mikael mentioned, whether you have outcome benefit. And obviously, depending on the outcome of those trials, we\u2019re going to be looking at different price points. So the size of the market or particularly the size of this drug is going to be very much informed by the data that we deliver in the pending Phase II and Phase III trials. Operator : We'll take our next question from Umer Raffat with Evercore. Umer Raffat : I feel like it's still very early in your engagement with some of your shareholders and the new shareholders. So perhaps it might be too premature to ask much further on that. So instead, maybe I'll focus on pipeline briefly. I know you mentioned, Michael, that the oral GIP antagonist adds better tolerability and more efficacy. It sounded like you were implying it's more incremental to what an oral GLP could do as a stand-alone. Could you just lay that into context, for example, in the 4-week Phase I study you ran, did it hit 4% to 5% weight loss? And secondly, the more than 30-valent pneumococcal vaccine that you guys disclosed this morning, does it have more than one carrier protein? Albert Bourla : Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : Yes. I think the ability of GIPR to act in concert with GLP-1 has been well documented in a few different peptide settings. So we aim to be the first to document this with an oral approach, and that could offer a really nice differentiation for patients that need more and faster achieving of the treatment objectives. That's what we want to reveal right now. On the -- our new platform for PCV generation 4 and 5, we include a number of technical improvements. We don't want to disclose those today, but we did -- we're open to mention that our PCV fourth generation, which covers 25 serotypes have as an example and improved serotype 3 based on new technology that moves it far beyond what we believe any other technology has been able to accomplish. And why is that important? Well, serotype 3 covers somewhere between 15% to 30% of disease in different countries and improving on that can have a bigger impact than adding a number of rather infrequent serotypes. As we go to the more than 30 valent, it will be a combination of such improvement and many more serotypes. Operator : We'll take our next question from Trung Huynh with UBS. Trung Huynh : Sorry, I was on mute there, Trung Huynh from UBS. I have two. So thanks very much for the comments on the activist investor. You said you disagreed with the thoughts over capital deployment and then you cited significant shareholder returns for Seagen and BioNTech. What's the difference between what you're thinking and perhaps what the Street is thinking here on BD? And then how do you intend to restore that and restore confidence back into the company, so that bridge between your expectations and the Street can be aligned? And then just on your commitment to delever, and thanks for the comments on the prepared remarks here. Is there an appetite to delever even quicker and sell the hospital business and [indiscernible] the Helion stake earlier? And you do have products going off with LOE soon. That could give you a little bit more flexibility on the balance sheet. So yes, just thoughts here. Albert Bourla : Why don't we start with this one and then I'll take a little bit the activist question. Dave Denton : Yes. So first, on the levering point, yes, our objective is to delever as rapidly as possible. And I think the company has been laser focused on doing that, given the fact that we've taken out about $4.4 billion in debt year-to-date, and we'll continue to do that. Secondly, without speaking directly around any potential BD opportunities here, is we're always looking to evaluate the infrastructure that we have and the assets that we currently maintain and understand if there's availability to, I'll say, monetize some of those assets over time to further support our delevering activity. So I would say all options are on the table, and we'll continue to evaluate on what makes the most sense for us strategically long term. Albert Bourla : As regards the \u2013 our projections compared to the Street projections in the business development. First of all, let\u2019s start by saying that by far, the 2 biggest Seagen and BioNTech in terms of revenues, right? And in both as, I think the Street move on seem way up compared to when we made the deal. And upon the [indiscernible] we are very, very stable. The other ones that also \u2013if you add to that, the Biohaven with NURTEC, which we are on our plans and we just exceeded for the second quarter, Street expectations, it is covering 80% of the investments that we have made and probably weigh more in terms of revenues. And the most important thing is that those Seagen, for example, or the BioNTech with our development of mRNA infrastructure around the world. And the Seagen acquisition with our taking over the ADC technology of [indiscernible] was a unique, unique asset is transformational for Pfizer. It\u2019s not the revenue growth, but we are seeing right now, and we\u2019ll continue seeing all the way towards the end of the decade. But it is 2 \u2013 a disease, one already in Phase III, the other is about to start Phase III that we got from Seagen, one the SV and the other, the PDL-1 ADC. Those are mega-blockbusters, if there are technical success, mega-blockbusters. And we are moving to Phase III because we have seen very positive earlier data. The same issue. We\u2019re starting with [indiscernible] cancer, another ADC. So I would say that I think \u2013 we truly think that this was well invested capital and will demonstrate significant value for shareholder. But I want also to make a final comment for any discussion with activists. But no matter if we are agree or disagree on what has happened, I think the most important thing, it is what we are doing going forward. Starboard has not presented any specific actions, but they suggested something needs to change. From that point, in the beginning of the year, already a year ago, we are already starting changing a lot of things. Over the past 10 months, we have implemented changes like we changed our commercial model to separate the U.S. and international business and appointed new leaders who have now delivered 3 consecutive quarters of revenue. And we integrated Seagen and created an end-to-end oncology research organization to ensure a successful integration of the company \u2013 of the Seagen pipeline. And we have retained the vast majority of the legacy Seagen colleagues, and we have delivered multiple, multiple successful readouts from that. We announced a plan to reduce OpEx by $4 billion, which we are executing successfully without negatively affecting the top line. We announced an additional plan to reduce manufacturing costs by $1.5 billion, which so far is delivering satisfactory results. We brought in Andrew Baum, which is a knowledgeable research analyst to help prioritize our R&D pipeline and future business development. We are advancing now the process of selecting a new scientific officer. And we have enhanced our Board with 2 terrific new directors who have deep expertise in corporate governance and shareholder value creation. So what we believe is that all these changes are the result of an intentional 5-point plan that we rolled out already in January of last year. So as I said in my personal, let\u2019s say, remarks, we plan to engage with shareholders, including Starboard and consider any good ideas that create long-term shareholder value. But I don\u2019t think that the statement something needs to change is really pragmatic because it\u2019s coming 15 months late. Operator : We'll take our next question from Louise Chen with Cantor. Louise Chen : So I just had two here. First one, I wanted to ask you is how we should think about the big pushes and pulls for sales and EPS in 2025? And when you might give guidance? Could it be as early as this year? And then second one, just on Seagen, just wondering how the integration is coming along and if you have any updates to some of the metrics that you gave like sales in 2030 and what have you for the Seagen deal? Albert Bourla : Okay. Dave, let's start with the first question. Dave Denton : Yes. So thank you. Regarding 2025, it's really topical because we're in the middle, as you can imagine, building our 2025 financial plan here across all of our business lines at -- to your point, there's going to be a lot of pushes and pulls as we think about growth into next year on both our core business as well as our COVID business. It is our expectation that we will provide guidance for 2025, most likely by the end of this year. So stay tuned, more to come. We will lay out all the pushes and pulls when we give guidance for 2025, so you can get a very clear understanding of our business and the opportunities to enhance shareholder value longer term. Albert Bourla : Chris, can you give us an update on the Seagen integration, both speak a little bit about the commercial, but also focus on the research, which is a significant value? Chris Boshoff : Thank you very much for the question. Overall, we're very pleased with the integration to date. We've retained the vast majority of colleagues at legacy Seagen, and we now have over 1,500 colleagues working in our facilities in Basel just outside Seattle. As you saw the global revenue in Q3, we printed $854 million from legacy Seagen and of that, PADCEV printed over $400 million in Q3. Seagen year-to-date delivered for us $2.3 billion, which is 38% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. We continue to execute very well on the portfolio, on the pipeline. We started Phase III studies with dasitamab vedotin in urothelial cancer, that\u2019s HER2-low, which is up to 40% of bladder cancer. With Sigotatacvedotin, the differentiated B6A started the first Phase III study in non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, that\u2019s where we saw most significant data. And we\u2019re also planning to start the combination of sicotatactedotin pembrolizumab in the first-line setting of non-small cell lung cans and recently discussed and aligned with the FDA on trial design and on the dosing. We\u2019re also progressing and to start a Phase III program with the PD-L1 V, the [indiscernible] in combination with pembrolizumab early next year. So overall, great commercial performance so far. We haven\u2019t missed a beat, and we continue to execute on the pipeline. Operator : We'll take our next question from Geoff Meacham with Citi. Geoff Meacham : Thanks so much for the question. Just had a couple of quick ones. Mikael, another one on obesity. And I know you've added assets outside of danuglipron and I appreciate that it's early. I want to ask you, what does success look like on efficacy just given the bar today? And then strategically, how does Pfizer view orals versus longer-acting injectables when you think about the investments Pfizer is making in this category? And then real quick, Albert, on the IRA. Obviously, it seems here to stay. But when you think about the potential for a new administration, what would Pfizer like to see obviously beyond closing the gap between orals and biologics on exclusivity? Albert Bourla : Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : For orals, to keep it very [indiscernible], I think you have a number of things that could be advantageous. One is, of course, the combined [indiscernible] with all other drugs that are involved in [indiscernible] metabolic disease to give long outcomes. And what you're looking for I would say is 10% to 20% order weight, the lower range of the first GLP. The upper range is where you can see oral combinations edge towards. And that's very much similar to what you can see with the peptide. So I can very broad with a lower and an aspirational range, the lower for more single agents that will edge above that and combi agents that can aspire to go above 15 and edge above that. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael. Now on [indiscernible] IRA. Clearly, IRA overall is negative for innovation and does not promote a spirit that people could provide investments, but there are also some good things about it. So clearly, I wouldn\u2019t like to see that the out-of-pocket that next year will be $167 per month for all your medicines for seniors. That, we want to be maintained. But this forced price setting [indiscernible] negotiation and also the penalty deal between \u2013 are things that needs to change. And it\u2019s not only on IRA. I would mention that 340B right now, it is one of the biggest issue, and it is unethical and it is the way that it is evolving. And it is creating significant transfer of funds from where it needs to be the [indiscernible] people to booster the profit lines of some business. So 340B reform is something that myself and the entire pharma is setting as a priority. So thank you for your question. Operator : We'll take our next question from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Terence Flynn : Great. Appreciate the questions. Two for me. I guess, first one is on the RSV opportunity. Just wondering what you see as the most likely outcome here for revaccination frequency and the potential impact on the longer-term market opportunity? And then the second question is more of a clarification. On your CDK4 inhibitor, you guided to starting first-line Phase III study early next year. Just wondering if you can share any more detail there on the design, if that would be a head-to-head versus IBRANCE? And if it would be in combo with VFD or if that's a monotherapy type design? Albert Bourla : All right. I mean, would you like to speak a little bit about the RSV and the maybe Terence, to directly answer your question. So how the market evolves, it's going to be a function of how ACIP recommendations for RSV evolve, and that includes revaccination timing, as you mentioned, but also [indiscernible] populations. I don't think it's really productive for us to predict how ACIP is going to evolve these recommendations. But we do feel confident in the Bristow's profile. And importantly, what I would like to highlight is we feel very confident in our ability to pull that profile through. You heard Albert describe our momentum in the U.S. market, particularly in light of dramatic improvements in our market share versus last year. And we continue to be ready to advance in vaccinations in the fourth quarter as well. And the last thing I would say is the FDA's recent approval of the 18- to 59-year-old at-risk population makes ABRYSVO the only RSV vaccine that's indicated to protect patients as young as 18 years of age, and it further strengthens this active on the viability of ABRYSVO. Last thing I'll say is on maternal. We have also had really good momentum on our ABRYSVO maternal indication. We see very strong signals in uptake for the month of September. We had a 20% uptake, which is a full doubling of where we ended the last season. And we continue to see uptake amongst OB/GYNs and health systems. So in the first 4 weeks of this season, the units that we shipped into those systems were up 56% from the first 4 weeks of last season. So we see momentum on ABRYSVO, and we look forward to future [indiscernible] updates. Albert Bourla : And Alexandre, do you want to add something on the international because that's also an important market for us. . Alexandre de Germay : Yes, absolutely. Even though it's not material yet, we're actually making very good progress. So on the adult front, we actually got BTC recommendations since the beginning of the year in large markets like U.K., Germany, in France, in Canada, in Australia, in Saudi Arabia and a lot of other midsized market positive share recommendation. Now we're moving into funding. And as you know, at the second quarter, we said that we won the exclusive U.K. tender. That's what we did. We also won the Canadian tender. Now in terms of reimbursement, we just got actually regional reimbursement in Germany, and we are launching [indiscernible] October in Germany. Now all the others, the large market and the client market that I've talked about, are in phase of negotiation. On the other side, the last thing I want to say is actually, we are working toward our immunobridging study in 2025 in China, so that we can do an NDA filing, which is also an important market for us. On the pediatric side, also, we are making good progress. We also got BTC recommendation in large markets like the U.K., in France, in Australia, in several other midsized markets. And actually, yesterday, we just got also the Pan-American Health Organization that covers 40 market in the Americas, that actually leased ABRYSVO in the RSV recommendation. So we're gaining also reimbursements in France. And we have actually just launched in France recently. There, again, on pediatric, once we got all those positive recommendations, we are moving into reimbursements. So we see great potential. It's going to take a bit of time because we go through all those statement steps, but we see good potential there. Absolutely. Albert Bourla : And then why don't we go to Chris for the question on the design of the Phase III. Chris Boshoff : Thank you very much for the question. On atormocyclib, our highly selective CDK4 inhibitor. This was another small molecule that was conceptualized and discovered in our laboratories in La Jolla. And as you know, it\u2019s currently in a Phase III program for second line plus hormone receptor positive breast cancer. This is potentially, not only a first-in-class, but basin class, highly selective CDK4 inhibitor. And as you know, CDK6 leads to some of the vulnerabilities, including the bone marrow toxicity, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re focusing on CDK4, which drive breast cancer proliferation. So we believe with the current date, including the safety and tolerability, the early clinical data support the potential for more complete and continuous dosing with CDK4. And as you\u2019ve seen, we\u2019ve got no grade 4 neutropenia, no Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea and no grade 4 and treatment-related AEs was observed. We\u2019ve aligned with the FDA on the first-line hormone receptor positive breast cancer study, which will start in the coming months. And it will be against physicians\u2019 choice of CDK4/6 in advance. Operator : We'll take our next question from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Evan Seigerman : I have one for Andrew on [indiscernible] of what I believe is this first call on the other side. In your first 4 months or so, can you help us better understand your findings regarding the portfolio? And more broadly, how do you hope to shape and focus the wide variety of assets that Pfizer has to drive sustainable growth? Albert Bourla : So what -- now that you're in the dark side, what is your opinion, my friend? Chris Boshoff : Well, I think, a, Evan, thanks for the question. B, I think in response to Albert\u2019s question, I think coming from finance, I guess, pharma is a segment of the light side rather than the dark side. But in terms of the question, look, I always regarded Pfizer\u2019s R&D engine, highly just because when you look at the stream of molecules that have been internally discovered at Pfizer over the years, first ALK inhibitor, first CDK4/6 inhibitor, numerous JAKs, ABRYSVO, there\u2019s clearly a very, very strong record of discovery and execution. And it\u2019s not just small molecules, I hasten to add. You see that in vaccines in oligos, in cell therapies, in bispecific. And for me, when I made the move, this was absolutely key in terms of a company that have this because if you don\u2019t have this, then life is very, very difficult. Now in answer to where I hope to add value coming forward, I think, as Albert alluded to earlier, historically, perhaps you may have pursued areas where that R&D investment hasn\u2019t translated into the type of revenues you want. The point is that this is a much easier challenge to solve. It\u2019s a matter of taking this incredibly powerful machine and put together in the right direction so that we are targeting those areas that translate into revenues. One thing that I think the COVID experience shows you is once Pfizer focuses, execution is something you should feel very comfortable about. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Courtney Breen with Bernstein. Courtney Breen : This is Courtney Breen from Bernstein. Perhaps building on the last question, looking at Slide 28 in the presentation today, it suggested that in the last 3 months, from the end of July to today, that there has been no meaningful advancement of the pipeline, albeit there are a number of pipeline actions kind of suggested to be initiating too. We are suggesting is as likely as a response to the reset and cost cutting that's going on. My first part to this question is, how will you ensure that this isn't repeated in further quarters? And how are we balancing the need to kind of take stock and cut while ensuring that high potential opportunities are getting appropriately accelerated through the pipeline? Albert Bourla : Then maybe I will ask the 2 R&D heads to comment on that. Please, let's start with Chris. Chris Boshoff : Yes. Thank you for the question. So just to remind us, this year, we've already started 8 new first in-patient studies in oncology, which I believe makes us the number 1 company in terms of Phase I clinical trial started. In the coming months, we expect potential Phase III readouts for breakwater, which is a very importation for us in BRAF mutated colorectal cancer which is up to 10% of colorectal cancer, and that will be in the first line setting, a big unmet need because there's particularly poor prognosis patients presenting with BRAF mutated colorectal cancer. We also expect readouts for Veritex2 our ER [indiscernible] we codeveloping with ovens for ER-positive second-line plus methodic breast cancer and potentially for Crest which is a sasanlimab, a differentiated subcut PD-1 in combination with BCP in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. We will also present in the coming months, Phase II randomized data for [indiscernible]. This is a randomized Phase II data in patients with prostate cancer. We've seen the data, and that provided us the confidence to initiate the 2 Phase III programs. In the coming months, we'll also start additional Phase III studies, as I mentioned, CDK4 in first line [indiscernible] breast cancer [indiscernible] in combination with pembrolizumab in PD-L1 high first-line non-small cell lung cancer and CAT 6 with positive breast cancer. Albert Bourla : So quite impressive on the Oncology side. Mikael, what about the rest? Mikael Dolsten : We thought we help you focus by this quarter displaying some nice movement, most valuable part of this chart, the right-hand. When you look over the next 18 months and including Oncology and non-Oncology, we will have up to 40 different opportunities to fill the left side that I hear you are eager to see progress on and the right hand. If you\u2019ll include the 40 will be divided between potential approvals, projected pivotal readouts and potential proof of concept. And that did not even include early signals in clinical development. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steve Scala with TD Cowen. Steve Scala : Pfizer has previously stated, it anticipated having visibility on long-term COVID product sales based on 2024 trends. Since we are now nearing the end of 2024, I'm wondering what that long-term number is? And then secondly, does Pfizer have the Phase III booster data for the RS vaccine in adults in-house? And if yes, does the data show a similar step-down in Booster immunogenicity as did the GSK vaccine? Albert Bourla : All right. So on the stability, let's -- maybe [indiscernible] you want to make a [indiscernible]. Chris Boshoff : Let me just comment on performance. I think, Steve, I think both on PAXLOVID and COMIRNATY. I think what our performance to date as well as the quarter, which show us is that these are both entering into a category where we understand what the volumes are likely to be. And we believe these are going to be durable businesses going forward. So just as an example, on PAXLOVID, even if you take the onetime items that Dave alluded to aside for a moment, we've seen significant PAXLOVID treatment course utilization, right? Even just in the summer wave that happened over the course of the third quarter, we saw an average of about 100,000 courses of treatment at the start of July, growing to about 225,000 treatment courses in mid-August before that wave declined. And we've built a very durable commercial engine to support that with increasing treatment rates, with very viable reimbursement, both on the government side as well as on the commercial side and a way to activate HCPs and consumers who need our treatment. And similarly, on the vaccine, our goal this year with COMIRNATY, and we had the benefit of being able to start 3 weeks before last year, was to start the season with plenty of vaccine in fridges, both in the retail setting as well as in the health system setting. And again, we've demonstrated an ability to do that quite well. When you look at where vaccination is this year versus last year, it's a little bit higher, actually, but a big part of that is just a function of the calendar in the 3 weeks earlier. We expect to see vaccinations continue in October through December. And the shape of that curve will continue to evolve, but all of this makes us confident that we're seeing a durable business, both on vaccines and PAX. Alexandre de Germay : For international, this is Alexandre, thanks for the question, too. Same principles, we see enduring business. In COMIRNATY, just I want to remind everyone that in the International vision, we closed our third quarter at the end of August. So basically, you don't see any sales of COMIRNATY simply because most markets are starting of the vaccination campaign in September. Having said that, we are progressing very nicely in our key regions. So in Europe, we got the approval of the GEN-1 adapted vaccine in July, and we got the KP12 [indiscernible] September. So it's basically an [indiscernible] started to work with our health care authorities partner in Europe, where we have existing contract to implement the multiyear contract that is in place. Something in the U.K. and Canada, we've also worked with the authority to actually execute our contract. In Japan, we also got the GEN-1 adapted vaccine approved in mid-September. And COMIRNATY is actually the only PFS vaccine, never frozen, which could be a completed advantage considering the distribution model in Japan. So again, we see this as an enduring business and we see us as I said, executing our existing contracts in our key locations. So it's probably a -- PAXLOVID stands Q3 -- was a good Q3 for us, and it's actually very good because it satisfies of perception that actually is a sustainable business with sustainable demand, which coincides with the COVID wave. And we had quite a strong spring waves in Europe and Asia, and that translated into [indiscernible]. Just to close, I want to say that 47 countries outside of the U.S. have transitioned from advanced purchasing into commercial. So as we see in the U.S., it is an enduring and now the sales that we see quarter after quarter reflect the absolute demand and reflect the waves as they hit the different region of the world. Albert Bourla : And still also, I can't resist also making some comments. In the 5.5 years of CEO, I had 23 earnings releases, of which 22 we beat EPS at Bloomberg and one we missed. And I don't like the one that we missed, and that was in Q3 last year and we missed it because of COVID. We severely miscalculate. Yes, there are excuses that last pandemic was 100 years ago. So we didn't have, let's say, benchmark. But -- and also, we had to reduce it significantly. We had $56 billion of COVID revenue in 2022 and we had a guidance of 22. So we reduced it at 40% on what used to be. However, life proved, that we got it wrong and us and everybody else. And the reality was that it was not 22 but 12. So we are very careful now when we speak about COVID because we don't want to miss it again. And -- but I would like to say that when I see the trends of the COVID business, PAXLOVID which for us is even more important because of the higher level of profitability, it is basically identical the utilization of last year compared to this year. So far, we had 4.9 million patients treated, end of Q3 with PAXLOVID in the U.S. and -- compared to 5.2 million people last year, the same period. The treatment rates have improved from 50% last year to 57%. And the fulfillment rates went a little bit down because now there is [indiscernible] from 88% went to 81%, but it's very, very stable. The same is with the COVID vaccination. When you see the trends of COVID vaccination, the utilization are basically the same like last year, more or less and still it's early in the season. So there could be fluctuations over there. But -- so I think your statement that some, we consider COVID as normal business now, it's absolutely true. And this is how we regard it. And we will stop separating our business to COVID and COVID because it's Pfizer business. And with that, I will ask Mikael to make a comment on the [indiscernible]. Mikael Dolsten : Yes. Thank you for your question. We have started to accumulate data on both durability and the impact of revaccination for RSV. On the majority of patients that we expected to go to pharmacy for revaccination, the titers remain robust after 1 and even 2 years, which is punctuate the quality of our oral vaccine. But they, of course, declined gradually, and we can have some meaningful improvement in this type with a booster. But I believe that likely in 3 years, around 3 years, we will see a drop in the titer that makes the boost really improve meaningfully, the protection for a substantial fraction of the patient. And that\u2019s what we are going to monitor now, whether the [indiscernible] is a good interval. But otherwise, it\u2019s performing exactly as expected for a high quality vaccine. Now there could be patient groups that go to physician offices that are more immunocompromised, moderate to severe patients, that may benefit from once a year, and that will be more a physician directive. So I hope that will give you a bit of an understanding how this will evolve. Operator : We'll take our next question from Rajesh Kumar with HSBC. Rajesh Kumar : My apologies. I was on mute. So two questions, if I may. What is the impact of [indiscernible] IRA on your business next year? Are there any numbers you're calling out, which might help us with the modeling? That would be very helpful to understand if there are any impacts. And the second one is, I appreciate the color on the Seagen pipeline and how you're progressing and how the market under appreciates the size of the opportunity? The sell-side estimates clearly did reflect your optimism. When is it that you'll feel a bit more confident or what do you need to see to increase your longer-term guidance on Seagen? Albert Bourla : Dave, can you take the IRA [indiscernible]. Dave Denton : So I'll just hit on it very briefly. Obviously, the IRA and that [indiscernible] has pluses and pull -- pushes and pulls to us as we cycle into next year. When we provide guidance by the end of this year, we will give you a view on the net impact of that as we think about our business. So more to come, hold tight on that. Albert Bourla : And there are puts and takes, so positive things are negative, right? So we need to assess it as we are building now these calculations as we are building our budgets for next year. Seagen pipeline, Chris? Chris Boshoff : Yes. Thank you for the question. So I think last year, at this time, we didn\u2019t expect we\u2019re going to have PADCEV approved in first-line bladder and everyone forecast of that approval for the first half of this year. And obviously, the approval happened very early because of the unprecedented data. So I think the performance commercially is really as we expected or exceeded what we expected in 2024. If you look at the rest of the pipeline now, the new molecules like [indiscernible] D-L1B as well as next-generation CD30 ADC called 35C for cancer [indiscernible], we will present next year conferences more updated data on these, including in combination with pembrolizumab for [indiscernible] for DB and for PD-L1 as well as really highly encouraging data for 35C, the next-generation CD30. So I think by showing and releasing more data next year will help all of you to build confidence in the pipeline. Operator : We'll take our next question from Akash Tewari with Jefferies. Akash Tewari : So looking at some of your IP around 25 [indiscernible] and Prevnar, it looks like you'll have a step up versus your previous 20 [indiscernible] vaccine, but it does look like effective serotype coverage could lag meaningfully versus Merck and backside approach it by 10% or more in older adults. How confident are you that the [indiscernible] vaccine could stave off a preferential rec from some of your peers down the line in adults? And then number two, can you talk about what special properties your once daily modified release enabledron could have outside of improved half-life that investors might be under-appreciating? I think those earlier comments stood out to us. Albert Bourla : Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : Yes. The 25 [indiscernible] that you asked about, the fourth generation, we aspire to the one that first hits the pediatric market, which is where the bulk of use of doses. But we also think because of this unique improvement of serotype 3, that is far more important and several of the other tiny serotypes will bring an overall value to the other segment that will be very meaningful. And as you have heard, we are working on a fifth generation that will include both improved performance such as serotype 3 and go far beyond any of those serotypes that you are talking about in numbers. We used 30 plus just to keep a bit of details for the future. For the QD, I think in general, you saw, of course, with the injectable when you went from once a day to once a week and you\u2019ve got a smoother profile and reduced the number of peaks that many patients perform better on them. So that\u2019s hypothesis, we are keeping our eyes on that with a modified release, you will have a more smooth profile. You avoid certainly additional high peaks that immediately is halved, and that\u2019s something we have seen in other formulation of other drugs. And that\u2019s why I think we are trying to be attentive in order to have our eyes on details that can help to make this product a really nice oral product with some differentiation. Operator : We'll take our next question from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim Securities. Vamil Divan : I'll keep it to two. So one just on the guidance for the full year. You increased the total sales guidance by 3.5%. You increased the COVID products by $2 billion. So I guess, you're lowering the non-COVID by about $500 million. I guess some of that does not surprise us. I'm wondering if there's anything else you might call out where you're sort of trimming your expectations for the full year? And then second one, sort of tie to [indiscernible] news from a few weeks ago. We noticed the GVT601 of Savelator. So that seems to be progressing still in your pipeline. I'm just curious if you're contemplating or have you made any changes to that approach? And the mechanism is obviously similar [indiscernible], just wondering if anything you learned from the [indiscernible] situation. Should we should think about carrying over in [indiscernible]. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Vamil. Dave? Dave Denton : Yes. On the guidance from a revenue perspective, you're absolutely correct. We increased our overall guidance by $1.5 billion. We increased PAXLOVID by 2, which implies that a $500 million compression in someplace else in the business, which is largely Oxbryta. We're absorbing the Oxbryta headwind and maintaining our 9% to 11% growth rate in our non-COVID business, which actually implies that our baseline business is actually performing quite well. Albert Bourla : And I want to remind that the non-COVID business was 14% growth this quarter. Then Mikael? Mikael Dolsten : Yes, on [indiscernible], which was previously called 601, yes, I\u2019m encouraged about that opportunity. And of course, we try here to incorporate learnings, how \u2013 which price was developed to our advantage. As you know, that drive was already approved 2019 when we did acquisition a bit later and with several programs already up and running. 601 by itself is at a 10-fold lower dose, it has more potency and brings more improvement for hemolytic anemia as one example. So this part has performed very well in our Phase II and looked really nice in tolerability. So I [indiscernible] about that one. When I speak about higher learnings, Oxbryta was performed in the more recent studies in a part of the world where it\u2019s really difficult to do the type of high-quality, consistent to clinical trials. And as we investigating some of those learnings with Oxbryta, we have, as a countermeasure, focus [indiscernible] entirely on high-performance sites that have a history of delivering great drug development. And this will obviously also support a profile. So I\u2019m optimistic. And as there\u2019s final end here. Please remember that when we did a GPT deal, our eyes were really on [indiscernible] up to 80% of the value of the deal. But Oxbryta allowed early entrants into the market, and we\u2019ll continue to investigate Oxbryta and keep you updated, what we learned. Operator : We'll take our next question from Dave Risinger with Leerink Partners. Dave Risinger : And thanks for taking all these questions today. So my first question relates to cost cutting ahead. Obviously, the company has already engaged in significant SG&A and R&D efficiency initiatives. But I'm curious about whether management sees opportunities for further SG&A and R&D reductions? And then with respect to the over 30 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine candidate in preclinical development. Given management's prior statements about it's R&D initiatives, I'm assuming that, that will be adjuvanted and I just wanted to confirm that? Albert Bourla : Let's take quickly, although that savings domain, the satin R&D. We did significant reductions and we were very careful to make them in a way that will not affect our pipeline and will not affect our business. So we are very happy with what has happened. Now are we going to not continue being efficient? Of course, we will. I think I see tremendous opportunities ahead of us that we can reduce some of the less ROI-driven investment that we are doing, both in R&D and SI&A. And part of that will be, of course, invested in more productive with a trend to be able to control the cost and absorb our cost inflation. So you should see a constant, very cost focused, very cost-conscious counsel as we move on. Now Mikael, on the 30 valent. Mikael Dolsten : Yes. Thank you for tying the question. And I think we really have been breaking new ground in our PCV technology platforms. And we\u2019re obviously very pleased to get some of our new technologies validated with the serotype 3 that you heard about in the [indiscernible] generation, the 25 [indiscernible]. The components that allows us to go far beyond 30 includes very sophisticated new type of chemistry that on certain hyper serotypes can give several fold improvement in titer. There are minor or more substantial formulation changes that can give some to quite significant fold increase and that may or may not include adjuvants and I also experienced that we\u2019re gaining on the use of carriers that we haven\u2019t been working on in PCV that can add to this tool book. So we are right now bringing all of these data together. And while we see we ran a lot with adjuvant as seen in our CDP program that allow us to go from 3 to 2, and we have a toolbox of new adjuvants, where it really will be necessary or not, it\u2019s too early to tell, but I acknowledge your good skills in the vaccine technology, and we keep you updated as we get closer to selecting candidates. Operator : We'll take our next question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Chris Schott : Just two quick ones here. Just first on margin structure and following up on the prior question. Is a mid- to high 30% adjusted kind of operating margin -- adjusted for COMIRNATY are still fair for Pfizer? And what's the rough time line to get there? And then my second question was just on the vepdegestrant Max franchise. Obviously, a very strong year this year. But as [indiscernible] out to next year, we've got the Part D redesign, we've got incremental competition. Is there still enough volume opportunity here to think about this as a franchise that's going to be generating healthy growth? Or should we think about growth slowing significantly going forward? Albert Bourla : [indiscernible] you start. Dave Denton : So first, obviously, mid- to high 30s is very much within the realm of our business model. We're very focused against that. We continue to march and make progress against that over time. So we don't have a specific date for at this point in time. But as we continue to progress, both this year and we give guidance for next year, I'm sure you should see us completely progress on that front. Albert Bourla : And I think COMIRNATY was also a little bit the question. Dave Denton : Yes. Well, I think COMIRNATY obviously, is a down draft to that. So obviously, adjusted for the size of that business will be important. But having said that, we continue to make investments in our business such that we're more productive, top to bottom, therefore, expanding our operating margin profile of the company. Albert Bourla : And we don't want to speak for specific products, the markets, right, because it's a little bit misleading. It depends on multiple things. We did it because of the extraordinary circumstances in '22. But in general, you all know that from 2 products, PAXLOVID is very, very high margin and COMIRNATY is on the low. [indiscernible], why don't we start international this time and then we end up with a mirror on [indiscernible] the redesign. Chris Schott : Okay. So on the international, we had a very strong year, and we continue to grow very strongly this quarter at 31%. Actually, our total patients on [indiscernible] have increased by 14% in the third quarter versus the second quarter. So this is a straight [indiscernible] that we are growing, and we continue to add new patients on treatment. This is essentially the result of 3 things. One, the average of [indiscernible] as the standard of care pretty much in all the countries where we operate. Two, the establishment of a robust infrastructure of care, which can enable the faster diagnosis and treatment of this complex disease. So this is a complex disease, and finding those patients takes time. And now we have a [indiscernible]. And the third element is also, of course, the increased access. Today, we have 45 countries where we have reimbursements. And we just recently had in this quarter, 2 countries, the U.K. and Australia, so 2 significant countries, that have started to reimburse in that [indiscernible]. So moving forward, we really see that those 3 elements will continue to deliver and drive growth in the key international markets. And if you look at the treatment rates, in our major international market, we still see some potential to increase that diverse. So that will be the drivers of growth in the next flowing quarters. Albert Bourla : I mean so Chris, in the U.S., I'll give you a little bit of color. Obviously, Vinda had very strong growth this year. And I think a big part of that has been just a direct result of the commercial effort and attention that we've put on it where we've seen real growth in the diagnosis rate and new patient starts. So new patient starts are up about 61% versus last year. And they're up about 3% quarter-over-quarter as well, and we're also improving compliance rates significantly with existing patients. For the market, there's a lot of patients, nearly half that remain diagnosed. So there's significant opportunity there. We will have tailwinds as we go forward. So we continue to put attention on this, and that's going to be largely increased diagnosis education, the prescriber rate that we're growing as well as affordability conditions and we've turned the page into 2025. But we do think that the volume growth will be at meaningfully lower levels than what we've seen year-to-date. And a big part of that is obviously headwinds we're going to see from the changing market landscape, where we will have new competitive entrants that will impact new patient starts as well as potential switching of existing patients onto some of these options. So those are some of the puts and takes on Vinda. IRA will be a piece of that as well as Dave mentioned, and we'll have more to share about '25 specifics when we give guidance. Operator : We'll take our last question from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Mohit Bansal : And first of all, congrats on a phenomenal hire in [indiscernible]. So maybe like taking the step back, can you comment something about ABRYSVO if there was any stocking this quarter? This particular market is a lot of like stocking driven in fourth and first quarter. So how you are thinking about that? It looks like from the IQVIA trends, price -- line price jumped a lot. So if you could help us understand what is going on there? And how should we think about this particular product in coming quarters? Albert Bourla : Which product is Mohit? Unknown Executive ABRYSVO. [indiscernible] Albert Bourla : So a few comments on ABRYSVO. So we wanted to, as I mentioned before, really start this vaccination season with ABRYSVO in fridges. And retailers, predominantly where volume is as well as with health systems. So we work with our customers and our channel partners to make sure that we were appropriately stocked and that's reflected in our Q3 numbers. Now what we have also seen over the course of Q3 is that administration volumes. And for ABRYSVO, that began in August, over the course of the quarter have continued to steadily rise. Now they are at lower volumes than from a market perspective, where they were last year. Lots of reasons for that, including timing of the COVID vaccines as well as the change in the ACE recommendation. But we anticipate that there will be volumes that continue into the fourth quarter. And finally, our results are also a function of what Albert mentioned is our significant improvement in market share. So we've doubled our market share into end customers from wholesalers and our market share of actual shots in arms of administrations in the retail setting in the middle of October was at 43%. So those are all the dynamics that are going into play for ABRYSVO performance in Q3 and heading into Q4. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Amir, and thank you, everyone, for your attention. It was another good quarter for Pfizer. I think we are continuing to execute the 5 points plan, but we have presented at the beginning of the year. There is an underlying operational health of our business, there is stabilization of the COVID business tool. Now we feel comfortable to [indiscernible] and we have seen strong growth from the remaining part of the business. We have seen strong performance from new products. Most of them, they have beaten analyst expectations this quarter, which shows that they are doing better at me than what was perceived they will do. And we are looking forward to continuing this path of executing and creating shareholder value. Thank you for your interest in Pfizer and you have a wonderful. Operator : That concludes today's call.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer and Senior Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am. Francesca DeMartino : Good morning, and welcome to Pfizer's earnings call. I'm Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer. On behalf of the Pfizer team, thank you for joining us. This call is being made available via audio webcast at pfizer.com. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2024 via a press release that is available on our website at pfizer.com. I'm joined today by Dr. Albert Bourla, our Chairman and CEO; and Dave Denton, our CFO. Albert and Dave have some prepared remarks, and we will then open the call for questions. Members of our leadership team will be available for the Q&A session. Before we get started, I want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements and discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. I encourage you to read the disclaimers in our slide presentation, the press release we issued this morning and the disclosures in our SEC filings, which are all available on the IR website at pfizer.com. Forward-looking statements on the call are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, speak only as of the call's original date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of the statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Albert. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much, Francesca. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. 2024 was a strong year of execution and performance for Pfizer. We were guided by clear strategic priorities, and we met or exceeded our goals for each one, while also delivering on our financial commitments. I'm pleased with the progress we made in executing transformative changes that strengthen our company. First, we successfully integrated the Seagen business, one of the largest investments we have made in the past decade, creating one of the best oncology companies in the industry. At the start of 2024, we split our commercial operations into two divisions, U.S. and international, and appointed two senior commercial leaders to increase focus in both. Aamir Malik and Alexandre de Germay have done a tremendous job to upgrade our commercial capabilities. They consolidated our external agencies down to one powerhouse global advertising company and leverage the power of AI to transform our marketing and selling engine. New data-driven deployment of our commercial and medical field resources, precision micro-targeting in social media and elevation of the Pfizer brand and commercial communications are some of the strategies that have significantly increased our commercial and medical effectiveness and the returns on investments. We are seeing the impact of these actions in our strong financial performance and in the recognition of our market leaders. We earned the top position in the 2024 IQVIA U.S. Field Force Ranking report and improved our ranking to claim #1 or #2 spot in 70% of the specialties in which we focus. I'm also proud of our strong year of pipeline progress in 2024, including more than a dozen approvals, seven pivotal study starts and eight key Phase 3 readouts. I'm very excited with the changes in our R&D engine under its new leaders. Chris Boshoff moved fast to create four end-to-end R&D units focused on oncology, vaccines, internal medicine and inflammation and immunology. This structure fully empowers research units that can operate with a focus and agility of a biotech company, while tapping into our differentiated enterprise-wide capabilities such as AI-powered drug discovery and development. Our focus on financial discipline also has yielded good results. We ended the year with expanded margins after a series of actions to realign our cost base. And we strategically deployed capital to enhance shareholder value, investing nearly $11 billion in support of internal R&D programs, de-levering by $7.8 billion and returning $9.5 billion directly to shareholders through our dividends. Finally, we also reinforced our commitment to strong governance. Our two new Board members bring deep expertise in financial markets and shareholder value creation. All these changes have created a strong foundation and allow us to start the new year from a position of strength. So now let me speak about our 2025 priorities. Last year, we had a significant emphasis on improving our commercial effectiveness. In 2025, the emphasis will move to improving R&D productivity, while maintaining focus on margin expansion, commercial excellence and shareholder lending capital allocation. Let me start with R&D. Across our pipeline, we believe we have a strong year of catalysts ahead of us and expect our new R&D organization to achieve multiple key milestones, including the possibility of at least four regulatory decisions, up to nine potential Phase 3 readouts and 13 potential pivotal program starts. For example, with atirmociclib, our next generation highly selective CDK4 inhibitor candidate, yesterday, we dosed our first patient in a Phase 3 study in first-line metastatic breast cancer. We also anticipate starting an additional first-line study in combination with vepdegestrant, the ER degrader we are codeveloping with Arvinas. Our ADC sigvotatug vedotin continues its Phase 3 study in second-line non-small cell and cancer. And this year, we expect to start a Phase 3 study in first-line non-small cell lung cancer. Our PDL1 ADC candida, a potential first-in-class PD-L1 targeting vedotin ADC, is expected to begin 2 Phase 3 studies this year, one in first-line metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and one in second-line-plus non-small cell lung cancer where the unmet need is significant. We have a robust clinical development program aimed at expanding are indications in multiple myeloma, and this year, we anticipate the readout of a Phase 3 study in double class exposed relapsed refractory multiple myeloma, that, if successful and approved, will triple the addressable population versus the currently approved indication. In vaccines, we expect to start the Phase 3 study this year for our PCV-25 candidate covering 25 serotypes. This is important foundational work that could help us bridge to and accelerate progress with our fifth generation PCV candidate covering more than 30 serotypes. This year, we also expect to start a Phase 3 study for our C. diff vaccine candy. In internal medicines, we remain on track to provide an upgrade of our dose optimization studies of danuglipron in the first quarter of this year. For ponsegromab, we expect to start a pivotal study this year in cancer caked ibuzatrelvir, our second-generation COVID-19 oral antiviral candidate, continues its Phase 3 study. Within I&I, we continue to progress a portfolio of medicines that include two potential first-in-class tri-specific antibodies currently in Phase 2. Now let's discuss our commercial strategy. 2024 was a strong year of commercial execution and we are pleased with our progress in improving performance of our newly launched products and gaining and maintaining market share for several of our core brands. I will start by highlighting the strength and impact of our oncology portfolio. Padcev plus pembrolizumab is an important growth driver as it has already become the #1 prescribed first-line treatment for locally advanced metastatic urothelial cancer in the U.S. We are expecting potential registrational interim data this year from ongoing pivotal studies in muscle invasive bladder cancer, which if successful and approved, would nearly triple the total addressable patients in the U.S. Braftovi/Mektovi achieved a 27% year-over-year worldwide operational growth and expanded its leadership position in multiple BRAF tumors, which are some of the hardest to treat cancer. Yesterday, we announced that BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab mFOLFOX6 showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with BRAF V600E mutation. We are very excited with the robust improvement in PFS and OS and are looking forward to presenting this data in a scientific conference. Lorbrena, a treatment for adults with ALK-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, achieved 37% worldwide year-over-year operational growth and is emerging as a potential standard of care in the first-line setting. Following last June's unprecedented CROWN trial data showing 60% of patients were alive without disease progression after five years, Lorbrena has seen a double-digit share increase in the first line in both new patient starts and new prescribers. ELREXFIO had a strong performance in 2024 with more than $130 million in full-year revenue and increasing overall share within the class of BCMA directed bispecific antibodies for patients with triple class-exposed relapse or refractory multiple myeloma in the United States. I also want to comment about our COVID-19 portfolio. We continue to see stabilizing patterns in the disease burden with a strong correlation between the COVID-19 burden of disease and Paxlovid utilization. We see the same stabilizing patterns in U.S. vaccination rates at relatively low levels. Our assumptions for 2025 are on par with this 2023 and 2024 patterns. And with the multi-year contracts we have secured in international markets, we are confident that our COVID-19 portfolio will continue to be a predictable and durable contributor to our business. In another key category, our Vyndaqel family of products achieved continuing momentum with 90% year-over-year growth in the U.S. and 32% operational growth in international markets. We drove progress in diagnosing more patients and improving access to this treatment from -- for transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy. Eliquis is a core brand for Pfizer with 10% worldwide year-over-year operational growth. It is prescribed to millions of patients and we continue to strengthen its leadership position in a growing oral anticoagulant market. We are also pleased with the ongoing positive momentum for Nurtec with 36% worldwide year-over-year operational growth, driven by strong commercial execution. Nurtec is a leader in the oral CGRP class used for treating and preventing migraine with about 49% market share, and we see opportunities for continued growth. Our respiratory vaccines, Abrysvo and Prevnar 20, also are key products in our commercial portfolio. We have achieved a market leadership position for the season in shipped doses for Abrysvo with an approximately 13 percentage points increase in market share, and remain confident in our ability to retain our position through strong commercial execution even as we see a decrease in the total adult RSV market volume, driven by a reduction in vaccination rates in the U.S. for the older adult indication. [Indiscernible] positive momentum in key regions such as Europe and Latin America and are also seeing a strong demand for our maternal indication. Abrysvo's season-to-date cumulative maternal vaccination rate nearly tripled compared to last season. With Prevnar, we are confident that we are well positioned for strong sustained leadership with over 87% market share in the U.S. across indications. Globally, the pediatric market accounts for approximately 2/3 of our Prevnar revenues, and we also continue to make progress for the adult indication in key international markets. We are encouraged by opportunities to maintain our leadership in the PCV space with our next-generation PCV-25 candidate mentioned earlier. In Phase 1, we demonstrated potentially improving immunogenicity for serotype 3, one of the largest contributors of disease at approximately 20% of invasive disease in adults aged 65 and older in the United States and Europe. Across our commercial portfolio in 2025, we are confident that we are in a strong position to build in our 2024 success and achieve commercial excellence in our key categories of oncology, cardiovascular, migraine, vaccines and I&I. With that, I will turn it over to Dave. Dave Denton : Thank you, Albert, and good morning, everyone. I'll build on Albert's comments by reinforcing that we are very pleased with the financial results for both the fourth quarter as well as the full-year of 2024. These results demonstrate that our focus and execution against our strategic priorities are driving both positive patient outcomes as well as financial and operational strength. In addition to our strong top line performance, our cost reduction programs are creating a more efficient organization, driving operating margin improvement. And as we move into 2025, these efforts will continue to lay the groundwork for potential increased capital returns and reinforce our commitment to maintaining and growing our dividend while enhancing long-term shareholder value. With that said, let me start with our full-year and fourth quarter results, then I'll touch on our capital allocation priorities. I'll finish up with a few comments on our 2025 guidance, which we are reaffirming today, and our near-term expectations that will continue to drive our growth potential in the latter half of the decade. For the full-year of 2024, we recorded revenues of $63.6 billion versus $59.6 billion last year. Importantly, our operational revenue growth when excluding contributions from our COVID products was 12%, exceeding our expectations of 9% to 11%. Full year 2024 adjusted gross margins expanded to 74% as we continued to drive cost improvements across our manufacturing network. On the bottom line, we reported full year 2024 diluted EPS of $1.41 versus $0.37 last year, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.11 versus $1.84 last year, significantly ahead of expectations due to our overall strong P&L performance. Now turning to the fourth quarter performance versus the same period of LOI, let me walk down the P&L. Total company revenues were $17.8 billion versus $14.6 billion in the fourth quarter of last year. Once again, our non-COVID-19 products exhibited robust performance with revenues of $13.7 billion reflecting 11% operational year-over-year growth. This performance continues to show that our refined commercial approach is working. We continue to focus on key products and geographies. We've refined how we allocate our commercial field resources globally. And we're further optimizing our marketing resources into key priority areas. We saw strong contributions across our product portfolio, primarily driven by the Vyndaqel family, Padcev, Eliquis and Nurtec, partially offset by declines in ABRYSVO and XELJANZ. Adjusted gross margin in the fourth quarter was approximately 68%, primarily the result of a net unfavorable mix related to our COVID-19 products, primarily due to the Comirnaty profit split with BioNTech and applicable royalty expenses. This was partially offset by our ongoing focus on cost management across our manufacturing network, as I previously mentioned. And as we previously communicated, long-term improvements in gross margin will remain a key focus for the company over the next few years. We expect to begin to achieve initial savings from Phase 1 of our manufacturing optimization program in the latter part of 2025 and continue to expect approximately $1.5 billion in savings from this first phase by the end of 2027. We continue to evaluate other strategies to improve our network structure and as well as our product portfolio. And we plan to share more information on those components of the program once it becomes available. Total adjusted operating expenses are essentially flat operationally at $7.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024. And I will note that this amount includes spending acquired via our Seagen transaction. Looking at the components specifically, adjusted SI&A expenses decreased 4% operationally, driven primarily by a decrease in marketing and promotional spend for various products, including both commodity Comirnaty and Paxlovid, partially offset by an increase in spending for certain oncology and recently launched and acquired products. Adjusted R&D expenses increased 8% operationally, driven primarily by net increase in spending, mainly to develop certain product candidates acquired from Seagen, partially offset by lower spending on certain ongoing vaccine programs and certainly as a result of our cost realignment program. We continue to be disciplined with our operational expense management and delivered on our goal of at least $4 billion in net cost savings from our cost realignment program. Q4 reported diluted earnings per share was $0.07, and our adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.63, benefiting from our top line performance as well as our efficient operating structure, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate driven primarily by jurisdictional mix. In support of our goal to enhance R&D productivity and to focus on high-impact medicines, our fourth quarter GAAP results reflect strategic decisions in our development plans and updated long-range revenue forecasts for several medicines. And as a result, we recorded approximately $2.9 billion in noncash intangible asset impairments related to several medicines in development as well as several in-line products. These decisions reinforce our focus on future growth as well as innovation. Now let me quickly touch upon our capital allocation strategy, which is designed to enhance long-term shareholder value. Our strategy consists of maintaining and growing our dividend over time, reinvesting in our business at an appropriate level of financial return, and finally making value-enhancing share repurchases after delevering our balance sheet. In 2024, we returned $9.5 billion to shareholders via our quarterly dividend, invested $10.8 billion in internal R&D, and as expected, completed business development activity was minimal. Our commitment to delevering our capital structure to a gross leverage target of 3.25x by the end of 2025 remains a key priority. In support of that goal, in 2024, we delevered by approximately $7.8 billion, paying down approximately $2.3 billion in maturing debt and approximately $5.5 billion in commercial paper. And in January of '25, we monetized another tranche of our Haleon shares, which for reporting purposes is a Q1 '25 event. We received approximately $3 billion in net cash proceeds, and now our ownership in Haleon was reduced from approximately 15% to approximately 7%. We intend to monetize our remaining Haleon investment in a prudent fashion during 2025. Overall, in Q4, we generated robust operating cash flows which combined with the most recent Haleon net sales proceeds of approximately $3 billion, resulted in significant free cash flow generation as we enter 2025. Our objective remains to delever and return to a more balanced allocation of capital between reinvestments and direct return to shareholders over time. Given we issued our full year 2025 financial guidance on December 17, let me just hit a few highlights. We expect total company full year '25 revenues to be in the range of $61 billion to $64 billion and full year '25 adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.80 to $3 a share, which reflects our expectation of strong contributions across our product portfolio as well as our focus on disciplined cost management. Importantly, we believe the steps taken to right size our cost base will put us on a strong footing towards increased operational efficiency and support our goal to return to pre-pandemic operating margins. In further support of this initiative, we now expect to deliver overall net savings of $4.5 billion from our ongoing cost realignment programs by the end of 2025, while continuing to advance programs that will improve cost of goods sold in the years to come. As a reminder, the impact of the IRA Medicare Part D redesign is expected to be a net headwind to the company's revenue of approximately $1 billion across our product portfolio, dampening growth by approximately 1.6% versus 2024. The impact of catastrophic coverage is expected to exceed the potential volume benefit from the reduction of the patient out-of-pocket cap, leading to a negative impact beginning in early in the year, while the positive impact of lower patient out-of-pocket costs is expected to build throughout this year. As the IRA is felt more acutely in higher-priced medicines, we expect Vyndaqel, Ibrance, Xtandi and Xeljanz to reach catastrophic coverage much earlier in the year. And due to these changes, we expect a higher gross to net impact on our revenues for all drugs in the beginning of 2025 that is expected to moderate throughout the remainder of the year when compared to 2024. And lastly, I will mention that we continue to monitor currency fluctuation as the year progresses. So in closing, let me just emphasize several key aspects of our business. We believe our financial targets for 2025 are both reasonable and achievable, reinforcing our commitment to operational excellence. We also believe our revenue volatility is largely in the past as COVID-related uncertainties have diminished. Additionally, our cost improvement programs have set the stage for ongoing margin expansion. We will continue our focus and execution to maximize the commercial value of our product portfolio. And our new R&D leadership is committed to driving value-creating innovation and strengthening our pipeline. And lastly, we have a clear path to reloading our balance sheet, enabling enhanced capital deployment in pursuit of additional opportunities to strengthen our business and create value for our shareholders. We are dedicated to maintaining and growing our dividend and meeting our delevering targets by the end of 2025, providing for a more balanced capital allocation. And with that, I'll turn it back to Albert to start the Q&A session. Albert Bourla : Yes. Thank you, David. But before we turn to the questions, I would like to close the year with one comment. Pfizer knows how to execute well when we set our focus on something. We saw what we could do in 2020 when we rapidly developed and prepared to manufacture billions of doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, in '21 when we repeated the same with Paxlovid, and in 2022 when, with successful commercialization, we exceeded $100 billion in full year revenue. In 2023, despite the difficulties with the rebased COVID-19 expectations, we invested in our future with a big bet in oncology with the acquisition of Seagen. And last year, we exceeded expectations repeatedly with four consecutive quarters of strong financial performance from our disciplined commercial execution. Now as we are directing similar focus and our proven ability to execute on our R&D pipeline, we are confident that we are well positioned to drive meaningfully improved productivity. And with that, operator, please assemble the queue. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We'll go first to Steve Scala with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Steve Scala : Thank you so much. I have two questions. First, on the danuglipron dose optimization data, it's apparently still on track for the first quarter of this year. What is the range of possible outcomes? And is dropping this version of the compound a possibility? And what would be the next step? Second question is, Chris Boshoff, I assume he's on the line. Under the heading of nothing is perfect, can you share with us two or three things in the Pfizer R&D portfolio or system that you think need to be fixed? New leaders usually say they want to move quicker, but sometimes they also thoroughly go through the portfolio and shed many projects. Is that also a possibility? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Chris? Chris Boshoff : So we start with danu. So for danu, just to be clear, we and as we stated previously, we're now targeting first quarter to have data from the ongoing dose optimization and formulation study, the PK study, and we're on track to deliver that in Q1. And we haven't seen the data yet, but obviously, that data will then determine decisions for the future of danuglipron. On your second question, as we've recently announced, we already focused our portfolio further. We've now established four end-to-end therapeutic areas : oncology, vaccines, internal medicine and I&I. And part of that will be to focus on those opportunities that could provide the biggest value both for patients but also for Pfizer. So you will see during the coming months how we further focus and execute and accelerate those medicines, we believe, could be potential future blockbusters. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Chris. And Steve, you're right, usually new leaders are taking their time to assess. But the good news with Chris is that he knew really the Pfizer organization. And I'm very impressed with the speed and thoughtfulness that he's deploying his changes. Already he announced the new organizations that selected a lot of leaders, and refocused our pipeline in collaboration with Andrew Baum. So next question, please. Operator : We'll go ahead next to Geoff Meacham with Citibank. Please go ahead. Geoff Meacham : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. Just had a couple of quick ones. So for the COVID franchise, you guys talked about stabilizing revenue for this year. Maybe just give us some level of conviction and your level of investments in this business kind of going forward. I think most investors kind of would like for it to kind of be viewed as just maybe upside to the story. And then from a capital allocation perspective, when you guys think about the appetite for potential BD, as you reprioritize or look at the pipeline and evaluate a lot of the assets and say early to mid-development, just want to get a sense from you guys for the appetite for growing out the number of TAs, if you had more optimization to do that can be achieved through BD. Thank you very much. Albert Bourla : Aamir? Aamir Malik : So Geoff, on COVID, maybe I'll start with Paxlovid. You saw Albert describe; we have multiple years now of reference where Paxlovid utilization tracks directly to the level of disease outbreak. And the year 2024 was no different. So we know that to be the case. And we've also put in place a very effective commercial model in Paxlovid that allows us to deliver on that and continue to improve. In fact, if you look at 2024, we had higher physician treatment rates than '23 and we also had gains in market share versus '23. So we know we have a model that works. And with regards to resource allocation, we have targeted our resource modeling for Paxlovid so that we are investing the places where it's relevant when it's relevant. So we have a very, very tailored model. And I think you see that in the results. We had a very big summer and early fall wave of COVID in '24. And then we had a milder and shorter winter wave. And you see that reflected in Paxlovid utilization. And we've also ensured that we have the right pricing model in place and put in place a new agreement with the U.S. government on our Paxlovid contract that defines the eligibility for the USG pack going forward. So there is clarity on that for January, February and going into March. And with regards to vaccinations on Comirnaty, again, we saw a pattern in '24 that very closely mirrored '23. So vaccination rates were quite stable. Again, here, we also saw an improvement in our market share position for Comirnaty, and we are confident that our commercial execution both with regards to the retail setting and the non-retail setting will continue to put us in good stead as we move forward. Albert Bourla : Thank you. And of course, in international, the same time here, we have contracts with our multi-year contracts that they are covering not only this year, but the year after. So all of that makes us feel that this is a very stable and predictable revenue stream. Why don't we go to capital allocation and then, Dave, maybe also, Andrew, you can comment on the BD. Dave Denton : So just, Albert, I'll be real quick. From a capital allocation perspective, I'm very pleased with the company's cash flow generation throughout 2024 as we've continued to enhance our cash flow yield, number one; number two, continue to aggressively de-lever. And now as we enter 2025, we'll be in a position from a cash and a de-levering perspective to have a more balanced capital allocation strategy, allowing us to do a slightly bigger business development programs if so desired in 2025. And with that, maybe I'll pass it over to Andrew to give some context around how we're thinking about that. Andrew Baum : Yes. So to recap what Chris says, we have narrowed our current therapeutic areas to four, so oncology, vaccines, I&I and internal medicine. Now it's fair to say that those are fairly broad areas, they are big buckets that you can put lots of therapeutic indications in. If we were to explore adjacencies or indeed, therapeutic areas where historically Pfizer hasn't been active. I think, firstly, we'll be looking for truly breakthrough science that's tractable with a drug. Second, an unmet medical need that we feel that can be monetized. And thirdly and most importantly, we have to have the talent with it in order to develop those assets if we go into a therapeutic area that is one that is unfamiliar to us or we don't have historically that backward of talent. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much, Andrew and Dave. Next question, please. Operator : We'll go next to Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks so much. Just two questions for me. Just coming back to capital deployment. Dave, just to build on those comments, you talked about slightly larger BD transactions. Can you just help size the range of what Pfizer is able to look at from here and how you think about balancing business development versus share repo, which I think you talked about as you started to de-lever would be part of the story? The second is on the RSV market. Can you talk a little bit about the thinking on the size of the opportunity from here and the potential for growth, given some of the 2024 results, both the U.S. as well as globally? Thank you. Dave Denton : Yes. So as far as capital deployment goes, Chris, I think the good news is the company has a very robust cash flow generation capabilities. And over time, we'll be able to do both dividends as well as BD as well as value-enhancing share repurchases. Specifically, as we come into 2025, given the strength of the company from a cash flow perspective, we have the capacity in the $10 billion to $15 billion ZIP code from a business development perspective within 2025 if we chose to focus in that area. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Aamir and Alexandre, the RSV? Aamir Malik : Very quickly, in the U.S., firstly, the market did decrease in 2024, and that's something that we have been signaling for quite some time. This was because of ships in ACIP as well as the early adopters of the vaccine in 2023. The important thing for us, the things that we can control, the strength of our commercial execution led us to the leading market share of doses shipped to end-customers at 50% for 2024, and an improvement in the shots in arms market share by 18 percentage points versus last year. And our maternal indication also performed very well, tripling the uptake from last season. Now as we look forward, in the absence of any major policy or ACIP change in '25, the RSV market without that is likely not to grow, but there are a lot of catalysts for mid-term growth. One is any policy updates to year round vaccination. Second, age expansion for 18 to 59-year-olds that are at risk, where we have great data, as well as potential revaccination recommendations as data becomes more available. So those are midterm growth catalysts. And in the meantime, we remain confident in our ability to execute as that evolves. Alexandre de Germay : So on the international front, Chris, what we see in this quarter is the beginning of the financial impact of the work we've done in approving and getting through the BTC and the payers for Abrysvo. And in the countries where we received positive BTC and got reimbursement, we start to see great execution working hand-in-hand with the authority in ACIP. Let me give you two examples in marginal immunization. So in the U.K. after winning the exclusive tender, healthcare professionals vaccinated with Abrysvo over 60% of the eligible pregnant women in just one quarter in Q4. In France, in competitive setting, Abrysvo was administered to over 40% of the eligible pregnant women in the Q4 alone. So clearly, we see a potential as we move into 2025 in the MI, great opportunity to expand usage and to expand the vaccination. And of course, that is not just in the developed market, but also in emerging markets. And for instance, as you know, Abrysvo was listed at the Pan-America Health Organization. And so starting this year, we can have Latin American country to start contracting Abrysvo. Now in the OA, we start also to see some traction and the vaccination campaign in the U.K. already reached 44% of the eligible population and regional vaccination was granted late 2024 in about half of the German population and we're expecting to get a full German population access in Q1 2025. So again, on both maternal immunization and order adults, plenty of opportunity to grow. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : We'll go next to Vamil Divan with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Vamil Divan : Yes, great. Thanks for taking my questions. So maybe a couple if I could on the pipeline. So Prevnar 25-valent you mentioned starting Phase 3 in adults this year. Just curious if you can comment on what you've seen so far gives you comfort in moving up for when we might see the data publicly. And also any updates on the pediatric population and when you -- where things stand there. And then the second one is on Ponsegromab. And just you have the, obviously, cancer cachexia, which you're starting Phase 3, we also noticed in the Phase 2 heart failure program, you increased the patient enrollment significantly there. Just curious if you can provide any perspective on what drove that change and just maybe your broader views on the heart failure rate opportunity for that product? Thanks. Albert Bourla : Chris? Chris Boshoff : So first all, PCV-25, as Albert mentioned, this is an ongoing Phase 2 study with a potential best-in-class vaccine. The Phase 2 study is ongoing in both adults and in pediatrics. As we've mentioned earlier, Serotype 3 is very important and is emerging as a very important serotype with up to 20% to 30% of the population actually developed serotype 3. So we're very pleased that we're now seeing what looks like best-in-class immunogenicity against serotype 3. On the pediatric front, as you mentioned, the study is ongoing. So we hope to provide additional data later this year. But everything we've seen so far suggests to us that we've got improved immunogenicity of PCV-25 versus our current vaccine. Just a reminder as well, we do have a fifth generation vaccine 30-plus, that's also now in preclinical development that we hope to launch in Phase I later this year. On ponsegromab, very quickly, we're excited about the data for cancer cachexia. And the cancer cachexia study should start later this year in a Phase III experience. And we stopped the development of the cardiovascular study. Albert Bourla : Thank you. And I want to also emphasize that the development strategy on PCV-30 plus involves the development of PCV-25, so refined strategy, which is development and regulatory, that will allow us to accelerate 30-plus by investing now in 25, which will come earlier, of course, to the market. And I think there was a question also on the penetration of PCV. But right now, both pediatric and adult, we have very, very high market share. We reported actually 87% market share. Next question, please. Operator : We'll go next to Courtney Breen with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Courtney Breen : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my call today. And thanks for the details on kind of how you're thinking about the R&D organization. Just a clarifier, and perhaps you can help us understand the strategy a little bit more here. It sounds like you're shifting into four R&D organizations. I also heard reference though to end-to-end area. So can you talk about whether these are similar or different to how oncology was set up earlier this year -- earlier last year? And then additionally, can you talk a little bit about how you're allocating investment across R&D across those four separate engines? How are you making sure that the bar is high in all of those different therapeutic areas and ensuring you've got the right prioritization given the independence of these units? Albert Bourla : Thank you. That's a great question. So Chris, start, and then Andrew can chime in. Chris Boshoff : Yes. So thank you very much for the question. So for oncology, as you stated, since the beginning of 2023, we had an end-to-end organization covering discovery, early-stage development, late-stage development as well as medical. And we already had that in vaccine since 2009. And now we build the same structure for I&I and internal medicine. So essentially, all four of those will be end-to-end organizations, for quicker decision-making and quicker handover between discovery, Phase 1, and then from early development into late-phase development. Andrew, regarding the... Andrew Baum : Yes, Courtney, you hit up on a critical question. So historically, when you look back, there's no shortage of first-in-class breakthrough molecules that we've successfully shepherded through development. However, some of those really have not delivered in terms of financial revenues, and therefore, to shareholders. And the key issue is really ensuring that we have successful portfolio prioritization, bringing that commercial lens to much earlier during the process and having estimates that are derived in an unbiased way and a dynamic and subject to continued revision. So in my role as chair with the PMT since I joined Pfizer partnering with Chris, we have been working through that pipeline, starting with the late-stage assets, but then moving earlier, to make sure the decisions we make drug by drug, indication by indication are ones that are going to deliver value for shareholders as well as the patients. Albert Bourla : Thank you for the question, Courtney. And I want also to chime in and say that in the R&D organization that we have right now, I think it's very, very, very strong capabilities. And it's proven with the number of approvals. But we have 13, right, last year and even same number in '23. No one even had even close to these numbers. If you see our success rate at 17% compared to 10%, 11% of the industry. Very few that have these success rates. And in time to the market, we are having approximately 5.6 years when most of the industry is in seven, eight years after improvements. However, looking back, I don't think that we necessarily -- we could have done way better in choosing the right products to focus our R&D capabilities, which is, I think, what now, Chris and Andrew, with the commercial assessments, will try to do. The good news is that if it was a question of capabilities to improve R&D productivity, that would be a multiyear undertake. When it is a question of refocusing your investments, that's way more quick. And I'm very optimistic that the results will come out very, very quickly. With that, let's go to the next question. Operator : We'll go next to Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Evan Seigerman : Hi guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. Congrats on all the progress. So given RFK Jr.'s approval by the Senate Finance Committee this morning, can you walk me through how you plan on working with him as a likely head of HHS, especially with his views on vaccines and general skepticism of the pharma industry? Albert Bourla : Yes. I was also informed that the Senate committee voted in favor of him. So I think his confirmation is pretty much secure right now. Of course, we will see what the full Senate will do. Look, I mean, we have with the Trump administration, as the pharma industry, in particular, what's big as Pfizer, have very good relations. Personally, myself, I have a very long-lasting relationship with the President, but was cemented during the Operation Warp Speed when we developed the vaccine for COVID, and I know that the President is very proud of what was able to accomplish, and he has made public statements on that. We met with Mr. Kennedy -- actually, the President introduced me to him and we had dinner offered together, and we tried to understand his view. I focus more not on the things that we clearly disagree, like the vaccines, but on the things that we can agree and we can do things together. And those are things in chronic diseases, in cardiovascular diseases, and more importantly, in cancer, which is something that is very, very high in the mind of the President. And it is also very in the mind of Mr. Kennedy. I met him a few times also after that, and we expect that we will have a collaboration. It's not my -- do I expect that we will agree on everything on vaccines? I don't know. But I think probably, as I hear all the statements that have been done by him and by the administration, he will have a way more tempered view on how to interact with the vaccines. But I don't want to speak about him further. I think there are a lot of opportunities that probably outweigh the risks that we have with the radical change that we will see from the Trump administration, actually, that we are seeing now with the Trump administration. So I'm cautiously optimistic. Now let's move to the next question. Operator : We'll go next to Kripa Devarakonda with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. kripa Devarakonda : Hey guys, thank you so much for taking my question and congratulations on the progress. I have a question on your breast cancer franchise. You recently announced a strategy for developing your CDK4 in frontline -- first-line breast cancer as a monotherapy and also in combination with vepdeg, the ER PROTAC. As the landscape evolves with other CDK4/6 inhibitors, different combinations, how do you see Pfizer's portfolio in breast cancer evolve over the next few years? Do you see this as the strategy is getting a piece of the broader pie? Or are there areas with your CDK4 and your -- with vepdeg where you think you could establish a niche? And also with the Phase III data from vepdeg expected any time in first quarter, what needs to happen with these data for it to be considered competitors? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Chris? Chris Boshoff : Thank you very much. Thank you for the question. We are very fortunate because we've got a lot of optionality now in breast cancer. I'll start with CDK4. We believe this is a best-in-class CDK inhibitor. And what we've seen for compliance and the rate of i.e., specifically treatment-related AEs as well as discontinuations. We are very optimistic that CDK4 could not only replace I brands, but all CDK4/6 inhibitors early-line breast cancer, including first line as well as potentially in the future also in the adjuvant setting. As Albert has mentioned, we are pleased that the first line study is now ongoing, that CDK4, atirmociclib in combination with letrozole. To your point, we also expect the readout for vepdeg in the second-line setting with a derisk study that includes ESR1 population as well as all-comer population. And that medicine potentially could become a replacement for backbone endocrine treatment. We are planning a study in the first-line setting combining Vepdeg plus CDK4 in first-line ER-positive breast cancer. I also just quickly want to mention CDK -- KAT6 because KAT6 is a differentiated epigenetic molecule. This is a first-in-category medicine. You've seen the data, very exciting, very encouraging data in later-line disease. And we're accelerating that also into a registration study with an ongoing Phase 3 trial in second-line-plus ER-positive breast cancer. Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Was there a question also for danu? No, it was not. Okay, good. Let's go now to the next question please. Operator : We'll go next with Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Terence Flynn : Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe two for me on the pipeline. On ELREXFIO first, just on the commercial side, can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of uptake at the academic versus community centers? Are you seeing any broadening out into the community setting? Or is that really going to be contingent on getting some of the earlier line data that you're expecting later this year from the Phase 3 trial? And then on danuglipron, on the dose optimization study, can you just kind of clarify how much data you're going to share later this quarter? Will we get weight loss data? Will we get tolerability data? How much data will be in the initial press release? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Aamir? Aamir Malik : Yes. We're very excited about the momentum on ELREXFIO. We continue to see increase in share in new patient starts quarter-over-quarter, in the class. And the uptick also does include community receptivity and awareness and new account adoptions. And obviously, with the whole slew of trials, assuming they're successful to follow, I think there's a lot of momentum behind ELREXFIO. And over the course of this year, we expect it to grow rapidly, driven primarily by increased demand in our top 100 accounts as well as increased adoption in the community setting, which I think positions ELREXFIO very, very well for the future as we expand indications into earlier lines of therapy in '26 and beyond. Albert Bourla : Thank you. And myself, I was quite impressed with community oncologist uptake of this product as quickly as it happened in the U.S. But also, we have very good news for ELREXFIO in international market. Alexandre? Alexandre de Germay : Yes, indeed ELREXFIO was commercially launched in already six markets in 2024, out of our top 15 markets, quite fast penetration. And of course, in 2025, we are expecting to get an additional 18 markets and four additional of our top 15 markets will launch this year. But the combination of the expand access plus the performance of the brands where we already have introduced the product gives us great confidence for accelerated growth. And to give you a sense, Japan is the second largest market outside of the U.S., and we had a significant and very rapid demand in Japan where ELREXFIO was introduced first to market, BCMA bispecific. And that's -- we've seen an immediate acceleration of utilization actually deep into the community in Japan. And where we've launched with other products, BCMA bispecific, like in the U.K., in Spain, in Italy, or markets where we have demonstrated ELREXFIO leadership, and we expect to continue this leadership position in 2025. So the combination of increased access and where we already introduced the growth expansions, there are two reasons why we believe the product has great potential. Albert Bourla : In general, ELREXFIO because we do think that it is a mega blockbuster, but will become. You need to understand that already in the first year, we had more than $130 million of sales. And this is in a very niche indication. This is triple refractory, which means patients that they have short duration of treatment and they are really failed after everything else that was tried. As we move to -- we have four Phase 3 studies, right? One could read this year. And that not only triples the population, so we go to bigger population, but also expands significant duration of treatment. And the fact it is true as we go to the next line and to the first line. So we think that in the U.S. and international, this product will become a very big oncology product for Pfizer. And with that, let's -- danu, Chris. Chris Boshoff : Yes. Just what we said it earlier, so in Q1, we expect the PK data, we're on target for that. Remember, this is looking at different formulations and will determine the dose selection for once-a-day tablet, for once-a-day approach for a potential taking forward into a registration strategy. Although you mentioned weight loss, weight loss is a secondary endpoint on the study. This is a smaller study. It's an in-unit study. So it may not be that reliable for weight loss from a small number of patients. Albert Bourla : Thanks. Next question? Operator : We'll go next to Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Mohit Bansal : Thank you very much for taking my question. Maybe if you can talk a little bit about Prevnar. How are you seeing Prevnar share? You did talk about the market share here, but in terms of [indiscernible] versus adults, how are you seeing the market share evolving, now that also [indiscernible] has an expansion in the next few years. There is also a lower added eligibility in terms of age. So can you talk a little bit about these dynamics? And how do you see market evolving here? Albert Bourla : All right. Let's start with international and then we go to the U.S. for a change. Alexandre de Germay : Okay. All right. So on Prevnar, as you know, in international, two-third of the business comes from the pediatric indication. And this kind of macro view with our Prevnar pneumococcal vaccine, we have maintained exclusivity in an IP in about 140 markets around the world. So that gives you the sense of the breadth of our pneumococcal vaccine. And as we move over the time, our intention is, of course to replace our Prevnar 13 to our Prevnar 20. So now of course, they are -- now if we go into the details, in emerging markets, we have a very large part of babies every year, so around 76 million new babies. And of course, alongside our great collaboration with The Gavi organization, we have a commercial organizations where we have demonstrated this year a double-digit growth of our Prevnar franchise. So a great execution in emerging markets. Now in the developed markets, following the EMA and the Japan approval, remember in March only of 2024, we've started to gain VTC approval and funding. And where we start to see that, we see that we are recapturing very quickly some of the business that went to competition. So give you an example, in Japan. Prevnar 20, as I said was approved in March. We got the VTC recommendation in October, and our market share in first dose went from 3% in September to 86% in December. So we see that Prevnar 20 gets approved, we really have an opportunity to regain that business. And on the adult side, here, again, we've seen a very strong growth in 2024 that we continue to expect significant growth just because we are expanding access in more mature markets with our Prevnar 20 adults. Albert Bourla : And Aamir, in the U.S.? Aamir Malik : In the U.S., let me start with the adult market. We have, right now, a very strong position in the adult market. Now we are going to face competitive pressure over the course of 2025 from capacity. But we are confident that we will continue to maintain meaningful market share. A lot of that has to do with our commercial execution, as well as the fact that many accounts, particularly nonretail accounts, prefer to stock a single vaccine. So we'll see that evolve over the course of the year. And while we don't think that there's much catch-up opportunity in the 65-plus, we also think there is growth opportunity in the 50 to 64 age group that brings about 30 million adults into the eligible population. So those will be the dynamics in adult. Now in [indiscernible] there again, we have very significant market share. And on the theme of improved market share across all of our vaccines, we saw a 12 percentage point improvement from August to August '23 to December '24 in our pediatric market share. And here, we expect this to be a much more stable market. We plan to retain that kind of leadership share, and we expect volumes to be more stable here. Albert Bourla : Okay, thank you very much. Next question. Operator : We'll go next to Dave Risinger with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. David Risinger : Yes, thanks for introduction. Thanks for all the update. Yes. So my question is just going back to RFK Jr. So assuming he is confirmed as HHS Secretary, and given his history of suing manufacturers and his commentary on lawsuits in the hearings last week, could you just help us understand his ability as HHS Secretary to remove U.S. vaccine liability protections that manufacturers currently benefit from and allow manufacturers the freedom to develop and sell vaccines that save lives? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Yes. Look, I don't want to comment because these are legal issues, but I believe that the liability is through Senate -- through Congress approval. So I don't think anyone can change that without, let's say, Senate approval. I know that that creates a turbulence into the market today and with RFK, it was almost certain that he will get confirmed. And we have engaged with him early enough so that we can mitigate all the issues. If he does the things that he has said in the past, because during the hearings, yes, of course, clearly, he tempered his statements on vaccines. But if he tries to do some of the things that he said in the past, I think that he won't find from the industry -- he will find it from the total medical community and the total scientific community and payers, that they don't want to see a reduction in vaccination because that's a very cost-effective way of controlling health care costs. And more than important, this is not what the Trump administration would like to see, another health crisis. So I would say that I feel cautiously optimistic that they will be very, very prudent with everything they try to do. Let's go to the next question. Operator : We'll go next to Trung Huynh with UBS. Please go ahead. Trung Huynh : Hi guys, thanks for the questions. Just two from me. So firstly, going back to Abrysvo, I think Aamir noted potential policy changes in RSV. So do you have any insight if there's going to be a discussion from ACIP on revaccination or cohort expansion this year? I guess that could be a positive for your guide. And then two, on Padcev's potential registrational muscle invasive bladder cancer trial, in general, I think cystectomy is used to cure patients in this setting. So just wondering how you're going to position this, and how quick could you penetrate this population if approved? Thanks very much. Albert Bourla : Thanks. Very quickly, Aamir, on Abrysvo, and then we go to Chris. Aamir Malik : Yes. What I described, Trung, were the catalysts that could result in market expansion for Abrysvo. Obviously, it's too early and not our place to comment on what exactly ACIP is going to take on it, when. Albert Bourla : And Chris, on Padcev. Chris Boshoff : So thank you for the question. Reminder that this is an event-driven study. So we hope by the end of this year, but if event doesn't happen, we'll move a little bit on. And muscle invasive, about 28,000 population in the U.S. alone, so it could more than double, as we mentioned, triple the population currently eligible. Currently, there's no standard of care treatment other than surgery, cystectomy, for patients considered cisplatin ineligible. So there's two studies, one for cisplatin-eligible and one for cisplatin-ineligible. For the cisplatin-eligible, currently is dominated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy. So there's a real need for both adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment and replace chemotherapy in the setting of cisplatin-eligible disease. And of course, for cisplatin-ineligible disease, it will completely change the future treatment paradigm. So we're very excited if these studies are positive and what we've seen. We've got confidence in these data from earlier studies. So yes. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Next question? Operator : We'll go next to Akash Tewari with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Akash Tewari : Hey, thanks so much. Just on danuglipron, it looks like you're using a bilayer immediate release and matrix technology here. But you don't actually test your bilayer formulation until the second half of your weight loss trial. Is that what your team is waiting on before you make a formal update? Or is it perhaps the Lilly Orforglipron data that's also going to factor into this decision? Thank you. Albert Bourla : I don't think we can disclose the technology. I know that there were speculations into the marketplace, but we haven't disclosed the technology. So I'm not sure we can say much. But Chris, do you want to add anything? Chris Boshoff : No, I don't think we need to add right now. Yes. Albert Bourla : Let's go to the next question. Operator : We'll go next to Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Chris Shibutani : Great, thank you. A quick one on the pipeline and another on business development strategy. On the pipeline, I noticed in Phase 2, you've advanced the GIP antagonist. Is that something that you'll be continuing to share data on, particularly as a monotherapy? And do you have any efforts on going to do a combination? In terms of business development strategy, I think the vocabulary you used included a capacity of perhaps in the $10 billion to $15 billion ZIP code. And I'm curious to know what you're solving for. And I asked this in part because, historically, there had been a view of using cash to acquire $25 billion in revenue by the end of the decade. But now when we think about where we are in this decade, and we think could be solving for structurally, there seem to be approaches sourcing assets from China, for instance. Many of your competitors are doing this. Are you solving for near-term revenues, or are you looking to use other methods, including perhaps partnerships over M&A? That would be helpful. Thank you. Albert Bourla : Yes. Let me start a little bit on the BD, on this one, you can chime in. We had -- very clear about so far, we have acquired $20 billion of [indiscernible] revenues. We are very confident that we will hit this number, very confident. So that's so far, so good on that, right? Looking forward, of course, we are looking at more strategic opportunities right now, which will enhance pipeline in areas that we would like to play rather than near-term revenues on BD. I would ask Andrew to comment, and then if you can speak, Chris, about the antagonist. Andrew Baum : Sure. So hi Chris, nice to hear your voice. So on the BD side, Albert said the keyword, which is strategic. So everything we do will be doing through a strategic lens of building around our core competencies or building competencies in areas that maybe we have not been in previously, if that's what we decide to do. On your point regarding China, it has not escaped our attention. Of course, the innovation from China across multiple therapeutic areas. And indeed, that was most evident with oncology seven years ago, but now it's expanding to most therapeutic areas. They're mostly fast-forwards, but I expect that will change as well. It's a scenario that we are very, very active in. We continue to have very fruitful discussions, and let's just see where we go. Albert Bourla : We have a very strong footprint in China, and that includes not only commercial, but we have a very strong R&D footprint that they are looking at Chinese innovation because they are progressing very fast, and to identify opportunity, Chris? Chris Boshoff : On the GIPR antagonist, this is potentially a first-in-class oral small molecule GIPR antagonist. It's currently in an ongoing Phase 2 placebo-controlled study, evaluating the GIPR antagonist in adults with obesity on the background of GLP-1 receptor agonist. If the data from the Phase 2 study are positive, we may potentially be able to develop also fixed-dose combinations, including with GLP-1, including potentially danuglipron in the future. Albert Bourla : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : We'll go next to Alex Hammond with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Alexandria Hammond : Thanks for squeezing me in. On Vyndaqel, with new competitors on the market and on the way, can you walk us through how we should think about the near-term commercial dynamics? Where can we see the largest share impact newly prescribed patients or switches? Thank you. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Alex. Aamir? Aamir Malik : Yes. Vynda obviously had very significant momentum in '24. You saw the growth rates and that was due in large part to the commercial efforts and the attention and investment we put behind it. We saw improvement in diagnosis rate as well as new patient starts. And we also did benefit from what was a onetime bolus of annual enrollment patients in the first quarter of '24 due to favorable affordability. So as we look into '25, there's both headwinds and tailwinds, and we're confident in the growth of Vynda, obviously at a different rate than it grew in '24. We do see increased diagnosis education, growth in the prescriber base. And there will continue to be favorable affordability conditions. But we do expect that there will be some headwinds. Obviously, you referred to two new market entrants. That will have some impact that remains to be seen both on switching patients as well as new patient starts. I think it's also important to remember that there will be impact of IRA on Vynda. And the effect that it has on the calendarization of our GTN, with more of the GTN impact coming earlier in the year as we reach the catastrophic phase. Now with all of that said, I think we remain really confident and excited. With Vynda, we've got a robust clinical profile that has data both from the clinical trial and the long-term extension. We've got five-year real-world data on VOWS. We've got strong access, and we are confident in our position as the standard of care. Albert Bourla : And let's move to the last question. Operator : Our last question comes from Tim Anderson with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Tim Anderson : Thank you. I have a question on just obesity strategy. So to me, late entrant companies with one lead asset might struggle unless they have real clinical differentiation. It could be in a better position if they have a collection of assets. There's naturally turnkey solutions out there in terms of companies that any larger company could either partner with or acquire outright. How is Pfizer looking at its BD efforts in this regard, either partnership or acquisition, that could bring you one or more assets that aren't far away from being in Phase 3? Albert Bourla : Andrew? Andrew Baum : Yes, hi Tim. So I agree with your assertion that obesity is heterogeneous and likely require a set of tools encompassing both modalities and different delivery devices in order to manage what is a lifelong condition. These assets do exist. Some are scattered, some have portfolios. But you can imagine that, of course, we are looking at all the opportunities and trying to understand what delivers the most value to patients and obviously, to Pfizer shareholders. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much. And I think that concludes our call. Thank you all for your interest. 2024 was a strong year of performance. And our 2025 strategic priorities are very clear. We are planning to execute as well on them as we executed in 2024. Thank you very much and have a nice day. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to Pfizer's Analyst and Investor Call to Review Full Year 2025 Financial Guidance. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer and Senior Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am. Francesca DeMartino : Good morning, and welcome to Pfizer's 2025 financial guidance call. I'm Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer. On behalf of the Pfizer team, thank you for joining us. This call is being made available via audio webcast at pfizer.com. Earlier this morning, we released our 2025 financial guidance via a press release that is available on our website at pfizer.com. I'm joined today by Dr. Albert Bourla, our Chairman and CEO; and Dave Denton, our CFO. Albert and Dave have some prepared remarks, and we will then open the call for questions. Before we get started, I want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements and discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. I encourage you to read the disclaimers in our slide presentation, the press release we issued this morning, and the disclosures in our SEC filings which are all available on the IR website on pfizer.com. Forward-looking statements on the call are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, speak only as of the call's original date and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of the statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Albert. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Francesca. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. We said that 2024 would be a year of execution for Pfizer, and I'm very proud for our colleagues for how they have delivered. I'm pleased with our year-to-date performance and our positive impact for millions of patients around the world. Today, we are reaffirming our full year 2024 guidance and David will provide our guidance for full year 2025. Before I turn it over to David to do that, I want to make some brief comments about why we are confident in our future, including our ability to continue delivering on our financial commitments. We believe our company is in a strong position, and as we have shown so far this year, we are relentlessly focused on execution of our 5-point plan to drive sustained long term value and impact. One year ago, we met with you to discuss the completion of our acquisition of Seagen, the formation of Pfizer Oncology and the change in our commercial model with the creation of two more focused commercial divisions, the Pfizer US Commercial and the Pfizer International Commercial. Each of these actions strengthened our company and they have been key contributors to the success we have achieved in 2024, as we executed against our five strategic priorities. We will review our performance in greater detail early next year when we report our full year 2024 results. For now, I will mention a few highlights that illustrate progress across our company. First, the integration of Seagen has gone extremely well. We have been successful in retaining the vast majority of Seagen's talented colleagues and together we have created one of the most experienced and capable oncology teams in the industry. Our growth year-to-date is demonstrating the power of our commercial capabilities and the combined Pfizer-Seagen oncology portfolio. Second, I am also proud of the strong year of progress with our pipeline. The oncology R&D team has continued to excel across the portfolio, delivering five Phase 3 study starts including our next-generation CDK4 inhibitor, the ADC sigvotatug vedotin and our EZH2 inhibitor mevrometostat. Several of these medicines could potentially be mega-blockbusters. At ASCO, we shared long-term follow-up data for Lorbrena leading to rapid adoption of next-generation ALK inhibitor globally as a first-line treatment of choice. Finally, highlighting our continued commitment to developing novel current cancer medicines, the team this year has initiated eight first-in-patient studies to date in oncology, including studies of two new ADCs with our next-generation TOPO1 payloads and also our panKRAS inhibitor. For the rest of our portfolio, we are also moving forward with our programs for cancer cachexia, obesity, next-generation oral COVID treatment and potential vaccines for flu/COVID and C. difficile as well as our fifth-generation pneumococcal vaccine candidate with more than 30 serotypes. Recently, we announced that starting in January, Dr. Chris Boshoff will begin serving as our Chief Scientific Officer and President of R&D. We conducted a comprehensive selection process and Chris rose to the top with his scientific expertise and his focus on execution, his proven leadership and his vision for advancing our pipeline of potential new medicines and vaccines. Chris will bring discipline and strategic focus to leverage his strong track record in oncology and drive progress across our key therapeutic areas. Chris also will partner with Andrew Baum, our new Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer, to ensure that we focus our R&D investments on the most impactful opportunities. We will look forward to talking more about this with you in the coming months. Third, our commercial teams both in the US and internationally have delivered strong results so far this year across our diversified portfolio. In the US, our new commercial model is yielding benefits as our specialized teams are more effectively targeting key opportunities to serve patient needs. Internationally, our commercial organization is capitalizing on the global reach and local expertise to expand patient access to medicines and vaccines. Fourth, we have also demonstrated good progress with financial discipline in 2024. We are working to realign our cost base in support of potential expanded margins. We achieved our goal of $4 billion in net cost savings by the end of this year and we expect an additional $500 million in net cost savings in 2025 with our previously announced cost realignment program. We also are already making progress with our plan designed to reduce manufacturing costs by $1.5 billion by the end of 2027. And finally, we are also moving forward with our fifth key priority by strategically allocating our capital to enhance shareholder value. We have an unwavering commitment to our dividend and remain focused on delivering while also reinvesting in our company's future. We remain confident that our previously deployed capital toward business development will produce significant long-term shareholder value and some deals such as Seagen and the BioNtech deal, have been transformational for Pfizer. Overall, our 2024 performance through the third quarter demonstrates the underlying strength of our business. It shows why we are confident that we remain well positioned in 2025 and are on the best path forward to enhance shareholder value. With that, I will turn it to my partner, Dave. David Denton : Thank you, Albert, and good morning everyone. At the start of this year, we outlined our five strategic priorities emphasizing focus and execution across the company. We have successfully fulfilled our financial commitments by achieving three consecutive quarters of solid performance, including maximizing the growth of our newly launched products, establishing oncology leadership and advancing our pipeline. In addition, we have also delivered on our $4 billion cost realignment program goal and strategically deployed our capital. So with that backdrop, let me begin this morning by reaffirming the company's 2024 financial guidance. We expect our full year '24 revenues will be in the range of $61 billion to $64 billion. Additionally, when excluding revenues contributed by both Comirnaty and Paxlovid, we expect our operational revenue growth to be in the range of 9% to 11% compared to 2023. Furthermore, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.95 for 2024. Please note that our '24 guidance incorporates approximately $1.2 billion in one-time Paxlovid revenues and roughly $0.30 in adjusted diluted earnings per share from all non-recurring items. After excluding these items, the baseline midpoint for 2024, which is used for comparison to our 2025 guidance, is $61.3 billion in revenues and $2.55 in adjusted diluted earnings per share. Now, looking ahead to 2025, we have confidence in the strength of our business and our ability to deliver on our commitments, creating long-term value for our shareholders. We want to emphasize that our approach to establishing our guidance and our outlook for 2025 will follow a more standard and typical process as the COVID-related variability in our business is mostly in the past and the revenue outlook for our overall business is stabilizing. Looking forward into next year, we are both very comfortable with our outlook and have a good line of sight to delivering on our financial commitments. On a total company basis, we anticipate 2025 revenues to be in the range of $61 billion to $64 billion with adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.80 to $3.00 a share. When comparing the 2025 guidance to the midpoint of the '24 baseline, we anticipate a year-over-year operational revenue growth rate ranging from approximately flat to up 5%. Now what truly highlights our performance, however, is the growth rate of our adjusted diluted earnings per share which is expected to grow operationally by approximately 10% to 18%. This implies an operating margin expansion of over 250 basis points versus 2024. This meaningful growth is a testament to our expansion in operating leverage and the disciplined approach we take to drive sustainable growth. Now before moving on to our other P&L line items, let me touch on a few highlights in our revenue outlook for next year. First, the impact of the IRA Medicare Part D redesign is expected to be a net headwind to the company's revenue of approximately $1 billion across our product portfolio, dampening growth by approximately 1.6% versus '24. We expect our share of the catastrophic coverage to exceed the potential volume benefit from the reduction of the patient out-of-pocket cap. As a reminder, the IRA is felt more acutely in higher-priced medicines like Vyndaqel, Ibrance, Xeljanz which reach catastrophic coverage much earlier in the year. Our assumption for our entire vaccines portfolio is that there will be no material US policy changes in 2025. Next year, our COVID-19 products are expected to contribute to stable revenue baseline -- stable revenue base in line with our 2024 guidance after adjusting for the $1.2 billion in one-time Paxlovid revenues. We expect that both Comirnaty and Paxlovid will maintain their market shares with stable pricing due to their commercialization in both the US as well as international markets. For Comirnaty, we expect materially stable US vaccine rates on par with 2024 levels. We continue to expect revenue primarily concentrated in the back half of the year. The distribution between Q3 and Q4 will depend upon the timing of the strain selection and approvals by regulatory agencies. Now, outside the US, we have a material portion of revenues from advanced purchase agreements, mostly in the European Union. Now Paxlovid utilization is expected to follow infection rates and revenues may fluctuate based on the timing, duration and severity of COVID-19 cases. It is important to note that in the US, we expect certain Medicaid and Medicare patients to transition out of the patient assistance program in the first quarter '25. This transition will allow us to recognize additional revenues on a cash basis benefiting operating cash flow. Our non-COVID vaccine products are expected to remain a key contributor to our business. We expect Abrysvo to benefit from international market expansion in both adult and maternal indications despite competition and a narrowing US market opportunity in the near term given the ACIP recommendations. Now, the PCV market has been a topic of many recent conversations. It is important to note that approximately two-thirds of Prevnar revenues are derived from the pediatric market which is anticipated to remain consistent with a stable market share through the end of the decade. However, the adult indication, which accounts for roughly one-third of the revenues, is expected to face competition with limited catch-up opportunities in the over-65 population in the US. Nevertheless, there are potential growth opportunities in the 50 to 64 age group in the US as well as in international markets through the continued rollout of PCV20 for both indications. Given all these market considerations, we expect Prevnar's overall revenue to moderately decline in 2025. Oncology is expected to significantly contribute to our growth in the later part of the decade. Padcev is expected to benefit from continued uptake in first-line treatment in locally advanced metastatic urethral cancer. Lorbrena is expected to continue strong growth through share expansion into first-line treatment and long duration of therapy. However, Ibrance is expected to be impacted by continued competitive pressures across markets as well as generic entry in select markets as well as the IRA. Overall, it's important to note that in 2025 our oncology growth rate will be mathematically dampened due to the overlapping effect of the Seagen acquisition. We anticipate Vyndaqel's growth will be tempered primarily due to the unfavorable impact of the IRA and new competition in the US. Internationally, increases in diagnosis and treatment rates is expected to drive continued expansion. And Eliquis, while over 10 years in the market, is expected to continue to grow through market and share expansion supported by strong data. We expect Nurtec to continue to benefit from commercial execution as well as ongoing HCP and patient engagement and education and to a lesser extent by uptake outside the US. And lastly, Xeljanz is expected to continue experiencing competitive and pricing pressures as it approaches patent expiry in the US and Japan towards the end of 2025 as well as the impact from the IRA. With that, now moving further down the P&L, total adjusted SI&A and R&D expenses are expected to be in the range of $24 billion to $26 billion and reflect the $4 billion in savings achieved from our cost realignment program. We anticipate an additional $500 million of savings from the program in '25 as we continue to aggressively control our costs. Specifically, the company expects adjusted SI&A expenses will be in the range of between $13.3 billion to $14.3 billion, a reduction of $500 million versus our 2024 guidance as we continue to focus on driving operational efficiencies. Adjusted R&D expenses are expected in the range of $10.7 billion to $11.7 billion, reflecting continued focus and prioritization in key therapeutic areas. As we enter next year, we will be focused on driving efficiency in our R&D organization with any resulting operational savings expected to be strategically reinvested in research to further fuel innovation and our long-term product development. The effective tax rate on adjusted income is expected to be approximately 15%, largely reflecting the impact of Pillar 2 and jurisdictional mix of our income. And while not part of our official guidance, adjusted gross margin is expected to be in the mid-70s which takes into consideration our expected product mix, the net impact of IRA Medicare Part D and the anticipated initial savings from Phase 1 of our manufacturing optimization program expected in the latter part of 2025. Now, as we cycle into 2025, we anticipate modest revenue growth of approximately flat to up 5%, but our unwavering dedication to driving operational efficiency will play a pivotal role in achieving an expected meaningful 10% to 18% growth rate and adjusted diluted earnings per share. We maintain our strong commitment to both maintaining and growing our dividend as well as meeting our de-levering targets by the end of 2025. We plan to continue to monetize our stake in Haleon over time, given consideration to our cash flow requirements as well as future market conditions. In closing, I'd like to emphasize several key aspects of our business. First, we believe we are entering a phase of revenue stability as the uncertainty caused by COVID are mostly resolved. Additionally, our cost-improvement programs have laid the groundwork for ongoing margin expansion. We will continue our focus and execution to maximize the commercial value of our product portfolio. Our new R&D leadership is dedicated to raising the bar for future innovation and strengthening our pipeline. And lastly, we have a clear line of sight to reloading our balance sheet, enabling us to effectively deploy capital and pursue additional opportunities to both strengthen our business and create value for our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Albert and for Q&A. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Dave, and a very good summary at the end. Now, operator, please assemble the queue. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks so much for the question here. I guess my question was really centered around gross margins. You're targeting mid-70s this year, but as we look past 2025, how much additional opportunity is there for improvement as we consider maybe not just Phase 1 of the restructuring, but some potential future opportunities you've highlighted as well? I guess I'm trying to get a sense of like are upper 70s are realistic target for longer-term gross margins. And if I can slip in a second quick question just on capital allocation, I know de-levering has been a priority. Do we think about 2025 as a year we should think about maybe potential for acceleration of BD and capital return or is that more 2026 and beyond? Thank you. David Denton : Chris, this is Dave. I'll take the question. Clearly, upper 70s from a gross margin perspective is a target for us and it is attainable. Let me just frame up a bit about our manufacturing optimization program. The team has worked really hard to identify and execute against our savings plan. Realistically, those savings get realized as we produce products into inventory and those savings get -- become realized through the P&L once we sell the inventory as we cycle through 2025. So there is a delay in the P&L of seeing the savings through the financial statements versus what's actually happening at the moment. So you're seeing a partial benefit in '25. You'll see more benefits as we wrap into '26 and '27. Secondly, on the capital allocation perspective, yes, our dedication is supporting our dividend, investing in our business as well as de-levering. You would expect that we -- you would not see us do large BD in 2025. That's largely a '26 and beyond focus for us. Having said that, as I've always stated, we always have a little flexibility to do BD in the near term as we see appropriate assets that would enhance our value long term. Albert Bourla : Thank you very much, Dave. Let's go to the next question, please. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Geoff Meacham with Citibank. Please go ahead. Geoff Meacham : Morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Dave had another one on capital priorities. I know you guys are committed to the dividend. I did note that you said raising it is also a priority. But would you say de-levering is by far the main focus for 2025? And I know there's been a lot of market chatter on potential spin-off of your hospital business. Wanted to get maybe any comments on that with respect to strategy and potential use of proceeds. Thank you. David Denton : Yeah, Geoff, the good news actually both supporting our dividend and growing our dividend as well as de-levering are both very high in our priority list and fortunate for us as our business is able to generate enough cash flow to be able to do both in 2025. So I put them on par from that perspective. And then secondly, while I won't on any market rumors, I would say that we are constantly looking at our business, understanding the assets that we have within our business that might perform or look differently outside. So we're constantly doing that evaluation to make sure what is the best value-creating opportunity for Pfizer in the long term. And we will continue to be resilient on that with all the businesses within Pfizer at this point. Albert Bourla : Thank you, Geoff, for the question and thank you for the very clear answer, Dave. Let's go to the next question. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Steve Scala with TD Securities. Please go ahead. Steve Scala : Thank you so much. Dave, you used the term revenue stability. Does that mean flat revenue through the end of the decade or a consistent revenue growth rate? And if the latter, then is Pfizer considering reinstating the 6% longer-term revenue aspiration that was pulled a year ago? And if not, what are your reservations? So that's the first question. And second, if Pfizer were planning to co-develop danuglipron with an established obesity company, would any financial implications of that be in the 2025 guidance? And would you need to call that out? Thank you. David Denton : Yeah. So, maybe I'll take the last one first is from a danuglipron, we do not have a co-development program baked into our expectations for 2025. So that would be different and new and unique. So we would come back to the market if that were to happen. So, number one. And then secondly, my revenue stability comment was not reflective of us having flat revenues through that time period. It was actually -- the revenue stability was a comment saying that largely the COVID variability is in the past for Pfizer. Keep in mind, let's cycle back a couple years. COVID was roughly $55 billion in revenue. This year is just around $10 billion in revenue. The air -- the size of the air bars around our expectations as we look forward for COVID revenues is much smaller. So therefore there's some stability now as we think about projecting out our revenues for '25, '26 and beyond. So that is the meaning of the statement. We have not given long-term expectations to the end of the decade at this point. Albert Bourla : Okay. Thank you very much. Let's go to the next question, please. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Tim Anderson with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Tim Anderson : Well, thank you. Albert, I think you met with Donald Trump recently. Has Pfizer met with others from his administration, including RFK Jr.? And any color you're willing to provide on how any of those discussions have been going? I think there's obviously uncertainty on the vaccine front what the downside risk could be to COVID if they directly target COVID vaccines and maybe on that latter point, what would be a realistic downside scenario to COVID revenues in the US in 2025? Albert Bourla : Thank you for the question. As it was written in the press and this -- actually the President confirmed in few interviews, including yesterday, we did have dinner with him and as the President said, he invited also Mr. Kennedy to that dinner. We had, and me personally, a very long-lasting relationship with President Trump that during his first term was cemented, particularly during the Operation Warp Speed period that the President is extremely proud and of course we are extremely proud. That basically delivered a vaccine through this landmark golden standard program, the Operation Warp Speed, actually not one, but two vaccines, that they saved millions of lives. And I know that the President is very proud of it. I don't want to speak about the details of what we discussed during that dinner because I want to respect the privacy. But we developed a good relation with Mr. Kennedy and he's now going through the confirmation. If he's confirmed, we will work with him to make sure that we advance the right policies. We are not interested in politics, we are interested in policies. And whoever is in the health, whoever has -- is in the leading position, we will work with them to accomplish. Really, I can't speak about what Mr. Kennedy's beliefs are and will be. But I can say that on the vaccines particularly that the President is very proud of the work that was done with the vaccine and because he and his program contributed significantly. Thank you for the question. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Chris Shibutani : Thank you very much. If I could just ask you, Albert, to follow on and potentially address the topic of drug pricing, particularly in the US with IRA implementation, but also internationally, I think there's been some talking points that have been out there in the media and amongst investors about most favored nation, whether or not there's potential to perhaps potentially increase pricing outside the US. Any commentary that you can share, perhaps stemming from the discussion that you had with the President-elect would be helpful. Thank you. Albert Bourla : It's very -- I don't want to go into details because as I said, I want to respect the privacy of these discussions. However, I can make some comments based on what the President chose to release in his interview. He spoke particularly yesterday and -- but also in previous interview that he gave over the previous weekend. He did speak that, that was -- he did reveal, but that was a topic that was discussed. And the President has very strong views, as he articulated recently and before from his very first term for the middlemen, the PBMs, that he wants transparency. It's very clear. He wants that the savings even more importantly will pass to the patients which they will see dramatic reduction in the cost they are experiencing with their medicines if that happens. And it seems to me that he is very committed to make this happen. Internationally, I think that the other countries should step up and pay their fair price for innovation and we are really focusing on doing that. Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Trung Huynh with UBS. Please go ahead. Trung Huynh : Hi, guys. Two questions, please. Just firstly, can you outline some of the Part D impact per drug? Your commentary was super useful here. So, you said that there's a volume uplift, but you're also going to have an impact for the higher-priced products. Just quantify that impact for the key products. We're not surprised through the year. And are there going to be any winners from Part D? And then you mentioned the current OpEx guide that includes the additional $500 million saving in '25. Can you contemplate the spend associated with a broad Phase 3 program in obesity? And could this guide change based on the QD danuglipron data that reads out at the start of next year? Thank you. David Denton : Yeah. Well, maybe I'll start with the danuglipron question. Just to clarify, if we move danuglipron into Phase 3 and we'll have more data here in Q1, we have -- that is contemplated within our 2025 budget for R&D. So that is -- that would be -- there'd be no change to our expectation or guidance if we move to Phase 3, number one. Secondly, from a Medicare Part D perspective, I probably can't get you a byproduct, but maybe I'll step back and give a little clarity just kind of how this works. Once you reach the catastrophic phase within Part D, the -- our commitment or our responsibility is 20% of the price. So think about it the fact that basically in those catastrophic phases, we are contributing a 20% discount to the price of our product at that point in time. So you can imagine a product like Vyndaqel that gets into the catastrophic coverage pretty quickly because of its current price point, we dampen our growth rate by 20% from a price perspective despite the fact that utilization is going up, number one. Secondly, if you just step back and look at the puts and takes across our business, it's a $1 billion net negative to us or 1.6% dampening of our growth rate. But if you think about it, there's probably about $500 million of uptake, higher utilization because of the lower out-of-pocket offset by $1.5 billion of headwinds from the catastrophic phase, netting us down to $1 billion in 2025. And then finally, for your question around the additional $500 million, we continue to work that expectation into our plan. We have really good line of sight to that. The incremental cost of that has been factored into our one-time expectations for the program. So, nothing incremental from that perspective at this point. Albert Bourla : Thank you. And clearly, utilization of technology and also, let's say, optimization of our operations is part of our plans to achieve those $500 million. And I'm happy that you clarified the danu question, Dave, before you spoke about co-development and indeed we don't have plans to co-develop it which will be less development cost, but the cost of a Phase 3 is incorporated in case. But we'll start. Let's go to the next question. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Vamil Divan : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two if I could. One is a follow-up on Comirnaty and I know you commented that your guidance assumes no major policy changes around vaccines. I'm curious how you just thought about maybe just the rhetoric around vaccines and if there's more discussion about the vaccine, maybe more anti-vaccine or anti-COVID vaccine sentiment, how that could impact use of the product even if there is no actual policy changes. And then my second question, maybe just as we're thinking about 2025, I'm curious maybe I guess for Albert, just while you point to sort of the key data events that we should be focused on, obviously a lot of attention on danu in the first quarter, but just other sort of key pipeline events that you think you maybe are underappreciated right now that investors should be focused on. Thank you. Albert Bourla : Yes. Thank you, Vamil. On Comirnaty in general, which is first of all, Dave made very clear that our expectations and this is where we build our forecast is we will not have any major changes in the US policy in 2025. And I believe that will be the case. But of course, we are very alerted and that's why we had these very productive discussions with the incoming Trump administration to ensure that the health and safety of the people that are using our products is there. In general, on the COVID and Paxlovid stability, it's very, very clear now that it is -- they are following identical patterns over -- year after year. The uncertainties and the things that could skew sales year-over-year were more related with the switch to commercialization or one-time events like the Paxlovid with the US Government building stock and then releasing the stock and all of that which are all behind us. Now we have commercial models and -- but they utilize -- and stable price. But the utilization is following identical patterns year after year after year. And I'm just watching in front of me right now, I'm staring the CDC charts of the of the wastewater COVID over the last three, four years. And every year, we have two waves and this year we have it in -- last year, we said the COVID wave in Q2 and Q4. This year, we had the COVID waves in Q3 and we are just experiencing an uptick that is very predictive with very high accuracy. I can say that we are expecting now a new wave of COVID as we are exiting '24 and we are entering 2025. So that means that both utilization of Paxlovid will be very stable at the levels that we had with very stable pricing with the only caveat that prices will increase for some patients that will go out of the path in Medicare. And in vaccines, again, we are trending very, very close to what was the vaccination rates of last year. And with a new wave, I think the vaccination rates will increase. Those are my comments on the vaccines. Was there another question? Yes, a very important question that what you should focus next year. Let me start with some readouts that I think are important because next year is very rich in some of these catalysts. Clearly, we are expecting the protein inhibitor the second-line metastatic ER-positive breast cancer to come next year. In Braftovi, the breakwater, it is for Braftovi in colorectal cancer. We are expecting also that readout to happen next year. The Sasanlimab which is our subcutaneous PD-L1 for non-muscle invasive bladder is coming next year. We have Elrexfio plus daratumumab in double class exposed multiple myeloma that is coming next year. We have the hemophilia A and B with inhibitors coming next year. Those are some of the important readouts. But there is a tremendous activity in Phase 3 starts for next year. Let me start with the next-generation COVID which actually we were expecting to start with next year, but I have -- I can tell you now that the study started already recently. Of course, danu, we expect to see the final results that we can start a Phase 3. Nurtec, we plan to start in menstrual migraine. Of course, ponsegromab with cancer cachexia, we plan to start. And CDI, with the vaccine against C. difficile that we are also looking forward to starting the Phase 3. In oncology, which is even more richer the pipeline, we have the CDK4 start that we expect in the first-line HER -- HR+ metastatic breast cancer, I repeat first-line. We have basically four Phase 3 studies with SV which is a new ADC from Seagen. We have one with TPS-high non-small lung -- cell lung cancer. We had one with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. We will have also an all-comers squamous non-small cell lung cancer and all-comers squamous, not small cell lung cancer. Those are four new studies that we expect with -- I spoke about CDK4 of course, KAT6 plus endocrine therapy in second-line metastatic breast cancer and a very important product that we have high hopes because of the early data. It is our PDL1V ADC which is a very novel concept and we expect to start again Phase 3 next year. So, as you will see, it's very, very rich in terms of expectations next year. So with that, I think we have time for one more question. Operator, can you please take the last question? Operator : Thank you. And we will take our last question from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Evan Seigerman : Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question and congrats on the really reasonable and clear guidance. So, a year into the Seagen acquisition closing and it's mostly being integrated now, how do you see the growth profile of the assets from this acquisition contributing to the broader plan revenue growth going forward? How significant of an accelerant are these assets beyond Padcev? And where do you see the greatest growth coming from the acquisition? Thank you, guys. Albert Bourla : Thank you. We -- when we did the acquisition, we set a goal that by year 2030, we expect that the Seagen acquisition will deliver $10 billion of revenues. We stay with this projection, but I think that we are advancing way better in the first years than what we thought we would. Actually, we are advancing way better than what the state thought that the Seagen acquisition will do. I also spoke for so many Phase 3 studies that they just started. Those clearly are not part of the $10 billion of this acquisition. So a reasonable success in any of them, full success in all of them, I mean, it's going to blow up the number big time. But reasonable success in some of them will clearly deliver higher value. And even the most important of the Seagen is that this is a platform that first of all, it is not facing -- it's very difficult to have generic competition. Basically, there is no regulatory path for an ADC to develop a biosimilar. And actually, it's extremely challenging for anyone to develop an ADC and prove that it is biosimilar. So it's pretty much LOE-free right now with the current science asset. And the other one it is that the platform is delivering constantly new Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3 studies. So, this is why I believe that the Seagen acquisition has been transformational. I think that the trends in the world and very much most key opinion leaders agree that chemotherapy will be replaced in the next 10 years largely by targeted chemotherapy, which is the ADCs. And right now, chemotherapy, it is the vast majority of cancer treatment. So, with that, I think that I would say what excites me -- I think I will close by saying what excites me for next year. And the first one is this one, I just spoke about the pipeline expectations, but I would say that with the new Head of R&D, I'm very excited about our R&D refocus efforts. We have very good performance on oncology. We have very good performance in vaccines. And the other therapeutic areas, we have tremendous capabilities that with the right focus will deliver significant new assets. So our goal is to turn around internal medicine and INI and bring it to the levels of oncology and vaccines that we are having right now. Another thing that also excites me is that I believe in even the most skeptical investors. Finally, we realize that the COVID revenues are stable. Will be next year the fourth year of an identical pattern for the first three, I believe will be for the fourth year. And that will provide some stability, as Dave said, in the expectations for revenues and probably will assign the right demand. And thirdly, I'm very excited because with Dave's leadership, our capital allocation has become really, really strategic. And right now it is very -- it was investing in the business in '23, largely with very big acquisitions. Then going forward, maintain the growth in dividend, paying down the leverage that we took to invest in the business and start, let's say, using other forms of capital allocation that we will see next year, so -- and then of course 2026 and '27 further. So I think I'm very optimistic that '25 will be a year of continuous commercial execution and R&D turnaround. Albert Bourla : With that, I want to wish everyone Happy Holidays. Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah for everyone out there and Happy Ramazan. And we are going to have another call in end of January at that time frame when we will announce the results of our last quarter. Thank you very much to all. Happy holidays. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",
