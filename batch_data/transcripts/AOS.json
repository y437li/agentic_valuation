O. Smith Corporation First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we'll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions). I'll now introduce your host for today's conference, Pat Ackerman, Vice President Investor Relations and Treasurer. You may begin. Patricia Ackerman : Thank you, Ashley. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2014 conference call. With me participating in the call are Ajita Rajendra, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Kita, Chief Financial Officer. A note this morning to you all, on the conference call, is that the slide deck is viewer control, so you will have to advance the slides as we go along. That's just a little hiccup we have this morning. So just be aware of that that you will need to advance your own slides. The next slide, before we begin with Ajita's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking states are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning's press release. The next slide. In order to provide improved transparency into operating results of our business, we are providing non-GAAP measures, adjusted earnings, adjusted EPS and adjusted segment operating earnings that exclude certain items, as well as non-operating pension costs consisting of interest costs, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gains and losses and curtailments. Prior year results are provided on a comparable basis. Reconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and also on our website. Ajita, I will now turn the call over to you. Ajita Rajendra : Thank you, Pat. I'm on slide four, which says first quarter highlights. 2014 is off to a great start. We continue to see the benefits in our performance from the housing recovery in the U.S. and our expanding consumer product business in China. Here are a few highlights. Our organic growth drove sales 8% higher to a first quarter record of $552 million. China sales growth of 25% exceeded our expectations, and growth was across the board with gas tankers, water treatment, and renewable energy products growing faster than the business as a whole. Our adjusted earnings of $0.54 per share was 13% higher than the $0.48 per share recorded last year primarily driven by higher sales. We continue to allocate a portion of our capital to returning cash to our shareholders. During the quarter, we announced the 25% dividend increase and repurchased $21 million of stock. To allow us to continue to repurchase our shares, our Board increased its authorization by 1.5 million shares in April. John will now describe our results in more detail. John Kita : Thank you, Ajita. Slide five. Sales for the first quarter of $5.52 million were 8% higher than the previous year driven by higher volumes of water heaters in the U.S. and China. Adjusted earnings of $49.7 million improved 11% from 2013. Adjusted earnings in 2014 excluded after tax non-operating pension cost of $3 million. Adjusted earnings in 2013 excluded after tax non-operating pension cost of 3 million, an after-tax gain of 6.8 million related to a settlement with the supplier, and an after-tax restructuring and impairment expenses of $9.5 million. On slide six, adjusted earnings of $0.54 per share improved 13% compared with $0.48 per share last year. The effective income tax rate of 28.8% associated with first quarter adjusted earnings was approximately 1 percentage point lower than in the first quarter last year providing a $0.01 per share benefit to first quarter 2014 adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliation from GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS is included at the end of this presentation and covers the previously discussed items. Slide seven. Sales in our North America segment of $389 million increased 3% over last year driven by higher sales of residential and commercial water heaters in the U.S., which were partially offset by lower Canadian water heater volumes and a weaker currency in Canada. The unfavourable sales impact from Canada amounted to approximately $5.5 million.  Rest of World segment sales of $173 million increased 25% compared with last year driven by increased demand for water heaters and water treatment products in China, market acceptance of our newer higher value water-heating products in China, and new store additions. After examining buying patterns by our top seven customers during the quarter compared with the prior year, we believe a change and inventory levels favourably impacted our sales in China by approximately $10 million. On slide eight, North America adjusted operating earnings of $59 million were slightly below last year and adjusted operating margin of 15.2% declined as well. The favourable impact from higher volumes in the U.S. and savings associated with rationalization of our manufacturing footprint were offset by higher steel prices, lower volumes in Canada, and a weaker Canadian dollar. As a result of higher steel prices, we announced a mid-single digit price increase in North America, which will be effective May 1. Rest of World operating earnings of $25 million improved almost 40% compared with last year. The favourable impact from higher sales and improved mix of products in China was partially offset by sales-related increases in selling and advertising costs and higher expenses related to opening a second water heater plant in China in late 2013. Operating margin was 14.5%, an improvement over last year, largely due to improved profitability in our China water treatment business. Our adjusted corporate expenses was $13 million, an increase from the prior year, primarily due to higher stock-based compensation costs, related to shorter amortization periods. On slide nine. Cash provided by operations of 12 million in the first quarter of 2014 was lower than the 34 million provided last year as a result of higher outlays for working capital in the 2014 period. We're expecting an operating cash flow for the full year 2014 to be between $240 million and $250 million. Our liquidity position and balance sheet remains strong. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 15% at the end of March 2014. We have sizable cash balances located offshore, and our net cash position was almost $250 million at the end of the first quarter this year. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 450,000 shares of common stock for a total of $21 million under a 10b5-1 automatic trading plan. At the end of the first quarter, we have repurchased approximately 300,000 additional shares. Considering the additional 1.5 million shares authorized in April by our Board, we have approximately $1.9 million shares remaining on our existing repurchased authority today. Depending on factors such as stock price, working capital requirement, and alternative investment opportunities, we expect to repurchase a significant portion of the authorized shares in 2014.  Slide ten. This morning, we increased our adjusted earnings guidance to $2.20 to $2.35 per share. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance represents a 10% increase in after-tax earnings compared with our 2013 results. Non-operating pension costs are expected to be $0.14 per share in 2014, slightly above the $0.13 per share in 2013. Recall that in 2015, our pension plan will sunset for almost all beneficiaries. We expect this to result in a considerable reduction to our pension costs for 2015. Our GAAP EPS guidance is $2.06 to $2.21 per share. Our adjusted EPS and our GAAP EPS guidance does not include the impact from future acquisitions. I will now turn the call back to Ajita, who will summarize the assumptions in our 2014 outlook and reiterate our acquisition strategy. Ajita Rajendra : Thanks, John. I'm on slide 11 which has a heading that says, \"2014 Outlook and 140-year anniversary.\" As John mentioned, the midpoint of our updated 2014 guidance implies growth of 10% in adjusted earnings per share over last year. Our outlook for 2014 includes the following assumptions. First, we continue to see strong growth in China. As many of you know, we operate as the consumer product business in that region and have invested significantly in innovation, safety, reliability, and quality to sustain and enhance our position as the leading premium water heating brand. The return on our investment in engineering and innovation together with distribution expansion and market share growth are the key drivers of our success in China. The macro-environment tool provides three important tailwinds for our business. First, our premium consumer products, with a highly recognizable brand are in the sweet spot of the government's desire to grow the consumption part of China's economy. Second, China recently set a goal for the population to be 60% urban by 2020. This push for urbanization equates to 10 million to 15 million people per year moving to the cities, and many of whom may buy apartments and water heaters. Third, rate inflation has been increasing recently, and this adds the expansion of discretionary income. Combining all of these factors gives us confidence that we will continue to at least grow at two-times China's GDP rate. Second assumption, we expect the Lochinvar brand to continue to benefit from the transition from lower efficiency non-condensing boilers to higher efficiency condensing boilers to higher efficiency condensing boilers and also from strong market acceptance FTXL boiler. Both of these products are expected to be introduced in the second half of this year.  Lochinvar branded condensing boilers continue to offer a compelling feedback in the form of energy savings, and we have better reputation for innovation and outstanding product quality. As a result, we expect Lochinvar branded sales to grow at approximately 10% in 2014 well ahead of GDP growth in the U.S.  Third, we are cautiously optimistic about the developing recovery in U.S. housing. After a very strong industry growth in 2015, helped by improved levels of home completions and significant expansion of the replacement market, we expect residential water heater volumes in the U.S. to be up to approximately 9 million units, including tankless, primarily due to an increase in new home constructions this year. We expect commercial water heater volumes will increase to approximately 162,000 units. Both of these industry estimates are improvements from the levels we originally forecast in our generate guidance and reflect a strongest tax of the industry this year. Fourth, we announced the mid-single digit price increase for wholesale water heaters in North America effective May 1st. This price increase was anticipated as we saw steel prices climb steadily over the last several quarters. And our fifth assumption, as discussed in the past, 2014 will be negatively impacted by higher cost associated with the new factory in China in approximately $10 million of incremental ERP implementation expenses.  In addition, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate for the year will be between 29% and 30% in 2014 higher than the 28.3% we sell in 2013. I'm on to the next slide now, slide 12, which shows the A.O. Smith growth strategy. Our acquisition strategy has not changed. We remained focused on water heating and water-related technology companies around the world, as well as leveraging our brand, our brand equity and distribution channel in China. Our target list continues to evolve. In the last 12 to 18 months, we've walked away from several targets primarily because of price and new names have been added to our pipeline. Our teams are energetic and very engaged in the process. We will continue to consider a combination of support for organic growth, acquisitions, share repurchase and dividends for capital deployment.  Slide 13, our investment criteria. You've seen this slide before, and we showed this as a reminder that we will continue to be financially disciplined acquirer of companies within our stated corporate strategy.  Now, this concludes our prepared remarks, and we're open for your questions. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from William Bremer of Maxim Group. Your line is open. William Bremer \u2013 Maxim Group : Good morning. Ajita Rajendra : Good morning. Patricia Ackerman : Good morning. John Kita : Good morning. William Bremer \u2013 Maxim Group : Nicely done. I love the consistency. Ajita Rajendra : Thank you. William Bremer \u2013 Maxim Group : All right. Let's first start off with Lochinvar. Could you give us a sense of how it\u2019s contributed to the quarter? And more importantly, what did you see on the aftermarket there? John Kita : Well, it was an interesting quarter for Lochinvar. They were up about 7%, and we feel they were affected pretty significantly by the weather. The contractors we talked to said that they were basically so busy that they only had time to repair versus replace, which can take two to three days. We saw that in our parts business. Our parts business was up almost 20% year-over-year and was actually as strong as the fourth quarter, which is very unusual for them from a parts standpoint, so they were affected by the weather. We're still very comfortable that coming out as Ajita talked about two new products in the last half of the year. We are incurring some engineering and expenses to get those to market, but we're very excited about the products that we're bringing, and we're comfortable at this point that they can still achieve their 10% growth. William Bremer \u2013 Maxim Group : Okay, John. Thank you.  And can you give us an update on how you're considering rolling out the residential end to that abroad? John Kita : You're talking about Lochinvar in China? William Bremer \u2013 Maxim Group : Yes, I am. John Kita : So I think there's not much of an update. We'll have the residential boiler there relatively soon. We're still running into some headwinds with respect to the commercial boiler in getting the approvals. We're looking at a couple of different strategies with respect to that right now. We're still comfortable long term that the boiler business will be a good growth opportunity in China, but it's taking longer than expected, but we're looking at a couple of different strategies with respect to commercial. Ajita Rajendra : Let me jump in here too, Bill. This is Ajita. We are seeing some signs in China where the government is starting to talk about cutting back on coal consumption and increasing natural gas in the country, and all of those signs are very positive signs from the point of view of these types of very highly energy efficient products. So again, as John said, it's going a little slower than we'd like, but the long-term prospects are right in line with our expectations. William Bremer \u2013 Maxim Group : Great. And then just a quick follow-up here. Can you give us an update on India, how that's progressing and what your strategy is throughout '14? Ajita Rajendra : India is going well. Right now, the economy is kind of at a standstill, and the depreciation of the Rupee has hurt us as we have said in the past, but if you look at what's happening with the business in local currency in India, it's right on track. We are increasing market share slowly, expanding distribution, and the business is growing. We don't see it in dollars, because the depreciation of the Indian Rupee essentially almost offsets the increase in volume that we're seeing. So we are happy with the business in local currency. We are not quite as happy when you translate it back to U.S. dollars. But again, the longer-term trends are very positive. There is a lot of anticipation that after the election and once they -- the issues with the election die down and there is a definite result that the economy will pick up again. William Bremer \u2013 Maxim Group : Great. Thank you for the time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Somerville of KeyBanc. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning guys. This is John for Matt.  Just first a couple of questions on the price increase, is that May 1st price increase across the board and North America, both residential and commercial, kind of similar mid-single digit range? And then a follow on to that, I mean obviously steel costs have increased over the last few quarters, but I believe Caldwell was still low where it was the last time you raised prices, in I think it was mid-2012. So how confident are you that that's going to stick? Are you the first mover here or are you following kind of industry price increases or just maybe talk to the confidence level that you're going to see stickiness in that price increase? Ajita Rajendra : We are pretty confident about the price increase. And I am not sure about the steel data. We'll have to check on that, but my perception is that steel prices were in fact lower at that time, although I'm not sure about that. Okay? We\u2019ll have to check on that. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Ajita Rajendra : But the indications in the marketplace are pretty good. There was not a lot of pushback, a very little pushback from our distributors, and so we feel pretty good about the price increase. Unidentified Analyst : And just given the timing, I mean, it's May 1st. So, since it's mid-quarter, we shouldn't see \u2013 there was no pull forward into the first quarter. There shouldn't be any impact, I wouldn't think, on a quarterly basis. Ajita Rajendra : Not in the first quarter. No, there was almost -- I shouldn't say almost. There was no buying in that we saw in the first quarter. We'll see a little bit of impact in the second quarter, but not much. Unidentified Analyst : Yeah. Okay. And then on the commercial side, commercial volumes -- you said commercial volumes were up in the quarter that was against the pretty tough double-digit comp, and I think there was pre-buy in California last year. You've increased your commercial industry outlook slightly, it looks like. So, are you seeing signs that non-res activity is starting to improve or what gives you -- how do you explain kind of the commercial bump? Ajita Rajendra : Yeah, we see non-res activities starting to improve and feel pretty good about that, which is why we bumped it up. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. John Kita : It started out relatively slow. I'd say, it shows that January and February were pretty weak, but we saw a very strong March. So, that's what gave us the comfort level to raise it up some. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then lastly, John, you mentioned the 10 million inventory benefit in China. Did something drive that? Is that a pull forward into the first quarter? Is it just your customers willing to kind of have higher inventory levels because of the consumer demand they're seeing? Just a little more color on that please. John Kita : I mean, part of it is the delta last year in the first quarter our major customer ship out of inventory. So the inventory's levels went down about $5 million. This year in the first quarter, our customers built their inventory levels about $5 million. So that delta is about $5 million. We're not really uncomfortable with the inventory level. It was just kind of a quarter-to-quarter comparison. Ajita Rajendra : Right. The $5 million up and down month by month per quarter is not unusual, as John said. But we try to -- when we do have inventory data, we try to look at it to make sure that we give you an accurate picture of what's going on. Unidentified Analyst : Great. That's very helpful. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Graham of Jefferies. Your line is open. Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Hey, good morning. John Akita : Good morning. Patricia Ackerman :  Good morning. Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Ajita, I just want to understand your market assumption for the U.S. res tankless. Are you using 4% for tankless as a percent of the market or 5%? Ajita Rajendra : It's about approximately 4%. John Kita : About 400,000 units. Ajita Rajendra : Four hundred thousand units. Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Four hundred thousand units. So essentially you're lifting your assumption in North America non-tankless by about a point, right? John Kita : Yeah, by about 100,000 units. Yeah. Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Right, right. Okay. I just want to kind of get that math right. So you're up by a point even though first -- January and February which I think you allude to as being weather affected were up five. Ajita Rajendra : Well, yeah. So on the residential side, January and February we're up 5%, okay? And we think that March was very similar. So we think the first quarter industry is up about 5%. What I was alluding to earlier was commercial was down January and February. But up significantly in March. Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Well, I guess I would have to believe that the weather affected January and February numbers of residents as well though, right? Ajita Rajendra : Possibly. John Kita : Yeah. Ajita Rajendra : That's possible. Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Okay. Ajita Rajendra : Again, we saw a very strong quarter as it was. We think about 5% for the industry. Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Understood. But even with that, let's say it didn't affect your 5% in the first quarter and your estimate is about -- you're assuming 4% for the year. Ajita Rajendra : Right. That's right. That's about right. Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Okay. All right. Next question kind of related to China, and I don't think we've ever asked this question before, could you guys separate out in total what your new distribution points impact on sales were versus the rest of the business if only versus the same store stuff? Ajita Rajendra : That's very difficult to do. We really have not thought -- we don't look at it separately because when distribution points change, there's always a change going on in terms of less efficient distribution points shutting down and new ones opening up. And so hopefully the mix is always getting a little better. And so because of all that change, we don't really look at to try to separate it out in that manner. Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies LLC : (Indiscernible) gets at least. The reason I'm asking is that obviously your two largest customers there are more than half of the sales. So I was hoping that maybe at least we can get one-third, two-thirds. John Kita : I don't know if I can give you that, Scott. But our two largest customers are about 40% of our business. Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Forty percent, I'm sorry. John Kita : And why it gets really difficult is we're adding primarily distribution in tier two, okay? We're closing -- and the phenomena we talked about the end of, I think it was '12, continues. There's a significant amount of closures of new stores and opening of new stores with the net increase being -- the net being an increase. So it's a real struggle to try to get even same store sales and some of that data. Clearly, I'll tell you this, quarter-over-quarter, I think new store additions help us year over year. We have had a net just from the fourth quarter, third quarter, we added probably a net of 150 to 200 stores. But again, most of those are in tier two, tier three setting so that they don't have the same per volume throughput after tier one starts happening. John Kita : Another thing that's impacting us is the growth in online sales, which doesn't really have a correlation to number of those. And our online sales last year were on $16 million, and we hope that we'll double that this year. And when we look at the first quarter, it's suddenly on track to do that. Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Okay. So let me ask the question maybe a little bit differently here. If we look at the sales growth number, X out the inventory impact. Your sales were still kind of 15% plus op, right? I'm sorry, the inventory impact. John Kita : Right. Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Where I'm trying to get at here is that off of my past calculations, I have always assumed 5%-ish type of new distribution add to sales. Would it be fair to say that even if you don't want to get that granular, do you think that your same store sales are still outperforming China GDP? John Kita : I would say that same store sales are probably not outperforming. Ajita Rajendra : I don't know that we have. John Kita : Yeah. But it's a combination. As we've said, we're growing differently. We have a higher average price, okay, year over year. And as of new products, we have a change in mix. We have new distribution. We have answerably product line like water treatment, commercial combi growing much faster than the average. Then we have the inventory build. So I think that's a pretty consistent story in that. We continue to grow a lot of different ways, and that's why we're comfortable saying that on average we're going to grow 15%. Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies LLC : I got you. That helps. Thank you. My other question is about the acquisition environment. And I don't know if this means anything, but your corporate expenses were a little bit higher than what I was expecting. Was there an acceleration in due diligence work in the first quarter on M&A? John Kita : I think we've talked about corporate in our last conference call and we spent traditionally our first quarter because of LTI grants and the way we have to amortize them much quicker because some of the executives are getting retirement eligible. I think we highlighted that that the first quarter was going to be the highest corporate expense. We're still comfortable. When we said at the end of the year of 49, we think we can probably have corporate come in around 48 or so. Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies LLC :  Okay. So, I guess the bottom line to that question would be really squarely for you Ajita. Could you access any type of probability that you\u2019ll get a deal done in 2014? Ajita Rajendra : That\u2019s almost an impossible question because like I said we are looking \u2013 I\u2019m happy with what we see in terms of the pipeline and potential. Like we have said that when we layout our financial criteria the price that we\u2019re seeing becomes a concern especially given today\u2019s interest rates and competition from P/Es etc. who are essentially looking at a slightly different math. And we will continue to be a very disciplined acquirer to make sure that when we do make an acquisition that it would be where we see value creation, and it adds value to our shareholders. So, to be able to predict whether we can do or not, I wouldn\u2019t go there at this point. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from Aditya Satghare of FBR. Your line is open. Aditya Satghare \u2013 FBR Capital : So two questions. First on the China market here, how should we think about your growth in China in the context of overall water heater growth in China? How should we think about the utilization level of this factory as we go forward? Ajita Rajendra : Why don\u2019t I jump in and then John maybe you should add some color to it? In looking at the water heater factory, obviously we just started \u2013 I mean we started our production little after midyear last year and it\u2019s building as the volume builds. So, it\u2019s nowhere near in terms of being fully utilized and we didn\u2019t expect it to be. So from that perspective it\u2019s adding cost as we\u2019ve indicated and that\u2019s in our guidance. I mean it\u2019s in line with what we expected and what we\u2019ve seen. And the teams are working on productivity improvements and all the rest of things to mitigate that as much as possible again all in line with our expectations and guidance from when we opened the factory. So, not much change there.  What is the first question \u2013 oh, the water heater market in general. If you look month by month things go up and down, okay? But overall, Aditya, if you look at the last six months and our anticipation going forward is that we have gained market share and we continue to gain market share over an extended period of time. Month by month things go up and down. Usually in the first quarter we go down a little bit in market share because we pulled back with spring festival etc., we pulled back a little bit on our promotion and you\u2019ve seen that in the past. But overall the trend has been a slow increase in market share. We expect that over time to flatten out because obviously you can\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s not an unlimited thing to go in terms of market share. Overall, we expect that to flatten out. Aditya Satghare \u2013 FBR Capital : One more question on China then, so you mentioned three products which contributed strongly for China growth, you mentioned the gas products, the renewable products and I missed the third one. But how can we think about your market share in some of these high-end differentiated products and maybe sort of broadly touch on what are some of the key factor, the key differentiating points customers are willing to pay for in terms of your products? Ajita Rajendra : I think the best way to look at it, Aditya, is that we have a team there really spends a lot of time and money and effort understanding the consumer and consumer trends. And combining that with our product development capability and speed to market, we stay ahead, we have in the past and we continue to stay ahead of the trends in terms of where the market is moving and come out with the products with the features and benefits and become first [ph] to market with key features and benefits at the high end that people are prepared to pay for.  And so our portfolio and mix of products is always changing. If you go back a few years, our product line was essentially electric tank type water heater and when we saw tankless as being a market we wanted to get into, we made a big push-in to tankless and we\u2019re now the leaders in tankless in China. And similarly we\u2019re growing in renewable energy products. And also when we made, the based on our strategy and getting into adjacencies to leverage our core competencies in China like our brands, like our channels and access to market, we went into water treatment for a number of reasons, again to expand our customer base and bring them high quality products that live up to our brand positioning. And also we wanted to get into a business that has a much faster replacement cycle from the point of view of replacement filter. Now, we haven\u2019t seen the impact of that yet in water treatment, but we expect to see that soon. So, we\u2019re constantly changing our product line, our portfolio products to stay ahead of the market and market trends. That\u2019s a long answer I know, but that\u2019s the approach that we have in China and have been taking for some time now. Aditya Satghare \u2013 FBR Capital : Last question from my side coming back to the U.S. here. If we try to sort of strip the weather impact aside, is there anything in the U.S. market or any change in customer buying patterns or mix, which would suggest that consumers are replacing at a rate, which is higher than what you have seen over the last couple of years? Ajita Rajendra : I don\u2019t think so. I think what we\u2019re seeing is that they have been last year and this year in addition to new construction coming back as there has been a pent-up demand for remodelling and the discretionary replacement component of residential water heaters and we see that coming back. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Connors of Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is open. Ryan Connors \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott : Great. Thank you. First, I just had a quick kind of housekeeping question on a couple of bigger picture items. Just in terms of the buyback you mentioned that authorization has been up in the press release there. Can you give us some color around what your assumptions are in terms of the buyback and share count within the guidance? John Kita :  We\u2019re assuming kind of for the year probably low 91 million shares outstanding, so 91 million to 91.5 million somewhere in that range. Ryan Connors \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott :  And then two other things from my end, just first off on this you mentioned as FTXL boiler rollout for Lochinvar, our understanding is that that\u2019s somewhat of a true step change in terms of applying that type of technology to a broader set of applications. So I\u2019m curious what, how that rollout is proceeding and what the reception has been both internally and among your distribution in terms of that particular product? Ajita Rajendra :  It\u2019s been very high. Internally certainly, I happened to have dinner with and speak to over a hundred of our Lochinvar distributors and buy/sell reps really in the last week and the excitement level is very high. That\u2019s when they really saw the product we introduced with in addition to actually they went in and had a training, etc. and the excitement level is very high. So, there is a gap here in terms of fire-tube type boilers and what\u2019s in the market. So, this goes from about 400,000 BTU to 850,000 BTU range and bringing in introducing fire-tube boilers of this quality with these type of controls, etc. into that space is seen as a very positive move in the marketplace. Ryan Connors \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott : Okay, and will that product price \u2013 Ajita Rajendra : We\u2019re moving [ph] the product. They\u2019re just starting to ship. So, we haven\u2019t really seen the impact of sell through, third quarter we start to ship the product. So, again this is excitement level we\u2019re seeing. It\u2019s, we haven\u2019t really seen numbers yet though -- impacting our numbers yet. Ryan Connors \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott :  And is the intent to price that product at a premium I would assume? Ajita Rajendra :  It will be in line with Lochinvar pricing, which is the premium price product in the marketplace. Ryan Connors \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott :  Okay. Great. And then just a final question from me. You mentioned \u2013 John, I think you mentioned a nice acceleration in commercial market in March. Does your data give you any insight into what particular niches of the market are picking up there? John Kita :  No. We wished it did but it does not. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from Charles Brady of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Charles Brady :  With respect to the China and the water treatment business in your release talk -- you cited the margin in Rest of World as being largely attributable to better profitability on that business. Can you just speak a little bit in \u2013 are you seeing a growth trajectory in that water treatment that\u2019s picking up a little bit quicker than you expected or is it just a function of as we go forward in time the volumes get better and the profitability gets better there? BMO Capital Markets :  With respect to the China and the water treatment business in your release talk -- you cited the margin in Rest of World as being largely attributable to better profitability on that business. Can you just speak a little bit in \u2013 are you seeing a growth trajectory in that water treatment that\u2019s picking up a little bit quicker than you expected or is it just a function of as we go forward in time the volumes get better and the profitability gets better there? John Kita :  Well. I think we\u2019re seeing volumes pick up nicely especially on the AO Smith branded portion of it, I think, it was up almost 70% quarter over quarter and so we\u2019ve seen nice improvement in profitability mainly because of the volumes coming through, etc. where in most of our outlets [ph] which means a little more SG&A etc., but again the volume certainly helps. And what we saw for the first time has really even after amortization of customer list, etc., which is almost $3 million on an annual basis we saw it was very slightly profitable even after that, so compared to year ago there was a fairly significant loss. Charles Brady : Alright. Okay. And then just on Rest of World, you previously commented for the margin for the full year expected just under 13% EBIT margin. Is that still kind of in line with your expectations, has that moved it all? BMO Capital Markets : Alright. Okay. And then just on Rest of World, you previously commented for the margin for the full year expected just under 13% EBIT margin. Is that still kind of in line with your expectations, has that moved it all? John Kita :  No. I think as part of raising our range, we got a little more comfortable with that. I think last year was about 13.2% EBIT margin and even with the full year the new plant we think we can achieve those sorts of levels this year. Charles Brady : Correct. Alright. BMO Capital Markets : Correct. Alright. John Kita :  All in total. Charles Brady : Just one more from me. When you talked about the M&A strategy one of the comments you talked about, you walked away from some stuff and some stuff had been added to the acquisition pipeline and I guess, Kita [ph] on that particular comment, I don\u2019t know if that was an offhanded comment, obviously things moving in and out, but I am wondering if that speaks to an expansion of kind of the areas you\u2019re looking at, or what would have driven adding companies to that potential pipeline that maybe weren\u2019t on that list before? BMO Capital Markets : Just one more from me. When you talked about the M&A strategy one of the comments you talked about, you walked away from some stuff and some stuff had been added to the acquisition pipeline and I guess, Kita [ph] on that particular comment, I don\u2019t know if that was an offhanded comment, obviously things moving in and out, but I am wondering if that speaks to an expansion of kind of the areas you\u2019re looking at, or what would have driven adding companies to that potential pipeline that maybe weren\u2019t on that list before? Ajita Rajendra : I think we really have not expanded what we are looking at in terms of water technology companies, and companies and businesses that would leverage competencies in China. So from that perspective, the lens has not really expanded. But we discover new companies or potentials or find areas in which maybe there is value creation that we didn\u2019t see before, while we may see potential with private companies that are not in the market but we started discussion. So it\u2019s a combination of all those things. John Kita : And I think companies are coming up for sale that weren\u2019t \u2013 sale that was unavailable. Ajita Rajendra : Right, they have become more actionable. So it\u2019s a \u2013 it wasn\u2019t anything, it was perceptive for you to pick up that comment but it wasn\u2019t anything unusual happening. It\u2019s the ongoing evolution as we are very actively looking for potential companies in this space. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Rose of Wedbush. David Rose \u2013 Wedbush Securities : I may be a little bit late on this because I was on another call. But I don\u2019t believe you mentioned it. If you could touch upon and I know it\u2019s small, maybe your progress on India\u2019s water treatment business, and then secondly, I had a question on the ERP. Ajita Rajendra : We talked about India a little earlier. The business in India itself is going \u2013 we\u2019re happy with the business in India. We are expanding our market share slowly. We are expanding our points of distribution and the product is very well accepted in the marketplace. The Indian market is kind of stagnant right now, especially with the elections going on, and there is a lot of anticipation that once the election is done that the market will pick up again. When we translate our results into U.S. dollars, the results are disappointing, because a unit volume growth is essentially offset by the depreciation of the Indian rupee. And so from that perspective, the revenue and the profitability we see is disappointing. David Rose \u2013 Wedbush Securities : I am sorry, I actually \u2013 I can\u2019t \u2013 what I was asking is about the initiatives on the water treatment side, I am sorry, maybe I wasn\u2019t clear. Ajita Rajendra : Oh, I am sorry, go ahead, John. John Kita : Well, I mean we talked about on the last call that we\u2019re going to enter the water treatment market, and I think the intent really is to do it on a pilot basis, test the product out in certain regions. So we did not \u2013 we will have a decent amount of advertising et cetera but it will be more on a pilot basis we believe this year with more of a larger rollout next year. David Rose \u2013 Wedbush Securities : Okay. So we\u2019re still on track. Ajita Rajendra : Yeah. The water treatment market in India is about 3 times the size of the water heater market in India. And it\u2019s an established market with some strong players and what we want to do is to make sure that we have the products that live up to the brand positioning and can go in and make a really good impression and compete in that space. If we had to say things on track, I would say we are slightly behind. But we anticipate that, that\u2019s an exciting opportunity for us just like in China to be able to leverage the infrastructure that we are building in the market. David Rose \u2013 Wedbush Securities : And then on the ERP side, it was a headwind last quarter, this quarter and as we think about next year, have you been able to quantify the benefits better now that it\u2019s underway and does that provide a tailwind, not just the lack of the headwind for you next year? And then on the CapEx side, you\u2019ve commented the impact on the CapEx for \u201914, does that all go away for \u201915 or is there some carry on in \u201915? John Kita : Well, we should talk about \u2013 we\u2019ve talked about the fact that expense is about $10 million incremental, i.e. about $15 million for the full year. The biggest portion of that expense ends up being in the last half of the year. We are right now in the testing phase and much of that cost et cetera gets capitalized. So we saw $1 million plus expense hit in the first quarter. We will probably see a couple million in the second quarter but the majority of the impact from an expense standpoint will be the last half of the year. And we are pretty much right on track with what we thought it would be. The first rollout will be in August, then we will start rolling out next year at the remaining sites. So we never anticipated that in \u201915 there was going to be significant efficiency improvement, again because the majority of the rollout happens in 2015. So you will start seeing the benefits we think more in 2016. Operator : Thank you. I am not showing any further questions in queue. I would like to turn the call back over to management for any further remarks. Patricia Ackerman : Thank you all for joining us this morning to discuss our first quarter results. Happy Earth Day to all and enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today\u2019s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

Smith Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce you to your host for today's conference, Mrs. Patricia Ackerman. Ma'am, you may begin. Patricia K. Ackerman: Thank you, Terja. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2014 conference call. With me participating in the call are Ajita Rajendra, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Kita, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin with Ajita's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results [indiscernible] different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described on this morning's press release. In order to provide improved transparency into the operating results of our business, we are providing non-GAAP measures, including adjusted earnings, adjusted EPS and adjusted segment operating earnings that exclude certain items, as well as nonoperating pension costs consisting of interest costs, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gains and losses and curtailments. Prior year results are provided on a comparable basis. Reconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and also on our website. Ajita, I will turn the call over to you. Ajita G. Rajendra: Thank you, Pat, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Our strong performance in the second quarter was driven by solid growth and profitability across all our major businesses. Here are a few highlights. Our organic growth drove sales 8% higher to an all-time record of $595 million. China sales were up 17%, with gas tankless and water treatment products growing faster than the business as a whole. Our adjusted earnings of $0.66 per share were 27% higher than the $0.52 per share recorded last year and were primarily driven by higher sales. We continue to allocate a portion of our capital to returning cash to our shareholders. We repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares for $60.8 million this year through June 30. To allow us to continue to repurchase shares, our board increased its authorization by 1.5 million shares in April. We increased our dividend by 20% or more for the third consecutive year in early 2014. John will now discuss the results in more detail. John J. Kita: Thank you, Ajita. Sales for the second quarter of $595.4 million were 8% higher than the previous year, driven by higher volumes in water heaters and boilers in the U.S. and water heaters and water treatment products in China. Adjusted earnings of $60.3 million improved 25% from 2013. Adjusted earnings in 2014 excluded after-tax nonoperating pension cost of $3 million. Adjusted earnings in 2013 excluded after-tax nonoperating pension cost of $3 million and after-tax restructuring impairment expenses of $3.1 million. Adjusted earnings of $0.66 per share improved 27%, compared with $0.52 per share last year; effective income tax rate associated with second quarter adjusted earnings in 2014 up 27.8% compared with 31.5% for the same period last year. The rate this year was approximately 1 percentage point lower than the rate we previously disclosed, providing a $0.01 per share benefit to second quarter 2014 adjusted earnings per share. We expect the effective income tax rate for 2014 adjusted earnings will be between 28% and 29%, with the GAAP effective income tax rate almost 1 percentage point lower. A reconciliation from GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS is included at the end of this presentation and covers the previously discussed adjustment. Sales in our North America segment are $410.1 million, increased 5% over last year, driven by higher sales of U.S. water heaters and Lochinvar-branded products. Rest of World segment sales of $193.6 million increased 14% compared with last year. Sales in China increased 17%, driven by increased demand for water heaters and water treatment products and expansion of our distribution outlets in China. North America adjusted operating earnings of $67.1 million were 7% higher than last year, and adjusted operating margin of 16.4% was up slightly. A favorable impact from higher volumes in the U.S. were partially offset by higher steel price. As a result of higher steel prices and other cost inflation, we announced a mid-single-digit price increase in North America, which was effective May 1. Rest of World operating earnings of $29.3 million improved 30% compared with last year. Higher sales in China, lower selling and advertising cost as a percentage of sales compared with 1 year ago and improved profitability of water treatment products contributed to the improved operating earnings in the second quarter. As a result, operating margin improved significantly over last year to 15.1%. Our adjusted corporate expenses were $11.5 million, a decline from the prior year primarily due to significant M&A due diligence cost incurred in the second quarter last year. Cash provided by operations of $90 million through June 2014 was lower than the $105 million provided last year as a result of higher outlays for working capital in the 2014 period. We are expecting operating cash flow for the full year 2014 to be between $240 million and $250 million. Our liquidity position and balance sheet remains strong. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 16% at the end of June 2014. We have sizable cash balances totaling nearly $500 million located offshore, and our net cash position was almost $250 million, both as of June 30, 2014. During the first half of 2014, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of common stock for a total of $60.8 million under our 10b5-1 automatic trading plan. Considering the additional 1.5 million shares authorized in April by our board, we had approximately 1.4 million shares remaining on our existing repurchase authority at the end of June. Depending on factors, such as stock price, working capital requirements and alternative investment opportunities, we expect to repurchase approximately 1 million of the remaining authorized shares in 2014, pending approximately $110 million for the year. As a result of the share repurchase activity, we expect to end the year with approximately $300 million in net cash, similar to the level at the end of last year. This morning, we announced an increase to our adjusted earnings guidance of $2.34 to $2.40 per share. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance represents a 15% increase in after-tax earnings compared with our 2013 result. Nonoperating pension costs are expected to be $0.14 per share in 2014, slightly above the $0.13 per share in 2013. Recall that our pension plan will sunset in early 2015 for almost all beneficiaries. We expect this to result in a considerable reduction to our pension costs for 2015 and beyond. Our GAAP EPS guidance for 2014 is $2.20 to $2.26 per share. I will now turn the call back to Ajita, who will summarize the assumptions on our 2014 and 2015 outlook and reiterate our acquisition strategy. Ajita G. Rajendra: Thank you, John. As John mentioned, the midpoint of our updated 2014 guidance implies growth of 15% in adjusted earnings per share over the last year. Our outlook for 2014 includes the following assumptions : First, we continue to see strong growth in China. As many of you know, we are a consumer product business in that region and have invested significantly in brand building, innovation, safety and quality to sustain and enhance our position as the leading premium water heater brand. The return on our investment in engineering and innovation is one of our key success factors in China, along with distribution expansion and market share growth. The macro environment also provides 3-pronged tailwinds for our business : First, our premium consumer products with a highly recognizable brand are in the sweet spot of the government's desire to grow the consumption part of China's economy. Second, wage inflation has been increasing recently, and this is the expansion of discretionary income and growth in the middle class. And third, China recently set a goal for the population to be 60% urban by 2020. This equates to 10 million to 15 million people per year moving to the cities and thereby increasing the demand for apartments and water heaters. Combining all of these factors gives us confidence that we will grow at least at 2x China's GDP rate. Please note that we expect higher advertising expenses in China in the third and fourth quarter due to a catch up in ad spending from lower spending in the second quarter and seasonal advertising and promotional spending in the second half of the year. As a result, we expect second half operating margins in Rest of World to be lower than the first half operating margin. Second major assumption. Significant market acceptance of our water treatment products has supported our growth in China. Chinese consumers are becoming much more aware of the health risks associated with poor water quality, and our trusted A. O. Smith-branded reverse osmosis water treatment products fill this need. With less than 4 years selling these products in China, the A. O. Smith water treatment brand has achieved almost 20% market share in the organized retail channel. We added over 500 retail outlets to our water treatment distribution channel in 2014, resulting in approximately 3,400 outlets now selling our products. Studies we have seen estimate 40% annual growth of water treatment products in China for the next 5 years. We continue to invest in innovation and technology to serve this fast-growing product category and expect our A. O. Smith branded water treatment products to grow more than 50% this year, resulting in almost $100 million in water treatment sales in China and Turkey. Our success in water treatment is a classic example of what brand-, distribution- and innovation-driven new products can achieve in China. Third major assumption. We expect Lochinvar-branded sales to grow approximately 10% in 2014, well ahead of GDP growth in the U.S. as our Lochinvar brand is expected to continue to benefit from the transition from lower efficiency noncondensing boilers to higher efficiency condensing boilers. Additionally, we have received very positive feedback from the market associated with our recently announced FTXL boiler. The FTXL will launch late in the third quarter, and we believe this new product could shift some sales from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. Fourth, we are cautiously optimistic about the developing recovery in U.S. housing. After very strong water heater industry growth in 2013, helped by improved levels of home completion and significant expansion of the replacement market, we expect residential water heater volumes in the U.S. to be up to approximately 9 million units, including tankless, due to an increase in new home construction and expansion of the replacement market this year. We expect commercial water heater volumes will increase to approximately 162,000 units. Fifth, we implemented a mid-single-digit price increase for wholesale water heaters in May related to higher steel prices and inflation of other cost. The price increase has been accepted. Sixth, as we have discussed in the past, 2014 will be negatively impacted by approximately $10 million of incremental ERP implementation expense. All the incremental ERP expense is expected to occur in the third and fourth quarter, with the significant portion in the third quarter. The strength in our profitability in our Rest of World segment gave us confidence to upgrade a high-level 2015 outlook. We expect 2015 Rest of World margin to be 14%, up from 13%, and we revised our 2015 EPS to $2.60 per share from $2.50 per share. Our revised 2015 EPS is 10% higher than the midpoint of our 2014 guidance and reflects lower estimated outstanding shares as a result of our share repurchase activity. We maintained our 2015 revenue expectation at over $2.5 billion, which represents 7% to 9% annual growth. We maintained our North American forecast at 16% Our acquisition strategy has not changed. We remain focused on water heating and water treating companies around the world, as well as leveraging our brand and distribution channel in China. The acquisition landscape continues to be competitive as sustained price appreciation in equity markets, overall, and higher leverage allowed by banks in their loans to private equity firm drives sellers' expectations higher. We walked away from several targets primary because of price and new names have been added to our pipeline. Our teams are energetic and engaged. Our capital deployment strategies continue to support a combination of investments for organic growth, acquisition, share repurchase and dividend. You have seen this slide before. We show this only as another reminder that we will be a financially disciplined acquirer of companies within our stated corporate strategy. And that concludes our prepared remarks. And now we are open for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Scott Graham of Jefferies. R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : I have 2 questions for you, guys. The first one is about the corporate expense and the implications on M&A. Corporate expense was not only down on a year-over-year basis by a lot but literally down versus the last 4 or 5 quarters' levels. And I'm wondering what that means exactly, Ajita. Is -- was there just a lot less due diligence in the second quarter because the pipeline has thinned out? Is there any kind of read there on what the pipeline looks like? Has it weakened? John J. Kita: Scott, I'd say it's [indiscernible]. I'll talk to numbers, and Ajita can talk about the pipeline. The reason it sounds from last year is we spent a significant amount of money on 2 potential acquisitions in the form of due diligence. We got very deep into due diligence process, and it was very expensive. And it's one of the ones we've talked about, where we've walked away and we decided to walk away from that one because of price. So I would say last year's second quarter was abnormal compared to the other quarters. And we still have the same commitment in dollars, x due diligence, to acquisitions that we've had over the last several quarters. Ajita G. Rajendra: And Scott, in terms of M&A activity, in fact, in terms of the total market, everything we are hearing is activity level is up quite a lot. And we are seeing that, too. And the pipeline is very robust, as it has been in the past. So there is no decline in activity or our energies behind the right type of acquisition. R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Got it, okay. The second question relates to the ERP expenditure of $10 million heavily weighted towards the third quarter. It sounds to me like not a lot was expended in the second quarter. We know something was expended in the first quarter. I'm not sure if you gave that or not, but I thought I heard you say, Ajita, that all of the incremental was going to be in the second half of the year. And again, I thought that we had some rung up in the first quarter. So maybe if you can just kind of connect those dots for us. Ajita G. Rajendra: Yes, go ahead. John J. Kita: The incremental, we said last year, we spent about $5 million on the ERP. Much of that was in the first half of the year last year because they only started capitalizing the cost. The first half of this year will -- we spent about $3 million to $4 million, again capitalizing most of the cost. But our first go-live will be in August of this year. So then you stop capitalizing and you start amortizing. So that's why we're saying the incremental year-over-year will be about $10 million, which is consistent, $15 million versus $5 million, but it will be basically $10 million additional in the second half of the year, most of which is the third quarter. Ajita G. Rajendra: And on the whole project, we are right on track. So nothing has changed from the time we really started talking about it. R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Got it. So that -- would that imply then, John, something in territory of like $7 million to $8 million in the third quarter? John J. Kita: It's probably incrementally, probably about $6 million to $7 million, I think, over last year. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye of Northland Capital. Noah Kaye - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division : We're hearing some very positive commentary on your China water treatment products coming out of the Aquatech Shanghai expo last month. You gave us some figures on expansion of stores. Can you give us some figures on actual branded water treatment sales within China for the quarter? John J. Kita: For water treatment, first half of the year was up close to 70%. And we're expecting that to continue the last half of the year, although there will be some tougher comps compared to last year. So we said that water treatment, we think, will be up at least 50% for the year. And so you're right. There's been a real acceptance of water treatment in general. There is very low penetration of the consumer for water treatment. So we are very optimistic about potential growth. I mean, we -- Ajita mentioned that one of the market research companies has estimated that, that market could grow at 40-plus percent CAGR for at least the next 5 years and probably longer than that. So we are very optimistic about that market. Ajita G. Rajendra: The other thing, though, is that if you were at Aquatech, you saw the impact that the A. O. Smith brand has in that category in China. And it's one of those things that seeing it gives you the impression and gives you the right impression on the impact much better than trying to explain it. And so if you were there, you'd see the impact. It has clearly shown us as the leader in that market in China. Noah Kaye - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division : Right. And just as a follow-up, we've seen softer housing demand in China in the first half of the year. Homes targeted to affluent buyers have certainly not been immune. So how do you reconcile this with your strong sales and margin growth in China? And can you give some thoughts on how you would expect housing market will impact your China sales going forward? John J. Kita: You're right. The housing market has been relatively weak, but I think we've been pretty consistent on how we've said we'll grow. We grow a lot of different ways. We grow by gaining market share. We did that during the quarter, specifically on the gas side, additional distribution outlets that we did. Some of our ancillary product lines, like water treatment, are growing much faster than the 15% we'd highlighted. So certainly, that's helped us. We think the replacement market continues also to grow some. So that's been a benefit. So we have not been totally dependent on new housing, which is good because it has slowed down, but we think that's a potential upside for us because ultimately, housing will come back there we believe. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran of Robert Baird. Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : So first, on the residential side, just could you talk about what the different channels are looking like there? Obviously, you've talked about strong replacement, maybe a little bit more muted new housing but certainly something on the right path. So could you talk about what you're seeing in those 2 channels, as well as what you're seeing through the various wholesale, retail-type channels as well? John J. Kita: We saw -- you probably saw the AHRI data for April and May. And they were relatively flat, but June was a very strong month. And so we've seen that. I think the wholesale has been a little bit stronger than the retail, which indicates maybe that there is some new housing going on, et cetera. But we're -- we originally forecast the industry to be up about 9 -- it's about 300,000 units up to about 9 million units for the year. And right now, we're very comfortable with that estimate. Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Makes sense. And then the 2 cost items that you've talked about in China, specifically, one, could you help us triangulate on -- more from a magnitude perspective how that advertising expense will swing either year-over-year or as we go from the front half to the back half? And then also, just an update on how the new facility is trending and if there's any still lingering headwinds there or how that's working through. John J. Kita: Yes, there still are some headwinds from the new facility, and we expected that. Again, when you're adding incrementally right on the edge, we had halfway [ph] for 2 million units in the old facility, and we added 1 million. And certainly, we are not filled with capacity on the new one. It's having some headwinds, which we expected, so nothing unusual there. At the advertising, 2 things about the advertising : Historically, when we look at advertising, first half to second half, the second half is 0.5% to 1% higher. And that's just really a function of prime water heater sales in September to December, covering the Fall Festival, et cetera. So when we look at those numbers, that's historically what it was. But in addition, the second quarter, our national ad spend was lower than what would be normal. And we expect to pick that up because, as alluded to earlier, we're going to spend more money nationally on television regarding water treatment, et cetera, and making sure that our brand is recognized in that category. So it will be higher, without a doubt, the last half of the year compared to the first half. When we look at the full year -- and that takes out some of the volatility, we started Rest of World by saying it would be less than the prior year. We said that when we got out of the first quarter -- I mean, at the end of the year. Then in the first quarter, we said it would be about equal. And now we're very comfortable that full year margins will be higher than the prior year. So they're making very good progress when you look at the whole year on their operating margin. Ajita G. Rajendra: Just to add one thing. That also drove us, partially, to improve our outlook for next year, Mike. Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : That absolutely makes sense. Just want to make sure I understood the moving pieces. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charley Brady of BMO Capital Markets. Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Can you comment on the price increase that went through in May? Do you think that had any pull-forward impact on Q3 sales? John J. Kita: Not really because it probably had a little bit of impact in April, but it would have cleaned itself out, we think, by the end of May. So we really don't think at this point -- I mean, traditionally, the third quarter is less, and we certainly expect that to be the case again this year. But we don't really think there was any pull forward for the whole quarter. Ajita G. Rajendra: There was pull forward within the quarter from month-to-month, but it was contained within the quarter. Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Right, right, okay. And then just back on the advertising expense comment on Rest of World in Q2, you said it's below what would normally be seen in Q2. Can you quantify -- so the margins in Q2 Rest of World were certainly a bit better than we had modeled in. I'm just trying to square up how much of that was just kind of maybe a shift because advertising expense kind of moved into Q3 from Q4. Actually, what I'm asking is, how much was the lower adverting spend the Rest of World benefited margins in Q2? John J. Kita: So lower advertising compared to the prior year was almost down 1%, and that was probably a lower run rate than we would expect on an ongoing basis. And again, the biggest factor was national TV advertising and lower spend rate in the second quarter compared to normal, I'll say. And we'll make that up. There was some -- the World Cup finished in the third quarter, and we were pretty aggressive with some national advertising for that, et cetera. So we'll make that up. Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. And there's one more, just kind of maybe an update on India. What -- any change there, any positive movement one way or the other? John J. Kita: I would say India is kind of at the same run rate we expected. As you know, about 75% of the sales come in the second half of the year. So it's really hard to gauge until we get into that. I mean, there's been some positive talk about the election and the new leader. Time will tell if that will pass through into the market. That's relatively recent. So it hasn't happened yet. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of William Bremer of Maxim Group. William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division : I'd like to go right to Lochinvar. Can you sort of give us a sense of the growth there, as well as do we have operating margins there up year-over-year? John J. Kita: Well, we had very nice growth in Lochinvar. I think we said in the first quarter, it was up about 7% year-over-year. And now we've said year-to-date is up 10%. So the math works, it was obviously above 10% the second quarter. The margins were relatively flat, and we knew that. We're spending a fair amount on engineering and also selling, associated with the new products that are coming out. But margins were relatively flat, which is what we were expecting for Lochinvar. So they had a very good quarter. Ajita G. Rajendra: Yes. And just to add a little more color to that. In the first quarter, the 7% we said, it was impacted by the cold weather because people were having a hard time getting around and replacing boilers, et cetera. And they caught up in the second quarter. So we are at the 10% rate that we've been talking about. And the new products that we've announced have been very, very well accepted, and the reviews have been terrific. We start shipping that the latter part of the third quarter and in the fourth quarter. And those new products, as John mentioned, the investment in engineering is an ongoing process at Lochinvar. And these are not the last of the new products that you are going to be seeing there. It's an ongoing process, and we have some very exciting new products on the drawing board, which we'll be seeing at very constant frequency out in the future. William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division : Nice color, Ajita. And can I expect the second half to be greater again than the first half? John J. Kita: Well, I mean -- again, we expect sales for the year to be 10%. So I'd say yes, we'll expect sales to grow. But again, there will be the margin impact from the engineering and the selling associated with the new product, but... Ajita G. Rajendra: We'll have the normal... John J. Kita: We have a good year. Ajita G. Rajendra: Right. We will have the normal seasonality, first half versus second half being a little stronger. John J. Kita: Right. William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division : And my final question regarding Lochinvar is just the international strategy going forward there and then timing of that. Ajita G. Rajendra: It's moving forward. Like we said, the market in China is not quite ready for the condensing-type products that Lochinvar sells and has, clearly, the chief [ph] position in. But it's coming. There are indications it's coming. And it's been a little slower than we anticipated when we made the acquisition, but clearly, the market is evolving. Operator : And our next question comes from Sam Eisner of Goldman Sachs. Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I just want to go back to the SG&A comment on the Rest of World segment. On a dollar basis, how much -- was there a benefit from lower advertising expense this quarter? John J. Kita: This quarter, the advertising spend was pretty similar to the prior year, okay. But as a percent of sales, because we had a 17% increase, it was significantly less as a percent of sales. Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : All right. And then in regards to Shanghai Water Treatment, is that business, kind of going forward, now fully profitable? I know that -- I think last quarter, you were breakeven or just slightly profitable. So I'm just curious what the expectations are for that. And then looking out to 2015, what is the expected profitability for that business now that you're raising guidance by about 100 basis points? John J. Kita: What we really said, Sam -- and we said it at the end of the year, that when we looked at our full water treatment business last year, it lost about $3 million. And that was primarily amortization of customer lists associated with the acquisition. Then we said earlier this year that we thought it would be about breakeven, and now we're confident it could be nicely above breakeven. So we would anticipate this year, even after the $3 million of amortization, the entire water treatment business will be at $2 million to $3 million P&L benefit. So that's a pretty big swing from the prior year. Ajita G. Rajendra: And just to add something to that, Sam, the -- we're not trying to maximize the profitability of the water treatment business right now because we are investing in terms of advertising and new products and all the things that are required to drive the growth in that business. And the other point is -- and we don't -- the gross margins of that business are very nice. And so we know that long-term profitability of that business is going to be right in line with the rest of our product lines in China. Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Understood. And then as it relates to the 2015 expectations, the 100-basis-point increase, is that all because of the water treatment business? Or are there other kind of benefits in there as well? John J. Kita: No. I think it's just evolved. Certainly, that's a positive, but we've leveraged some of our SG&A as we've gotten larger. And the contribution from the higher volume that we expect next year, we still are comfortable when we look to next year at 2x GDP. So that's 15% or so. So that will, obviously, contribute nicely. So I think it's all of those factors. Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Great. And then just lastly, on India, given it's back halfway, and I think, John, you alluded to this in an earlier question, just curious what the expectation is for profitability of that business. I believe for the last few years, it's been breakeven or maybe even slightly down because of current space. So curious how you guys are thinking about that into the back half of this year? John J. Kita: Well, when we said, Sam, at the end of last year, I believe that they lost -- India lost about $5 million in total in 2013. We also said at that time that we expect to lose a similar amount. I think as we look at 2014, we'll probably lose -- we'll probably lose maybe a little bit less but certainly in that $4 million to $5 million range again. Operator : And our next question comes from Matt Summerville of KeyBanc. Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : A couple of questions. First, on the commercial side of the business in North America, you gave a little bit of granularity in terms of the month of June on the residential side. Can you provide some qualitative or quantitative comment on what you saw in your commercial business in June? And I guess, why -- you're obviously embedding in your guidance only 3% growth in commercial year-to-date. It's, obviously, tracking comfortably north of that. Can you help reconcile that? John J. Kita: Yes. If you look at April and May, I think the industry was up 10% or 11% or something. And we saw similar-type numbers in June. So yes, commercial has been very strong. I mean, anecdotally, when we talk to the people in the field, there's the combination of replacement, repair, remodel, retrofit, and there are some pockets of new construction. So it's all of those things contributing. We're calling for the last half of the year right now to be flat to down a little bit. That's the potential upside. Again, we don't have quite as good as information to forecast that. The architectural index has turned positive a little bit. So time will tell. But you're right, it has been running better than that year-to-date. Ajita G. Rajendra: And we hope you are right. Second half is stronger. Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : On the ERP items, is it -- will that be reported through the North American segment? Or will some of that hit corporate? How should we model it? John J. Kita: The majority will go through North America. Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then just lastly, with respect to China, sort of 2 questions, what's the magnitude of FX headwind that you're encountering in Rest of the World? And how does that compare to how you would have originally thought about it heading in the year? And then is there -- in percentage terms, can you break down, as you sit here, year-to-date in China how much of your revenue is coming from water treatment versus legacy electric versus newer products like gas instantaneous? John J. Kita: Well, what I can say is all of them are up, certainly water treatment and instantaneous, because I mentioned we've gained some market share up there the most. But electric is also up nicely for the quarter and year-to-date. The first part of the question was -- oh, FX. Are you talking on the sales side? Clearly, on the sales side, FX has had a negative for us because when we did the planning for the R&D, we did a 6 05, and it's running at 6 20. So that's a headwind of a couple percent right here. And so we're modeling 6 20 for, I believe, the third quarter; 6 15 for the fourth quarter. They -- the -- from a standpoint of cost, it hasn't been too significant this year because the rupee has appreciated a little bit comparable to R&D. So I mean, we haven't had big headwinds from a cost standpoint. Where we are having some headwinds, quite frankly, and we've talked about it, is Canada purchases. We closed the Fergus plant last year. They're buying from the U.S. The Canadian dollar continues to be weak. So that has had some negative impact on earnings the first half of the year. Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : And then, John, just maybe one more. Is there any sort of early information you can give us regarding 2015 and the ERP implementation and quarterly cadence or first half, second half cadence of any incremental spend you anticipate next year? John J. Kita: As we look at it, we've said this year, the expense will be about $15 million. And we would guess next year, the expense will be about $15 million also. That will probably be more the first half than the second half. I'd be guessing, but I'd say -- let's say, $10 million, first half; $5 million, second half or so would be my best guess at this point in time. So we expect it to be relatively level year-over-year. So we won't have that headwind that we had this year of the incremental $10 million. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of David Rose of Wedbush Securities. David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division : I think most of mine have been answered, maybe just a couple of small ones. On the water treatment, I don't understand your selling to Turkey. Is that correct? And I'm assuming that's not meaningful, but is that somewhere you're gaining a little bit more traction? John J. Kita: Turkey was actually down. Turkey is kind of C&I market. So it's more project sales. So in the quarter, they were down less than $1 million. That can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. So we purchased them, I guess, a year ago, January. Sales were projected to be around $10 million. And I think they'll track pretty close to that, maybe down a little bit below $10 million, but I think it's proceeding okay. Ajita G. Rajendra: Yes, it's proceeding on track. David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And then are you starting to get any replacement business from your RO membranes? John J. Kita: Yes. When we talked to our people, the consumable numbers for this year are expected to be $3 million to $4 million. So it's starting to come in. As we've talked about, one of the advantages of this product is the main membrane doesn't have to be replaced. The main filter doesn't have to be replaced for almost up to 3 years. But some of the filters get -- other filters -- there is 4 or 5 of them in there, get changed periodically, annually, for example, on a couple of them. So we'll see a little growth in consumables this year, year-over-year. So we're expecting $3 million to $4 million. David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division : Right. And then lastly, you didn't call it Internet sales. Is it something that you're starting to get still more momentum? Can you give us a number? John J. Kita: Yes. Internet sales did extremely well. First half of the year, they're almost $20 million. Last year, the entire year, was about $15 million. So we're expecting that number to at least double year-over-year. And that's a combination of water heating and water treating. So Internet sales are doing extremely well. Ajita G. Rajendra: And we continue -- we expect that trend to continue out in the future. Operator : And at this time, I'm showing no further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the call back over to management for any further remarks. Patricia K. Ackerman: Thank you for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to us, and I'll be happy to spend a little more time with you about the business. And on behalf of the Ajita and John and myself, enjoy your day. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

O. Smith Corporation Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Patricia Ackerman, Vice President Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead. Patricia Ackerman : Thank you, Kate. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2014 conference call. With me participating in the call are Ajita Rajendra, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Kita, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin with Ajita\u2019s remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include among others, matters that we have described in this morning\u2019s press release. In order to provide improved transparency into the operating results of our business, we are providing non-GAAP measures, adjusted earnings, adjusted EPS and adjusted segment operating earnings that exclude certain items as well as non-operating pension costs consisting of interest costs, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gains and losses and curtailments. Prior year results are provided on a comparable basis. Reconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and also on our website. Ajita, I will now turn the call over to you. Ajita Rajendra : Thank you, Pat. And good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Our strong performance in the third quarter was driven by solid growth and profitability across all our major businesses. Here are a few highlights. Our organic growth drove sales 8.5% higher to $582 million. China sales were up 16% with gas tankers and water treatment products growing faster than the business as a whole. Our adjusted earnings of $0.59 per share were 9% higher than the $0.54 per share recorded last year and were primarily driven by higher sales, which more offset $6 million in incremental ERP expenses. We continue to allocate a portion of our capital to returning cash to our shareholders. We repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares for $87 million this year through September 30th. We increased our dividend by 20% or more for the third consecutive year in early 2014. We are on track to return approximately $160 million to shareholders this year. In August, we successfully completed our first ERP go-live milestone. I commend our team for their laser focus on a successful outcome. The remaining go-live events are planned to occur in 2015. John will now describe our results in more detail. John Kita :  Thank you, Ajita. Sales for the third quarter of $582 million were 8.5% higher than the previous year driven by higher sales of water heaters and boilers in the U.S. and water heaters and water treatment products in China. Adjusted earnings of $53.5 million improved 6% from 2013. Adjusted earnings in 2014 excluded after-tax non-operating pension costs of $2.9 million. Adjusted earnings in 2013 excluded after-tax non-operating pension costs of $3.2 million and after-tax restructuring and impairment expenses of $1 million. Adjusted earnings $0.59 per share improved 9% compared with $0.54 per share last year. The effective income tax rate associated with third quarter adjusted earnings in 2014 was 27.9% compared with 25.7% for the same period last year. The rate last year benefited from several non-recurring items. Consistent with previous disclosure, we expect the effective income tax rate for 2014 adjusted earnings will be between 28% and 29% with the GAAP effective income tax rate almost 1 percentage point lower. A reconciliation from GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS is included at the end of this presentation and covers the previously discussed adjustments. Sales in our North America segment of $392.4 million increased 6% over last year driven by higher volumes of U.S. residential water heaters and commercial boilers and a price increase in May. Rest of World segment sales of $198.5 million increased 13% compared with last year. Sales in China increased 16% driven by increased demand for water heaters and water treatment products and higher customer inventory levels in advance of the fall holiday. North America adjusted operating earnings of $56.3 million were 1% lower than last year and adjusted operating margins of 14.3% was lower as well. The favorable impact from higher volumes and prices in the U.S. were offset by higher steel costs and an incremental $6 million in plant ERP implementation cost. Rest of World operating earnings of $30 million improved 12% compared with last year driven primarily by higher sales. Operating margin of 15.1% declined slightly from one year ago as a result of higher selling and advertising cost as a percent of sales in China. Our adjusted corporate expenses were $10.6 million, a decline from the prior year primarily due to higher expenses related to management incentive programs in 2013. Cash provided by operations of $164 million through September 2014 was lower than the $188 million provided last year. Higher earnings were more than offset by higher outlays for working capital in the 2014 period. We are expecting operating cash flow for the full year 2014 to be between $225 million and $235 million. Our liquidity position and balance sheet remain strong. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 16% at the end of September 2014. We have sizable cash balances totaling nearly $525 million located offshore, and our net cash position was almost $270 million, both as of September 2014. During the first nine months of 2014, we repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares of common stock for a total of $87 million under a 10b5-1 automatic trading plan. Considering the additional 1.5 million shares authorized in April by our board, we had approximately 840,000 shares remaining on our existing repurchase authority at the end of September. Depending on factors, such as stock price, working capital requirements, and alternative investment opportunities, we expect to repurchase approximately 490,000 shares of the remaining authorized shares in 2014, pending approximately a $110 million in the full year. As a result of the share repurchase activity, we expect to end the year with approximately $275 million in net cash. This morning, we announced an increase to our adjusted earnings guidance of $2.37 to $2.41 per share. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance represents a 16% increase in after-tax earnings compared with our 2013 results. Non-operating pension costs are expected to be $0.14 per share in 2014, slightly above the $0.13 per share in 2013. Recall that our pension plan will sunset on December 31, 2014 for almost all beneficiaries. We expect this to result in a considerable reduction to our pension costs for 2015 and beyond. Our GAAP EPS guidance for 2014 is $2.23 to $2.27 per share. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Ajita, who will summarize the assumptions in our 2014 outlook and our growth strategy. Ajita? Ajita Rajendra : Thank you, John. As John mentioned, the midpoint of our updated 2014 guidance implies growth of 16% in adjusted earnings per share over last year. Our outlook for 2014 includes the following assumptions. First, we continue to see strong growth in China and we expect over 17% growth in the region in 2014. Second, we expect Lochinvar-branded sales to grow approximately 10% in 2014, well ahead of GDP growth in the U.S. as our Lochinvar brand is expected to continue to benefit from the transition from lower efficiency non-condensing boilers to high efficiency condensing boilers. We are encouraged by the acceptance in the market of the newer higher efficiency products in the Lochinvar portfolio. Specifically, we are seeing the CREST boiler being increasingly specified in projects. Additionally, we have received very positive feedback from the market associated with our recently announced FTXL boiler, which was launched late in the third quarter. Third, we are cautiously optimistic about the developing recovery in U.S. housing and the strengthening demand for commercial water heaters driven by replacement and retrofit activity. Fourth, we successfully implemented a mid-single-digit price increase for wholesale water heaters in May related to higher steel prices and inflation of other costs. Fifth, as we have discussed in the past, 2014 will be negatively impacted by approximately $10 million of incremental ERP implementation expense. The fourth quarter will be impacted by $3 million to $4 million of incremental cost and this is in line with our past guidance. I would like to dive into our growth model in a little more detail, first China. As many of you know, we are a consumer product business in China. We have three growth drivers underpinning this business which give us confidence to project an annual growth rate of two times GDP for the foreseeable future, first is overall market growth. EMM which is a retail channel research firm that we have quoted many times in the past, predicts water heater market growth to be 7% in China this year. With continued urbanization, growth in the middle class and the developing replacement and upgrade markets, we expect strong market growth to continue for quite some time. The second growth driver is market share gains and increases in average price. We have a strong market position by value in the electric wall-hung category. Our position in gas tankless while a leader is less than 20% by value and we see opportunity to continue to gain more share with our well accepted quiet model. Increases in average price are also part of this growth driver. Our commitment to engineering resources will continue to result in new products with features and benefits in which consumers see value and for which they\u2019re willing to pay an incrementally higher price. The third growth driver is fast growing ancillary product categories, the most significant example of which is water treatment. A. O. Smith branded water treatment grew $25 million in 2013, which added 5 percentage points of growth to our overall China business in 2013. This year we expect water treatment to grow to almost $90 million with the A. O. Smith branded portion totaling approximately $70 million. CMM projects, Point of View\u2019s water treatment products in China to grow 40% per year over the next five years. Combining these three growth drivers gives us high confidence that we will continue to grow at two times China\u2019s GDP rate into the future. Certainly China is part of our strong organic growth profile, but it\u2019s not the whole story. As demonstrated by achieving year-over-year organic growth of 7% or more over the last eight quarter, we believe our organic profitable growth profile of 8% per year for the foreseeable future differentiates A. O. Smith from its peers. A solid and expanding replacement demand and minimal exposure to Europe underpins the faster growing pieces of our business. And these are; 15% growth expectation for China, which is 30% of our business, 10% growth expectation for [locking] of our branded products, which is 12% of our business and the remaining 58% of the business, which is almost exclusively North America water heater, is reasonably expected to grow at 4%. The weighted average of these three pieces comes to 8%. And we are comfortable that this organic growth projection -- we\u2019re comfortable with this organic growth projection for the foreseeable future. Our acquisition strategy has not changed. We remain focused on water heating and water treating companies around the world, as well as leveraging our brand and distribution channel in China. The acquisition landscape continues to be competitive as sustained price appreciation in equity markets overall and higher leverage allowed by banks in their loans to private equity firm drives sellers\u2019 expectations higher. Our teams are energetic and engaged. Our capital deployment strategies continue to support a combination of investments for organic growth, acquisition, share repurchase and dividend. You have seen this slide before. We show this only as a reminder that we will continue to be a financially disciplined acquirer of companies in our stated corporate strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we are opened for your questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Matt Summerville - KeyBanc: Hi, just a couple of questions. First, can you talk a little bit about the inventory situation that you called out with respect to China, sounds like things maybe at a little built up here over the last couple of months. And is that more of a normal factor is this something unexpected I guess that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to understand? John Kita : I think Matt as you go into the fall holiday; it\u2019s not unusual for them -- for our customers to build up some inventory. I think it happened last year\u2019s third quarter and this year it\u2019s a little bit more of a pickup than last year\u2019s third quarter. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything significantly out of the ordinary. Matt Summerville - KeyBanc: And can you just revisit -- and I apologize if you said this in your prepared remarks, it is my last question. In terms of commercial water heater market volume what you expect for 2014 was embedded in your guidance and then similarly for residential in North America? John Kita : Sure. When we look at 2014 commercial it\u2019s been relatively strong year-to-date. The third quarter we\u2019re thinking was pretty flat to up maybe a little bit. We\u2019re estimating that fourth quarter will be flat with the prior year which gets you to 164,000 to 165,000 units. Last year is pretty much tracking where we sat, we said beginning of the year we were estimating 9 million units, we haven\u2019t come off that. And as you know that\u2019s up 4%, 5% from the prior year. Matt Summerville - KeyBanc: Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies. Your line is open. Scott Graham - Jefferies: Hey, good morning. I don\u2019t want to read anything into it, because I don\u2019t think that there needs to be right into it, but the China full year sales guide kind of suppose fourth quarter of up \u201812, just wondering off of -- particularly off of the previous question. Is there anything we should be reading into that or is that just some of that inventory order change or the change in dynamic of orders for the fourth quarter versus that third quarter build? Ajita Rajendra : Yes. I think it could be impacted by a little bit of the inventory build. We would certainly expect the fourth quarter to be up double-digits. Quarterly growth can be lumpy due to variety of reasons including promotional activity inventory levels and previous year\u2019s comparisons. So, we\u2019re still very comfortable projecting two times GDP going forward and we think fourth quarter will be double-digit. Scott Graham - Jefferies: Okay. Thank you. John, I think it was you who said last quarter that the company was kind of looking to sort of freeze the cash balance and use the excess, the overage of free cash flow more for share repurchases. And certainly we have seen a pick-up in share purchases this year but now you\u2019re talking about cash balance that has actually declined for the first time in a while in the third quarter and will decline again in the fourth quarter. Again, just trying to read tea leaves here, are we now\u2026 John Kita :  Scott, what we said is we are going to try to keep our net cash balance for the year relatively constant with the prior year. Last year, it was $290 million. We would expect this year, it will be $275 million to $280 million. So I would read anything into it. That resulted though in us buying back $110 million or so of stock. And so that was really the focus as to keep the net cash balance relatively stable but we can only estimate it so close. Scott Graham - Jefferies: Right, and I get that. But I guess my question is my extension of that John is, are we seeing that the pace of 2014 share repurchases is kind of in the absence of acquisitions what we should see after 2014? John Kita : Well, we haven\u2019t said what we\u2019re going to do after 2014 but we did say, in 2014 we want to keep that net cash balance about constant and that we still think acquisitions are potentially the best value added opportunity for shareholders. But until we get that acquisition, we were comfortable proceeding in 2014 the way we did. So, as we look at our plan, and come out in the first quarter I mean in January of next year, we\u2019ll evaluate where we are for 2015 at that time. Scott Graham - Jefferies: All right. Thank you. And last question, more for you Ajita. As you can see, I really have no questions operationally. The question I have is more about share -- I am sorry, acquisitions to finish off John\u2019s point. Is there anything you could tell us to give us some type of temperature check on where this process is, it\u2019s been a long time coming, we understand asset prices are higher, private equity a little bit looser with the cash but it\u2019s been sometime and is there any way for -- is the temperature hotter now than it was in the second quarter or the first part of the year and if so why? Cold you give us some type of breadcrumb here on, where -- how hot the water is on the M&A side? Ajita Rajendra : Like I said in the past, the activity level is high. If I look at last few months, it\u2019s been as high as it has been in the past. And the timing of this is very difficult to judge obviously; companies come in the market and we don\u2019t control that timing. We do also target companies and it depends on how those conversations go. So, it\u2019s very difficult to predict that as you know. But from our perspective and our strategy, nothing has changed. We\u2019re looking for the right type of acquisition and we\u2019ve laid out the criteria that we have and we are being very disciplined about sticking to that criteria. And as John said, we believe long-term the best value that we could bring our shareholders is making the right acquisition. Scott Graham - Jefferies: Right. You have shared with us on that though that you have walked away from situations, be it price for or for extended due diligence reasons. So I guess my -- I am wondering again looking for these breadcrumbs again, Ajita, just wondering if we are closer to the altar on anything now than we were at the beginning of the year? John Kita : Scott you know I can\u2019t comment on that. Scott Graham - Jefferies: Well, I was hoping you could, other companies do in fact. But if -- I know you guys do keep it a little bit closer to the best, but that\u2019s all I had. I was just hoping for a little bit more on this because it\u2019s been as you know more than three years running? John Kita : I understand. Scott Graham - Jefferies: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye with Northland Capital. Your line is open. Noah Kaye - Northland Capital : Thank you, Ajita and John and congratulations on another strong quarter. If I could touch on China that 16% growth -- you\u2019ve given some good granularity, let me put a little more detail on how to think about where the growth is taking place. Can you break it down a little bit in terms of the mix and water heaters the replacements versus new housing demand? And then also touch on as you have in the past the online versus the retail mix? Ajita Rajendra : Well, I\u2019ll say our online continues to be very strong. Last year it was $15 million for the full year. We originally estimated it would double, but by the end of the third quarter we were over $30 million. So we expect that to run pretty close to $40 million for the year. So that continues to do very well. The replacement versus new housing, I can only give you anecdotal kind of based on our survey. Our people would say the replacement is picking up, where they would have used a number of 35% or so of the market one or two years ago. They are now saying it\u2019s approaching 50% specifically in the tier one steady. So, and I said anecdotal, that\u2019s our survey data. As you know there isn\u2019t good HRI and housing completion data like there is in the U.S. where we can be more specific and confident in that replacement new ratio, so that\u2019s about the best I can do. Noah Kaye - Northland Capital : Sure. I understand. And margin in China were again very much lower, again really strong and you\u2019ve guided I think previously to a much lower EBIT rate for the year. Is there a reason I think for the fourth quarter to expect some meaningful additional expenses in China and Rest of World that would kind of bring it back down or are we continuing to track above that as we look for the fourth quarter? Ajita Rajendra : Well, the third quarter beyond us, the margins did surprise us a little bit. We have said SG&A would be up from the second quarter and it was, and it was up a couple of points we talked about. However gross margin because of some mix et cetera was also up. So we weren\u2019t anticipating the gross margin mix positive that happened. When we look at the fourth quarter, SG&A will continue to be up, I mean it is traditional we talked about it last meeting about advertising being up in the second half of the year and we except that to continue. We do also as we look at India from a sales standpoint some things have come up. India was tracking a little bit behind last year and then we mutually agreed to wind down our crow banding relationship with our largest distributor in India in the third quarter due to some channel conflict issues. So absent those sales, we\u2019re expected to be up 20 percentage here, but unfortunately we\u2019re going to be down about $4 million with that customer mostly in the fourth quarter. So that will have some affect on margins, but again we still think we\u2019ll be up, Rest of World year-over-year fourth quarter margins will be up. So, India has taken a little bit of a detour, we pass them long-term. We still think it\u2019s a good place to be. We think we\u2019ll be able to replace those sales as we go forward. And the core business is still seeing some growth. Noah Kaye - Northland Capital : Great. Thank you so much. I\u2019ll jump back. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of William Bremer with Maxim Group. Your line is open. William Bremer - Maxim Group : Good morning, good morning. Ajita Rajendra : Good morning. William Bremer - Maxim Group : Nice quarter. Let\u2019s go in for Lochinvar, can we get a sense on their revenue growth this quarter and I know you\u2019re guiding for 10% for the year, but can you help us get a little more granular in terms of their operating margin and going into the winter season now more specifically on their aftermarket? Ajita Rajendra : Well, as you know as we get in for the third and fourth quarter their aftermarket does pick up and we would expect that to be the case again. It might be monotonous, but they were up about 10% again this quarter and they continue to do everything that they said they will do. Their margins are very comparable to last year even when they have higher engineering and selling, so they continue to perform very well. For the year we expect them to be up about 10% with comparable margins again given that they\u2019ve put a lot in engineering this year and a lot in selling, I think they\u2019re doing extremely well. William Bremer - Maxim Group : Can you talk about specifically their expansion plans and not just here domestically, but potentially internationally? Ajita Rajendra : Well, we\u2019ve talked about the new products; the FT XL will come out late in the third quarter. We expect it to be well received. Good electronics and they will be more efficient than the competition in that space. They have some other product line expansion planned for next year that we think will also be beneficial. China I think we talked about in the last meeting, the condensing is moving slower maybe than what we\u2019re anticipating. But we think there is some potential opportunities as we develop products for maybe the non-condensing in China that\u2019s going to take most of next year to develop those products. But we\u2019re still optimistic I would say on China long-term for the boiler business, but probably the condensing is going to take a little longer than we originally expected. William Bremer - Maxim Group : Okay. And then let\u2019s go into India a little bit. Can we discuss what your strategy is now going forward and are you starting to think about bringing in the water treatment portion to this and I mean what\u2019s the strategy going forward for India at this point? Ajita Rajendra : I think the strategy has not changed at all. I think this relationship that we had with this customer, we expected at some point would that we\u2019d go our different ways because of some of the channel contract that was built in. It came a little faster than we anticipated, but that\u2019s kind of what built into our longer-term plan. Without that customer, we\u2019ll still grow at 16% to 20% in India this year. The economy we feel is improving. The economy has been slow but it is improving. And the longer term strategy in terms of building our brand, building it with water heaters and then expanding it into water treatment has not changed. William Bremer - Maxim Group : Okay Ajita, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Samuel Eisner with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Samuel Eisner - Goldman Sachs : Yes, thanks very much. And good morning everyone. Ajita Rajendra : Good morning. Samuel Eisner - Goldman Sachs : Just going back to some of the comments that John was making before on the rest of world profitability, it sounds as though that gross margin was a bit better than you expected, you said because of mix and then et cetera. I\u2019m just wondering if you could expand on really what is driving the profitability in rest of world and if you could even call out what the profitability on water treatment was that\u2019d be very helpful. John Kita : Well water treatment, I guess all I can really say about water treatment on an annual basis is last year we lost about $3 million in water treatment and we have talked about a $2 million or so profit this year. And everything we\u2019re seeing that still on track. And I think that\u2019s relatively equally spread across the four quarters. So, there is nothing unusual there. And I\u2019m not sure the rest -- it truly was a mix in China. So, China had extremely good quarter, better than we would have said, we would have projected because of that gross margin improvement. And that was really mix, some of the customers carry higher margins and those had higher sales in the quarter. Samuel Eisner - Goldman Sachs : And then if you look at your guidance for the year, I believe that implies around $0.60 in the fourth quarter. So, you just reported $0.59 quarter, should we be thinking about your business as essentially flat on a sequential basis, is it accelerating or was it slowing throughout the course of the quarter, just I want to help understand what that\u2019s really implying for the fourth quarter. John Kita : Well, you\u2019re right. The midpoint is $0.60 and that\u2019s a 15% increase over last year. So, that\u2019s a positive. As we look at the businesses, we look at as I mentioned that we expect commercial to be relatively flat year-over-year. So, we don\u2019t expect to get benefit from that. We do expect Lochinvar to continue to be up, that will be beneficial. And then as I have said, China, we expect to be up double-digit, but we could have some margin changes there, because we\u2019re not expecting the repeat of the gross margin improvement but we are committing to doing additional SG&A. And then as we talked about India\u2019s profit will be down because of -- when I said we lost about $4 million with that customer, as you can understand since the fourth quarter is where 60% of our sales are much of that loss will be apples-and-apples to the fourth quarter of last year. We\u2019ve said India is going to lose $5 million; it will probably lose a little bit over $5 million with this adjustment. But I think I go back to Ajita\u2019s statement, when you look at our organic relative 8%, we\u2019re comfortable with that going forward and on a quarter-to-quarter basis you can have some internals, but we\u2019re certainly comfortable, we have a growing business which will add growing profitability. Ajita Rajendra : And also when you compared to last year, it\u2019s about a 50% improvement over last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Samuel Eisner - Goldman Sachs : I understood. And then if you just look over the course of the quarter if I just look at July, August and September, did you see any deviation in the rate of growth either in Rest of World or within the U.S. for your business? Just trying to understand if exactly are accelerating or decelerating or basically saying flat throughout the course of the current quarter that you just reported? John Kita : Well, it\u2019s always dangerous to look month-to-month, but I\u2019ll say that the resi and commercial are relatively strong in September. But again, I\u2019d be careful taking going too much with that, because it\u2019s in very month-to-month, but it was clearly stronger and China I think will just continue to be consistently that increase. So I wouldn\u2019t to say I anything bowing down... Ajita Rajendra : Yes. And I would just reinforce that it\u2019s so difficult to see it month-by-month. I mean if you look at the AHRI data for August, I\u2019m sorry July and August it was relatively flat to up a little bit. But based on our September, we expect September to be high. But again, overall the quarter is pretty good. Samuel Eisner - Goldman Sachs : Great. Thanks so much. I\u2019ll hop in queue. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charley Brady with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Charles Brady - BMO Capital Markets : Thanks. Good morning. Ajita Rajendra : Good morning. Charles Brady - BMO Capital Markets : Just can we talk about on the price increase that you had in May. Are you now or did you -- are you recovering the steel costs now and have you seen any continued escalation in the material costs? Ajita Rajendra : Well, as you\u2019re aware, steel costs are up, as well as inflation was up for things like healthcare et cetera and that\u2019s really what drove the price increase. And that was the factor for it. And steel prices as you know have stayed high and even increased over the year as things have gone on. So I mean it is what it is. Steel has stayed up there. Charles Brady - BMO Capital Markets : Right. So is it fair to say then it\u2019s a little bit more of a margin headwind or does another price increase come through at some point this year? Ajita Rajendra : We can\u2019t talk about future price increases for sure. Clearly steel was up pretty dramatically especially when you look at last year to this year, it was up pretty dramatically. I mean the CRU numbers are out there that say it was up significantly. Charles Brady - BMO Capital Markets : Okay, thanks. And just on your -- I\u2019m assuming there is no change to your expectation for how things starts in the U.S. given that your resi unit volumes about the same? John Kita : Right. We\u2019re still at that million or so in completions, I think about 900,000 or so, so really no changes in our assumptions there. And as I said, the resi volumes are pretty much tracking where we thought they would be. Ajita Rajendra : And we\u2019ve been pretty consistent with that right from the beginning of the year. Charles Brady - BMO Capital Markets : Right. Just one more for me then on China, can you give us some granularity on the growth rate you\u2019re seeing in the Tier 1, Tier 2 cities versus some other smaller Tier 3 Tier 4? Is there a large bifurcation for the growth rates between those tier cities? John Kita : Well, I guess I\u2019d say Tier 2 continues to grow and become over 40% I think of our sales. We\u2019re just right now I would say and Ajita you may know better than I do kind of looking at parallel trading Tier 3 and Tier 4 and then certainly as we go out into the future that\u2019s an area we\u2019re going to focus on. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019re significantly out there right now. We\u2019re still in that 6,000 plus distribution outlets in total. Charles Brady - BMO Capital Markets : Right. And I think some of the smaller cities are also being penetrated by the online sales. John Kita : Right. But certainly as you look, we do look as part of our growth going forward. I think Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities will play a part in there without a go. Charles Brady - BMO Capital Markets : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Rose with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. David Rose - Wedbush Securities : Good morning. Since most of my high level questions have been answered, I do have a couple of others. One is, if you could break out the inventory a little bit for us in terms of where you think it might be more concerning for you in China in terms of -- is it price point, is it Tier 1 or Tier 2 where do you think you maybe most inflated and why? And then if you could on that just also provide us a little bit more color on the consumable piece for the water treatment business, I know it\u2019s relatively small, but maybe just a little bit of update on that? Thank you. John Kita : I\u2019ll take the last one first. I don\u2019t think there is anything really new in the consumable. We\u2019re probably looking at $2 million to $3 million. I think I might have said 3 to 4 last quarter, but I had incorrect number, it\u2019s probably closer to $2 million to $3 million. We do think as we\u2019ve talked about we\u2019ve tried to do some things. Our recent release in July makes all the filters proprietary now use that term a little bit loosely because you have to be able to enforce it, but we certainly think in the future that consumables will play a bigger part and we\u2019re doing everything we can to try to maintain that proprietary filters in our systems. So that\u2019s clearly something we look at. And as we go forward, we think it will become a bigger part of our business. And as we go through our planning phase, we might have a better feel for that. But as we talked about those four or five filters in each -- our old system and they have to be replaced at different time lines. Number two, the inventory, really not much and again, I don\u2019t want to overemphasize the inventory. With the holidays, you would normally have a build up in the third quarter. It was a little bit more than last year, could have a minor effect on the fourth quarter. But again, we still expect growth in the fourth quarter to be up double-digit. And really nothing distinct about that inventory growth; it\u2019s with our major customers which you would expect. David Rose - Wedbush Securities : Okay. And then one more if I may, can India be breakeven next year? And what if so, what does it take for you to be breakeven? John Kita : I\u2019ll take a shot at it. We said that it\u2019ll lose $5 million this year, we certainly have every intention and we think we will improve the profitability of the water heater next year. We talked about last year, we were doing some vertical integration, bringing more of it in-house; we expect to have that done towards the end of this year. So, we will see some improvement. I\u2019m not sure given the loss of this customer that we can get all the way to breakeven, but we certainly anticipate we\u2019re going to have improvement in the water heater business next year. I think the wildcard will be water treatment for evaluating how we roll that out and clearly when you have a new role like that, that has some expenses associated with it. So, I think we\u2019ll be in a better position to kind of talk about India when we do our year end review. David Rose - Wedbush Securities : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : I\u2019m not showing any further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. Patricia Ackerman :  Okay. Thank you very much for your attention to our company this morning. And you all have a great day. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does concludes the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a good day.",

Baird William Bremer - Maxim Group Noah Kaye - Northland Capital Patrick Wu - BMO Capital Markets Aditya Satghare - FBR Capital Markets David Rose - Wedbush Securities Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee Operator : Welcome to the A.O. Smith Corporation Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Now, I would like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Ms. Patricia Ackerman, you may begin, ma'am. Patricia Ackerman : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and thank you for joining us on our 2014 results conference call. With me participating in the call are Ajita Rajendra, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and John Kita, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin with Ajita's remarks, I would like to remind you some of the comments that will be made during this conference call including answers to your questions will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others matters that we have described in this morning's press release. In order to provide improved transparency into the operating results of our business we have provided non-GAAP measures, adjusted earnings, adjusted EPS and adjusted segment operating earnings for 2013 and 2014 that exclude certain items as well as non-operating pension costs, consisting of interest costs, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gains and losses and curtailment. Reconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and also on our website. Ajita, I will now turn the call over to you. Ajita Rajendra : Thank you, Pat and good morning ladies and gentlemen. 2014 was another excellent year for A.O. Smith. We continued to see the benefits in our performance from an improving economy in the U.S. and our expanding consumer business in China. Here are a few highlights; our organic growth drove sales 9% higher to a record $2.36 billion. China sales were up 18% with gas tankers and water treatment products growing faster than the business as a whole. Our adjusted earnings of $2.43 were 18% higher than the $2.06 per share recorded in 2013 and were primarily driven by higher sales which more than offset approximately $9 million in incremental ERP implementation costs which were incurred in 2014. We continue to review our capital allocation and dedicate a portion to return to shareholders. We repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares for $104 million in 2014. We increased our dividend by 25% last January and last evening we announced a 27% increase to our dividend. In 2014 we returned approximately $160 million to shareholders. In 2014, we celebrated 140 years of serving our customers with honesty and integrity. These values lie at the heart of our success and longevity and they will continue to underpin our culture well into the future. John will now describe our results in more detail. John Kita : Thank you, Ajita. Sales for the full year of $2.36 billion were 9% higher than the previous year, driven by higher sales of water heaters and boilers in the U.S. and water heaters and water treatment products in China. Adjusted earnings of $221 million improved 16% from 2013. Adjusted earnings in 2014 excluded after-tax non-operating pension costs of $13.2 million, adjusted earnings in 2013 excluded after-tax non-operating pension costs of $11.9 million, after-tax restructuring and impairment expenses of $16.4 million and a $6.8 million after-tax gain related to a settlement with the supplier. Adjusted earnings of $2.43 per share improved 18% compared with $2.06 per share in 2013. A reconciliation from GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS is included at the end of this presentation and covers the previously discussed adjustments. Sales in our North America segment of $1.6 billion increased 7% over 2013, driven by higher volumes of U.S. water heaters and boilers which were partially offset by lower water heater sales in Canada primarily due to the 7% decline in the Canadian dollar. Sales growth of Lochinvar-branded products exceeded 10%. Rest of world segment sales of $768 million increased 15% compared with 2013. An 18% increase in China sales driven by increased demand for water heaters and water treatment products and our higher priced product mix was partially offset by lower sales in India resulting from weakness in the housing market and the termination of a co-branding relationship with our largest distributor. North America adjusted operating earnings of $253 million were 7% higher than the previous year and adjusted operating margin of 15.6% was flat. The favorable impact from higher volumes in the U.S. was partially offset by higher material costs and approximately $9 million in incremental planned ERP implementation costs. Rest of world operating earnings of $107 million improved 21% compared with 2013, driven primarily by higher sales. Operating margin of 13.9% improved from the previous year as a result of improved performance in China which was partially offset by larger losses in India. Losses in India totaled $7.5 million in 2014 including approximately $1 million of product development and advertising costs related to our planned 2015 launch of water treatment products. Our adjusted corporate expenses were $46 million, a decline from the prior year primarily due to higher interest income in 2014 and higher expenses related to management incentive programs and due diligence activities in 2013. Sales for the fourth quarter of $627 million were 12% higher than the previous year, driven by higher sales of water heaters and boilers in the U.S. and water heaters and water treatment products in China. Adjusted earnings of $58 million improved 20% from 2013. Adjusted earnings in 2014 excluded after-tax non-operating pension costs of $4.3 million. Adjusted earnings in 2013 excluded after-tax non-operating pension costs of $2.9 million and after-tax restructuring and impairment expenses of $2.7 million. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings of $0.64 per share improved 25% compared with $0.52 per share the previous year. A reconciliation from GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS is included at the end of this presentation and covers the previously discussed adjustments. Sales in our North America segment of $431 million increased 13% over 2013, driven by higher volumes of U.S. water heaters and commercial boilers. We believe some of the increase in our U.S. residential water heater volumes was due to the customer inventory build in advance of the NAECA 3 efficiency standard change in April 2015. Continued strong performance from our CREST family of condensing boilers drove sales of Lochinvar-branded products up over 10% from the fourth quarter 2013 levels. Rest of the world segment sales of $203 million increased 10% compared with the previous year. Sales in China increased over 15% driven by increased demand for water heaters and water treatment products and were partially offset by lower sales in India. North America adjusted operating earnings of $71 million were 21% higher than the previous year, primarily due to higher volumes. Adjusted operating margin of 16.5% increased significantly as well. Rest of world operating earnings of $22 million improved 9%, compared with 2013 driven by the impact from higher China sales which was partially offset by higher advertising costs in China and a $3 million loss in India. Operating margin was essentially flat from one year ago as a result of larger losses in India which offset margin improvement in China. Our adjusted corporate expenses were $11 million, a decline from the prior year primarily due to higher expenses related to management incentive programs in 2013. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 29% which was at the high end of our previously disclosed range compared with 26.6% for the previous year. Cash provided by operations of $265 million in 2014 was lower than the $282 million provided in 2013. Higher earnings were more than offset by higher outlays for working capital in the 2014 period. Our liquidity position and balance sheet remains strong. Our debt to capital ratio was 14% at the end of 2014. We have sizable cash balances totaling over $540 million located offshore and our net cash position was over $300 million at the end of 2014. During 2014, we repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares of common stock for a total of $104 million under a 10b5-1 automatic trading plan. At the December meeting our Board increased the authorized shares available for repurchase by 2 million shares. Considering this increase, we had approximately 2.5 million shares remaining on our existing repurchase authority at the end of December. Depending on factors such as stock price, working capital requirements and alternative investment opportunities, we expect to spend approximately $100 million on share repurchase activity in 2015, resulting in net cash levels around $300 million similar to 2014 year-end levels. We expect our cash flow from operations in 2015 to be between $270 million and $280 million, similar to 2014. Our capital expenditures in 2014 were $86 million which included approximately $32 million related to our ERP implementation. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $100 million to $110 million in 2015 which includes approximately $20 million to support the ERP implementation and approximately $30 million related to capacity expansion in China and in the U.S., to support Lochinvar-branded sales. Our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $66 million in 2015 compared with $60 million in 2014. We successfully completed our first ERP go live milestone in August 2014. We expect the remainder of our planned sites to go live in 2015 and 2016. ERP implementation expenses were $14 million in 2014 and are projected to be about $20 million in 2015. We estimate our effective tax rate to be between 29% and 30% in 2015 and higher than in 2014 due to one-time benefits in 2014 such as the R&D tax credit. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $48 million in 2015. This morning we introduced our 2015 EPS guidance of $2.65 to $2.80 per share. The midpoint of our EPS guidance represents a 12% increase in after-tax earnings compared with our 2014 adjusted results. We expect our earnings per share in the first half of 2015 to be flat or up only modestly compared with 2014, due to the following factors; we expect to experience inefficiencies and one-time costs associated with the NAECA transition in the first half of 2015. We expect the benefits of NAECA 3 pricing will be effective about mid-second quarter. We believe our first half volume will be impacted by the 2014 year-end pre-buy and we expect ERP costs which will be about $20 million in 2015 and spread equally over the year which results in an incremental $3 million higher expense in each of the first two quarters of 2015 compared to 2014. As previously mentioned the majority of our pension plan sunsets on December 31, 2014. GAAP pension expense in 2014 was $28.6 million of which $6.9 million was included in adjusted earnings. GAAP pension expense plus costs related to our replacement plan for the sunset pension plan are expected to be approximately $4 million in 2015. As a result, we do not plan to report adjusted earnings beginning with the first quarter of 2015. I'll now turn the call back to Ajita, who will summarize the assumptions in our 2015 outlook and our growth strategy. Ajita? Ajita Rajendra : Thank you, John. As John mentioned, the midpoint of our updated 2015 guidance implies growth of 12% over last year. Our outlook for 2015 includes the following assumptions; first, we continue to expect strong profitable growth in China driven by expected overall water heater market growth, market share gains, improved product mix and water treatment product growth significantly higher than two times GDP. Collectively, we expect these drivers to deliver growth at two times China's GDP growth rate. Second, we forecast Lochinvar-branded product sales to continue to grow at the brisk 10% pace at which they have grown or exceeded since we purchased the business in 2011. This is well ahead of GDP growth in the U.S. as our Lochinvar brand is expected to continue to benefit from the transition from lower efficiency non-condensing boilers to high efficiency condensing boilers and new products driven by market leading innovation. The launch of our FTXL boiler line late last year has been very well received. We're expecting similarly strong acceptance from our newly introduced expansion of the CREST boiler family which will target the 850,000 to 2 million BTU power portion of the condensing boiler market. We're showcasing this new product offering at the AHR Expo this week in Chicago. Third, a regulatory change in the energy efficiency standards of residential water heaters sold in the U.S., governed by an update to the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act or NAECA 3, will become effective in mid-April. Water heaters which do not meet the new efficiency standards can no longer be manufactured after April 15, 2015 impacting approximately 80% of our U.S. residential water heater SKUs, the new compliance products are more expensive to manufacture. We have announced to our customers an average residential price increase of approximately 20% on these products to cover our costs. Fourth, we're cautiously optimistic about the developing recovery in U.S. housing and the strength in demand for commercial water heaters, driven by replacement and retrofit activity. We estimate 2014 residential water heater industry volumes were up 6% over the prior year, partially driven by a pre-buy ahead of the NAECA 3 regulatory change. We estimate 2014 commercial industry volumes were up by a similar percentage and achieved a new high. We expect the housing market in the U.S. to continue to recover, but due to the pre-buy in the fourth quarter of 2014, we expect industry water heater shipments in 2015 to be flat or up modestly. Fifth, we continue to seek ways to leverage our strong brand and distribution channel in China. Launching an A.O. Smith branded water treatment product line in 2010 was our first foray into a new product category in the region. Growing A.O. Smith-branded water treatment sales from $18 million to $75 million in the last two years continues to prove that our assets and know-how in China are very valuable and that our team in China understands the drivers required to succeed in the very competitive and crowded China marketplace. Total China water treatment sales in 2014 were $90 million, including $15 million of sales which were not branded A.O. Smith. China Market Money or CMM estimates that the point of use water treatment category in China will grow over 40% per year over the next five years and we're excited about the opportunity and pleased with the market share gains that we have achieved through leveraging our brand, our engineering and our distribution strength. In China, our brand attributes include quality, reliability, safety and trust. These attributes translate very well to air purifiers, the fastest growing home appliance in category in China as measured by CMM. Partnering with a Japanese manufacturer, we expect to launch the A.O. Smith brand air purifier in China early in the second quarter in 2015. An investment for the future, air purifier sales are expected to be less than $10 million in 2015 with losses of approximately $4 million primarily related to advertising and promotion costs. Sixth, we remain optimistic about the long term opportunity in India and we're committed to the country with the second largest population and the second fastest growing economy in the world and its developing middle class who desire quality of life products. India is an investment for the future and our 2014 sales were $15 million, about $5 million lower than 2013 due to the termination of a co-branding relationship with our largest distributor and contraction in the water heater market, due to weakness in the housing market. As a result, the 2014 loss of $7.5 million was larger than the $5 million loss we incurred in 2013 and includes approximately $1 million of product development and advertising costs related to the planned 2015 launch of water treatment products. In 2014, we completed an expansion of our Bangalore facility which extends the range of water heaters produced locally and accommodates future demand. The expansion also serves as a platform to launch residential water treatment products in India this year. We have developed a point of use product family specifically for India, collaborating with our engineering expertise in the U.S. and in China and plan a limited product launch in India in 2015. We expect the entry into the water treatment category and continued investment in brand building activities to offset expected performance improvement in our water heater business, resulting in losses in 2015, similar to those in 2014. Overall sales in India are expected to be $20 million to $25 million in 2015. Seventh, we expect North America operating margins to be approximately 16%, similar to our previous disclosure and a slight improvement from 2014. Our rest of world margins are projected to be between 13.5% and 14% and will be impacted by the net investment in the launch of A.O. Smith branded air purifiers in China. This graphic sums up the organic growth potential we see in our businesses going forward. In fact, we expect North America water heater sales will grow faster than 4% in 2015 as a result of the price increase on our NAECA 3 compliant products and result in total Company sales growth of approximately 10%. Each of our teams understand the drivers of this growth potential and we're investing behind these drivers. Our acquisition strategy has not changed. We remain focused on water heating and water treating companies around the world as well as leveraging our brand and distribution channel in China. The acquisition landscape continues to be expensive as sustained price appreciation in equity markets, lower financing costs and the lack of organic growth for many strategic buyers have been driving prices higher. Our teams are energetic and engaged and our capital deployment strategies continue to support a combination of investments for organic growth, acquisitions, share repurchase and dividends. You have seen this slide before and we show this only as a reminder that we will be a financially disciplined acquirer of companies within our stated corporate strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks and now we're open for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Scott Graham with Jefferies. Scott Graham : I would like to maybe if you could run us through a little bit the P&L impact of the energy efficiency standards. So you're increasing prices on 80% of your North American residential units by 20% and that starts in the middle of the second quarter. Will that hit full run-rate in the third quarter? John Kita : I'm not sure I heard it completely. But I guess I would say I think I heard full run-rate in third quarter. Yes, we expect as we said in the first half of the year, we'll have some operating inefficiencies, some one-time costs and then the price increase, on average assuming there will be some pre-buy which we're trying to limit, will probably be mid-second quarter as we said. So by the third quarter, yes we should be at a full run-rate. Scott Graham : And it looks like your margin is going to hold up pretty well, even though it's a higher cost. John, are you saying that you [inaudible] this year and came up with a price increase that's based on materials that you could get - so you can change that 15% margin? Is that kind of how strategy went? John Kita : I'm not sure I heard the whole question. I mean, I guess I would say we're maintaining our margins. Clearly, there is a cost increase associated with this move and as we've talked about in the past, we have said our aspiration for North America was 16% operating margins. We were very close to that in 2014 and we expect to be there in 2015. It's a combination of items, some of which is Lochinvar, we expect better performance. We have talked about in 2014 they were affected by higher engineering costs, higher sales costs as they brought two new products to the market and we expect better performance from them in 2015. So all-in-all-- Ajita Rajendra : And since they are growing faster than the rest of North America, the mix is getting better because Lochinvar is getting to be a bigger part of our overall mix. So all that put together, we'll meet our 16% guidance that we have been giving in the past. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Halloran with Robert W. Baird. Mike Halloran : So could you help on some of the pre-buy activity here? Maybe how much do you guys estimate was in the fourth quarter? And then are you expecting a comparable amount of pre-buy to occur in the first quarter? John Kita : Our best guess is, we had a strong December. We assume the industry will have a strong December. So we would guess there was over 100,000 unit pre-buy in the fourth quarter. Our guess would be the first quarter would probably be up, the industry will be up from the prior years by maybe 100,000 units. We certainly will limit the amount of pre-buy, but we would expect the industry could be up. But we may see the ramifications of that then in the second quarter. Obviously there is guessing going on, but that would be our best guess. Mike Halloran : Okay and fair to assume then that whatever pre-buy you see in the fourth or first quarter probably gets pulled out of the second quarter. As you responded to Scott's question, you should be pretty much through that inventory that built up by the end of the second quarter? John Kita : That would be our best guess. Mike Halloran : And then use of cash from here, you have obviously increased the dividend. You increased the buyback authorization though, I think on a year-over-year basis the level of share repurchases is expected to be the same. How are you thinking about that in terms of what is still going to be pretty strong free cash flow? And what would be the levers that would cause you to increase how you think about that share buyback on an annualized basis from here? John Kita : Well, we have said there is really four capital allocation options with number one being organically. You can see we're doing relatively significant capital expenditure investment in our business, to really support the growth that we're seeing. Number two is acquisitions, we're still very actively looking at acquisitions and think that's the best value creation and I would say in this interim period, we felt from a cash buy back standpoint that we want to hold our net cash position level. So we're estimating that after CapEx and after everything, we'll generate about $100 million, after dividends, after CapEx and that's what we're estimating then for the stock buyback. As you said, we also increased the dividend. So those are the four options. Those haven't changed, and it still leaves us in a position to make value-added acquisitions. Operator : Our next question comes from William Bremer with Maxim Group. William Bremer : First question, let's go into Lochinvar. Can you give us a little insight in terms of the provisioning of aftermarket as well as what you are striving to longer term there? Whether or not we start to gravitate and take this internationally has always been a question and just in terms of how many and the education that's needed there, it is a very high margin business and just wondering what the strategic plan there is going forward? John Kita : Well the replacement market continues to be 10% or so of its business and it's also growing at about 10% a year. So it is staying right up at that level. We've talked in the past about international, we still think China is a very viable market for Lochinvar. The education of the whole industry if you will to condensing is taking a longer time than we expected. So we're actually developing some products that will maybe be competitive in the high-end, high BTU non-condensing market which we hope we're going to be able to take to China in the second half of the year. So we think longer term clearly China is an opportunity for their business and we'll continue to explore that. William Bremer : The new product launch in terms of the air purification. Can we go a little granular there? Is this more on the residential side? Is this more on the commercial side and what's the overall strategy there, going forward? Ajita Rajendra : Will, what we\u2019re seeing here is as we look at China, we have some tremendous assets in China. Primarily our brand, our distribution, our market know-how, our manufacturing capability, etcetera and we have been looking at ways in which we can leverage these capabilities in China and when we look at our brand and the strength of the brand and the attributes of the brand, behind high quality, high reliability, high level of trust and we also see in the Chinese market, the fastest growing appliance right now is the air purifier. And so we partnered with a Japanese company to produce residential air purifiers and we see this as an opportunity. This is a niche opportunity for the Chinese market. We don't see this as being a global business for us but it is an opportunity for us to leverage the very strong assets that we have in China for to help continue our growth. William Bremer : And my final question is just on commodity prices. Overall global steel prices, while they'll lower year over year, really and truly have not matched the dramatic declines that we have seen in coal and iron ore. Can you possibly just comment on what you are looking at and what you are seeing, that may be a tailwind for you later on this year? John Kita : Well it's hard to say, clearly steel still is at the level that is relatively comparable to last year's first quarter. There has been a recent decline but as we all know, that is relatively volatile, so it can go either way. So at this time, we're projecting it staying at the levels it's at and maybe increasing a little bit later in the year, but we've been wrong on forecasting where steel has gone for a while. Operator : Our next question comes from Noah Kaye with Northland Capital. Noah Kaye : There has been a lot of attention in the market to FX, heading into next year. Can you talk about how FX foreign exchange assumptions factored into your overall sales assumptions? John Kita : Well, from a sales perspective, Canada, we do a fair amount of business in Canada over $100 million, so it does have an effect obviously therefrom a sales translation as well as an earnings translation and we have built that into our assumptions. China, the currency has been around the 6.20 range or so. It's gone down to 6.10, it's gone up to 6.25. Obviously if that were to move dramatically one way or the other that would have an impact, but it's been pretty much at 6.20 for a while. Those are the two major ones. As you know, we do not have much presence in Europe, and so we do not have that concern and issue, that other companies are talking about. So it's a factor, but not a significant factor for us. Noah Kaye : Okay. Again for 2015 sales assumptions, how much are you thinking about in terms of water treatment sales? John Kita : Well as we talked about, we have had tremendous growth there over the last two years. The industry is expected to be up 40%, so that would certainly be our objective to grow that $75 million branded portion by 40%. Noah Kaye : Okay. And then finally to return to North America, we've seen some pretty robust construction sales estimates, growth estimates for 2015. You mentioned that it is possible Lochinvar seemed to be, it's going to take a little bit more on the residential side. Can you talk a little bit more about potential upside? Because I think we look back at 2014, commercial volumes obviously grew faster than what you had guided for. How are you thinking about that for next year? John Kita : Well, you're right. We have been conservative on commercial, we have been surprised, we actually grew 10,000 units last year, we're at an all-time high. I can assure you commercial construction is nowhere near where it was in 2007, when it was at the all-time high. And we've talked about it, it's a variety of factors. It's retrofit where new restaurants are going in. It's redundancy. Our area of the small hotel and restaurant build is doing okay, so it's a variety of items. And at this point, since we haven't done a very good job, we've kind of punted and said we will expect it to be about flat. We have been hearing this construction build story now for the last two or three years. It has not happened, certainly vacancy rates are down so potentially it could happen this year and that would be upside if the industry is higher than 167 because as you know we have good market share in that area. Operator : Our next question comes from Charles Brady with BMO Capital Markets. Patrick Wu : This is actually Patrick standing in for Charlie. Just one quick question online sales in China. I think there was commentary there was commentary that it was $50 million in 2014. What was the amount for the fourth quarter and what is the year-over-year growth for the quarter versus the prior quarter? Just trying to get better color on that. John Kita : To be honest, I don't have the quarter over quarter growth. I mean, it's been growing sequentially throughout the year. We've forecasted that next year it could approach $90 million to $100 million. It's an area that our management team looked at very closely three or four years ago and started building up the internal capability to do it, so they have been ahead of the market from that standpoint and it's been very successful for us, but I do not have the sequential growth. Patrick Wu : Okay. What is the channel outlet count, in China, to end the year? And what were the incremental additions in the fourth quarter? Is there any new changes to the mix that we should be aware of in terms of Tier 1 and Tier 2s? John Kita : The channel distribution is a little bit interesting. We were up about 500 net-stores for the year, that's to about 7500. Now that's higher than you would have heard in the past, because as we've done more looking at things, we had about 1000 stores, historically, that were small stores, Tier 3 and 4 that were not included in our count and now we're. So the bottom line is the net stores were up about 500. We expect them next year to be up about 300 net. There continues to be the opening and closing. The distribution of stores is about 62%, so it's moving up a little bit, Tier 2 and above compared to Tier 1. But still, the majority of our sales are still in Tier 1. Patrick Wu : If I may just squeeze in one more? For India obviously it is still an unprofitable part of the business right now. What are your assumptions, what is the company's assumption in terms of when that may turn the corner? After $20 million to $25 million in sales, I think you mentioned for cash in 2015, what is the profile not margin there? Can we expect that to turn the corner this year or what is the outlook there? John Kita : I think what we said is that we do expect it to improve. We lost about $6.5 million in the water heater business last year which was about $1.5 million more than the prior year that was really driven by the termination of the distributor, mutually agreed upon by both parties which affected the sales by about $4 million to $5 million and the decline in profit. We've also experienced because I would have to guess because of the uncertain in the whole political situation, etcetera there, coming up to the elections, the housing market was clearly down. So we saw the market down, that's the color of what happened. What we expect to happen in 2015 is sales to grow $5 million or so on the water heater side and improve the profit by a couple million dollars as we vertically integrate and have higher sales. Much of that will be used up though in the water treatment which is the market that is probably three times the water heater market which we think is an opportunity. So that's why we're saying net, net, net, we will be about the same. When we look at breakeven analysis and that is always dangerous because as you are looking at currency and all other things, the water heater business was about a $15 million business, we would think we have to get to a level of $30 million to $35 million or so to get to a breakeven on the water heater. Operator : Our next question comes from Aditya Satghare with FBR Capital Markets. Aditya Satghare : So I had two questions, one on the Lochinvar and one on the water treatment. So, on Lochinvar sales continued to increase about 10%. How far are we from a normalized mix for the industry in terms of this continuing market share shift? John Kita : We think we still have room to go. The last data we saw, the condensing was about 40% of the market. The estimates we have seen is that could move to 60% to 65% in the next 3 or 4 years, so we think we'll still have some tailwind there. But the other thing that is important to realize about Lochinvar is they continue to bring out new products and the products have been very well received in the marketplace. So it is the combination I would say of the market helping us as well as the innovation of the new products. Aditya Satghare : And then on the water treatment, could you maybe talk about some of the similarities or differences between the Chinese and the Indian market and what lessons from China could you potentially apply as you go into India in that market? John Kita : With respect to water treatment? Aditya Satghare : That's right. John Kita : Well, we're certainly using the design people in China to coordinate with the people in India to develop a product specific for India. One of the biggest differences is China is primarily a below the counter type product, while in India it's an above the counter type product. In India, reverse osmosis is significant, but also other components like UV, UF are bigger than what they are in China. So there are differences in the marketplace. Membrane texture, etcetera is different can be - certain things, the water in India isn't as uniform throughout the country, that creates some issues. So there are differences between the markets. As we have said though, it's a large market, there are formidable competitors there, but we think we can be successful in it. Ajita Rajendra : And I think you know, just to add some color to that, we continue to see India as a tremendous long-term growth opportunity and that's why we continue to invest in India. The water treatment category as John said is about three times the size of water heaters and the distribution is very similar. So by getting into a new category, we can leverage the sales force, the advertising, etcetera in a similar type of distribution network. And we see again, tremendous long-term potential, but we need some help from the economy which didn't come in 2014 and we hope that will come, certainly will come in the future. Operator : Our next question comes from David Rose with Wedbush Securities. David Rose : Just a couple of follow-ups, maybe it wasn't clear to me the CapEx break out between India and China as it relates to water treatment and how much you are spending in Lochinvar? And maybe at a higher level, Ajita, maybe you can discuss what you've seen in India, in terms of the potential enablers from the Modi government to make your business a little bit more attractive? And then structurally in India, lastly, how you are spending your resources to reduce costs at the same time growth of business and maybe you can provide some specific examples? John Kita : Well I'll do the CapEx and you can do the remainder. What we have said is we really don't have a lot of CapEx in India in 2015. What we said is about $30 million of CapEx associated with China expansion as well as Lochinvar expansion. So those are the two components that are, I'll say bricks and mortar different than in the past and then also the ERP expenditure. So I think we really do not expect to put much more capital in India. David Rose : In China as it relates to the expansion in China, how much of it is pure water heaters treatment and then you have the expansion of the Lochinvar piece in China? John Kita : I'm sorry. The Lochinvar piece is in the U.S. David Rose : It's all U.S.? Okay. John Kita : They have run out of space because whenever you are growing at 10% a year, they have run out of space. So we've added and that will be an over $10 million expansion that we're in the process of doing, the China one is a little bit unique in that it is primarily combi boilers. We were in a position where we were asked by the government to leave our location of combi boilers so we had two options. We could have squeezed it in to the new Nanjing 2 plant or we have, I'll call it exclusive right to that adjacent land for us, for a short period of time and we're taking the opportunity to build a facility to accommodate the combi boiler plant as well as new labs etcetera for our instantaneous business which has been growing very quickly. David Rose : And then maybe you can follow-up on the question in India in terms of-- Ajita Rajendra : Maybe just add a little bit in terms of Lochinvar expansion. What we're also doing in Lochinvar with that expansion is expanding our lab capability and we're actually doubling the size of test stations that we have because innovation and as John mentioned earlier, the new product capability and the drive for new products and innovation is a big part of the growth of that business and we continue to see opportunity there, so we're again investing in ourselves and doubling our capacity for engineering and testing at Lochinvar. In terms of India we have, you know consumer confidence has certainly gone up with the new government and everyone is very hopeful that things will improve. I know as much as anyone else because I read the same news releases. I can't point to any concrete things that the government has done that is going to specifically impact our industry but consumer confidence is up. We hope to see the housing market improve. Last year it declined, our estimates by about 15%. 25% plus in some of the larger cities, but we're hopeful that things will improve. In terms of the operations in India, we take an approach anywhere we go. We're a very frugal company in terms of when it comes to people and when it comes to driving costs out of our operations and we have processes that focus on lean and continuous improvement and all of the programs that have made us a successful manufacturer in the U.S. and Europe and China are applied in India. And the improvements are ongoing and there are specific programs, continuous improvement programs like anywhere else in the world. So I think those areas we're comfortable with and frankly when I look at India, last year was a disappointment in terms of the overall results. You have heard me say that before and we know the drivers of the downside. On the positive side, we're building our brand, the brand is getting better known and better recognized. We're building our distribution points in India and all of these are investments for the future and what we believe is going to be a tremendous growth market out in the future. Operator : Our next question comes from Todd Vencil with Sterne Agee. Todd Vencil : For fourth quarter, I think you gave the year, but what was the ERP drag in the fourth quarter? John Kita : The ERP drag in the fourth quarter was I think $2 million or $3 million. Todd Vencil : Okay. Was there any drag in 4Q or the prior year? Or was that all incremental? John Kita : It was all incremental the prior year. 2013. Todd Vencil : On the price increase I know there was some question about the technological solutions that your competitors are going to come out with. Is 20% standard in the market at this point? Have your competitors come out yet? Ajita Rajendra : Todd, we certainly talk about our pricing and what we've done in the marketplace, but I would hate to speculate on what the competition is doing because we just don't fully know and what we've gone out with is about a 20% price increase which covers the cost. Todd Vencil : Can you talk a little bit about the Lochinvar expansion that you mentioned here that you are going to be spending some money on this year and just what the plans are there? And just a little more color? Ajita Rajendra : Like I said, we're expanding our manufacturing area and also our lab space and part of that involves actually literally moving a parking lot and taking over some of the existing parking lot to accommodate this expansion because again, we see tremendous opportunity in this business, certainly today in the North American market. And out in the future in global markets, although the global part of it is coming slower than we expect, but it certainly - we have high confidence it's going to be there. Like John said we've changed our focus a little bit on the global part because we see the condensing part of the global growth being slow to get there, especially in China. So we switched some of the resources to go after some of the high input innovative, non-condensing products, specifically for the Chinese market and they will be out somewhere at the end of this year. Todd Vencil : Final question this is a bit, but just as a reminder the ERP expenses for this year, that runs through operating profit in the North American operations right? John Kita : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Graham with Jefferies. Scott Graham : So my question is, off of a comment that you made during your discussion Ajita, that asset prices had actually gone up? And I was wondering if you would elaborate on that and how you are looking at the M&A in 2015 with currency on your side? Ajita Rajendra : I'll elaborate on my comment and it's what we're hearing in the marketplace is that with capital being available a lot of companies especially strategics seem to be going after growth and paying premium prices for growth opportunities and so that seems to be driving prices up and that's what we're hearing in the marketplace. I don't have any statistics to quote that but we're hearing that consistently in the marketplace and with our portfolio of 9% to 10% growth, we don't feel the need to go after growth segments at a premium price. So we're looking at our criteria has not changed. We're looking at the same disciplined approach that we have had in the past, but the comment was based on what we're hearing about and frankly seeing happening in the marketplace. Scott Graham : And then sort of the part two of that, when you have currency maybe on your side now, is that a partial offset? How are you looking at that? Ajita Rajendra : I think that you know, when we look at our currency and look at what we have in terms of offshore cash, certainly that would make an offshore acquisition give it, in our criteria which we have published and looked at and that would give an offshore acquisition an advantage and make it look more attractive. Scott Graham : Okay, so it's not like as if you have stepped up your efforts because of currency? Nothing has changed, but maybe more things are streaming better? Ajita Rajendra : No, I think that our efforts are at a high level as they have been. So from our perspective, nothing has changed. Scott Graham : Okay. Last question is on India. How much of that $7 million loss in 2014 can you reverse in 2015? John Kita : Well I think as I said, Scott and you probably couldn't hear it, is the water heater business lost about $6.5 million and we invested about $1 million in the water treatment business. We expect the water heater business can go down to probably about $4 million or something loss. But because of the investment in water treatment, it's going to offset much of that. So we're assuming some volume increases in the Indian market for water heaters as well as more vertical integration which takes out some of the currency exposure we have had there in the past. So we do expect to see the water heater improve, but the total business will probably lose close to that $7.5 million. Ajita Rajendra : And let me just elaborate a little bit on that Scott. When we talk about the loss in water heaters that includes the expenses for brand-building activities. So it's a combination of all of that and we continue to invest behind the brand because we believe like I've said a number of times in the long-term viability and attractiveness of the Indian market.

All this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Pat Ackerman. You may begin. Patricia Ackerman : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and thank you for joining us on our 2015 first quarter results conference call. With me participating in the call are Ajita Rajendra, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and John Kita, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin with Ajita's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call including answers to your questions will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others matters that we have described in this morning's press release. Ajita, I will now turn the call over to you. Ajita Rajendra : Thank you, Pat and good morning ladies and gentlemen. Our first quarter results set quarterly records. We continued to see the benefits in our performance from an improving economy in the U.S. and I expanding consumer business in China. Here are a few highlights. Our organic growth in both of our segments drove sales 12% higher to a record $619 million. China sales were up 15%. Our net earnings of $0.65 per share were 30% higher than the adjusted earnings per share of $0.54 recorded in 2014 primarily due to higher sales. We continue to review our capital allocation and dedicate a portion to return to shareholders. We repurchased approximately 333,000 shares for $21 million during the first quarter. We increased our dividend by 27% in January. Both of these actions are consistent with our stated capital deployment strategy. Our transition to NAECA III compliant products is on track. This is a very complex project impacting approximately 80% of our residential water heaters. Our team has done a tremendous job of navigating through this very challenging activity. John will now describe our results in more detail. John Kita : Thank you, Ajita. Sales in the first quarter of $619 million were 12% higher than the previous year driven by higher sales water heaters and commercial boilers in the U.S. and water heater and water treatment products in China. Net earnings of $58 million were 18% higher than first quarter adjusted earnings in 2014. Net earnings of $0.65 per share improved 20% compared with adjusted earnings per share of $0.54 in 2014. Sales in our North America segment of $429 million increased 10% over 2014 driven by higher volumes of U.S. water heaters and boilers. We believe a portion of the increase in water heater sales resulted from a pre-buy associated with our announced price increases for both commercial water heaters and NAECA III compliant residential water heaters. The price increases were effective in April. Lochinvar branded products grew over 10% during the quarter as new products, including our CREST boiler family continued to gain market acceptance. Rest of world segment sales of $196 million increased 13% compared with 2014. China sales increased 15% driven by higher demand for water heaters and water treatment products. North America operating earnings of $71 million were 20% higher than adjusted segment operating earnings in the previous year and operating margin of 16.6% was significantly above the 15.2% adjusted operating margin one year ago. The favorable impact from higher volumes for residential water heaters and higher margin commercial water heaters and boilers in the U.S. was partially offset by approximately 2.5 million in expected incremental ERP implementation costs. Rest of world operating earnings of $26 million improved 4% compared with 2014. Higher profits in China were partially offset by an approximately $1 million larger loss in India, which was expected due to the launch of water treatment products. Operating margin of 13.4% down from the previous year, primarily due to the larger loss in India and the launch of air purifiers in China. Our corporate expenses declined modestly from the prior year adjusted corporate expenses. We borrowed $75 million of 10-year average life fixed rate debt to achieve a better balance of fixed to floating rates in our debt portfolio. The higher rate on the term debt and the higher debt levels in the first quarter of 2015 account for the higher interest expense. Cash used by continuing operations during the first quarter 2015 of $3 million compares with $12 million provided in 2015. Higher earnings were more than offset by larger outlays for working capital in the 2015 period. Our liquidity position and balance sheet remain strong. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 18% at the end of March 2015. We have cash balances totaling almost $575 million located offshore and our net cash position was approximately $270 million at the end of March. During the first quarter we repurchase approximately 333,000 shares of common stock for a total of $21 million under a 10b5-1 automatic trading plan. We had approximately 2.2 million shares remaining on our existing repurchase authority at the end of March. Depending on factors such as stock price, working capital requirements and alternative investment opportunities, we expect to spend approximately $100 million on share repurchase activity in 2015, resulting in net cash levels around $320 million at the end of 2015 similar to 2014 year-end levels. This is consistent with our stated capital allocation strategy. We expect our cash flow from operations in 2015 to be between $270 million and $280 million. We expect capital expenditures to between $100 million and a $110 million in 2015 which includes approximately $15 million to support the ERP implementation and approximately $30 million related to capacity expansion in China and in the U.S., to support Lochinvar branded sales. Our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $66 million in 2015. We successfully completed our first ERP go-live milestone in August 2014. We expect the remainder of our North American planned sites to go-live in 2015 and 2016. ERP implementation expenses were $14 million in 2014 and are projected to be $20 million in 2015. We estimate the incremental ERP cost will occur in the first half of 2015. We estimate our effective tax rate to be between 29% and 30% in 2015. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $48 million in 2015. This morning we increased our 2015 EPS guidance to between $2.72 to $2.82 per share. The midpoint of our upgraded EPS guidance represents a $0.05 per share increase over our previous guidance and a 14% increase in EPS compared with our 2014 adjusted results. We expect our earnings per share in the second quarter of 2015 to be above flat with 2014 adjusted second quarter earnings per share due to the following factors; we believe our second quarter residential and commercial water heater volumes will be impacted by the first quarter pre-buy. We expect ERP costs will be about $4 million higher in the second quarter 2015 as compared to the prior year and we expect the benefits of NAECA 3 pricing will be effective about mid-second quarter. I'll now turn the call back to Ajita, who will summarize the assumptions in our 2015 outlook and our growth strategy. Ajita? Ajita Rajendra : Thank you, John. As John mentioned, the midpoint of our updated 2015 guidance implies growth of 14% over last year. The outlook for 2015 includes the following assumptions; first, we continue to expect strong profitable growth in China driven by expected and continued overall water heater market growth, market share gains, improved product mix and significant water treatment product growth. Collectively, we expect these drivers to deliver growth at two times China's GDP growth rate. Second, we forecast Lochinvar-branded product sales to continue to grow at least 10% keeping pace with the annual growth rates we have achieved since purchasing the business in 2011. This is well ahead of GDP growth in the U.S. as we believe our Lochinvar brand will continue to benefit from the expected transition from lower efficiency non-condensing boilers to high efficiency condensing boilers and new products driven by market leading innovation. We're starting to see strong acceptance from our newly introduced expansion of the CREST boiler family which targets the 750,000 to 2 million BTU per hour portion of the condensing boiler market segment. We launched this product earlier this year in advance of the 2015, 2016 heating season. Third, we announced to our US customers an average residential price increase of approximately 20% on NAECA 3 compliant products. We also announced a price increase on our US commercial water heaters, which became effective in April. Our US team has executed superbly through the NAECA 3 transition so far this year and we now expect the commercial water heater industry to modestly grow in 2015 after a strong first quarter. Fourth, we continue to seek ways to leverage our strong brand and distribution channel in China. Launching an A.O. Smith branded water treatment product line in 2010 was our first foray into a new product category in the region. Growing A.O. Smith-branded water treatment sales from $18 million to $75 million in the last two years continues to prove the power and the value of our A.O. Smith brand and infrastructure in China. Our experienced Chinese management team continues to leverage these assets to succeed in the very competitive and crowded Chinese marketplace. Total China water treatment sales in 2014 were $90 million, including $15 million of sales which are not branded A.O. Smith. China Market Monitor or CMM estimates that the point of use residential water treatment category in China will grow at over 40% per year over the next five years and we're excited about the opportunity and pleased with the market share gains that we have achieved through leveraging our brand, our engineering and our distribution strength. In China, our brand attributes include quality, reliability, safety and trust. These attributes translate well to air purifiers, which along with water treatment products, are among the fastest growing home appliance categories in China as measured by CMM. Partnering with a Japanese manufacturer, we launched the A.O. Smith brand air purifier in China late in the first quarter of 2015. An investment for the future, air purifier sales are expected to be less than $10 million in 2015 with losses of approximately $4 million primarily related to advertising and promotion costs. Fifth, we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity in India and we're committed to the country with the second largest population and the second fastest growing economy in the world and its developing middle class who desire quality of life products. India is an investment for the future and the $7.5 million loss that we expect in India this year is similar to 2014 and includes higher product development and advertising costs related to the launch of water treatment products. We expect overall sales in India to be between $20 million and $25 million in 2015. We plan to hold an Analyst Day on May 21 at our Lochinvar plant near Nashville. The main focus will be presentations by our business leaders including Kevin Wheeler, Wei Ding, who will travel from China and Bill Vallett. Attendees will also have the option to tour the Lochinvar facility. This next graphic depicts the organic growth potential we see in our business going forward. In fact, we expect North America water heater sales will grow faster than 4% in 2015 as a result of the price increase on our NAECA 3 compliant products and commercial water heaters and result in total company sales growth of approximately 10%. Our lack of currency exposure to the volatile euro increases our comfort with our growth forecast. Our acquisition strategy has not changed. We remain focused on water heating and water treating companies around the world as well as leveraging our brand and distribution channel in China. The acquisition landscape continues to be expensive as sustained price appreciation in equity markets, lower financing costs and the lack of organic growth for many strategic buyers drive prices higher. Our teams are energetic, engaged and disciplined. Our capital deployment strategies continue to support a combination of investments for organic growth, acquisitions, share repurchase and dividends. You have seen this chart before and we show this only as a reminder that we will continue to be a financially disciplined acquirer of companies in our stated corporate strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks and now we're open for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Charley Brady with BMO Capital Markets. Charles D. Brady: Thanks, good morning. Ajita Rajendra : Good morning. Charles D. Brady: I know it's difficult, but any sense as to the magnitude of the pre-buy impact on Q1 Rizzi water heater sales. Ajita Rajendra : Well, as we look you've probably seen the AHRI data for January and February it was very strong, we think that continued at least for us it did in March so our estimate is the industry was probably up 250,000 to 300,000 units from the prior year, our guess would be a majority of that was pre-buy associated. Charles D. Brady: Okay, and you are seeing that trend kind of continue into this month? Ajita Rajendra : I think orders are about where we expected. I mean as we said we expected to come down in the second quarter. So nothing surprising so far, but were only 20 days into the month. Charles D. Brady: Fair point. Just on China real quick then. I don't know if you called it up, but what was the margin impact on the air purification product launch costs in the quarter? Ajita Rajendra : The air purification was a loss of about $500,000, so about 4/10 of a percent I guess. Charles D. Brady: That\u2019s all I have. Thanks very much guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Halloran with Robert Baird. Michael P. Halloran: So how much inventory do you think in the North American channel right now of the older model. We talking about a month and a half or so based on when you're, when you expect the pricing to start rolling through mid-2Q? Ajita Rajendra : Yes. I think that's reasonable. You've almost got a break it down into pieces if you look at the discontinued product, which was over 55 gallon and some of the other products there's a pretty significant inventory build we think in those products. And that's going to kind of spread out over the probably the next nine months. We are not I would say I don't think we\u2019re uncomfortable with the level of the old product out there I think as we talked about we put people on allocation and so I think we're relatively comfortable I think with the inventory levels except again for that discontinued product which we expected to be up and that started the pre-buy in the fourth quarter and it certainly has continued in the first quarter of those products. Michael P. Halloran: That's good color there. And then any sense for how the industry from a ability to meet the new orders of the new standard water heaters. Any sense for how the industry itself is adapting any signs of any logistics as supply chain constraints are operational constraints right now? Ajita Rajendra : We haven't seen anything that we really talked about ourselves I don't think - there's expectations everybody had a long time to prepare for this. John Kita : From an operational perspective I think we are right on track and where we expected to be at this point. Michael P. Halloran: That makes sense. About what I would've thought and then lastly you know raise the commercial expectations a little bit here. What do you guys see on the underlying commercial water heater market and what were the factors that drove a price increase being put through for your perspective. Ajita Rajendra : Well, we did see the commercial industry was strong. It was up where guessing 6,000 to 7,000 units and part of that we think was some pre-buy associated with the price increase. The rest of it is when we talk to our commercial salesman, the commercial market has been very strong. I mean Lochinvar for example had a great quarter their commercial water heaters and commercial boilers were very strong. They had lower engineering costs so when we look at the margin improvement in North America a good portion of that is due to just Lochinvar commercial mix. So it was very good quarter. So we have not done a good job of forecasting commercial as you know, but there are some times that a strong will see how it continues and that's really what drove us to raise commercial. Michael P. Halloran: Good I appreciate the time is always. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from William Bremer with Maxim Group. William Bremer : Good morning gentlemen. Ajita Rajendra : Good morning. William Bremer : Let's go to Lochinvar. You just called out the commercial end of it was very strong. What types of like visibility do you have on Lochinvar and I also want you to comment a little bit on the manufacturing expansion plan for them as well? Ajita Rajendra : Well, I mean the visibility we have is as I said the commercial continues to be very strong for them and it\u2019s across the board and as you are aware we brought out some new products we extended the CREST product line we brought out new fire tube boiler for the 400 to 850 BTU area both those products have been well received and so we're optimistic and the capacity is for a good reason. I mean when they have been growing 10 plus percent we need to add capacity but also they built their business on innovation and we're adding several new labs et cetera. Engineering labs for them to continue that goal. John Kita : We are essentially doubling our testing capability. In Lochinvar as part of the expansion. William Bremer : Okay. Great. And then let's go to the aftermarket there. We start to see aftermarket specifically for the highly condensing boilers pick up year-over-year. Ajita Rajendra : Well actually was pretty flat in the first quarter and the reason for that as you may recall last year while we talked about the first quarter, that parts business was up quite a bit because of the weather et cetera. So that part of the business has been kind of in that 12% to 13% and it continues grow with the company. So we are very pleased with that part of the business. William Bremer : And then finally on the air purification, how is that progressing and can you give us a little inside on are there any other avenues that will just slowly gravitate into maybe larger units and possibly commercial and are we to stay with the residential for the time being? Ajita Rajendra : I think it\u2019s very early in terms of air purifiers, but we see air purifier this is right on strategy from the point of you of leveraging infrastructure and brand in China and air purifiers along with water treatment products, residential water treatment products and residential air purifiers among the fastest growth categories of appliances - home appliances in China. So this is bright in line with our expansion and certainly what we see is that we will expanding that line as it goes. So we are very optimistic but it\u2019s very early to tell we\u2019ve just introduce the product. William Bremer : Great. Nice quarter, Ajita thank you. Ajita Rajendra : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Scott Graham with Jefferies. Scott Graham : Hey, good morning all. Ajita Rajendra : Good morning, Scott. Scott Graham : So could you tell us what the same-store sales growth was in Tier 1 and Tier 2? John Kita : Scott as we've talked about in the past and I think it's even become more complicated for us to try to measure that as we add stores and close stores. So our people over there are having some struggles calculating that. The bottom line is unit volume was up nicely. I could conjecture and say I think part of it is due to the new stores we\u2019ve add it, but remember for the most part those are being added in Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities. And I think same stores were seeing nice improvements. So I think China had a very good first quarter up to 15% and water treatment continues to do very well. Scott Graham : Okay, fair enough. The price increase in North America is that I know it\u2019s very early, but any signs of has your confidence increased, decreased are you good with this price increase is it holding so for. John Kita : Scott as I have said in the past, we can\u2019t really comment on prices we could prices up and will have to see what happens. Scott Graham : Okay, last thing on - I am going to get one question answered here. Okay. On acquisitions and I'm not asking for anything that's overly sensitive for anything, but it sounds to me as if you know we were looking at one deal and that didn't work, and we were looking at maybe the purification and that may be didn't work and JVs. Is this going to be maybe something new? Because it seems like JVs are a very viable option for some capital deployment understanding of course there's going to be some losses in the early periods of the operations but can we see more of this from you guys in the rest of world. John Kita : I'll start and Ajita can finish. We really don't have a JV in the air purification you're right we looked for air purification acquisitions there have not come up with anything yet so the next step we took as we looked at companies that were there that had good product that didn't have what we have which is the brand and distribution so we under into buy/sell range but not really to JV buy/sell range with the manufacture will continue to look for opportunities because we certainly think our brand in our distribution, but we are also going to want to have best technology. So we will continue to do that. So I don\u2019t think necessarily that JVs we are open to JV I mean it certainly something we are open to, but it\u2019s not necessarily wave of the future for us. Scott Graham : Fair enough. Ajita Rajendra : But if you look at JVs we\u2019ve done eight years ago approximately which was with Takagi for our Tankless water heaters in North America, which is going very well. But as we look at capital allocation strategy have not changed it all. Scott Graham : Now understood. Ajita Rajendra : We talked about Scott at the last call I believe that we were very close to couple opportunities, acquisition opportunities in the fourth quarter and because of price primarily we didn\u2019t end up do in the deal so we will continue we are certainly seeing competition more from strategic now that we have probably in the past and that\u2019s primarily do in our mind to the fact that they are not growing organically and we are not going to chase pricing because we are growing organically. Scott Graham : Understanding that you're looking everywhere, has the decline in the value of the euro say increased your figure on a potential European acquisition? John Kita : We are always looking. It's got to be strategic, okay so we continue to look like I said nothing has really changed. From a capital allocation strategy viewpoint. The fact that the euro is down makes potential acquisitions in Europe more attractive, but again it's got to meet our criteria. Scott Graham : Gotcha, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Samuel Eisner with Goldman Sachs. Samuel H. Eisner: Good morning everyone. Ajita Rajendra : Good morning. John Kita : Good morning. Samuel H. Eisner: On the pre-buy can you talk a bit about what your utilization rates were in the quarter and how you expect those to fair for the remainder of the year into the second quarter I just want to understand the impact on earnings from the pre-buy this quarter. John Kita : Well certainly absorption was very favorable in the first quarter because of the magnitude, and I can't give you a dollar number and what the effect will be in the second quarter, but certainly the run rates will be lower in the second order without a doubt and it will have an impact from and of absorption standpoint we were running full bar January, February, March without. Samuel H. Eisner: Got it. And then on the working capital build this quarter. Can you just talk a bit about what that\u2019s actually going for what the plans are is that primarily for get new product out in China or just what specially that that\u2019s targeted for? Ajita Rajendra : Yes, I mean if you look back historically our first quarter normally have the little bit DSO. So when we look at DSO we are saying day sales and receivables plus days and inventory minus AP we are exactly where we were last year first quarter at about 37 days that\u2019s up from the fourth quarter and traditionally is if you look at the pieces of it inventory we did built some finished goods inventory without a doubt so that was primarily North America. Receivables was kind of across the board when you look at the receivable belt from year-end it's a little deceiving because sales were up from November, December and the last two months of this quarter were up. So it really was reasonable that it's up. So nothing surprising whatsoever on the first quarter cash flow and we expect that we're staying with our same level for the year. Samuel H. Eisner: Got it. And then just lastly on the price increases in commercial are those are ready out in the market, and the reasoning behind the price increases is that just you feel better about the market so you can push a little bit of price or is that from material related on just want to understand the rationale behind it. John Kita : The price was put out I think late last year for effective for April 1. And there's a whole variety of reasons that go into it. There had been continual increasing costs previous price increases have not necessarily held so it's been out in the marketplace for quite some time and known. So that's why we think there was some pre-build - pre-buy. Samuel H. Eisner: And then just based on the last comment you anticipate that this price increase will hold if others have not held? John Kita : You know we're not going to conjecture our future effects of pluses or minuses on price increases. Samuel H. Eisner: Alright, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Robert McCarthy : Good morning everyone. John Kita : Good morning. Robert McCarthy : First on water treatment I think did you suggest a long-term growth assumption in China collectively by 40% over the next five years is that correct? Ajita Rajendra : That's based on CMM data which is a marketing group in China 40% we certainly saw that last year and we expect to see that this year and their forecast is for the next four or five years that to grow 40% and that's driven primarily because the penetration rate of water treatment products in China is very low. Compared to other Asian countries and obviously we know that there is some water issues et cetera. Robert McCarthy : In terms of I mean do you think of that execution happens over the next 18 to 24 months and would you expect it even perhaps think about your multiplier or [indiscernible] your shorthand for growth in China could be higher than specifically? John Kita : Well, I mean we are comfortable with the two times GDP and you know we broken that model out to three buckets and one of the buckets is for example on water treatment and when it grew last year, it grew about $30 million and we had about $600 million of sales that was above 5%. And we think that the reasonable level going forward and that certainly been important when you look at how other companies are doing in China. There is a slowing down, but we've got that growth through those three different buckets that makes us comfortable at two times GDP. Robert McCarthy : In terms of your growth drivers in China do you ever get nervous about potential with distribution if it could ever be like an inventory drawdown or any kind of volatility that you could anticipate that could kind of stunt your growth rate for a period of time? John Kita : Well, I mean when we talk about the growth rate we're really talking about on an annual basis. On quarter-to-quarter we can have some build for various reasons, holidays coming up, customers wanting to get their VIP allowance for the quarter et cetera so that can be a variety of reasons on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but I think we look at it on an annual basis and say that we think that's a reasonable estimate. Robert McCarthy : Switching gears with India, I mean a work flowing and by no means obviously its early days and you are getting lot of traction but what are kind of the qualitative factors you would decide whether maybe India is not a place you want to grow longer-term. What would be the basis for thinking for a retrenchment there? John Kita : I am going to let Ajita answer that but I'll say the first point I was here will we started China in 1995 and it was a painful seven or eight years, okay, really painful. Pretty heavy losses, but we were committed to the country because we started long-term growth. So I mean that\u2019s the history of China from 1995 to 2003 that's when we broke even. And then I\u2019ll turn it over to Ajita. Ajita Rajendra : Yes, I think, first of all there's no - we don't have conversations frankly about retrenchment in India because like John said, we are looking at it long-term and really see the long-term potential in the country. I just in fact just got back earlier this week from a trip to India and the economy there is a lot of expectation and consumer confidence because of the new government. Although nothing has really happened yet, but from our perspective and looking at what we are doing in terms of building our brand and building our distribution points et cetera. You know things are going okay, given where we are in India. Obviously the economy were a little better last year actually the water heater market declined, housing starts have declined et cetera. But we expect that to come back because of fundamentals in India in terms of population and the drivers growing the middle class in India are pretty solid long-term we really have believe that this is a long-term tremendous opportunity and in fact in addition to water heating in this quarter, late in the quarter we introduced water treatment products also in India. Robert McCarthy : Okay, and then\u2026 John Kita : The only thing I\u2019ll add Rob is neither one of us are obviously comfortable losing $7.5 million last year and what we talked about this year, so a similar amount now again we expect to see improvement in the water heater this year and we are making that investment in the water treatment which is making the loss for the whole India about the same, but it\u2019s certainly not our intent to live with $7.5 million losses for a long period of time. Robert McCarthy : What do you think your reasonable cadence to breakeven then two to three years in India or what are we thinking? John Kita : I mean you've almost got a break it into the pieces and I think we talked about in the last call, if you think about water heating and that lost about $6.5 million last year we had about $15 million of sales, we expect those sales to move up about $5 million this year and that lost because of the higher sales and also more vertically integrating to go down a couple of million bucks. We look at a breakeven in the range of $30 million to $35 million or so for the water heater business. And we hope that certainly in the next two to three years. Robert McCarthy : Right. Switching gears to commercial. I mean obviously some clear signs of strength there do you think that speaks to kind of North American commercial construction markets picking up or how would you typify what you are seeing? Ajita Rajendra : When I talked to our salesmen they would say yes, they are seeing compared to last year this time that there is more cranes, there is more building going on. I mean we had a strong commercial business because of the retrofit, because of the move to high efficiency, because of the move to building restaurants and small hotels, but I think you are starting to see more hospitals, education facilities et cetera. So I think we are cautiously optimistic that things are picking up. Robert McCarthy : And then finally in terms of your revenue growth for the year have you categorized how much you think I think is 10% core how much of that is price? Ajita Rajendra : No, we haven't. Robert McCarthy : Okay, all right. Thanks very much for your time. Operator : Our next question comes from Noah Kaye with Northland Capital. Noah Kaye : Good morning and congrats on the quarter. $10 million for air purification for the first year seems like a very good start. Could you ballpark for us what you think the addressable market could be in China for air purification given your existing footprint. Ajita Rajendra : So we've startled under $10 million in sales and the real key to remember on the air purification market is the highest sales level are in the third and fourth quarter primarily the fourth quarter, so that's still to come. When we look at the air purification market, our best estimate is about $2.5 billion last year and then if you look at our channel which is kind of retail stores and online, we're seeing it\u2019s probably about half of that if you will is sold through that channel. And then this is where the guessing comes in. We are not going to play on the low-end. We are going to play on the high-end and our best guess is that's probably 40% to 50% of that number. So it's a long way to say and our best guess is probably $500 million maybe is the addressable market for us. Noah Kaye : And how would you think about growth rate for that portion of that market, is it comparable to water treatment? Ajita Rajendra : CMM I mean the good thing about the two areas we are in is those are the two fastest expected appliance growth markets for the next four to five years and both of them are kind of in that 40% range, so time will tell. Again part of the advantage why those are growing is the penetration rate is so low. Noah Kaye : Sure. Part of the reason of course for your success with water treatment has been that you significantly reengineered and improve their product. You have to do that to kind of grow the sales the way that you want to? Are there other measures that you'll have to take can you talk about that a little bit. Ajita Rajendra : We will certainly have to do that because our brand the equity of our brand is built around new products and being first to market on capabilities within categories that we're in. So we've entered the market with the [ME2] product and we will have to engineer it and come up with a value proposition that is at least somewhat unique to the market and different. So yes, we will have to - we are investing in engineering and figuring out how we do that. Noah Kaye : And then so I guess the next question would be given that you have these high growth opportunities in water treatment in your purification. As you look at one, two years how much do your water heater sales in China actually have to grow on the percentage growth basis for you to continue to grow to X GDP, how would you think about that? Ajita Rajendra : Well, I think probably the easiest way for me to answer that is kind of those buckets we\u2019ve talked about and we\u2019ve kind of laid it out that the first bucket is market growth and if you think of our water heater business right now it\u2019s about 75% of our business over in China and CMM has estimated that\u2019s going to grow at 7% and we think that\u2019s reasonable going forward even as housing slows down we think replacement is increasing, we use to talk about 35% replacement above two to three years ago in Tier-1 cities we are now talking about 45% to 50% so that\u2019s one bucket of approximately 5% and the other bucket is market share higher price as we bring out new products with values and features that consumer want has a higher price and then we grow our distribution. So where we hope to gain market share is in the water treatment and also in the instantaneous side of the market if you will, the gas instantaneous and then that third bucket is the ancillary product lines which is led by water treatment. So if those buckets that we have kind of stressed why we think we are different than other people who are in China. Ajita Rajendra : Yes, and water treatment and now air purification which we hope will be another category that grows and also one more as we think of the long-term, the newer categories we are growing like water treatment and air purification has a replacement component that\u2019s in a much shorter cycle than water heater, because not the whole thing but the filters. Okay now we haven\u2019t seen the benefit of that yet, but we hope that benefit will also start growing as we go forward. Noah Kaye : Terrific. Thank you for the answers and congrats again on the quarter. Ajita Rajendra : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Hammett with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jeff Hammett : Hey, good morning guys. Ajita Rajendra : Good morning. Patricia Ackerman : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Hammett : Hey, one last one on price. What if you seen from your peers and competitors on pricing actions are they kind of aligning with what you've announced both in res and commercial? Ajita Rajendra : We can talk about our pricing increase, which we have but really can't comment on the competition or looking forward and anticipate things happening on pricing. Jeff Hammett : And then just along those lines I mean you talked about your kind of readiness and everything is intact. How are you thinking about kind of profit flow through on those pricing increased based on your input costs and higher cost of manufacture et cetera. John Kita : I think we\u2019ve kind of set our margins would stay similar on the new products and so that how we are kind of looking at it if you will. Jeff Hammett : Okay, great. And then finally, you guys in the last presentation looks like you gave some segment margin guidance 16% for North America 13.5% to 14% for rest of world. Are those still intact I didn't see anything in this presentation. John Kita : No. But as we raised our guidance I think you can look at probably the North America being a little bit higher than that and that's really driven by the commercial side of the market. You know now that we've raised our commercial estimates and we're a big player there and then we look at Lochinvar, and Lochinvar\u2019s a big player in the commercial and that's stronger. I think it's that combination that allows us to say we think we can get a little bit higher in North America and that's why we raised our guidance. Jeff Hammett : Okay, perfect, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Todd Vencil with Sterne, Agee. Todd Vencil : Thanks, good morning, guys. Ajita Rajendra : Good morning. Todd Vencil : Covered a lot of good ground here bunch of my questions have been knocked out. I did want to ask about the ERP and just to make sure I am squared away on the number you said $20 million of spend this year coming entirely in the first half? John Kita : No. I'm sorry. So last year we spent $14 million and it was lower in the first half, higher in the second half last year. This year were saying it's going to be about $20 million spread relatively equally over the year which means the first half is about $6 million more than the first half last year. And then pretty flat year-over-year for the second half. Todd Vencil : Got it, that makes sense. And that\u2019s all - is that all P&L impact or\u2026 John Kita : Yes. Todd Vencil : That includes. Okay, so that\u2019s all P&L impacted in the $15 million of CapEx on top of that. John Kita : Right. Todd Vencil : Okay, that was my question. Thanks a lot. Ajita Rajendra : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from David Rose with Wedbush Securities. David L. Rose: Hi, thank you for taking my call. I have just a couple quick ones if we can bang them out. Following up on the debt. Just help me understand the reason behind increasing your debt at $80 million given the free cash flow you have the cash from the balance sheet are you thinking about much larger type acquisitions is this because you have something imminent? John Kita : No. So David when you look at we have cash overseas, we have debt here of about $250 million I suppose $270 million at the end of the quarter that was almost all floating rate. And so what we said given the attractiveness of long-term rates and just hedging that position we decided to draw down $75 million of long-term debt and pay down some of the short-term debt and it was kind of 35% to 40% fixed to floating and again we've talked about the fact that from a stock buyback standpoint if we buy back $100 million this year, probably about half of that will come from debt because we're obviously generating money in China and offshore. So that was the logic stream for doing it we think we got a very attractive rate of 3.5% tenure money so we're pleased with it. David L. Rose: Okay, thank you. And then just a couple of last ones with respect to which inventory and inventory now and just so we can have a better understanding the margin profile when that product flows through over the next couple of quarters, can you talk about scrap issues, quality maybe you made some reserves that you setup that\u2019s on the balance sheet? Ajita Rajendra : We took some in the first quarter some obsolescence as we evaluated the obsolescence and we talked about that, so we had some inefficiencies in the first quarter as well as obsolescence as we are running pilot runs and we had some weather et cetera. So we are not anticipated a significant amount of those issues at all in the second quarter, we hope that portion of it\u2019s pretty much behind that. David L. Rose: Okay. And then on water treatment, what was the contribution from water treatment in China? Ajita Rajendra : Water treatment was up about $10 million in sales. It was up over 80%. It's a little deceiving because last year's first quarter was an easy comp, so we think that 40% going forward for the next three quarters is a reasonable number. So if you look at when we talk about water treatment was $18 million two years ago, $43 million I\u2019m sorry three years ago, $43 million, $75 million last year our forecast is in the low $100 million this year, so the growth is what we expect. David L. Rose: And what was the margin contribution? Ajita Rajendra : I don\u2019t know for the quarter, what we\u2019ve talked about for the year last year that water treatment made about $2.5 million, we would think we would at least double that this year from a profitability standpoint. David L. Rose: Okay, great. That's it for me for now. Thank you very much. Ajita Rajendra : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Giannakouros with Oppenheimer. Jim Giannakouros : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Ajita Rajendra : Good morning. Jim Giannakouros : Lochinvar, just one follow-up there. Growing 10% plus can you give us more granular look into where you're seeing outside growth by geography you've given us the subcategories of non-res, but is there any particular areas of strength that you are seeing from a geographic perspective? Ajita Rajendra : Well, the boiler business from a commercial standpoint is across the country so I don't think we're necessarily seeing any geographic. But the growth in Lochinvar is not only commercial boilers, they had a very good first quarter in commercial water heaters and we would say that's 500,000 BTU to say 2 million BTU and so that market also grew very well, so they saw their commercial market grow very nicely. And I haven't heard of any specific geographic region from a residential clearly the Northeast is that, but I think commercial it\u2019s pretty much across the country. And again as I said earlier, education, hospitals et cetera those areas are certainly growing. Jim Giannakouros : Got it, okay. And then just sticking to the boiler side I know we\u2019ll take a closer look at next month at the facility, but are there any competitive advantages we should be mindful of that are potentially driving share gains among the competitors offering, similar energy efficiency upgrades and obviously the value proposition that comes with? Thanks. Ajita Rajendra : I think the new products, we certainly feel the new products that have come out from Lochinvar have a clear advantage in the marketplace especially because they are fire-tube products as opposed to the water-tube products that are prevalent in the marketplace. So the new product the FTXL which we introduced early in the year and then subsequently the expansion of the Crestline, we feel have certainly are very attractive and been very well accepted in the marketplace and it\u2019s early. We expect a lot of growth. John Kita : Yes, and you\u2019ll see the controls I think are there in your lowest controls we think are also have a big competitive advantage. Jim Giannakouros : Looking forward to it, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from William Bremer with Maxim Group. William D. Bremer: Yes, a quick follow-up and hopefully you could clarify something that's puzzling me. The price increases. Both on the residential and the commercial, can you give us a sense of the magnitude of the price increase on the commercial end? Ajita Rajendra : The price increase on the commercial and really varies by product et cetera in some product lines it low double-digits, but it really ranges byproduct so there's no one set amount. William D. Bremer: Okay, and then on the water treatment I\u2019m assuming that India would be an option, how much of a change or modification will be needed to what has been produced for the China market to then going to India? Ajita Rajendra : We are manufacturing the water treatment products for India in India, so they are modified in the sense that the designs are different, China primarily they are hanging on the wall or under counter, India is primarily under counter top products. So the products are different, the technology is similar, but we are manufacturing for in India. William D. Bremer: Ajita the $30 million to $35 million for the breakeven in India is that exclusively water heaters or does that also include the water treatment aspect of this. John Kita : That\u2019s the water. Ajita Rajendra : That\u2019s water heater part of it. That\u2019s the water heater part. William D. Bremer: Okay thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Charley Brady with BMO Capital Markets. Charley D. Brady: Hey, thanks. Just a quick follow-up on the China air purification. Given that it's kind of a buying or selling you not manufacturing like you are in the water purification is there a meaningful margin differential so is that sort of a business starts really ripping up you know some small base, but just trying get us any meaningful margin back on the ROW margins. John Kita : Only from the standpoint, Charley, of the losses this year. Where we've said they could be up to $4 million. As we spend a lot of money on SG&A, but our philosophy, and I think you're aware of it but for the entire group, our philosophy is when we look at other alternatives. We're looking for product lines that have a premium product that can have relatively high gross margin. So that when we scale it up we can end up with the bottom line attractive margin. And we think air purification is one of those product lines. And certainly water treatment is. Ajita Rajendra : Absolutely and you know what we\u2019re looking at is when we get to longer-term steady state, that is not going to be a deterioration of our margins in China. And we feel pretty comfortable about that right now. It's very early, but we feel pretty comfortable that this is a category we can achieve that in the long term. Charley D. Brady: Great thanks guys. End of Q& A Operator : And I am not showing any further question at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to management. Patricia Ackerman : Thank you for joining us this morning. We hope to see many of you at our Analyst Day in May and registration information on our Analyst Day is available on the Investor page of our website aosmith.com. Have a great day.

O. Smith Corporation Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Patricia Ackerman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. You may begin, ma'am. Patricia Ackerman : Thank you, Earl. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on our 2015 second quarter results conference call. With me participating in the call are Ajita Rajendra, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Kita, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin with Ajita's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning's press release. Ajita, I will now turn the call over to you. Ajita Rajendra : Thank you, Pat; and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. We set sales and earnings records again in the second quarter. Higher-than expected volumes of residential and commercial water heaters, earlier realization of higher pricing associated with NAECA III compliant water heaters, improved performance at Lochinvar, as well as lower than expected material costs resulted in stronger performance in the second quarter than we originally projected. Here are a few highlights. Organic growth in both of our segments drove sales 10% higher to a quarterly record of $654 million. China sales were up 15%. Net earnings of $0.79 per share were 20% higher than the adjusted earnings per share of $0.66 in 2014. We continued to review our capital allocation and dedicated a portion to return to shareholders. In addition to our regular dividend, we repurchased approximately 400,000 shares for $27 million during the second quarter. Our transition to NAECA III compliant products is complete. This is a very complex, complex project, impacting approximately 80% of our residential water heaters. I'm now going to hand it over to John, who will describe the results in more detail. John Kita : Thank you, Ajita. Sales in the second quarter of 654 million were 10% higher than the previous year. Net earnings of 71 million were 18% higher than second quarter adjusted earnings in 2014. Net earnings EPS of $0.79 per share improved 20% compared with adjusted earnings per share of $0.66 in 2014. Sales in our North America segment of 443 million increased 8% over 2014, driven by a price increase effective in April for both commercial and residential water heaters in the U.S. as well as higher sales of Lochinvar-branded products. Rest-of-world segment sales of 221 million increased 14% compared with 2014. China sales increased 15%, driven by higher demand for water heaters and the water treatment products. North America operating earnings of 86 million were 28% higher than adjusted segment operating earnings in the previous year, and the operating margin of 19.4% was significantly above the 16.4% adjusted operating margin one year ago. The favorable impact from higher water heater prices in the U.S. and Canada, higher boiler sales, and lower material costs was partially offset by approximately 4 million in expected incremental ERP implementation costs. Rest of world operating earnings of 31 million improved compared with 2014 due to higher profits in China. Operating margin of 14% fell from the previous year due to higher selling and advertising costs as a percentage of sales in China, including promotion related to the Company's new air purifier product and larger expenditures in India to support the launch of our water treatment products. Our corporate expenses declined modestly from the adjusted corporate expenses the prior year. Cash provided by continuing operations during the first half of 2015 was 59 million compared with 91 million provided in 2014. Higher earnings were more than offset by larger outlays for working capital in the 2015 period. Increases in accounts receivable balances, primarily driven by higher sales was a major driver of higher working capital requirements in 2015. Our liquidity position and balance sheet remained strong. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 16% at the end of June 2015. We have cash balances totaling 552 million located offshore, and our current net cash position was approximately 273 million at the end of June. During the first half of the year, we repurchased approximately 730,000 shares of common stock for a total of $47 million under a 10b5-1 automatic trading plan. We had approximately 1.8 million shares remaining on our existing repurchase authority at the end of June. Depending on factors such as stock price, working capital requirements, and alternative investment opportunities, we expect to spend approximately 125 million on share repurchase activity in 2015, resulting in net cash levels similar to 2014 year-end levels. This is a $25 million increase in our expected share repurchases due to projected improvement in earnings and cash flow. And it is consistent with our stated capital allocation strategy. We expect our cash flow from operations in 2015 to be approximately $300 million. We expect capital expenditures to be between 100 million and 110 million in 2015, which includes approximately 20 million to support the ERP implementation and approximately 30 million related to capacity expansions in China and in the U.S., with the U.S. portion in support of Lochinvar-branded sales. Our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately 65 million in 2015. We successfully completed our first two ERP go-live milestones in August 2014 and May 2015. We expect to convert all of our major North America plant sites by the end of 2016. ERP implementation expenses were 14 million in 2014 and are projected to be 19 million to 20 million in 2015. As we expected, the incremental ERP costs occurred in the first half of 2015. We estimate our effective tax rate to be approximately 30.5% in 2015, higher than earlier projections due to a change in our geographic earnings mix. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $45 million in 2015. This morning we increased our 2015 EPS guidance to be between $3.04 and $3.09 per share. The midpoint of our upgraded EPS guidance represents a $0.30 per share increase over our previous guidance and a 26% increase in EPS compared with our 2014 adjusted results. I will now turn the call back to Ajita, who will summarize the assumptions in our 2015 outlook and our growth strategy. Ajita? Ajita Rajendra : Thank you, John. As John mentioned, the midpoint of our updated 2015 guidance implies growth of 26% over last year. Our outlook for 2015 includes the following assumptions. First, we continue to expect strong, profitable growth in China, driven by expected and continued overall water heater market growth, including an emerging replacement demand, which is most prominent in Tier 1 cities; market share gain; expanded distribution; improved product mix; and significant water treatment product growth. Collectively, we expect these drivers to deliver growth at two times China's GDP growth rate. China inventory levels at our seven largest distributors are about the same as last March but up about $10 million from the end of last year and from a year ago. As we have expressed in the past, China inventories can rise as customers increase orders ahead of buying holidays or to ensure volume incentives. We are watching China inventories, as they are higher than normal. We do not expect the 30% decline in the Shanghai Stock Exchange Index to have a meaningful impact on the economy or our sales due to a number of factors. There is relatively low participation in the stock market by urban households. We estimate that to be around -- less than 10%. Stock holdings represent 10% to 15% of household wealth, and we have seen no historical evidence to support correlation between consumption and stock market level. Despite the recent decline, the stock market is up about 70% from last July. There was relatively low impact on retail appliance sales and our China sales when the China stock market corrected in 2008. And also, we do not view water heaters or water treatment systems to be discretionary purchases in China. Our second major assumption : we announced to our U.S. customers an average residential price increase of approximately 20% on NAECA III compliant products. We also announced a price increase on our U.S. and Canada commercial water heaters and non-NAECA III compliant residential water heaters. The price increases became effective in April. The magnitude of the NAECA pre-buy now appears to be lower than we expected, and we have increased our U.S. residential water heater industry volume forecast to add an incremental 150,000 units, or 1% to 2%, over last year. We also increased our full year outlook for the U.S. commercial water heater industry and expect growth of 3% to 4% in 2015 after a strong first half. Third major assumption, we forecast Lochinvar branded product sales to continue to grow at 10%, keeping pace with the annual growth rates we have achieved since purchasing the business in 2011. This is well ahead of GDP growth rates in the U.S., and we believe our Lochinvar brand will continue to benefit from the expected transition from lower-efficiency non-condensing boilers to high-efficiency condensing boilers and new products driven by market-leading innovation. The acceptance of our newly-introduced expansion of the CREST boiler family, which targets the 750,000 to 2 million BTU portion of the condensing boiler market segment, continues to be very strong. We launched these products earlier this year in advance of the 2015-2016 heating season. Fourth major assumption, we continue to seek ways to leverage our very strong brand and distribution channels in China. Launching an A. O. Smith branded water treatment product line in 2010 was our first foray into a new product category in the region. Growing A. O. Smith branded water treatments from $18 million in 2012 to predicted sales of over $100 million in 2015 continues to prove the power and the value of our A. O. Smith brand distribution and infrastructure in China. Our experienced Chinese management team continues to leverage these assets to succeed in the very competitive and crowded Chinese marketplace. China Market Monitor, or CMM, estimates that the point-of-use residential water treatment category in China will grow 35% to 40% per year over the next five years. And we are excited about the opportunity and very pleased with the market share gains we have achieved through leveraging our engineering, distribution, and brand strength. In China our brand attributes include quality, reliability, safety, and trust. These attributes translate very well to air purifiers which, along with water treatment products, are among the fastest growing home appliance categories in China, as measured by CMM. We launched the A. O. Smith brand air purifier in China late in the first quarter of 2015. An investment for the future, our air purifier sales are expected to be approximately $8 million to $10 million in 2015, with losses of approximately $4 million primarily related to advertising and promotion costs. Fifth, we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity in India, and we are committed to the country with the second largest population and the second fastest growing economy in the world and its developing middle class, who desire quality-of-life products. India is an investment for the future and the $7.5 million loss we expect this year is similar to 2014 and includes higher product development and advertising costs related to the launch of water treatment products. We expect our overall sales in India to be approximately $20 million in 2015. We believe our 8% organic growth potential for the next several years differentiates A. O. Smith among other industrial companies. In fact, we expect North America water heater sales will grow faster than 4% in 2015 due to the April 2015 pricing action in the U.S. and Canada and result in total company sales growth of approximately 11%. Our historical organic growth rate and lack of currency exposure to the volatile Euro increases our comfort with our growth forecast. Our acquisition strategy has not changed. We remain focused on water heating and water treating companies around the world as well as leveraging our brand and distribution channels in China. The acquisition landscape continues to be very expensive, as sustained price appreciation in equity markets, lower financing costs, and the lack of organic growth for many strategic buyers drive higher multiples in prices. Our teams are energetic, engaged, and disciplined. Our capital deployment strategies continue to support a combination of investments for organic growth, acquisition, share repurchase, and dividends. You have seen our investment criteria before, and we show this only as a reminder that we will continue to be a financially disciplined acquirer of companies within our stated corporate strategy. And this concludes our prepared remarks, and we have now time for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robert McCarthy from Stifel. Your question please. Robert Paul McCarthy : Hi. Good morning, everyone, and congratulations on an excellent quarter. I guess the first question would be, if you are thinking about 2016 in terms of anniversarying kind of the factors around the pre-buy and how we are thinking about it -- now, I know you are not initiating 2016 guidance here. But can we think of, qualitatively, about the factors that are going to impact kind of growth in North America in your business in 2016? Or how should we be thinking about it, because it's going to be difficult to model, because we just had such a strong year this year. John Kita : Well, you are right. We have not looked at the 2016 plan yet. We'll do that later in the third and fourth quarter. I think from a modeling standpoint, we are very comfortable still with that 8% to 9% organic growth that we have consistently talked about. So from a top line, we think that's very achievable. And from a margin standpoint, we've said we are going to try to continue to increase margins. Obviously there's factors that affect that, including steel costs, which are volatile, et cetera. But again, we haven't really done the modeling yet for 2016. Ajita Rajendra : Yes. And I think, to add to what John said, the 8% to 9% is driven by a number of assumptions which we have talked about, which include North America, which we feel is going to be a little stronger because of the pricing action for NAECA III products and also China, driven by two times GDP and Chinese GDP. We are very comfortable with the overall guidance that we've been giving and that also includes the Lochinvar growing at 10%. Robert Paul McCarthy : And just a follow-up on the comments -- which we appreciate, obviously, about the context around China and the inventory -- when do you think you are going to have a better sense of how you think the growth trajectory is going to play out kind of into 2016 from moderating the inventory levels? When do you think we will get a better sense from your customer distribution base in terms of how to -- thinking about planning for next year, given the inventory levels you cited? John Kita : As Ajita just said, I think we're comfortable with that two-times GDP. You have seen the model, Rob, on how we've grown water treatment from an ancillary product line -- continues to grow significantly. It was 75 million this year. It will be over 100 million next year. So that's certainly -- we expect that to continue as the market continues to grow. We've said consistently we think the water heater market in China will grow somewhere in that 7% range, helped by higher replacement, which we're certainly seeing in Tier 1 city. And you know, the third bucket we've talked about is gaining market share, which we're continuing to do on the GAF side. We're adding distribution; we're over 7,500 outlets. And we'll continue to have higher price increases at higher price as we bring products to market that have values and features the consumer wants. So the model we have to grow the business, we think, is intact. You're going to have some lumpiness on a quarterly basis, when you might have higher inventories because of VIP incentives that they are trying to get, etcetera. We don't necessarily look at a quarter-to-quarter. What we're looking at is full-year of that two-times GDP. Robert Paul McCarthy : Thanks. I'll leave it there for now. Congratulations on an excellent quarter. John Kita : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Graham from Jefferies. Your question please. Scott Graham : Good morning, and nice quarter, you guys. I did also want to ask about China, because obviously the overriding driver to your sales there is GDP, but sort of de facto GDP. It's more, from what we've discussed, household formations. Like you, it doesn't seem as if household formations are going to slow a lot because the stock market slows. But there could be some temporary disruptions. And so I guess what I'm wondering is : is the combination of that -- if that's in your thinking, in fact -- plus the little bit of higher inventory could give us just some China sales numbers in the second half of the year that may be more toward, let's say, the 10% rather than the 15% growth? John Kita : I think, Scott, overall -- as John said -- we try not to react too much to the quarterly ups and downs. And we're very comfortable with the two-times GDP guidance for the year. Scott Graham : Yes. John Kita : And like I said, and you indicated, we are not concerned about the stock market and the impact, because I listed out the reasons we are not. And everything that we check on and the people we consult reconfirm to us that that's going to have little to no impact on, as you mentioned, household formation and the other drivers that really drive our volume. Scott Graham : Okay. Got you. Two other questions -- the price increase that you have the higher-priced versions of the water heater units that went out the door in the second quarter -- when did that actually start? Was that a middle-of-a-quarter phenomenon? You said it didn't really affect as much as you thought. My sense was that you guys were thinking sort of May. Did it actually happen in May, or was it -- you know, the higher-priced units start to go out the door earlier than that, in fact? John Kita : They actually went out earlier, Scott. We would've said -- we thought the industry would be down over 10% in the second quarter year-over-year for both residential and commercial. And we thought there would be a little bit of a lull after \u2013 you know, we could only manufacture the old one from April 2015, and the new one we started manufacturing on April 2016. We thought there would be a little bit of a lull, but we really did not see that. Essentially, the residential and commercial markets, we're thinking, are going to be about flat year-over-year for the quarter. And that surprised us. But the benefit of that is we have higher volumes than we thought. We also started selling the higher priced NAECA units earlier than what we thought. And so if you ask me when, I guess I would say kind of third \u2013 you know, third \u2013 certainly sometime last half of April, we started seeing the benefit of that. And that was earlier than we thought. Scott Graham : And last question is : you indicated the incremental upward change on North America water heater volumes within your view. Could you just remind me what your view is on North America residential water heater volumes for 2015? John Kita : So last year it was 9.2 million units. We said we thought there was some pre-buy in the last half of the year, and that it was going to be flat to up very slightly is what we said in the first quarter. Now, based on what we've seen in the first quarter and the second quarter, we would say industry units will be up 150,000 to 200,000 units, so somewhere in that 9.350 million to 9.4 million range. Scott Graham : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Noah Kaye from Northland Capital. Your question please. Noah Duke Kaye : Thank you. Good morning, Ajita, John, and Pat. How are you? Ajita Rajendra : Good morning. Noah Duke Kaye : First, maybe we could start on the gross margin line. At a 40%-plus gross margin, I would love to unpack that a little bit. You mentioned lower steel prices. You have also had the price increase. I know in the past you have said that you didn't think that gross margins would benefit necessarily from the price increases. And then, as you said, the volumes in some parts of the business have been stronger, leading to capacity utilization. So I would love to just kind of get a sense of what was the biggest driver among those three things in contributing to the higher margins? And how do you think about this? Is this a sustainable gross margin level over the next several quarters into 2016? John Kita : Well, so gross margins were up significantly. And it was primarily in North America, and it was a combination \u2013 Lochinvar and a very, very good quarter and year-to-date. So their margins were up several points. And on North America, margins were up. And as we had talked about, we had some price increases for commercial and non-NAECA III products due to wage and medical cost inflation. So that went in place during the quarter. We had two price increases in Canada during the first half of the year, and then we had higher-priced NAECA products, which had higher cost. But in addition, what you said is material costs did come down during the quarter and that benefited. So it was primarily in North America, and it was a combination of items. Now, to your next question, I think obviously there is \u2013 volume that can skew that. I think you are aware, when you look at the history of the water heater industry, the third quarter normally represents about 22% to 23% in the volumes, which -- so that can theoretically affect gross margins. But I mean, I think at current price and current material costs, those margins are reasonable on a several quarter basis. Noah Duke Kaye : Okay. Very helpful. Second question, we've been hearing even more recently a possibility by Congress to enact legislation that would include repatriation connected to the Highway Trust Fund. I'm sure you're watching that closely. You have talked about this in the past, but can you just remind us, first, if there were to be a repatriation, have you already assumed for income statement accounting purposes that the cash is coming home? And I guess the second there would be, if there were to be such a repatriation, how might that impact your views on doing foreign acquisitions? Thanks. Ajita Rajendra : Well, a portion of it -- we do have accrual for a portion of it. It's approximately $200 million coming back home. So we do have an accrual on the books for that. Congress and the administration have talked about this probably four or five times over the last two years. So at this point we are not holding our breath on this happening. But we're happy to hear they are talking about it. And depending on what the cost is to bring it back, right now, in our mind, it's prohibitive to bring it back. So depending on what the cost is, we'll certainly consider that. But I think we've said all along -- and I don't think these changes it \u2013 that we're looking globally for acquisitions. And I think we'll continue to do that. So I wouldn't see us necessarily bringing back everything immediately, by any means. But we'll certainly evaluate it. We certainly do hope it goes through. Noah Duke Kaye : Okay. Great. Thanks so much. Congrats on the quarter. Ajita Rajendra : Thanks. John Kita : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital. Your question, please. Jeffrey Hammond : Hi, good morning guys. Ajita Rajendra : Good morning. John Kita : Hi, Jeff. Jeffrey Hammond : Can you just \u2013 so back to the North America margins, I mean, it seems like the big variable going forward is really input costs. And if those go back up, then maybe this margin is not sustainable. But it doesn't seem like there's any real aberrations in the margin. Ajita Rajendra : No, nothing significant from an aberration standpoint. No unusual items in the quarter. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay. And then can you just talk about how ERP rolls off into 2016? Ajita Rajendra : Well, we're looking at that as our planning process. We said this year we'll spend $19 million to $20 million in expense. Our best guess is that will be similar to maybe up a little bit next year, as we take more sites on in 2016. But we're evaluating that right now. We did our Johnson City plant, as we said, in August 2014. We did Lochinvar in May of this year. And given some of the NAECA items that have developed along the way, because it's been all-hands-on-deck from a NAECA standpoint \u2013 we probably will not do any more sites in 2015. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay. And just finally, on NAECA III, have you seen any dislocation from competitors, where you've been able to maybe perform better in the near-term or capture share? Or is everyone kind of transitioning well? Ajita Rajendra : I mean, as I think we talked about last time, we weren't expecting anyone to really have any significant hiccups. So this has been in process for quite some time. From what we see, there really has not been much in the way of share changes during the first half of the year. John Kita : Yeah. We didn't model anything or expect anything. And it's kind of playing out. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from William Bremer from Maxim Group. Question please sir. William Bremer : Good morning, Ajita, John, Pat. Outstanding quarter. Ajita Rajendra : Thank you. John Kita : Hi, Bill. William Bremer : Hey, good morning. My first question \u2013 and maybe you could just help me out on this \u2013 is on the China market : what is the breakdown of, say, replacement versus new? I know you emphasized Tier 1 replacement in your remarks, but can you give us a sense of what's currently the run rate there or the split there? John Kita : I can tell you, based on our survey data, there is no good data put out by the government on that, or at least we haven't found it. But when we look at our surveys that we have of people that bought, when I was over there two or three years ago and I ask every time I'm over there \u2013 they had talked about Tier 1 cities kind of being in the 35% range or whatever. And as we've been over there more recently, the talk is closer to 50% in Tier 1 cities. And that's logical, because you've now got pretty high penetration rates in Tier 1 cities for water heaters. So now we talk about our life being eight years. We're not going to comment on the life of what our competitors are, but at eight years you'll start having some replacement. So we think it's a bigger piece of the pot. And quite frankly, it will probably grow into bigger pieces of pot, especially in Tier 1 cities. Ajita Rajendra : And also I think, Bill, anecdotally our brand is positioned at the high end. It's an aspirational brand. So as people's incomes get higher, and they replace, then if they decide on buying a better brand, then they gravitate more towards A. O. Smith. So it was a combination of all of that. But as John said, we don't really have any good quantitative data to back it up. William Bremer : Right. Now, shifting to Lochinvar, seems as though it's been stellar, stellar performance. The market is starting to gravitate towards it. You are doing more and more fabrication for some top clients. And now we are starting to see it truly accelerate. Could you give us a sense of, first \u2013 not only the expansion, but give us a sense of the contribution to the quarter as well as the aftermarket? John Kita : Well, I'll start, and then Ajita can fill in. The aftermarket was up about 9%, which has been pretty consistent with what we had expected. Their commercial market has been very strong. We have talked about beginning of the year we thought the commercial industry for water heaters would be flat, and now we're talking it's going to be up 3%. They are continuing to see very strong commercial build. As I alluded to earlier, their margin points are up several points in the first half of the year. Their sales are up over 10% the first half of the year and their business continues to do very, very well. It's helped, obviously, by the new products that have come out. They expanded their line on the CREST down to 750,000 BTU. They bought out a fire tube boiler in the smaller range, and that's doing well. So all in all, Lochinvar had a great first half of the year. And they contributed to the performance in North America. Ajita Rajendra : And you know, the only thing I would add to that is that the strategy behind Lochinvar is new products and coming out with new things. And we continue to invest in that area. As you saw during the Analyst Day, we are expanding our capacity in terms of engineering and testing capability and expanding the factory. And all of that is going well. And we will continue to invest in the key drivers, which is technology and being first to market with the best products in the marketplace. William Bremer : Right. Ajita Rajendra : And it's working. William Bremer : I appreciate it. My last question is on the operating margins in North America. Very solid. The 19.4% -- that includes the 4 million of ERP systems, correct? Ajita Rajendra : Right. Well, the incremental of ERP. So I mean you can kind of look at -- we're talking about $20 million of expenditures in 2015. And it's roughly flat lined, 5 million a quarter -- not quite, but about 5 million a quarter. What we're saying is last year in the quarter, it was about 1 million or so. And so there was an incremental four. So second quarter compared to third quarter ERP costs this year will be relatively similar. William Bremer : Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instruction] Our next question comes from Todd Vencil from Sterne Agee. Your question please. Todd Vencil : Thanks. Good morning, guys. John Kita : Hi, Todd. Ajita Rajendra : Good morning. Todd Vencil : I want to focus in on the margin in North America again I know you've had a few questions on it and given a few answers, but it was a big number, so I really want to make sure I understand it. John, you laid out the factors, and you kind of talked about them. Is there any way you can sort of size up how much was price and how much was sort of lower materials costs and things like that in terms of maybe the incremental operating profit in North America in the quarter? Or is that just kind of too hard to do? Ajita Rajendra : Yes. We really are not going to break that out. And it's difficult to get your hands around it. But those -- the pieces I alluded to, the Canadian price increase, the price increase on non-NAECA, Lochinvar, the sale of higher-priced NAECA product, and lower material costs -- all of those where relatively significant factors in the improvement. Todd Vencil : Got it. And can you maybe let me know how much those -- you know, I think you have talked about the NAECA -- the step-up on the NAECA-compliant product being about 20%. Can you remind me what the price increases were on the other products? Ajita Rajendra : I think we said that they were -- commercial, we said there was a wide range depending on the geographic location and the type of product. I think you are probably somewhere in the high single digits on the other type products. Todd Vencil : Got it. That's helpful. And on the lower raw materials, is that something that per your -- either your arrangements with distributors and customers or, given the competitive environment, that you are enjoying it for now but going to end up giving back? Or do you think you get to hold onto that raw material benefit? John Kita : Ajita, he was asking about raw material costs and pass-throughs etcetera. On wholesale, it's done traditionally through price adjustments, price increases or decreases, depending on the marketplace. But there is no direct pass-through on the wholesale side. Todd Vencil : No. Yes. John Kita : Retail with some of our customers -- we do have some pass-through of steel, etcetera. Todd Vencil : Would those be kind of yet to come? Or those have impacted? John Kita : I think they vary. They go in different cycles. And some of them are sooner than others. But they tend to be a little bit after. Todd Vencil : Okay. And so if I kind of look at that 19.4% margin in North America, it feels like there's a whole lot that went right in the quarter. So would you think, like, a 19%-plus level is sustainable? Or just going to continue to kind of trend higher on a trailing four-quarter basis, or something like that? John Kita : Well, I think I alluded to it. I think the 19.4 -- what it was, based on current prices and current material costs and the continued strength in the commercial market -- which, remember, helps two of our operations; it helps our commercial water heater, and it helps our Lochinvar, which are higher-margin business. We are not uncomfortable with that range, given those factors. Ajita Rajendra : Yes, and I think the key -- the wildcard is material costs. That can have an impact. Todd Vencil : Well, I'll put steel on my screen, then, and keep an eye on that. Final question, kind of relatedly, kind of not : how does the inventory in the channel look? I know you were expecting some -- I guess a lot of guys were buying the non-NAECA III compliant. And I'm speaking -- I know you have talked about China, so I mean specifically about the U.S. now. But for you guys and for your customers, how do you feel like the inventory looks? Ajita Rajendra : Maybe I'll take a stab, and John, you add to it. You know, unfortunately the visibility of inventory in most of our channels is very tough. Okay? In wholesale it's very difficult to take a look at. The retail side -- it's a little easier. And China, like I said, China is the one that -- again, it's an estimate. We feel it's a little on the high side, but not higher than last quarter. It's higher than the end of the year or from one year ago. But again, this tends to be lumpy sometimes when you look at it quarter-by-quarter because of the fact, as we have talked about in terms of people trying -- sometimes buying in to hit volume targets -- quarterly volume targets for VIPs; sometimes buying in for holidays, etcetera., that have high sales. So we're watching it. We are not concerned about it, but we are watching it. John Kita : When we look -- Todd, when we look at North America, as Ajita said, we don't have great visibility. But when we talk to our customers, our impression is that levels might be slightly elevated -- but not to any significant level, which is good. And that's why we felt comfortable increasing the full-year residential and commercial, because of our understanding of what's in the channel. Again, with the caveat we don't have great visibility. But certainly, we talk to our customers. Ajita Rajendra : Right. So bottom line, we are comfortable with the annual guidance. And we are not overly -- we are watching, but not overly concerned about the inventory levels. Todd Vencil : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Connors from Boenning & Scattergood. Your question please. Ryan Connors : Great. Thanks for taking my question. A couple of different type questions. First off, it was our understanding that there was an effort in the Senate to exempt certain water heaters used in electric utility demand/response programs from the NAECA III regulation. I wasn't ever sure what the outcome of that was. Do you know about that effort and whether that was successful? Ajita Rajendra : It's still pending, but we don't expect a big impact on the market because of that for some time. It's a long period of time. Ryan Connors : Okay. So that's not been finalized at this point? Ajita Rajendra : Yes. Ryan Connors : Okay. Ajita Rajendra : And it's for really very, very large capacity type water heaters. Ryan Connors : Yes. Now, do you manufacture any of those, to the extent that does go through? Or is that other players? Ajita Rajendra : You know, we do manufacture some of them, but it's not a huge impact. But again, like I said, we don't see a huge impact of that legislation hitting this industry, if at all, for a long period of time. Ryan Connors : Okay. Separately, a lot of news by one of the very large companies in the industry, General Electric, about some acquisitions they are planning, if they can get them through. Does that have any impact potentially on you all? What's your view there of how their recent strategic shifts impact their focus on this industry or not? Ajita Rajendra : Not really. When you think of the water heater industry and General Electric, they are small player in one category which is heat pump water heaters. And that's part of their appliance business, which is pending sale to Electrolux. And so we expect that to continue. We don't know of any change in strategy by Electrolux, and so we have no idea \u2013 it's a very small impact on the industry. Ryan Connors : Okay. And then finally, just the issue \u2013 I don't think you have addressed online sales at all in China, and how that's trending, and how all the noise in China that you have talked about a lot on the call here impacts the outlook for that piece of the business? John Kita : We haven't seen \u2013 so last year online sales were $55 million. Through the first six months they were about $50 million. We're still tracking towards the $90 million to $100 million that we have talked about on previous calls. So we haven't seen any impact whatsoever, and we are progressing as we expected. Ryan Connors : Okay. And you envision that continuing \u2013 I mean, do you believe that's going to flatten out at some time? Or do you think that really will continue to grow at that kind of a trajectory and pretty quickly become the majority of the business? John Kita : No, I don't think it's going to grow at that trajectory. It's not going to go at 100% a year. There's still an \u2013 and again, we have different components of that. So water heaters probably represent about 75% of net sales. Water treatment represents 20% of net sales; and air purifiers, maybe 5% of net sales at most for the year is what we're expecting. So we think it will probably still continue to grow, but not at that trajectory. Ryan Connors : Okay. Great. Thanks for your time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Rose from Wedbush Securities. Your question please. David Rose : Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Just a couple last ones. And not to go too much into the margin side, but just to clarify, as we look at the ERP comparison, it's easier in Q3 and Q4 than it was the prior year. Margins should be the same, all else being equal, but you get the benefit from the ERP. So am I missing something that would suggest that your margin in North America wouldn't be higher? John Kita : No, I guess what we're saying, David, is we were about \u2013 we'll be about 19 million or 20 million this year. And it was flat-lined -- somewhat flat-lined at 5 million a quarter, let's say. Last year, the first half of the year, it was 14 million. It was only about $4 million. Okay? So the 10 million versus 4 million is -- it affected us $6 million compared to the prior year. This year, the last half of the year, it's going to be roughly 10 million of ERP in 2015 compared to 10 million of ERP in 2014. So I don't know if that clarifies for your question, but it won't have an impact on margins over the prior year. David Rose : Okay. And so, then, there really shouldn't be any negative drag other than the possibility of kind of the pass-through costs for steel, if that happens? John Kita : And volumes. So when you look at volumes for the water heater industry, it's normally about 52% or so in the first half of the year, 48% the last half of the year. Commercial is very similar. So, volumes second half of the year will be a little bit less than the first half of the year, which has an impact. David Rose : Okay. That's helpful. And then, China, just lastly, you provided some good commentary about market sentiment. Maybe you can provide a little bit more commentary about your strategy in terms of pricing and promotion in light of what you may see a slightly weaker market or potentially a weaker market? Do you plan to be more aggressive? Do you plan to do more promotional work? Do you think you may limit your ability to increase prices? Ajita Rajendra : There's a lot of questions there. So, promotion-wise, certainly we are spending more on promotion on air purifiers, water treatment, and also online. So that's a fact. We are spending more on those areas, as they are relatively new areas. So we are spending more promotion dollars there. As we have talked about in the past that SG&A spend can be very volatile. Last year it was very volatile. And we ended up at about 13.8% or so for rest-of-world, which was driven by China. But there was wide differences by quarter-to-quarter. This year we're thinking it's going to be more leveled out. And we have talked about being about 13.5% to 13.75%, let's say, for the full year. And that drop is driven by a couple things : it's driven by our investment in air purification. It's driven by our investment in water treatment in India. And also, we started selling water treatment in Vietnam, and that's having a negative effect on those margins. So we're very comfortable with where the margins are. They're pretty much what we had talked about. And again, what differentiates us from a lot of people in China is our growth model isn't dependent on only one item. We have those three buckets, and that gives us some comfort going forward. We will continue to build the brand and invest in the brand. I don't know if that answers your question. David Rose : Well, actually \u2013 I mean, the commentaries are pretty consistent, obviously, with what you've said in the past. I guess what I was really trying to get at was \u2013 and maybe you answered it earlier \u2013 you don't seem to be terribly concerned about the environment in China, the current stock market volatility in China, to make you change any of your pricing or promotional strategy or SG&A strategy. And that's really what I was getting at. Ajita Rajendra : No, we don't. Like we've always said, we are always going to \u2013 there are going to be quarterly ups and downs in the marketplace in China. And we are very comfortable \u2013 or anywhere \u2013 and we are very comfortable with the longer-term guidance that we've given. And we manage the ups and downs as best we can, as we see them coming. Specifically in terms of the stock market, like I said, we are not concerned about the impact of it in terms of looking at the number of people it impacts, and all the reasons I gave -- and the fact that it's up 70% from last year, anyway, even with this recent drop. So we don't see that as having a long-term impact on our type of customer. John Kita : And I think as Ajita has alluded to, in 2008 the market dropped much more significantly than what it did. And it didn't have a significant effect on consumer spending. So we've looked at a lot of economists work, and there's no empirical evidence that ties to stock market move to consumer spending. And again, we also say \u2013 or household formation, so time will tell if this is something different, but there's nothing from a historical standpoint that supports that. David Rose : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert McCarthy from Stifel. Question, please. Robert Paul McCarthy : Yeah. Just a couple of follow-ups. You cited the strength in kind of your commercial-facing end markets. Clearly, you updated your guidance there. But any other additional color about how \u2013 you know, did you feel like this is real and sustainable? How do you think about where we could be? Could this be a multiyear thing in terms of the growth you are seeing? John Kita : I wish I could answer that. We haven't done a great job of estimating the commercial market. We continue \u2013 you know, we talk to our salespeople, and they are seeing it in a lot of different components. You know, gas, high-efficiency is becoming a bigger piece in the last three years. And that certainly is in one of our areas of strength. The hotel and the restaurant business is doing fairly well. So we are seeing construction there as well as retrofit work. We're also seeing for redundancy work being done. That's on kind of the commercial water heater. And then the verticals that Lochinvar works with are the educational side. And they are starting to see some potential in the healthcare side, et cetera. So there's been a lot of talk about commercial coming back, and it hasn't. But it has, for our businesses, come back pretty well. So we certainly cross our fingers and hope it will continue for the next several years. Robert Paul McCarthy : And it sounds like you haven't seen material weakness in Canada. I think you alluded to some pricing as well. But I mean, could you comment there in terms of what you are seeing, and \u2013 just to give the macro outlook there? John Kita : Not much change in the industry. It's relatively flat year-over-year. But obviously, because of the currency, it's been affected. I mean three of the four players on manufacture in the U.S. So there's been impact there -- three of the four major players, I should say -- impacted there. We had some currency translation, adjustment of our top line, obviously, as the currency has devalued. But as I said, there's been price increases that have gone in there. Robert Paul McCarthy : And then, finally, on China, just in terms of -- two questions. One, have you seen -- I mean, you are talking about the fact that you expect this replacement cycle to kind of manifest itself. Could you cite just specific -- just incremental or anecdotal -- data points that you are seeing that, number one? Obviously aside from the strong growth rate; I understand that. And then just number two, perhaps comment on how we should think about the long-term growth trajectory for water treatment vis-\u00e0-vis your core business? John Kita : Well, it's anecdotal replacement, and its anecdotal surveys that we do of people that buy water heaters. And it really is kind of the Tier 1 -- where I alluded to earlier. It's gone from 35% to 45% and 50%. So it truly is anecdotal. But it also makes sense, right, because of the high penetration rate for some time. Water heaters don't last forever, so they are going to be replaced. Water treatment Ajita alluded to : CMM has estimated a 35% to 40% growth rate over the next four or five years. We are comfortable with that growth rate. We have the right product in the right market with our reverse osmosis and our tankless product. We feel we have the best product on the marketplace. So we are comfortable with those types of growth rates as we look at it. Robert Paul McCarthy : Thanks for your time. Operator : And we have a follow-up question from William Bremer from Maxim Group. Your question please. William Bremer : Follow-up -- maybe if you can just comment a little bit on the pricing environment in China. And given the $10 million inventory build there, what should we expect? John Kita : It's fairly flat, I think. Ajita Rajendra : Yes. In terms of pricing in China as we go on \u2013 first of all, for obvious reasons we can't talk about pricing. But in China in the environment is \u2013 we rarely \u2013 our pricing comes from new products with new features, and benefits, and different value propositions that we are able to then get higher prices in the marketplace. Being a consumer appliance, that's essentially the way we improve unit price in the marketplace in China. The environment for pricing is \u2013 you know, it's a very tough environment. If you look at the CPI and PPI in China, they are actually headed downward. But in terms of tying to inventory levels, like I said, we are watching it. We are aware of it. But at this point we are comfortable with the guidance for the year. William Bremer : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I'm not showing any other questions in the queue. I would like to hand the call back over to Patricia Ackerman for closing remarks. Patricia Ackerman : Thank you all for joining us today. We have posted a slide deck from our Analyst Day in May and a new video showcasing our China business on our website, aosmith.com. We welcome your questions, and please do not hesitate to contact me. Have a wonderful day. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude our program. You may now disconnect.

O. Smith Corp Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Patricia Ackerman. Ma'am you may begin. Patricia K. Ackerman: Thank you, Shannel. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on our 2015 third quarter results conference call. With me participating in the call are Ajita Rajendra, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Kita, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin with Ajita's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning's press release. I will now turn the call over to Ajita who will begin with remarks on slide 3. Ajita G. Rajendra: Thank you, Pat and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. We set earnings records again in the third quarter and sales were the second highest in company history. Here are a few highlights. Organic growth in both of our segments drove sales 7.5% higher to a third quarter record of $625 million. Despite being a record, this is lower than our previous estimate for the third quarter as we believe a pre-buy of residential water heaters in the first quarter ultimately negatively impacted third quarter volume. In addition, the decline in the value of the Chinese currency negatively impacted sales by $5 million.  China sales were up over 13% in local currency. Net earnings of $0.82 per share were 39% higher than the adjusted earnings per share of $0.59 in 2014. We continue to review our capital allocation and dedicate a portion to return to shareholders. In addition to our regular dividend we repurchased approximately 850,000 shares of $57 million during the third quarter. Our transition to NAECA III compliant products is complete. This was a complex project impacting approximately 80% of our U.S. residential water heaters. John will now describe our results in more detail beginning with slide 4. John J. Kita: Thank you, Ajita. Sales in the third quarter of 625 million were 7.5% higher than the previous year. Net earnings of 74 million were 38% higher than third quarter adjusted earnings in 2014. As shown on slide 5, net earnings of $0.82 per share improved 39% compared with adjusted earnings per share of $0.59 in 2014. Sales in our North America segment of 417 million increased 6% over 2014, driven by a price increases in the U.S. and Canada for residential and commercial water heaters and higher volumes of commercial water heaters and commercial boilers. Residential volumes declined as we believe channel inventory continues to adjust to the pre-buy in the first quarter. Rest of world segment sales of 217 million increased over 9% compared with 2014.  China sales increased over 13% in local currency driven by higher demand for water heaters and water treatment products. Higher China sales were partially offset by currency translation and lower sales in India and Europe. Consistent with prior years we believe inventory levels at some of our customers in China were elevated in advance of the one week holiday in October.  On slide 7, North America operating earnings of 91 million were 61% higher than adjusted segment operating earnings in the previous year and operating margin of 21.7% was significantly above the 14.4% adjusted operating margins one year ago. Pricing actions in the U.S. and Canada, higher sales of the Lochinvar-branded products, and commercial water heaters and lower steel and ERP implementation cost contributed to the significantly improved segment performance. The impact to profits from lower residential volumes in the U.S. partially offset these favorable factors.  Rest of world operating earnings of 27 million declined compared with 2014. Higher sales and lower steel costs were more than offset by lower sales of highly profitable commercial water heaters in China and increased selling, general, and administrative expenses. Higher promotion cost in advance of China\u2019s one week holiday in October as well as higher development and advertising cost associated with the 2015 launch of air purification in China and water treatment products in India were the primary drivers of higher segment SG&A expenses.  Segment operating earnings were reduced by almost 1 million due to currency translations. As a result of those factors, third quarter 2015 operating margin of 12.6% was more than the 15.1% operating margin in 2014. Our corporate expenses declined from the adjusted corporate expenses to prior year primarily as a result of higher interest income. Our effective income tax rate during the first nine months of 2015 up 30.7% was higher than the previous year primarily due to the change in our geographic earnings met.  We anticipate our effective income tax rate for the full year will be similar to earlier projections of approximately 30.5%. Cash provided by continuing operations during the first nine months of 2015 was 232 million compared with 165 million provided in 2014 driven primarily by higher earnings and smaller outlays for working capital in the 2015 period. Our liquidity position and balance sheet remains strong. Our debt to capital ratio was 15% at the end of September 2015. We have cash balances totaling more than 600 million located offshore and our net cash position was approximately 345 million at the end of September.  During the first nine months of the year we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares of common stock for a total of $104 million under a 10b51 automatic trading plan and in the open markets. We had approximately 900,000 shares remaining on our existing authorization authority at the end of September. Depending on factors such as stock price, working capital requirements, and alternative investment opportunities we expect to spend approximately 128 million on share repurchase activity in 2015 resulting in net cash levels similar to 2014 year-end levels. This is consistent with our stated capital allocation strategy. Please turn to slide 9 for several full year assumptions. We expect our cash flow from operations in 2015 to be approximately 300 million. We expect capital expenditures to be between $85 million and $90 million in 2015 which includes approximately 17 million to support the ERP implementation and approximately 30 million related to capacity expansions in China and in the U.S. with the U.S. portion in support of Lochinvar-branded sale. Our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately 65 million in 2015. We successfully completed our first two ERP go live milestones in August 2014 and May 2015. We expect to convert the majority of our North America plant sites by the end of 2016. ERP implementation expenses were 14 million in 2014 and are projected to be about 17 million in 2015. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately 43 million in 2015. This morning we increased our 2015 EPS guidance to be between $3.08 and $3.12 per share. The midpoint of our upgraded EPS guidance represents a 28% increase in EPS compared with our 2014 adjusted results. I will now turn the call back to Ajita who will summarize the assumptions in our 2015 outlook and our growth strategy beginning on slide 11. Ajita. Ajita G. Rajendra: Thank you, John. Our China business grew 15% in local currency through the first nine months of 2015. Many of you have seen our China growth model. In the past we have used a multiple of China GDP as a simple proxy for our China growth. We do not believe that China GDP is the only driver of our growth, nor does it adequately reflect our potential in China. We are a consumer product company in China which distinguishes us from most industrial companies operating in China today. We have three growth drivers underpinning our China business which gives us the confidence to continue to project an annual growth rate of approximately 15% in local currency for the foreseeable future.  The first driver is overall market growth which we believe is impacted by household formation and a growing replacement market. One factor that might not be obvious when looking at our China business for the first time is that a developer is very unlikely to install water heater or water purification products in apartments offered for sale. In fact about 80% of high rise apartments in China are sold without water heaters or other appliances. The newly formed households essentially buys an apartment with four walls and decorates it or finishes it after purchase. We view the unsold apartments as a major opportunity in China which is very different than in the U.S. Our focus therefore is not on new apartments that have been built but on the sales of apartments to individual home owners which by the way is increasing. The three months moving average year-over-year growth rate of new apartment square footage sold was in the mid-teens in July and in August. The other proxies we used to track water heater and water treatment appliance sales growth are retail sales as well as growth in the consumption portion of GDP. The IMS forecast for China consumption growth which was published in August is 7% this year and almost 8% next year. With continued urbanization, growth in the middle class and a replacement and upgrade markets of 50% in the larger cities, this is based not surveyed, we expect strong market growth to continue in China for quite some time into the foreseeable future. The second growth driver is market share gains and the increases in average price. We have a strong market position by value in the electric wall hung category.  Our position in gas tankers while a leader is less than 20% by value. We see opportunity to gain more share in our well accepted and patented super quite models. Our commitment to engineering resources will continue to result in new product with features and benefits in which consumers be valued and for which they are willing to pay an incrementally higher price. This results in a favorable mix impact and increases the average price per unit sold.  The third growth driver is fast growing ancillary product category, the most significant example of which is water treatment. A. O. Smith branded water treatment added 5 percentage points of growth to our total China volume in each of the last two years and is expected to grow from $75 million last year to over $105 million this year. In addition we expect to sell approximately $8 million in air purifiers in 2015, after launching the A. O. Smith branded category in March of this year. The combination of A. O. Smith branded water treatment and air purifiers will add over 5 percentage points of growth this year. The last two drivers I mentioned are primarily in our control as we continue to invest behind them. The first is a function of the growing replacement market and urban household formation especially at the income levels in which consumers typically buy our products and which is forecasted to increase significantly over the next few years. Combining these three growth drivers gives us the confidence that we will continue to grow at approximately 15% annually in local currency for a number of years into the future.  On the next slide I will describe our portfolio growth model. We believe our 8% organic growth potential for the next several years differentiates A. O. Smith among other industrial companies. We are comfortable with our projected China growth rate of approximately 15% in local currency as I have explained. Sales of Lochinvar branded products grew over 9% during the first nine months of 2015 which included commercial boilers growing at a faster rate. Given the strength in our end markets we continue to believe sales of Lochinvar branded products will grow approximately 10% per year.  The residential water heater industry continues to transition through the NAECA III regulatory change as channel inventories built in the first half of the year continue to run off. Based on our volumes through the first nine months of the year, we believe the industry volumes will be flat for the year, slightly less than the pace year-to-date. Our estimate for industry volumes of commercial water heaters is 178,000 or 6% increase over last year, and also slightly less than the pace year-to-date.  We expect sales in India will be approximately $15 million, down from our earlier projection of $20 million due to decline in new home sales that is a result of lower than expected sales of water heater and water treatment products. Losses are expected to be slightly higher than the prior year.  Slide 13, the next slide outlines our four options for capital allocation. One, we continue to invest in ourselves. As John mentioned earlier, we expect to spend approximately $85 million to $90 million this year on capital projects. Two, we have borrowing capacity and cash to support over $1 billion worth of acquisition and our strategy has not changed. We remain focused on water heating and water treating companies around the world as well as business which will leverage our brand and distribution channels in China. Three, we will deliver a growing, sustainable, and competitive dividend. We have increased our dividend by 20% or more in each of the last four years. And four, we are satisfied with the cash and borrowing capacity we have for acquisitions therefore we are comfortable repurchasing shares in 2015 in an amount slightly less than the free cash flow after dividends or approximately $130 million. This concludes our prepared remarks and now we are open for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Hammond : Can you hear me? Ajita G. Rajendra: Can now. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay, can you just -- I mean the margins are exceptional in North America, can you just talk about any aberrations to the good and just talk about sustainability of those margins? Ajita G. Rajendra: Well, as we have talked in the past there are several significant items. We have had price increases that we have talked about in commercial and residential and also in Canada. Lochinvar sales were up in the third quarter and their historically back half of the year is much stronger than the first half of the year so that significantly helps margins.  Commercial volumes were also up and so it is kind of a series [ph] and material cost were down. So it is a series of many items. Now, the current margins were over 21% in North America. Again our health buy Lochinvar in the second half of the year, we talked last quarter and he said that on an ongoing annual basis flat 19% to 20% has reached the current commercial level pricing and deferred levels. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay, and then just real quick on residential, what is your assessment of kind of inventory that was pre-bought being kind of rung out and then along those same lines any kind of feedback from distributors or the channel that consumers are reacting negatively to kind of the higher price point products around kind of the NAECA increase? Ajita G. Rajendra: Well, so the first one is inventory levels. We said at the end of June they were slightly elevated. I guess now in hindsight they were probably a little more elevated than what we thought. If you look at what happened, the trend during the quarter in July and August thus far residentials were down about 5% -- 4% to 5%. We are expecting in September they were down closer to 20%. Now part of that is a very difficult comp with the prior year but the other part was still meaningful adjustments of inventory levels. And I think when you go back on what we have said, when we started the year we said that we thought there was a pre-buy of 100,000 units in 2014. Then we rolled forward to the first quarter and the first quarter volumes were up 300,000. In the second quarter we said we assumed residential was going to be down about 10% and it was flat and we were surprised by that and we -- I will say prematurely then took our estimates for the industry up by about 150,000 units. I think we are right back to where we started with our original projections saying we think the industry is going to be flat for the year and part of that is going to come out of September and October. So that would be our best guess. I will comment on consumer pricing and I haven\u2019t heard anything. I will make the comment that from an end consumer product, the price is very reasonable. You get a six year warranty, you get a very energy efficient product that is going to last 12 to 14 years. So, in the appliance world it is a very reasonably priced end product that I guess -- I haven\u2019t heard any push back if you will. John J. Kita: I think that is very accurate. There has been no push back we are hearing in the marketplace in terms of from the end user. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay, thanks guys. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from Todd Vencil of Sterne, Agee. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Todd Vencil : Hey, good morning guys. Ajita G. Rajendra: Good morning. Todd Vencil : Speaking with North America residential for a second, if we look at the margin is there any way to kind of -- I think the three big categories you sort of decided there were -- that we would think about were the mix really down and the higher margin commercial and Lochinvar up. There has got to be some production incremental going on there and then price cost, on the price cost obviously you had the price increase but the new units were more expensive, have you actually seen an improvement in your price cost spread there that you can tell? John J. Kita: Well the only comment I\u2019ll make is fuel cost have come down somewhat. But otherwise I think you summarized it pretty well. It is a combination of price increases and non data and commercial both in the U.S. and Canada. We have higher margin dollars associated with the NAECA product. We had a very strong again commercial which helps both our Lochinvar and our commercial water heaters. And we have lower material cost. It\u2019s the variety and then on top of it compared to the prior year we had about 5 million less ERP cost. So it\u2019s a variety of several items. Todd Vencil : Got it, thanks. And I think you just said this but I will just ask this it is really a way to make sure the 20% increase you guys put it on the NAECA products that hold up even in the face of the declines in volumes that you have seen in the third quarter? John J. Kita: In the declines in volumes in the third quarter, as we stated in the past we did increase prices for the new NAECA III products on average 20% and we have been very transparent with what the NAECA pricing increase is. We really can't comment any further on pricing as we\u2019re the only public company in our industry. Todd Vencil : Got it, fair enough. Switching to China just to make sure you said, Ajita I think that in the first nine months of the year China growth ex-currency was about 15%? Ajita G. Rajendra: Yes. Todd Vencil : Okay, and then the inventory issues that you mentioned heading into holiday are we through those at this point do you think. John J. Kita: Well I don\u2019t think we necessarily said we had inventory issues. I mean we said that inventory levels in the third quarter were up consistent with the prior year and we think that was driven primarily by the holiday that comes in late September and goes through October. So at this point I don\u2019t think we are uncomfortable with the inventory level. Ajita G. Rajendra: And as John said, the increase we saw was in inline with the increase we had last year. Todd Vencil : Got it, understood, thanks for that. And then final words from me, if we think about the China business and I just want to make sure I am thinking about the math the right way, you mentioned that water accumulated filtration I think added, I think you said more than 5 percentage points to the growth rate, should we take from that the growth rate on water heaters is around 10%? John J. Kita: I mean so when we break it into the three buckets we really say that the first bucket is the water heater market and our expectation is its going to grow about 7%. And I say that\u2019s about what we\u2019re seeing and we now have the formal number for last year and as we look at numbers and then we\u2019re seeing that\u2019s about 70% of our business. So that ends up being about 5 points. And then the third bucket is the one you are eluding to when you look at our water treatment for the last two years that went from 18 to 43 to 75, that added 5 points by itself. This year 73 to over 105 is going to add 4.5 points or whatever and with the air purifier it will add or take us over about 5 points of growth. So I mean that\u2019s how we kind of break it up and then there is the second bucket which Ajita alluded to. Todd Vencil : Got it, okay. Thanks for that. John J. Kita: And I think just another point to add to that is that we hear lots of obviously news about GDP dropping and it has gone, the forecast has gone for 72, 6.9 but what impacts us more is consumption because unlike a lot of companies we are manufacturing in China for the Chinese market and the Chinese consumer. And so the consumption portion of GDP is what impacts us more and the forecast -- IMA forecast for that component is growth of 7% to 8% in the next couple of years. So it is very consistent with what we\u2019re seeing and what you are hearing from us. Todd Vencil : Got it, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from William Bremer of Maxim Group. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. William Bremer : Good morning Ajita, John, and Pat. Ajita G. Rajendra: Hey Bill. Patricia K. Ackerman: Good morning. William Bremer : My first question is where steel prices are currently is now the time that the Board thinks about locking in for the foreseeable future, how do you look at that given the balance of your growth? And secondly China, can you give us a sense on the how much more investment is needed specifically on the air purification, is that just basically being targeted for your stores and then just an update on the store rotations in terms of tier 1 to tier 3 phase? John J. Kita: So, I will start with the last one. Store locations were about 8000 stores so that is top. I think the distribution of 40% in tier 1 and 60% in tier 2 and 3 is still pretty close. So that hasn\u2019t changed. Your first one is hedging of reconfigured, low cost [ph] hedging that is not as terribly liquid market on the LME and on the exchanges but we continue to look at it. And we have made no formal decisions. The second one was air purifiers. Well I think the one comment we have made is that given the significant growth in water treatment and we think the potential for air purification, we are going to have to put some breath in water in China for those two businesses and we are kind of evaluating the options right now on what to do there. Ajita G. Rajendra: And I think Bill if your question was around the investment in terms of SG&A and advertising, etc we have been saying that we will lose about $4 million in the category, air purification category and we are comfortable with that. So we are in line with what we have been saying. William Bremer : And then once you John on the ERP implementation mentioned 17 million, how much has been spent year-to-date there and am I under the correct assumption of 5 million hitting the fourth quarter? John J. Kita: Yeah, I think the fourth quarter is about $4 million or $5 million Bill, somewhere in that range is reasonable. So when you are 17 so we spend about 13 year-to-date. I mean we have been kind of running at that $4 million to $5 million range if you will. William Bremer : And that is exclusively in North America, correct. John J. Kita: That is exclusively in North America. William Bremer : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from Kevin Maczka of BB&T Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Kevin Maczka : Thanks, good morning. John J. Kita: Good morning. Kevin Maczka : First question, just to make sure I am clear on the North American water heater forecast that the volumes will be flat this year, so we had a big pre-buy in late 2014, the price increases hit in early 2015, why is it again that is starting to materialize in the form of 20% volume declines in September and October, is that primarily a comp issue or I am just wondering why are we seeing such a severe decline now? John J. Kita: I mean, it is a great question and obviously we did not certainly anticipate it when we took volumes out. But the best and I will use the word guess is lead times. If you go back to the first quarter they certainly wanted some of the -- our partners wanted some of the old products and we put them on allocation but they got them. The new product came out and they certainly wanted some of that product and the lead times I think for the industry extended some. And because we were changing 80% of our SKUs, it was a significant undertaking. So, I think there was safety stock built up, etc, etc that is just again our estimate and that now lead times are back to more normal levels. For us and we would guess for all of our competition and now there is some excess inventory in the channel. That is the best for lack of better word that we can come up with. Ajita G. Rajendra: And I think lot of just in times that some say they adjust upwards and lead times go out and they adjust downwards and lead times shorten. And I think it is an impact of that. But as John said, it surprised us too. It was higher than we anticipated but we don\u2019t see any major market impact that is causing that other than inventory. John J. Kita: And so we are right back as I said earlier to our original estimate where we thought there was about 100,000 of pre-buy, 100,000 to 150,000 pre-buy in the fourth quarter and we said completions were going to be up 100 to 150. And so we would watch and we kind of said the industry would be flat. Now the thing to remember is the industry has grown pretty nicely over the last two years as replacement has become a bigger piece. So I think right now we\u2019re staying flat as a reasonable expectation. William Bremer : Got it, it all makes sense and to get too flat what does that imply for the remaining months of the year. John J. Kita: The remaining months of the year, for the fourth quarter we would expect it is going to be down and again part of that is a reflection of that pre-buy that happened last year, right, that\u2019s 100,000 to 150,000 units. So it ends up with the industry being down I guess couple hundred thousand units or something. William Bremer : Okay, got it. And if I could just ask one more on China and I appreciate all the comments and the new ones on the resi side with the purchasing the heaters after the apartment purchase but, I am wondering if you can say a little bit more about what you are seeing on the commercial side. It sounds like that was a little bit softer, is there some macro pressure on that side of the business there? John J. Kita: Really it did have an effect on margins in the third quarter. We have about a $30 million business last year so it\u2019s not a huge business but it\u2019s a very profitable business. Year-to-date we saw that its down over 30% and it has specifically affected the third quarter by about 3 million sales being down 3 million and profit being down 2 million. So, the bad news is that it had a significant effect, the good news is the business is only $30 million business and we have seen that in a couple of different parts. We saw that in our Lochinvar business to sell boilers through a distributor. Those sales were down in the third quarter also relatively significantly. So the bad news is yes, the commercial market is weak. The good news for us is that it is not a huge component of our sales by any means. Ajita G. Rajendra: And this is in line with again things we have been reading about China where infrastructure spending has come down and this is again as John said, small part of our business but it is being impacted by that. William Bremer : And I\u2019ll jump off after this but that\u2019s likely to continue, it sounds like if in fact that sort of China big picture macro pressure? John J. Kita: Well in theory but again if we are down to some $20 million we would think at some level that kind of a baseline. So we are down from 30 to probably a little over 20 this year. I am not sure it will go much lower.  And it really does mask how well China really did in the quarter because water heaters and water treatment were up very nicely. You take out that $3 million decline in sales they were up 15% in all their other businesses. So they had a very good quarter. Margins were good. Again except for this effect of the commercial business as well the translation of their margins. And with that margin dollars if you will. So all in all I think China had a very good quarter. William Bremer : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from Mike Halloran of Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Mike Halloran : Good morning everyone. So staying on the China side and staying on the margins specifically, you had the promotion cost that extended in the third quarter this year. I think last year and maybe even the year before they were kind of flipped around with very minimal promotion oriented cost in the third quarter or more aggressively in the fourth quarter. Maybe you could just talk about how that tracks as we move into the fourth quarter here and if you expect some revision? John J. Kita: Well I think we would kind of expect that and I think we talked about that a little bit in previous calls. That last year we had higher margins in the first three quarters and then lower margins in the fourth quarter. And it was really as correctly what you said a distribution of some of the SG&A cost. And I think we have kind of said that we expect this year is going to be more of a level type kind of margins for China if you will. Mike Halloran : Okay that makes sense there and then North America, not to beat a dead horse but another question on the residential side, is the implication then once you walk through September-October time period that the inventory levels are then about right size and you see some more normalized trends or do you think that the inventory build stretches a little bit longer in the next couple of months or the months we just had? John J. Kita: I mean as we have talked to our partners we would say it is probably stretches through October and then we anticipationally send a level off. Mike Halloran : That makes sense, thanks guys. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from Samuel Eisner of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Samuel Eisner : Yeah, thanks very much and good morning everyone. Patricia K. Ackerman: Good morning. Samuel Eisner : Just going back to the North American resi comments, I want to understand, you mentioned in this talk is there a way to pass out, is there difference in the channel between your wholesaler customers as well as your retail customers? John J. Kita: In what sense Sam. Samuel Eisner : I mean I guess we know who your largest customer is on the retail side or the home center side but just curious if there is a -- the speed stocking is it across the Board destocking, is it more pronounced in one of those main channels, I just want to understand kind of more simple level? John J. Kita: It is more pronounced in home side. I understand the question now. It is more pronounced in home side. Samuel Eisner : Got it, that is helpful there. And then on the margins, I thought I will ask it again, 700 basis points on a year-on-year basis is pretty phenomenal, you mentioned mix at least for Lochinvar, it is always in the back half of the year so that wouldn\u2019t necessarily be a tailwind, so perhaps you can talk about mix on commercial as well as Lochinvar kind of absent of the normal 2H ramp that you would see far from Lochinvar? Ajita G. Rajendra: I am not exactly sure of the question, but I guess what I will confine is that we have said in the past that Lochinvar is about 60% of their earnings come in the last half of the year, 40% in the first half of the year. We are certainly seeing that and their commercial business is very strong which has given better margins for them. So that is a contributor. We have also seen our commercial business up year-to-date and in the third quarter relatively significantly and again that is a big contributor because those two businesses are our highest margin businesses. Samuel Eisner : Alright, I guess my point is though Lochinvar is always going to be stronger in the back half of the year, so on a year-on-year basis there shouldn\u2019t be a change in the profitability unless your mix is dramatically improved on the other winning commercial water years, so that is\u2026 John J. Kita: Sam, their margin percentages were up very, very nicely for the quarter and year-to-date and part of that is what you alluded to. Commercial was up more and so that contributed to that. I hope that answers the question but yes, their margin percentage points was up very nicely year-to-date. Samuel Eisner : Understood. Sorry, didn\u2019t mean to interrupt. And then I guess just lastly on the rest of the world growth rate, the roughly 9.5% that you guys grew I recognize there is some FX headwinds there. Just wondering if you can put that growth rate that you saw in the quarter into the three main buckets that you guys had referred to as your overall kind of rest of world growth, thanks? John J. Kita: Well, so first of all remember that China was up about 13.5% not 9%. They were up about 13.5% in the quarter and local currency terms. And I guess if you ask me and I haven\u2019t done it but I would say it was 5% or so for water treatment/air purification. We think the market was probably up 4% to 5%. When you adjust for the -- I should say 6% to 7% and then you adjust for our 70% of the business. And we continue to gain share in water in the instantaneous side of the market and some price. So I mean, I think it was reasonably split between those three buckets for us to get the 13.5% in local currency terms. Ajita G. Rajendra: But I do want to caution that quarter-by-quarter that mix will change and frankly we are not really good at forecasting quarter-by-quarter. But from a longer term or an annual perspective we are very comfortable with those three buckets. And it so happens that this quarter they are about a third each. But there are times when one will be growing faster than the other and compensating. So, I just want to caution that it is not always a third, a third, a third for the three buckets. Samuel Eisner : Got it, that's very helpful. I will get back in queue. Thanks. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from Robert McCarthy of Stifel, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Robert McCarthy : Good morning everyone. Ajita G. Rajendra: Good morning. Robert McCarthy : In terms of 2016 and going back to sustainability of the North American margins, given the very impressive performance, I think you alluded earlier in the call that given the factors that were kind of set you would expect a more normalized level of margin in the 2016 time frame could be 19% to 20%, what is the implication for pricing with respect to your North American product, is there disciplined pricing or would you expect tougher pricing incrementally particularly volumes continue to be weak going into 2016? John J. Kita: You know one thing is that we don\u2019t count and don\u2019t speculate on what's going to happen to price going forward. It is just again we are the only public company and we are the only ones out here talking about plans and speculating on prices, something we just don\u2019t do. Robert McCarthy : Okay, fair enough and then I guess tumbling down the question thinking about the deval in China, did you think these steps hurt any of the movement secondly to kind of the high end of the market, it is kind of your bread and butter in terms of or has it hurt pricing in any large degree, how do you think about the deval in terms of the competitive dynamics for you in China? Ajita G. Rajendra: We have not seen any movement away from our product being on the high end. And in fact if we look at our short-term market shares in China again from a value perspective we have been inching up. So we have not seen any movement away from the higher end product. John J. Kita: And I don\u2019t think we would expect to see that we would. Robert McCarthy : Okay and then moving on to, you talked about kind of disconnecting from the China GDP multiply which I think makes some sense and focusing on consumption trends but just looking at China overall, I guess obviously the commercial business was an area of weakness. Are there any other parts of the business that you are just kind of watching I guess in the context of its looks like air purification or was a little late versus your expectation. Obviously these are small numbers but you got it initially about $10 million in resi this year. It looks like it is going to be 8, can you speak to, are you seeing any areas of incremental weakness aside from the commercial side? Ajita G. Rajendra: Not really, I think overall I think like we said during my comments, we are comfortable with the 15% annual growth that we have been talking about. And to your point we\u2019ve used GDP as a convenient benchmark or reference point in the past but as GDP becomes more volatile I think that\u2019s why we are trying to explain more in terms of what really drives our business and we get down to the three buckets that are impacted really by different components of GDP by consumption as opposed to the whole GDP measure by itself. John J. Kita: And air purification I think we have said in the past under $10 million and we were always in that 8 million to 9 million range so I think we are -- we really haven't adjusted that down. I will say that the air purification in the first half of the year, the markets did not grow as expected. But we really didn\u2019t have much effect on us if we\u2019re just bringing our products into the market place at this point in time. Ajita G. Rajendra: The category grew phenomenally fast last year and for the first half of this year has been relatively flat if not down a little. This is the total category in the market. But yes, it\u2019s so comfortable that it\u2019s a great place to go into because we think overtime we\u2019ll be able to bring some innovation and new things to that market. Robert McCarthy : You know, okay, thank you for that and then just looking across the other parts of the portfolio, I guess ERP expense next year what is your expectation initially in terms of incremental expense or tailwind or expense coming down in 2016? John J. Kita: It won't come down. We are going through the planning process right now. It will go up mainly because you end up expensing more during go lives and we will have more go lives next year. So we are kind of looking at that right now and its probably could approach $25 million I guess next year but we are in the process of doing that when we get in the first quarter call, we\u2019ll have finalized that. Robert McCarthy : 25 million in total not incremental expense right, okay to be clear right John J. Kita: And that is very much a guess at this point. Robert McCarthy : Now that will be refined down the road. Okay and then just on the M&A front. I mean, obviously you have spoken in the past, you are focused on the value, focused idea or deal in certain regions or geographies. I think you have spoken to the limited opportunity sort of properties. I mean has anything changed given the macro, given the bid asked in terms of expectations and has it changed kind of your view of capital redeployment here in terms of perhaps doing other things, given that the M&A environment maybe particularly murky or volatile? Ajita G. Rajendra: No, first of all the answer is our strategy has not changed. So we have been very consistent with our strategy. There are opportunities out there, no question about it. The market is very expensive. People are paying -- companies who don\u2019t have the organic growth we see are paying very high prices for growth. And so it makes it a little more challenging type of market but we are sticking to our strategy and our stated objectives in terms of return to shareholders. Robert McCarthy : Okay, and the last question is, I mean, without going into 2016 too much because I know you are going to do that later on, I mean just looking at the performance you have had year-to-date how we think about in terms of the relative comparison next year. Is first half tougher next year or second half tougher next year just thinking about the walk? Ajita G. Rajendra: Again, I will give you some macro comments and John you want to add to it, but we don\u2019t expect there to be too much difference in the cycle and the cyclicality of the business. And we are just going through our plans. So our plans are putting them together. So they are by no means definite but again, longer term we are very comfortable with the 8% plus growth portfolio that we have talked about, organic growth portfolio that we have talked about, very comfortable with that. John, do you have anything to add. John J. Kita: No, you obviously should incorporate price increases, etc in April so that\u2026 Ajita G. Rajendra: So we have a partial year\u2026 John J. Kita: I think we add that but otherwise\u2026 Robert McCarthy : I will leave it there, thanks for your time. Ajita G. Rajendra: Thanks. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from Ryan Connors of Boenning & Scattergood. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Ryan Connors : Great, thanks for the time this morning. I had a question, you talked a lot about the NAECA III situation in terms of the pricing and the tactical impact on channel inventories but I wondered if you could comment on that from the angle of competitive offerings and market share and I guess as the relative merits of everyone's compliant offerings become better understood in the marketplace, is that a situation where you and others will pretty cleanly just map over your respective customer bases to your new offerings or are there opportunities here to either pick up or I guess lose market share based on the relative merits of the different compliant offerings, without getting too technical obviously? John J. Kita: I think everybody it appears have approached it pretty much the same way and so the offerings that have come out are relatively consistent. So, we would not, I don\u2019t think expect much movement from a market share standpoint either way. Ryan Connors : Okay, and as you -- so is that the way it is being marketed kind of in the channel, or I mean I would imagine there is -- the products are being sold on some kind of relative superiority and there is some competitive dynamics at play there but you are saying that the reality is it is more or less commoditized and then which means it would kind of fall back to more or less a pricing game to some extent then? Ajita G. Rajendra: Well, I guess I would say is I don\u2019t think it has really changed the dynamic change before or after in that thought from a product standpoint. But you still have all the things of your distribution channel. We have better distribution channels. We have all of those things that will come into play is not by any meaningful price gains. John J. Kita: Right, so I think just to reinforce that, the competitive dynamics have not changed vis-\u00e0-vis NAECA coming in. But your point in terms of if you segment the business into the commercial and residential, clearly the residential business is much more commoditized and the commercial business sounds much more in value and that is where frankly we come out on top. Ryan Connors : Okay, that's helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from Larry De Maria of William Blair. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Larry De Maria : Okay, thank you. In the first catalogue allocation you noted that strategy hasn\u2019t changed so therefore should we assume that share repo policy would continue next year and be reauthorized when you complete the remaining 900,000 shares? Ajita G. Rajendra: Yes, I mean from the point of view of saying we are not going to be adding to our cash reserves, we are going to be buying back shares, yes. Larry De Maria : Okay, great, thanks. And then on China sales are obviously strong but below the 15% a quarter. I guess what do you see that gives you the confidence that accelerating to fourth quarter and you are already seeing that. I am having all maybe the markets responded to the promotions and how are they referenced and maybe other new products in the fourth quarter that we\u2019re talking about? John J. Kita: So year-to-date we were at about 15% and we would expect the fourth quarter will be about 15% increase and that\u2019s why we\u2019re comfortable with that. And nothing out of the ordinary as I mentioned earlier, we had all of our SPUs [ph] did extremely well except the commercial side and the commercial side its only $30 million business in 2014 numbers. So it did have an effect but the business is doing very well and we are comfortable with the 15% in the fourth quarter which would give us about 15% for the year. Larry De Maria : Okay and but has the market responded to promotions that you referenced across some earning in October? John J. Kita: Yes, I think that the sell through would be in the holiday certainly. Larry De Maria : Okay and then one last question I guess, correct me if I am wrong when you are looking for a deceleration margins in the fourth quarter after obviously posting real good results this quarter, is there any reason for this besides in the headwind I don\u2019t know if there is factory shutdowns for seasonal reasons or is there any other reason for deceleration that\u2019s not normal? Ajita G. Rajendra: I wouldn\u2019t say we are forecasting much in the way of deceleration of margins in the fourth quarter. We earned $0.82 in the third quarter. The midpoint of our range in the fourth quarter is I guess about $0.84 and so I don\u2019t think we\u2019re expecting much in the way of deceleration in margins by overall. I mean there will be some on the margin because commercial and Lochinvar is a little bit lighter in the fourth quarter as in the third quarter which is traditional. They have been every year we owned them. In the commercial market we would expect it will be down a little bit but again nothing significant. Larry De Maria : Got it, alright, thanks very much. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from Bhupinder Vohra [ph] of Jeffries. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, good morning guys. John J. Kita: Good morning. Unidentified Analyst : Most of the questions have been answered. I just wanted to get a sense of we talked about and how we have been talking about your previous presentations in China in the water treatment market, the size of it, and I believe John actually mentioned something about the water treatment in India. Can you just talk about that like size of the market like what growth rates we see for that category and how it goes over the next few years? John J. Kita: CMM has estimated that the water treatment in China is going to grow 35% to 40% over the next three or four years. We are seeing this year we would expect probably above 40% growth in that category and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll have. So we are very comfortable with that mainly because the penetration rate of water treatment equipment in China is very low compared to other developed countries. So I think that\u2019s the basis why CMM is saying that it is going to continue to grow and grow dramatically over the next several years. And we\u2019re comfortable that the size of the market sorry it is a little hard to get your hands around but we would say that without the AT, etc it is probably a $2 billion market. Half of it is distributed through our channel and half of it would be on the high end so our gap is probably a $500 million to $600 million market at this point in time but growing dramatically. Unidentified Analyst : Okay and do you have the same story on the India water treatment. John J. Kita: We do not have the same study in water treatment in India. We just brought that product to market late in the first quarter of 2015. We are really doing it in two cities in India as its heavily advertised product and we wanted to make sure that we were focused on a couple of cities and that\u2019s where we are looking at right now. Unidentified Analyst : And I believe Ajita you mentioned something like a number you were comfortable investing in China Air Purifier, I believe it was $4 million next year on kind of advertising and marketing, is there a similar number for the other markets like India and if you are doing the same thing for Southeast Asia? Ajita G. Rajendra: No, just to clarify what I mentioned was that we expect the air purification number to be negative $4 million in 2015 this year. We have not said anything about next year. Again these are new businesses we are getting into and we expect that we\u2019ll have to invest behind them which is by the way again part of our strategy which we have been doing right through, that as different categories grow and then their growth stage we\u2019ve always been investing in what's coming down the road and what's going to be our growth engines in the future. So this is a continuation of that strategy that has been very successful for us in China and we hope in India going forward. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, that\u2019s all I have. Thank you. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from David Rose of Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. David Rose : Good morning and thank you for sneaking me in this morning. I was wondering if you can just clarify something on North American margins first and then go into China. Just help me remember the impact of NAECA, you had the price increase so generally you have escalators or adjustments built in when steel prices move. But because of NAECA you didn\u2019t do that necessarily, does that mean now going forward that we would see adjustments because of steel prices and they could go down, your pricing could go down theoretically, help me understand that, if you don\u2019t mind? John J. Kita: We have no price adjustments on the wholesale side of the business and we have a few on the retail side of the business. So I don\u2019t think necessarily automatically you can assume that. David Rose : Okay, I was just [indiscernible] we might see something. So we shouldn\u2019t assume that at all? Ajita G. Rajendra: Again, we are not going to comment on future price but there is nothing setup if you will. David Rose : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then on China you call out the contribution to growth of water treatment business of being 4.5 points, that business grew 40%, that contribution was less to the growth rate last year so I am assuming roughly 3 points of growth. If I strip that out of your growth rate that implies that your water heater business last year grew roughly 12%, if I am not mistaken 12% to 13%. So this step down in growth rate in the water heater business, was there a particular market that was weaker for you, did you see that step down in growth in tier 1 on tier 1 markets, maybe you can break that out for us? John J. Kita: From a China perspective where one water treatment growth is last year I think was about 5 point not 8 points for the total. This year it will probably be about 4.5 points so it is very close to the same number. So there is not much of a difference there and as Ajita alluded to there is different buckets and different moving on three buckets year-over-year but nothing specific from a water heater standpoint. We continue to do very, very well on the instantaneous gas with our new products and again the thing you have to build in there is commercial [indiscernible] and that\u2019s kind of on the periphery is affecting some of the noise. David Rose : Okay, and then the DSOs declined nicely in the quarter and I am assuming most of that was that in China, was that North America? John J. Kita: We have some inventory built for a variety of reasons but our DSOs were down and our account stable base were outside I think year-over-year. Our total days in cash cycle were down. David Rose : Okay, so then on the China front can you just provide a little bit more clarity in terms of how you are monitoring the financial strength of the distributors in China, particularly the independence? John J. Kita: You know a lot of the independents and the distributors that we have we get our cash up front. So really there isn't a whole bunch of AR type risk that we run in China. David Rose : Okay and then there is strength in terms of being able to support the channel going forward, are you getting any sort of color? John J. Kita: Well I think we have strong distribution partners because they are selling our product which is selling very well. So I mean we are comfortable with the strength of our distribution partners. And we have a lot of specialty stores. We have I think what 1800 or so specialty stores but those are concentrated. It is not that we are dealing with 1800 different distributors those are concentrated in a group of distributors if you will. So we continue to do well and our partners are doing well. Ajita G. Rajendra: But also I think to answer your question is their concern about their financial strength and their ability to fund the growth that we expect going forward. No, and we do monitor that, we work with them and if we find that there are concerns about that we have a plan to switch them up. So that and that by the way is not anything new. That\u2019s something that\u2019s been in place for sometime in the way we manage the business in China. David Rose : Okay that\u2019s helpful, thank you Ajita, thank you John. Operator : Thank you and we have a follow up question from William Bremer of Maxim Group. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. William Bremer : Thank you for taking it. One quick one, I was wondering if you could sort of give us a little granularity on Lochinvar, their commercial side specific fabrication orders versus more standard, now each say standard off the shelf products that they serve, can you give us a sense are you starting to see more specific fabricated orders there and then just a quick update on Canada. John J. Kita: Not much different in terms of the dynamics with Lochinvar. The condensing boiler segment is very strong. And like John mentioned there was some weakness in the product that non-condensing products that are sold in China through a distributor through the Lochinvar brand. But other than that the dynamics are not very different. Does that answer your question Bill? Ajita G. Rajendra: Well I think Canada -\u2013 I mean I think the balance are relatively flat. Obviously there is an effect on the translation back to the U.S. Also much of the product is purchased from the U.S. by three of the four competitors there and that\u2019s really what generated the price increases to maintain our reasonable level profitability. William Bremer : Thank you. On Lochinvar just really go into the fact that when we did visit the plants down in Tennessee we definitely saw the expansion occurring and anticipating more specific fabrication for corporate client. I was wondering if that is what's powering these margins a little bit more at this time? Ajita G. Rajendra: As you saw and when we had our Analyst Day there, the expansion is happening and is going very well. That\u2019s the combination of expanding manufacturing capacity and also expanding engineering and testing and lab capacity. And that\u2019s all looking at the long-term. And as we\u2019ve indicated we think that there is a long runway for this business to continue to grow at 10%. And so what we are doing is just planning for that and that\u2019s going well. So from a longer term perspective since the dynamics are in place and we are very comfortable with that and what's built into our guidance. William Bremer : Great, thank you Ajita. Operator : Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Patricia Ackerman for closing remarks. Patricia K. Ackerman: Thank you for joining us today. Please take note that we will be at the Goldman Sachs Conference in Boston on November 3rd and the Baird Conference in Chicago on November 9th. A short video showcasing our China products and distribution can be found on our website, aosmith.com. Have a wonderful day.

I would not like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mrs. Patricia Ackerman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Ma'am, you may begin. Patricia Ackerman : Thank you Eric. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and thank you for joining us on our 2015 fourth quarter and full year results conference call. With me, participating on the call, are Ajita Rajendra, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Kita, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin with Ajita's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning's press release. Also, in respect of others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. I will now turn the call over to Ajita, who will begin his remarks on slide 3. Ajita Rajendra : Thank you, Pat and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. 2015 was another excellent year for A.O. Smith, setting records for sales and earnings. We continued to see healthy end markets for U.S. commercial water heaters, our Lochinvar branded products, and our consumer products in China. We believe our organic growth outshines almost all other industrial companies. Here are a few highlights. Organic growth in both of our segments drove sales nearly 8% higher to a record $2.54 billion. Excluding the impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar against the Canadian and Chinese currencies, our sales grew over 9% in 2015. Despite being a sales record, this was lower than our previous estimate for the year as our year-over-year U.S. residential water heater volumes declined in the second half of the year, similar to the industry. China sales were up over 16% in local currency. Record net earnings of $3.16 per share were 30% higher than our adjusted earnings per share of $2.43 in 2014. We continue to review our capital allocation and dedicate a portion to return to shareholders. We repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares for $128 million during the year. We increased our dividend by 26% earlier this week, following the similar increase one year ago. And during 2015, we returned almost $200 million to our shareholders. John will now describe our results in more detail beginning with slide 4. John Kita : Thank you, Ajita. Sales for the full year of $2.54 billion were 7.7% higher than the previous year. Net earnings of $283 million improved 28% from 2014. As shown on slide 5, net earnings of $3.16 per share improved 30% compared with adjusted earnings per share of $2.43 in 2014. Sales in our North America segment of $1.7 billion increased 5% over 2014, driven by price increases in the U.S. and Canada for residential and commercial water heaters and higher volumes of commercial water heaters and condensing commercial boilers in the U.S.. Based on our shipments, we expect residential water heater industry volumes in the U.S. to decline by approximately 300,000 units in 2015. Rest of world segment sales of $866 million increased 13% compared to 2014. China sales increased $95 million, driven by higher demand for water heaters and approximately $35 million of incremental sales of A.O. Smith branded water treatment products. Our newly launched in-home air purifier products added approximately $9 million to China sales. On slide 7, North America operating earnings of $340 million were 34% higher than adjusted segment operating earnings in the previous year, and operating margin of 20% was significantly above the 15.6% adjusted operating margin one year ago. Pricing actions in the U.S. and Canada, higher sales of Lochinvar branded products and commercial water heaters in the U.S. and lower steel costs contributed to the significantly improved segment performance. The impact of profits from lower residential volumes in the U.S. partially offset these favorable factors. Rest of world operating earnings of $113 million improved 6% compared with 2014. Higher sales and lower steel costs were partially offset by lower sales of highly profitable commercial water heaters in China and increased selling, general, and administrative expenses. Segment operating earnings were reduced by approximately $2.5 million due to China currency translation. Higher selling and promotion cost to support expansion in tier 2 and tier 3 cities and our e-commerce platform in China as well as higher development and advertising costs associated with the 2015 launch of air purification in China were the primary drivers of higher segment SG&A expenses. As a result of those factors, 2015 segment operating margin of 13% was lower than the 13.9% operating margin in 2014. Our corporate expenses declined from the adjusted corporate expenses the prior year, primarily as the result of higher interest income. Our effective income tax rate during 2015 of 29.7% was higher than the previous year due to a change in our geographic earnings mix. Sales in the fourth quarter of $639 million were 2% higher than the previous year and below our expectations. Lower U.S. residential water heater volumes and weaker U.S. boiler sales contributed to less organic growth than we expected. Excluding the unfavorable translation impact from the weaker Canadian and China currencies of approximately $13 million, sales grew 4%. Net earnings of $80 million was 39% higher than fourth quarter adjusted earnings of 2014. As shown on slide 9, net earnings of $0.90 per share improved 41% compared to adjusted earnings per share of $0.64 in 2014. Sales in our North America segment of $414 million declined 4% over 2014. Price increases in the U.S. and Canada for residential and commercial water heaters and higher volumes of commercial water heaters were more than offset by lower volumes of U.S. residential water heaters and approximately $5 million unfavorable currency impact in Canada. Sales of Lochinvar branded products were flat in the quarter. Industry volumes of residential and commercial boilers declined in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with the previous year. We believe warmer weather at the beginning of the heating season may have negatively impacted residential boiler volumes and longer lead times for commercial projects may have negatively impacted the commercial boiler industry. Rest of world segment sales of $232 million increased 14% compared with 2014. China sales increased 19% in local currency, driven by higher demand for water heaters and water treatment products. Seasonally strong air purifier sales added over $5 million to China sales. Higher China sales were partially offset by unfavorable currency translation of approximately $8 million. On slide 11, North America operating earnings of $92 million were 30% higher than adjusted segment operating earnings in the previous year and operating margin of 22.3% was significantly above the 16.4% adjusted operating margin one year ago. Pricing actions in the U.S. and Canada, higher sales of commercial water heaters, and lower steel contributed to the significantly improved segment performance. The impact to profits from lower residential volumes in the U.S. partially offset these favorable factors. Rest of world operating earnings of $29 million improved 27% compared with 2014. Higher sales and lower steel and advertising costs, all in China and smaller losses in India were partially offset by increased selling expenses in China. Segment operating earnings were reduced by over $1 million due to current China currency translation. Fourth quarter 2015 operating margin of 12.3% improved from the 11% operating margin in 2014. Our corporate expenses declined from the adjusted corporate expenses the prior year, primarily as a result of higher interest income. Fourth quarter results included approximately $3 million or $0.03 per share of income tax benefits primarily associated with the recently approved extension of the research and development tax credit in the U.S. and additional R&D tax benefits in China. Cash provided by operations during 2015 was $344 million, compared with $264 million provided in 2014, driven primarily by higher earnings and smaller outlays for working capital in the 2015 period. We exceeded our 2015 cash flow estimate by approximately $50 million, as a result of lower capital spending as well as improvements in working capital. Our liquidity position and balance sheet remain strong. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 15% at the end of 2015. We have cash balances totaling approximately $650 million located offshore and our net cash position was approximately $400 million at the end of December. During 2015, we repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares of common stock for a total of $128 million under a 10b5-1 automatic trading plan. At it's December meeting, our Board increased its authorized share available for repurchase by 2 million shares. Considering this increase, we had approximately 2.6 million shares remaining on our existing repurchase authority at the end of December. This morning, we announced our 2016 EPS guidance to be between $3.40 and $3.55 per share. The midpoint of our EPS guidance represents a 10% increase in EPS compared with our 2015 results. Please turn to slide 14 for several 2016 assumptions. We expect our cash flow from operations in 2016 to be approximately $320 million which is less than 2015, primarily related to expected higher outlays for working capital this year compared with 2015. We expect capital expenditures to be between $120 million and $130 million in 2016 and higher than the $73 million spent in 2015. Due to the strong growth of our water treatment business in China, we will reach the capacity of our existing lease facility in the next few years. Our 2016 capital spending plans include approximately $40 million related to construction of a new water treatment manufacturing and air purification assembly facility in China. Total cost for the facility are expected to be approximately $65 million and it will be completed in early 2018. In addition, we expect to complete capacity expansion of two North America plants in 2016 at a cost of approximately $7 million. Our 2016 capital spending plan also includes approximately $8 million to support the ERP implementation. Our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $70 million in 2016. We successfully completed our first two ERP go-live milestones in August 2014 and May 2015. We expect to convert the majority of our North American plan sites by the end of 2016. ERP implementation expenses were approximately $16.5 million in 2015 and are projected to be approximately $25 million in 2016. Higher than the previous year due to larger number of scheduled go-live events in 2016. Approximately $4 million of incremental ERP cost is expected to incur in the first quarter, with the remainder primarily in the fourth quarter of 2016. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $48 million in 2016, higher than the $43 million in 2015, primarily due to expected lower interest rates than last year on cash deposits in China. Pension income is expected to be approximately $7 million in 2016 compared with zero in 2015. Costs associated with our replacement retirement plan are about $6 million in both years. Our effective tax rate is expected to be between 30.5% and 31%, higher than the 29.7% rate experienced in 2015 due to a change in our geographic earnings mix. We expect to continue to repurchase shares at a value equal to our free cash flow after dividends for approximately $150 million in 2016 which is consistent with our stated policy to maintain our net cash balance at approximately $350 million. As such, we expect our average diluted outstanding shares for the year will be between 87.5 million and 88 million shares. I will now turn the call back to Ajita, who will summarize the business assumptions in our 2016 outlook and our growth strategy, beginning on slide 15. Ajita? Ajita Rajendra : Thank you, John. We expect our businesses will collectively grow between 9% and 10% in local currency terms and between 7% and 8% in U.S. dollars in 2016. The assumptions for currency underlying our organic growth forecast are at current rates. We expect steel prices will remain at current levels, as global demand remains soft and capacity utilization remains slow. Some comments specific to our North American segment. We expect four months of pricing benefit in 2016 as the 2015 price increase in the U.S. will anniversary in late April. We expect U.S. residential water heater volumes will grow by 100,000 to 150,000 units in 2016, primarily as a result of new construction. We expect U.S. commercial water heater volumes will be modestly higher after strong growth in 2015. Due to the significant pre-buy which occurred in the first quarter of 2015, the first quarter of 2016 will be a difficult comparison for U.S. residential water heater volumes. After double-digit volume declines in the U.S. commercial condensing boiler industry in October and November, industry volumes grew 10% in December. We see this positive trend continuing in our business in January. The continuing transition to condensing boilers and new product introductions give us comfort to project Lochinvar branded sales growth of 10% in the first quarter of 2016, as well as for the full-year. Recall that our Lochinvar branded sales are seasonally skewed to the second half of the year which coincides with the heating season. The water heaters we sell in Canada are manufactured in the U.S.. The Canadian dollar weakness is expected to result in a significant product cost increase to our Canadian operations in 2016 which is only partially offset by announced price increases. The magnitude of this headwind is in excess of $5 million. These factors, in addition to the assumptions John discussed earlier, lead us to expect our North America segment operating margin will be between 20% and 21% in 2016. Now, some comments specific to the rest of world segment. We're committed to our business in India. We remain optimistic about the long term opportunity in the country with the second-largest population and the second fastest growing economy in the world and its developing middle class who desire quality-of-life products. India is an investment for the future and the $8 million to $9 million loss which we expect in 2016 is similar to 2015 and includes higher promotion and advertising costs related to brand building, as well as the expansion of our water treatment product distribution to six cities in 2016 from two cities in 2015. We expect to combined sales of water heaters and water treatment products in India to be greater than $20 million in 2016, an increase from 2015 sales of nearly $16 million. We're a consumer products Company in China which distinguishes us from most industrial companies operating in China. The Chinese consumer demonstrated resilience in 2015. We have three growth drivers underpinning our China business which give us confidence to project an annual growth rate of approximately 15% in local currency for 2016. The first driver is overall market growth which we believe has impacted by household formation and a growing replacement market. A proxy we use to project their potential for water heater market growth is the growth in the consumption portion of GDP. We have seen independent forecasts, including one from the IMF which project China consumption growth between 7% and 8% in 2016. With continued urbanization, growth in the middle class and a growing replacement and upgrade market, we expect supportive market growth to continue for quite some time. The second growth driver is market share gains and increases in average price. We have a strong market position by value in the electric wall-hung category. Our position in gas tankless, while a leader, is less than 20% by value and we see opportunity to gain more share with our well-respected and patented super quiet models and as our newly launched high-rise models gain acceptance. Our commitment to engineering resources will continue to result in new products with features and benefits in which consumers see value and for which they are willing to pay an incrementally higher price. This results in a favorable mix impact. The third growth driver is fast-growing ancillary product categories, the most significant example of which is water treatment. A.O. Smith branded water treatment products achieved sales of $110 million in 2015, up from $75 million in 2014, an added 5 percentage points of growth in each of the last three years. After successfully launching the A.O. Smith branded in-home air purifiers last year, we expect sales to more than double to approximately $20 million. The combination of A.O. Smith branded water treatment and air purifiers incremental sales is expected to add almost 5 percentage points of growth this year. The last two growth drivers are primarily in our control and as we continue to invest behind them. The first is a function of the growing replacement market and household formation. Combining these three growth drivers give us confidence that we will grow approximately 15% in local currency in 2016. We expect rest of world segment operating margin in 2016 will be similar to last year's margin of 13%. One final comment on China, the recent declines in the China stock market and value of the Yuan are unprecedented and we acknowledge the concerns of the investment community surrounding our China business. While it is not our practice to discuss monthly results, recent trends might add some perspective, given that the latest macro events in China materialized in mid-December. In local currency, the average of our daily shipments in January increased over 15% year-over-year. Please also remember that the first quarter is typically our lightest China sales quarter, due to the New Year travel holiday in February. The Spring Festival in February. Please move on to slide 16. Especially in these volatile and uncertain economic times, we believe our long term annual 8% organic growth potential and our stable defensive replacement markets which we believe represent over 85% of North American water heater and boiler volumes, positively differentiates A.O. Smith among other industrial companies. Coupled with growth and stability, we have a strong balance sheet poised to take advantage of strategic acquisitions that add shareholder value as well as allow us to return cash to shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks and now we will take your questions. As Pat mentioned earlier, please limit yourself to one question and one follow up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. Please also note that John and I are in different locations and we will do our best to coordinate our answers to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Ryan Connors from Boenning & Scattergood. Your line is now open. Ryan Connors : I wanted to ask two different questions about China. One has to do with your cash position there, Ajita, and there has been some talk lately about, in light of all the issues, China reinstituting some of the capital controls, in particular clamping down on corporate profits leaving the country. How does that impact your view of your cash position there? Are there enough investment opportunities in China, given the environment, or should we look at that as kind of stranded cash? Ajita Rajendra : Why don't I give a general comment and then let John talk specifically about the cash. I was in China last week, and as you know, I go there very often. It's interesting that all of the talk that we hear about China in terms of the stock market and all of the things happening -- the people on the street, that is not even a topic of conversation. They are looking at different drivers and different things. I met with customers, I met with obviously a lot of people in our workforce. I had dinner with the ex-dean of the business school at Nanjing University. The focus and discussion are on very different topics. So things like this, they are not really -- it's not a topic of conversation within China. Specifically on stranded cash, obviously that topic wouldn't come up, but we don't have too many concerns about that. John, maybe you want to address it directly. John Kita : Ryan, it's clearly one of the things they are talking about is capital controls. We have in the past -- we took out about $100 million out of China in 2014. We certainly have uses of cash in China. As we talked about, we\u2019re going to be adding the water treatment and air purification plant. We're looking at opportunities, always, to expand our product lines, as we did with air purification and water treatment both four or five years ago. So we will obviously continue to monitor the situation. Ryan Connors : And then my follow-up was to do with China, also. I realize it's sensitive to comment on competitor moves, but it looked like General Electric's appliance business may end up in the hands of one of your notable competitors in China. Obviously, they've got a respected American brand like you do, so I wondered if you could just comment for us on how you view that potential development in the competitive landscape there, and whether that has a potential to disrupt anything competitively? Thank you. Ajita Rajendra : Let me take that, John. I don't think so, because first of all, GE has been in the business for a while and obviously the GE brand name is very, very well-respected here. They have -- they essentially make heat pump water heaters. It's a very limited line and haven't had a huge impact on the marketplace. Now Haier is a competitor; they are a very good company, also. They are a strong competitor in China. We have been gaining share from them in China. They have the capability of much broader product development. But again, it's early to tell. But it's not something at this point we're concerned about. Haier has -- when you look at the hierarchy of products at Haier, water heaters comes very low, and there is limited capacity that is available right now with the GE product line. We're not concerned about it, but it's something we're watching. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charlie Brady from SunTrust. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : This is actually Patrick standing in for Charlie. Just looking at U.S. residentials -- obviously you added some color there, so thanks a lot for that. Once you knew what the outlook was for 2016, was any of the weakness that you saw -- obviously, you said back-half was weak. Was that mostly macro-related or was there any due to the pull-forward of the pricing increase in April? And if so, is there a quantification of that or just any color on that would be great. John Kita : Our best estimate, if you go back to the end of 2014, the fourth quarter compared to 2013, that was up about 180,000 units, fourth-quarter 2014 versus 2013. Our guess -- and it is a guess -- is that a healthy portion of that was pre-buy, because it was already out that NAECA was coming and there was going to be some discontinued lines. There was going to be some effect on some of the multi-family units, et cetera. So when we look back at it, we estimate it could have been as high as 150,000 units of pre-buy last year. When you incorporate that with the fact that completions were only up about 80,000 this year, you come up with the delta of about 220,000, explanation [ph] of the 300,000 units. We certainly have seen some of our customers reduce their safety stock because everybody now is delivering on time. So we think the combination of those two is the reason that it's down. We will obviously continue to monitor 2016 as it goes forward. Unidentified Analyst : And just one question, I guess my follow-up is on the steel costs. How much of the margin increase in both your reported segments were attributable to these improvements -- declining steel costs for you guys? John Kita : We haven't quantified that. As we said earlier, it's really -- the margin improvements really came from three different areas. Commercial was very strong. We put price increases in earlier in the year on NAECA product, on non-NAECA product, and on commercial. We also put price increases in, in Canada. The third component, if you will, is lower steel costs. It's a combination of all three of those that are contributing to the improved margins. Unidentified Analyst : Would you say that they are on the list then? Or -- in terms of the improvement or is that fairly high up there? I want to get a good gauge of what that number could be? John Kita : Pricing and steel were obviously the biggest ones. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Maczka from BB&T Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Kevin Maczka : Two questions for me. If I can go back and revisit this pre-buy in North American resi volumes. John, I thought I heard you say that 2015 finished down about 300,000 units. You see up about 100,000 to 150,000 units in 2016. So over that two-year period, we're net down. I guess my first question does that, again, all relate back to that pre-buy and that hard comp from Q4 2014? Or is there something else going on, maybe share-wise? Because it seems like, with the construction up cycle and so much of this replacement, that over a two-year period we would still be positive? John Kita : Well, it's not share. I would say our share was very consistent over the time period, so it was not share. Certainly, we're estimating some numbers. It's very possible this year, because of the downturn in 2015, could be closer to 200,000 up. We're just monitoring it. What we had, Kevin, is a significant increase in the industry from 2012, where it was 8.1 million units, up to 9.2 million units in 2014. Part of that was helped by new construction, but certainly part of it was helped by replacement. So it's really hard for us, quite frankly, to tell you within 100,000 or 200,000 units or within 2% of a 9.2 million units, what the exact number is. Ajita Rajendra : Kevin, like you are saying, I hope we're being a little conservative. Kevin Maczka : Right. Just to follow up on that, as we look out into Q1 in the first half -- I know you are not usually commenting on monthly progression here, but we saw industry numbers down double digits in Q4. Is that your expectation again going into Q1? Or should that start to normalize like your China business had? John Kita : I think, clearly -- and we said it on the call last year -- 2015 first quarter, because of the significant price increase, the industry was up 300,000 units or so. And we certainly don't expect that to happen. I think -- as I looked at the history, the last couple of years, I would think we're going to approach more like the 2014 distribution by quarter. That would seem to be more sense for me -- maybe a little lighter in the fourth quarter because of the pre-buy. But otherwise, I think that's the more normalized distribution than what we had last year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy from Stifel. Your line is now open. Robert McCarthy : So maybe you can just comment first on -- boiling down for 2016 -- because we have a lot of issues going around, obviously the carryover of pricing which you elucidated and then obviously some incremental pricing and then the volumes. But is there a way to break down, basically on a consolidated basis, what you expect on a percentage basis from volume and from price in 2016 or a range? John Kita : Again, I think the best estimate for volume would be what I just said from the standpoint of residentials, our biggest business. I think that, that distribution in 2014 is probably reasonably representative. From a price standpoint, as we said in the call, we're about -- certainly through the end of April, we would certainly think we're going to see significant price, year over year. And then it starts leveling off after that, because that's when the price increases went in. If you look at our ownership since we've had Lochinvar, 2012, the distribution of our earnings has been 48%, 52%, first half, second half; and I guess as a high level, that is not in an reasonable estimate. Robert McCarthy : Okay. And then, maybe you can just comment and just add to some of your comments around Lochinvar. Obviously, you saw a weakness in the fourth-quarter, but you saw some nice trajectory and exit rate. But just give some narrative around what undergirds your confidence there, given the change in regulatory standards? Or the progression that's going on there on the products that you think supports a 10% organic growth rate, there? John Kita : A couple things. October and November were double -- the industry was down double digits; we were down about half that. And then we did see a decent recovery in the industry in December. As for us, if you look at the entire Lochinvar for the year, they were up about 7%. But when you take out China -- and the sales to China were about $4 million and we've talked about not only our China business struggling, commercial in China, but also Lochinvar. You take out the Canada shortfall and quite frankly, from a competitive standpoint, because we're competing against some competitors in Canada and the currency has moved so much, it's more difficult. You take those two out and they were up about 10%, even with the fourth quarter. So when we looked at December and we look at where we're projecting for the first quarter -- up about 10% -- we're comfortable with the full-year growth of 10%, year over year. Ajita Rajendra : And also comfortable with what we've always been saying in the longer-term conversion from non-condensing to condensing. You're going to have these short-term blips, but that longer-term trend and trajectory is solid. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Jeff Hammond : Just a couple things back on North America. So you mentioned safety stocks coming down. Just maybe assess what your customers are telling you in general about inventory levels and specific to pre-buy overhang? And then, just on mix around the NAECA standard -- have you seen people trading down as a result of the higher pricing, particularly at the 55 gallon-plus level? John Kita : Safety stock, we've just finished sales meetings and the input we got from the salespeople is, the inventory levels of our customers are reasonable, but as you've seen in the whole industrial landscape in the fourth quarter, the demand has been relatively weak. We have seen an improvement in our normal ordering patterns in December and January, but I'd say we're not quite normal yet. But I think we're on the right trajectory. I was just going to answer the second one. The trading down -- Jeff, I don't know. If you're talking about the discontinued electrics, in effect what we've probably seen happen there is, the commercial business has been strong in the 55-gallon to 90-gallon range. So one of two things probably happened either residential customers -- that were buying those residential units in that size now are buying commercial; or commercial customers that were buying the residential in that size are now buying commercial. That's one of the explanations on why commercial has been better. And could they be trading down? Certainly, it's a possibility to a smaller size, if you will. Jeff Hammond : Okay. And just quickly on the Lochinvar comment about longer lead times. Is that a function of macro uncertainty? Some slowing in commercial construction? Or is it something different? John Kita : As we've talked to people, you would say it probably is due to macro uncertainty, but we don't know. The engineers are -- our customers are very busy; it's just the release of the projects weren't happening as quickly as they normally do. I don't know if that's financing; I don't know -- other macro issues. But again, we view it as probably only a temporary blip, because the good news is the engineers appear very busy. Ajita Rajendra : Also, just to add some color to that -- this is more anecdotal than quantitative -- but I was at ASHRAE and I know many of you were at the ASHRAE show. Talking to customers, they feel pretty good about 2016 and where business is going to be. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran from Robert Baird. Your line is now open. Mike Halloran : Just thinking about the FX commentary and splits by division -- I think it was $5 million or so headwind, I think you said for the Canadian dollar impact to North America. So is it fair to think about 1 point of headwind in North America and then more like 4-ish for the rest of the world? John Kita : In the fourth quarter, it was $5 million for Canada and about $8 million for China. What we're estimating, based on current rates now, what 2016 headwinds could be, is closer to $40 million for China over 2015. And maybe another $15 million or so for Canada for the year, top line. Mike Halloran : Perfect. That's exactly what I was looking for. And then, on the China side, maybe you could just talk about the new product curve, as you see it through 2016, here? Anything interesting coming on the water purification -- I'm sorry, water filtration or the air purification side? Ajita Rajendra : Yes. I feel very good about the new products. Like I said at the early part of the call, I was in China last week. We have an interesting slate of new products coming out. I don't want to be specific in terms of either new stuff that they haven't introduced yet. But the pace of new product introduction, the pace of innovation in bringing truly new things to the market as opposed to cosmetic changes -- because we do both -- There is some interesting new stuff that's coming out In water treatment. In air purification, we had essentially two SKUs. We had one SKU that we came out with in April; and another one, a smaller size which we introduced around October. Those two SKUs had $9 million of sales last year which again shows the power of the brand in the right categories with the right products, even though they were only two SKUs. We will be expanding that line also in 2016. I feel very good about the new products that are in the pipeline. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of William Bremer from Maxim Group. Your line is now open. William Bremer : First question I just want to get a clarity on -- did you mention earlier that air purification contributed $5 million in revenue this quarter? John Kita : Yes, it was around $5 million in the fourth quarter, $9 million for the year. William Bremer : Okay. Second question, can you give us a little more granularity in terms of the replacement market in China and how large that is for you at this time? John Kita : All we can look at is based on our surveying data, et cetera. We have seen, in our estimation, that increase over the last two to three years -- which is logical, right? We have been selling in some sort of magnitude for the last 10, 12 years. Our units last on average about 8 or 9 years and we think it is probably longer than our competitors. So in tier 1 cities specifically, we have seen an increase in replacement. Our estimate would be, it would be approaching 50% or so, based on our data. But we don't quite have the data we do in the U.S., where you can -- everybody is reporting and you can take new construction and subtract it to get replacement. It's logical it's increasing. We would expect it is. William Bremer : Very fine top line performance in China. No doubt. Just want to get a sense of your feeling of the inventory that's in the channel there, right now? John Kita : We're comfortable as we look compared to the year. I think the distribution by quarter was pretty reasonable, so I think we're comfortable where we're from an inventory standpoint. I don't know, Ajita, if you heard anything different when you were there last week? Ajita Rajendra : No. I think says it. It's about where we should be. In the past we have expressed some concerns that it was a little high, as we did, I think, about one year ago. Right now, I would say we're where we should be. And like I mentioned, we don't normally talk about monthly results, but what we saw in January was the type of increase that we like to see for the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bhupender Bohra from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Bhupender Bohra : My question is around rest of the world margins, here, like we have spoken -- Ajita, we've spoken about. We have seen -- we have been hovering around 13% margins. Where do we see the rest of world? The China margins go forward, here? I think if you'll go back in 2014, we have hit 15% number here. If you can just give some color on that? And what would be the inflection point where we see from 13% to go to that next level of 14%, 15%, mid-teens margins, here? Ajita Rajendra : If you look at -- a lot of it is driven by China. A lot of it is driven by what type of investments we also are making. At this point in time -- and when I say point in time I am taking a fairly -- you know, 12 to 18 month time frame -- we're investing in India, in terms of brand building. Again, in India we're following the same type of similar playbook as we did in China which is heavy investment in the brand and then following it up with categories in which we're strong -- products and categories in which we have strength. So we're investing behind the brand in India. We talked about what we expect in India. In China, we're investing in a new category that we're getting into which is air purification. We're continuing to invest heavily behind water purification even though we have a $100 million-plus business. Again -- and for the last few months in China, we have been the leaders in that category, in terms of market share. But, we continue to invest heavily behind it to really solidify our position as being the leaders in that category, because for 20 years we were a water heater guy and now we're a water guy and now we're getting into air purification. So we're expanding that brand and that takes heavy investment. Also, we're investing in terms of getting into those second and third tier cities. The smaller cities. So there is a heavy amount of investment going on right now. There has always been a question of, can we see more leverage in China for the increased volume? Yes, at this point in time we're investing a lot of that back into new products and new distribution and new categories. John, you want to add any color to that? John Kita : You are right. From the standpoint of China, margins have come down a little bit. They were about mid-teens this year, about 15%, down a little bit from 2014. I think there are a couple things driving that, that Ajita talked about. I think the core businesses -- electric, gas, water treatment -- doing very well. But we're investing in air purification and will have a larger loss next year than this year as we grow the distribution platform. Commercial -- we've talked about, had a difficult year this year. That had a negative effect on China's margins and rest of world. And quite frankly, there's other businesses we're incubating that had larger losses, like combi boilers, where we think that's an important market in the future and we're committing to engineering. We're very comfortable, but the anticipation is down the road. Certainly it's to grow these margins and also to improve our profitability in India. So it's not going to happen overnight, but that is certainly an objective down the road. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Rose from Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open. David Rose : I just wanted to have a question on China and there is an embedded question within that and then I have a follow-up. On China, just on the margin side -- to be clear, what was the change in the advertising spend year on year? John Kita : I think as we talked last year, the margins were negatively impacted because we were running a fair amount of CCTV advertising for water treatment. We did not have that this year. That was a pretty significant contributor to the improvement in the margins year over year in the fourth quarter. That was the major delta, is just we did not have that advertising on national television. And we kind of talked about in the past, these advertising spends can vary quarter to quarter and I think we outlined that last year in the fourth quarter. We did see better improvement in China margins this year than last. David Rose : Okay; and then the question on margins for China for 2017 is -- if you open up the facilities, do you have under-absorption in factory in your fixed costs, depressing margins? Should we think about it that way in 2017? John Kita : I don't think we would expect significant -- obviously we'll avoid some of the lease costs we have, et cetera and we're going to be able to be at a decent occupancy. To be honest, I have not -- it's really 2018 that -- it's going to open early 2018. I have not done a lot of analysis of that. But I wouldn't expect it is going to have a huge effect. Ajita Rajendra : Also, I think it's fair to say that we have ongoing -- because we always have been expanding. We expanded our factory, opened the new factory, October -- year ago October. We've expanded that facility right now; we haven't moved into it yet. We always have more capacity than we need in some areas and we're filling it up very quickly and building new factories and moving in. So I don't think -- as John said, I don't think you're going to see an unusual under-absorption level in the next couple of years. David Rose : And then the follow-up question was a housekeeping one, the other income was up meaningfully from Q3. Can you just clarify what that was? John Kita : I would have to look, but I know year over year it was interest income. When we saw that China could potentially lower rates, we laddered some volatile while away, but that will be expiring towards the end of this year -- towards the end of 2015. And that's why we said corporate expense goes up next year; interest income will be down, I think, $4 million or something from year over year. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy from Stifel. Your line is now open. Robert McCarthy : Yes, one follow up. Just wanted to talk about the margin outlook for North America. What goes into that aside from just the anniversarying of the price increase and how we see it playing out? Should we think about some core operating leverage on the basis of that? Obviously, if you look at the implied run rate, it's around the 21% range through 2Q through 4Q. Any kind of dynamics about how you're going to achieve that? And tentatively your confidence level in achieving that, would be helpful? John Kita : I think what we've done the last two quarters is above that, but that's been driven by mix as much as anything -- commercial and Lochinvar which is our highest margin product lines, certainly contribute to that; and resi being weaker. But I think there is puts and takes. Obviously, steel will probably be a benefit this year. On the other hand, we talked about the Canadian currency issues. That is going to be a negative. And then the other thing that ends up in the play in North American margins is, SAP is going to be up about $8.5 million to $9 million. That and the currency are probably the biggest factors on why there is a little bit of headwind from that standpoint. Robert McCarthy : Ajita, do you have any other thoughts on that or not? Ajita Rajendra : No, I think that hits it. Because one of the things we didn't talk about a lot is the fact that the SAP, the ERP is going to be that much higher in 2016 over 2015. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charlie Brady from SunTrust. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : This is actually Patrick again. Thanks for taking my follow-up. I wanted to touch a little bit on the online sales from China that you guys mentioned a little bit briefly. What was the level in 2015 versus 2014? And if I'm not mistaken, these higher-margin sales, right? And do you have any expectations for that number, in terms of 2016? John Kita : It was about $140 million. It was higher than what we thought it would be when we put out our projections. That compares to what -- $55 million or something last year. It's hard to say a higher margin. We would say at least as good a margin, but we're putting a fair amount back into advertising, et cetera, in development of that channel. So that is certainly the case. We would expect that's going to grow. I think right now their estimate is about 20% to 25% growth over where it was. But that is certainly becoming an important channel for us. Unidentified Analyst : And one very quick question about India. The $8 million to $9 million loss expected for 2016 on -- I think you said $20 million of it expected? John Kita : Yes, we said over $20 million and we had about $16 million. What's happening in India is, we're making improvements on the water heater side. We still have a ways to go. But as we talked in the release, here, we're expanding our water treatment. We think that's a potentially large market for us and to enter a market like that is going to take a decent amount of investment from an advertising, distribution, expansion, et cetera, standpoint. So water heaters is improving and we're spending more on water treatment, ending up about the same point. Unidentified Analyst : Actually, my question was at what sales level will we be able to have a breakeven number? John Kita : On the water heater side, I think we've talked about in the past, it's about a $15 million business. Our expectation is to be a $30 million business. Somewhere around there would be a breakeven. I have the number for water treatment, but I can't recall it. It's probably a similar type of number. Maybe a little bit less. Operator : Ms. Ackerman, I'm showing no further questions at this time. Please proceed with any further remarks you may have. Patricia Ackerman : Thank you all for joining us today. Please take note that we will be at the Wedbush Sustainability Conference on March 9 and the BB&T Industrials Conference on March 23. Have a wonderful day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

But later, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session, instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your first speaker for today, Pat Ackerman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. You have the floor. Patricia K. Ackerman - Treasurer & Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on our 2016 first quarter results conference call. With me participating in the call this morning are Ajita Rajendra, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Kita, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin with Ajita's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning's press release. Also in respect of others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. I will now turn the call over to Ajita, who will begin his remarks on slide three. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Pat, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. The first quarter of 2016 was another excellent quarter for A. O. Smith, setting first quarter records for sales and earnings. We continue to see healthy end markets for our consumer products in China and boilers in the U.S. We believe that our organic growth prospects differentiate us from most other industrial companies. Here are a few highlights. Sales grew 3% to a record of $637 million. Excluding the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar against Canadian and Chinese currencies, our sales grew 5% in the first quarter. China sales were up 17% in local currency. Record first quarter net earnings of $0.83 per share were 28% higher than our earnings per share during the same period last year. We continue to review our capital allocation and dedicate a portion to return to shareholders. We repurchased approximately 430,000 shares for $30 million during the first quarter. We increased our dividend by 26% three months ago. John will now describe our results in more detail beginning with slide four. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Ajita. Sales for the full year of $637 million were 3% higher than the previous year. Net earnings of $73.5 million improved 26% from 2015. Earnings per share of $0.83 improved 28% over last year. Sales in our North America segment of $424 million declined 1% compared with the first quarter of 2015. Price increases implemented in April 2015 in the U.S. and Canada for residential and commercial water heaters, as well as higher boiler sales were more than offset by lower volumes of residential and commercial water heaters in the U.S. January and February 2016 industry volumes declined 16%, primarily due to a pre-buy in the 2015 first quarter. We expect the trend continued in March. Rest of World segment sales of $217 million increased 11% compared to 2015. China sales increased 17% in local currency, driven by higher demand for water heaters and A. O. Smith branded water treatment products, as well as seasonal demand for our in-home air purifier products. On slide six, North America operating earnings of $92 million were 29% higher than segment operating earnings in the previous year, and operating margin of 21.7% was significantly above the 16.6% operating margin one year ago. Higher prices in the U.S. and Canada and lower material costs contributed to the significantly improved segment performance. The impact to profits from lower residential and commercial water heater volumes in the U.S. and $3 million of incremental costs associated with our ERP implementation partially offset these favorable factors. Rest of World operating earnings of $27 million improved 3% compared with 2015. Higher China sales were partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses in China and a larger loss in India. Segment operating earnings were reduced by approximately $1.5 million due to China currency translation. Higher selling costs to support expansion in Tier 2 and 3 cities and our e-commerce platform in China, as well as higher developmental costs associated with new products, including expansion of our air purification product portfolio in China, were the primary drivers of higher segment SG&A expenses. As a result of these factors, first quarter segment operating margin of 12.4% was 100 basis points lower than a year ago. Our corporate expenses increased in the first quarter compared with the year-ago period, primarily as a result of higher expenses at our Corporate Technology Center. Our effective income tax rate in the first quarter of 2016 was 29%. The rate was similar to the prior-year quarter and lower than our previously disclosed effective tax rate guidance for the full year 2016 of 30.5% to 31%, due to the early adoption of a new accounting standard for share-based compensation. The lower effective tax rate compared with our previous guidance benefited our first quarter 2016 results by $0.02 per share. Cash provided by operations during the first quarter was $27 million compared with flat operating cash flows during the same period last year, driven primarily by higher earnings in the 2016 period. Our liquidity position and balance sheet remain strong. Our debt to capital ratio was 16% at the end of the first quarter. We have cash balances totaling over $640 million located offshore, and our net cash position was approximately $354 million at the end of March. During the first quarter, we repurchased, under a 10b5-1 automatic trading plan, approximately 430,000 shares of common stock for a total of $30 million. We had approximately 2.15 million shares remaining on our existing repurchase authority at the end of the first quarter. This morning, we announced an increase in the midpoint of our 2016 EPS guidance and a range between $3.47 and $3.55 per share. The midpoint of our EPS guidance represents an 11% increase in EPS compared with our 2015 results. Please turn to slide nine for several 2016 assumptions. We expect our cash flow from operations in 2016 to be approximately $330 million, which is less than 2015, primarily related to expected higher outlays for working capital this year compared with 2015. Due to the strong growth of our water treatment business in China, we will reach the capacity of our existing lease facility in the next few years. Our 2016 capital spending plans include approximately $20 million related to construction of a new water treatment manufacturing and air purification assembly facility in China. Total cost for the facility, which is expected to be completed in 2018, will be approximately $65 million. In addition, we will complete capacity expansion at two North America plants in 2016 at a cost of approximately $7 million. Our 2016 capital spending plan also includes approximately $9 million to support the ERP implementation. We've revised our capital spending plans for 2016 and now expect capital expenditures to be between $110 million and $120 million in 2016, a reduction of approximately $10 million due primarily to changes to the construction timeline of our new plant in China. Our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $70 million in 2016. We successfully completed three ERP go-live milestones since 2014. We expect to convert the vast majority of our North America plant sites by the end of 2016. Expenses related to our ERP implementation were about $16 million in 2015 and are projected to be approximately $24 million in 2016, higher than the previous year due to the large number of scheduled go-live events in 2016. The majority of the remaining 2016 incremental ERP cost is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2016. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $48 million in 2016, higher than the $43 million in 2015, primarily due to higher expenses at our Corporate Technology Center and expected lower interest rate than last year on cash deposits in China. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 30.5%, higher than the 29.7% rate experienced in 2015 due to a change in our geographic earnings mix. We expect to continue to repurchase shares at a value equal to our free cash flow after dividends, or approximately $175 million in 2016. The repurchase amount is higher than our original estimate of $150 million for the year, as we incorporated the lower capital spending projection into our repurchase plan. This is consistent with our stated policy to maintain our net cash balance at approximately $350 million. As a result, we expect our average diluted outstanding shares for the year will be 88 million. This is the high end of our previous guidance as adoption of the share-based compensation standard results in more diluted shares outstanding. I will now turn the call back to Ajita, who will summarize the business assumptions in our 2016 outlook and our growth strategy beginning on slide 10. Ajita? Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, John. We expect our business to collectively grow between 9% and 9.5% in local currency and between 7% and 7.5% in U.S. dollars in 2016. The assumptions for currency underlying our organic growth forecast are at current rates, with the exception of a modest decline assumed in the China currency rate. We expect steel prices to remain firm, as they are up over $150 per ton since the beginning of the year. This will have a negative impact on margins starting in the second half of the year. Specific to our North America segment, we expect four months of pricing benefit in 2016 as the 2015 price increases in the U.S. will anniversary in late April. We expect U.S. residential water heater volumes will grow by 100,000 to 150,000 units in 2016, primarily as a result of new construction. We are seeing a trend emerge in the commercial water heater industry. The majority of the growth in commercial industry units so far in 2016 has been in the 55-gallon to 90-gallon electric category. You may recall similarly sized electric residential units were discontinued by NAECA III. Driven by continued growth in the small electric category, we expect U.S. commercial water heater volumes will grow 10,000 units in 2016 after strong growth in 2015. Residential and commercial boiler sales growth in the first quarter exceeded 15% as the continuing transition to condensing boilers and Lochinvar's new product introductions drove growth. Recall that about 55% of our Lochinvar-branded products are boilers and related products, including parts. The remainder, which is composed of residential and commercial water heaters, which declined in the first quarter primarily due to a heavy pre-buy a year ago. Our Lochinvar-branded sales are seasonally skewed to the second half of the year, which coincides with the heating season. The water heaters we sell in Canada are manufactured in the U.S. The Canadian dollar weakness has resulted in a significant product cost increase to our Canadian operations in 2016, which has been partially offset by announced price increases. The magnitude of this headwind is over $5 million. These factors, in addition to the assumptions John discussed earlier, lead to our expectation that our North America segment operating margin will be between 20.5% and 21% in 2016. Specific to our Rest of World segment, we are a consumer products company in China, which distinguishes us from most industrial companies operating in China. In local currency, our sales in China have grown by 18% in 2014, 16% in 2015, and 17% in the first quarter of this year, despite a softer China economy. We have various growth drivers underpinning our China business, which give us confidence to project an annual growth rate of approximately 15% in local currency for 2016. These drivers include : overall water heater market growth driven by household formation and an emerging replacement market; geographic expansion; market share gains; growth in water treatment and air purification products; and an improved product mix. The Rest of World segment operating margin for 2016 will be similar to last year's margin of 13%. I'm now moving on to slide 11. Especially in these volatile and uncertain economic times, we believe our long-term annual 8% organic growth potential and our stable defensive replacement market, which we believe represent approximately 85% of North American water heater and boiler volumes, positively differentiates A.O. Smith among other industrial companies. Coupled with growth and stability, we have a strong balance sheet poised to take advantage of strategic acquisitions that add shareholder value as well as allow us to return cash to shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks, and now we are available and open for your questions. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Bhupender Bohra from Jefferies. Your line is open. Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC : Hey, good morning, guys. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Morning. Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC : So I just wanted to get some color on the China. Ajita, in the press release you guys have talked about higher selling cost to support expansion in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. Can you expand on that, like where is this expansion happening and which particular markets we are talking about here? Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Why don't I give a headline, and John maybe you want to add some color to it? A couple of things. We are expanding into \u2013 we have always been expanding and we are expanding into smaller cities. We are expanding our own A.O. Smith stores. We are also investing in some new categories, which is continued investment in water treatment and air purification, and we are also investing in the commercial side of the water treatment market. So there's lots of investment going on for expansion in the future. One of the things as we think and as I have talked about very consistently, we are never going to be dependent on a stagnant portfolio of products in China for growth, okay, because that obviously doesn't last forever. And as we are always going to be investing in new categories to be able to leverage this incredible asset that we have in China, our brand name, our distribution, our manufacturing capability, the very strong team we have in China. So we are constantly investing in these new categories which are going to be our growth engines in the future. And right now, like I said, we are continuing to invest in water treatment and the commercial side of water treatment, air purification expansion geographically. And as we've consistently said in the past, we are looking at mid-teens type margins in China over the long term. There's going to be leverage as our volume grows, but the leverage is going to be less than what you would find in the U.S., because we are investing and because the SG&A in China tends to be much more variable than the SG&A expenses in North America. John, you want to add anything to that? John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I think the only thing I would add is obviously wage inflation is going up faster in China, and so there is some inflation cost also in that SG&A number. Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Just a follow-on on China, again. When you look at the headline news about the property prices or the residential prices in China, home prices going up and the household formation you talked about in your commentary, can you give us some color? Like as we talk about like some of the consumer markets kind of slowing down, you look at like auto companies talking about slower growth in China over the next five years, how does that hold actually with your 15% view over the next few years here? Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Bhupender, that's a great question. And again, John, you maybe want to add some color. As we look at it, in the appliance, in the consumer appliance categories, we are not seeing that, okay. And some of the things that we look at, if you look at the some of the forecasts we have IMF, UBS, they are forecasting the consumption component of GDP to grow between 7% and 8% in 2016. We are also seeing the sales of retail square footage of housing actually go up. So some of the indicators we are seeing in the macro economy, we hear different numbers and different parts of it, and certainly the export related industries are not doing well. But the consumption based industries seem to be doing well and we are seeing that in our market. John, anything you want to add? John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. And I think just remember that in our China growth model, we're assuming about 7% market growth in water heaters. And we're comfortable with that as appliance sales seem to be going up 6% and 7%, and I think we're going to benefit from the fact that replacement is becoming a bigger component. So those are kind of our assumptions in our 15%. Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thanks so much. I'll be joining the queue. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And maybe just one thing also, Bhupender, when we look at \u2013 for our 15% growth we look at a market growth of about 7%, and then the other components in terms of things like new products, market share growth, et cetera, are coming in to add up to our 15%. So right now, we feel comfortable with what we see. Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charley Brady from SunTrust Robinson. Your line is open. Charley Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hey. Thanks. Morning. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Morning. Charley Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Back on the China question, your comment on the replacement market coming to China, can you just maybe comment on what the replacement market is starting to look like in China and sort of what kind of growth you'd expect over the next 18 months, 24 months out of that? John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, all we have, Charley, is kind of our survey data. And as we look in Tier 1 cities, if you go back two or three years, that percent was about 35% replacement, and now it's approaching 50%. And that's just logical as penetration in Tier 1 cities is probably approaching 90-plus-%, and units fail. I mean we talk about our units lasting eight years to nine years and we think maybe our competitors' last less, and now replacement is going to become a bigger component. Charley Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Does that over time, maybe in the next 12 months, have any positive impact on reducing the promotional spend that you've got to put out there, or is it just something you've got to keep doing because you're still expanding in the market, and now you've got the water and the air added into that? John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, I don't think that by itself results in lower promotional expenses, I don't know if you can see that, but I don't think that would. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No. Charley Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: But I guess do you see it coming down, I guess is where I'm getting at? John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, I think without a doubt, as Ajita said, our long-term objective is to have SG&A as a smaller percent of sales. I mean we want to be able to leverage our top line growth. But right now, we're investing \u2013 we're incubating some businesses like Combi Boilers, like water treatment, like air purification. And as we expand the distribution outlets, we incur costs for display, we incur costs for promoters, et cetera. So that's still kind of the mode we're in right now. But clearly, our objective is down the road to be able to leverage that. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Right. And also, we are always very cognizant of these costs and doing things to bring them down. John said something that reminded me. In the past when we had \u2013 when we expanded, and we had new promoters, we spent a lot of money training those promoters. Now, we do obviously still train them, but we use things like WeChat and different tools that bring that promotion \u2013 the training cost of these promoters down very significantly, okay? So we are always looking at how we make those SG&A expenses go down and become much more productive. But at the same time, as we expand geographically and get into new categories, we are going to have to be spending, investing to make sure that we have the adequate presence in those categories with new competitors. Charley Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville from Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is open. Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Hey, morning. A couple of questions. First of all, just with respect to steel prices moving higher as of late, and you mentioned this in your prepared remarks, how should we think about the cascade, if you will, or progression of margins as we move through the year, particularly in North America relative to where you are in Q1? And obviously mix may or may not play a role in that, so if you could fold that in, that would be great. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I would say, it won't really affect margins much in the second quarter. As you know, there is a lag. But we certainly do see a progression of margins affecting the third quarter and fourth quarter because this increase really started happening in March, late February. And so it's going to affect us in the third quarter and fourth quarter. Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : I guess as a follow-up and unrelated, moving over to China, historically you've given some quantification of water treatment, air purification revenues. If you're willing to do that for the first quarter and what your expectation is for 2016, that would be helpful. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Water treatment did very well, was up 30%. We would expect it would be up about 30% for the year. Air purification did quite well. As we've said it's a seasonal business. It was up about $8 million or $9 million. We didn't basically have a product the prior year. And as we've said in the past, it'll really be the fourth quarter and the first quarter will be the major selling points for air purification. So we're still comfortable with that forecast of $20 million or so, and it'll be primarily first quarter and fourth quarter. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And we have some market leading products coming out during the year that'll help the fourth quarter season. So we feel pretty good about that forecast. Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran from Robert Baird. Your line is open. Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Morning, everyone. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Morning, Mike. Patricia K. Ackerman - Treasurer & Vice President- Investor Relations : Morning. Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): So a couple questions on North America, first on the commercial side. Obviously, you're still expecting growth for the full year. What happened in the first quarter on the volume side? AHRI numbers seem to point to a decent environment still. Anything specific you'd point to there, and then what gives confidence (27:15)? John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It really relates, Mike, to what Ajita said, the 55-gallon to 90-gallon electric category, that represented all of the growth. We just recently introduced products to better compete in that portion of the commercial water heater market and we expect to get our share of this market as the year progresses. But that's really the reason we were down a little bit while the market was actually, we think, up a little bit. Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. That makes sense. And then talk about the inventory levels on the residential channel in North America, obviously challenged in the first quarter on the comps side. Are you seeing the right sequential patterns in the numbers to help give some confidence in that up 100,000 plus units this year? And maybe just talk about what the customers are saying on that side? John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, obviously, the first quarter was down, and quite frankly it was down more than we expected. We would have thought it would have been down 300,000 or so, the pre-buy that we said last year and it will turn out to be down more than 400,000. We're still comfortable with that 100% increase -- I mean, 100,000 unit increase for a couple of reasons. One is we obviously have very favorable comps as we get to the last half of the year. We expect completions to be up about 100,000 to 150,000, so that should pass through. We just completed our regional sales managers, and I think as the input we got from them is that they're positive and their customers are positive for the year. So we'll continue to monitor it. But yeah, it did start out a little slower than we thought, but we think that forecast of $9 million, $9.1 million is certainly achievable at this point. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And also, Mike, in terms of what customers are saying and what we're hearing in the marketplace, so this is anecdotal, but things we are hearing and consistently is that there was \u2013 obviously the buy-in was bigger than we anticipated, I thought it was. And part of the reason, which is what we're hearing, is that, normally, when there is a buy-in because of a price increase, it's the distributors who buy in. But this time, it seems like contractors bought in also, okay, that's what we're hearing. And the reason is that some of the new NAECA III type units were slightly bigger than the older units. So it was a tight fit, especially in multifamily housing, which is doing very well. And so there seems to be a new component of the buy-in. In talking to other plumbing industry suppliers to the wholesale marketplace, obviously people we don't compete with, also their thoughts in terms of new construction is very similar to ours, in that 1.1 million to 1.2 million type new construction. And so putting it all together, talking about what the sell-through rates are at distribution, we feel pretty good about the forecast and the guidance. Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. I appreciate the additional color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy from Stifel. Your line is open. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Can you hear me? Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Patricia K. Ackerman - Treasurer & Vice President- Investor Relations : Yes. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Okay. So I guess the question I have, obviously you had some price costs and some movement in this year in terms of North America, and I'll talk to Pat offline about some of the details of that in the back half. But just conceptually going forward, what are you thinking in kind of a steady state environment? You can get a couple of points of price, volumes will be a couple of points, what do you think you can get incremental margins on a sustainable basis in North America for the next couple of years? John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Rob, we really haven't come out with a forecast on what margins are going to do in the next couple of years, and there is obviously a lot of variables in that. I mean we still expect that the industry is going to continue to grow, because that 1.1 million completions, that's below the norm we think. So we think that's going to continue to grow. We think that Lochinvar, given where they are specifically from a boiler standpoint, we think will continue to grow at 10%. And they obviously contribute at very attractive margins. So it's certainly our objective to grow margins, but we have not put out any forecast on what they're going to do in the next couple of years. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : But also I think it's \u2013 you can say that our most challenged category from a margin perspective is our residential water heater category, which we've talked about in the past. And again, we've said in the past that we expect 20% to 25% type incremental in that category and we feel pretty comfortable with that. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Now, that's helpful. And then switching gears to China and about water treatment, could you just expand about some of the investments you've made there on the CapEx side and does it point to some of your ambitions as to how big that market could be? Obviously, you had 30% growth I think in water heaters in the quarter. I think that was probably just a nominal number. But maybe you could just \u2013 not water, excuse me, in water treatment in China, but could you speak about kind of the opportunity you see there? Do you think there is a chance that perhaps investors are kind of underselling that opportunity over the longer term? John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, CMM has put out an estimate that they think the water treatment market can grow over approximately 30% for the next several years. And the basis for that is the low penetration rate of units in China. We also are familiar with the water issues they have. We have the best product in the market. It wastes less water, longer lasting filter. And it's RO which is the area that is the preferred method for water filtration in China. So we're very comfortable as we look out that a 30% growth rate is achievable. And so whether investors are incorporating that or not, I mean we think we're building a very good water filtration business. Last year, the A.O. Smith brand sold $110 million worth; that was up from $75 million the previous year and up $43 million the prior year. We also have some small sales in Vietnam, some small sales in Turkey, and we're also still selling the legacy business. So I think we're developing a very solid water filtration business. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think also to add to that, as I look out into the future in terms of our \u2013 again, to be the leader, we have to have market leading products and we have a tremendous portfolio of products in the pipeline which I feel very good about. The other thing which I alluded to at the beginning of the conversation is that we are also now expanding and stepping into the commercial side of the water treatment business. This would be appliances for small restaurants and things like that. So we feel very good about the potential for water treatment in China and frankly around the world in emerging markets. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for your time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Jeff. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Ajita, just wanted to get back to just this whole inventory dynamic. So when you talk to your distributors about inventories and sell-through and maybe their visibility into the contractor, what's kind of your conclusion on the inventory situation? And I guess around that, any kind of pause or digestion from customers, just given how big the price increase was here for NAECA III water heaters? Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : First of all, like I said, this is anecdotal, so I don't have real good facts and numbers, it's conversation. One of the questions we were wondering about was whether people cut back on inventories and had the same dollar investment as opposed to unit investment because of the price increase, which is what I think you're alluding to. From what I understand in talking to some of our larger customers, they did not do that, okay, because their replenishment is really based on units. And so there wasn't any cutback because of that. I think that inventory levels in wholesale are okay. Retail maybe a little low, wholesale are where they should be, normal level. John, anything you can add to that? John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. I think to answer your last question, we have not seen any pushback from the end customer. And I've said this in the past, I mean if you look at what a water heater costs, it is the cheapest appliance out there. It's at a six-year warranty. It's going to last 13 years to 14 years, and it's very energy efficient. So it is a very realistically priced product to the end consumer, which is obviously important. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So if you look at the different components \u2013 the different segments of people buying, if you think of new construction, it's going to happen. If you think of forced replacement, it's going to happen. If you think of \u2013 there is about, we think, 20% to 25% depending on the year and the economy of the replacement market is discretionary replacement. Now, that component you can say, wait a minute, maybe price does impact it, we don't have any real good facts. But at the end of the day, someone's going to buy a water heater maybe once, maybe twice in a lifetime. So it's not a price point that people have in their minds as being something familiar. When they are in the market, they go in and they check on a price and then they decide whether they're going to go ahead or not. That component could be impacted, but we don't really see evidence of that. We'll know more as time goes on because we have techniques, which we do track things like that and track people who buy water heaters and some of the reasoning. But some of those things \u2013 that data lags and we'll have to \u2013 it'll take us some time to really get to the bottom of that. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Just on China, you have quite a bit of cash trapped over in China. What's kind of the cost to repatriate that? We've heard about people kind of, with the FX volatility, wanting to kind of move cash out of China. How does that kind of inform your view on that trapped cash? John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So we've taken out in the last two years or so $150 million of dividends out of China. When you take it out of China to Europe, you pay about a 10 \u2013 not about, you pay a 10% withholding tax to China. And then to bring it back from Europe back to the U.S., it would be an incremental low 20% type charge. So I mean that's the whole discussion going on in Washington, right, is it's very expensive to repatriate money back to the U.S. And until the government makes some changes in it, companies are going to keep it offshore. So we continue to look for opportunities in China. So at this time right now, we're leaving that money there, and we're comfortable with that. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey, good morning. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Morning, Scott. Patricia K. Ackerman - Treasurer & Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): So is there anything that you see in the market right now where the increase in steel prices that we've seen cannot be passed on to customers later this year? Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think, look, the pricing that we had last year is holding in the marketplace. In terms of the future, I really can't speculate in terms of what could or couldn't happen. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): But correct me if I'm wrong that we're talking here mostly, right, about the distributors, because on the retail side, it's contracted. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Parts of it, yeah. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, a portion of it is. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Right. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : A portion of it is, so there are pass-through mechanisms for a portion of it. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And distributors like price increases as long as they're measured historically, right? Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Scott, I'm not going to speculate on future pricing, okay? I mean that's something I've never done. If you look at over time, okay, let's look at the past rather than looking at the future, over time when there are significant material price increases, we've been able to pass that on to the marketplace. That's what the history has been. I can't speculate in terms of the future when it comes to pricing for obvious reasons. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): No problem. Understand. Hey, was just wondering, piggybacking off of the cash questions, how does the M&A pipeline look? I mean is there any possibility of getting something done this year? Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Obviously, we can't talk about anything that's happening. But I can talk about there was a lull in the market in terms of potential \u2013 the activity level in the marketplace. There was a lull for a while, but recently things have picked up a bit. So there are the ups and downs, as you know, and the market is active. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Here's my last question. We're now toward the end of April, and water heaters are a pretty short cycle business. So I'm just wondering is, you made a comment during your remarks that you guys \u2013 or it may have been John, that you guys are expecting the pre-buy effects to impact some of April as well. Are you at a point today based on the most recent data, where the pre-buying maybe now looks more behind you? John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, I'm not sure, Scott, the pre-buy was last year. That was when the pre-buy happened was last year, and it really happened kind of up through middle of April. I think our order rate, I'd tell you in April is about normal. So again, I think we have favorable comps the last half of the year, and we would hope we're going to see completions grow by 100,000 units, 150,000 units. So we'll certainly have better visibility as we get through the second quarter, but we think right now it's reasonable. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Right. No, John, that's what I'm saying. I know that the pre-buy was last year. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): What I'm saying is that have you seen in the recent data, where you're now largely done with that comp that the order rates are normalizing and it sounds like you are seeing that. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, but it's very short period, right, because again the pre-buy went through April 15 of last year, so I mean we're looking at a very short period. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Understood. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Rose from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Good morning. Thank you for taking my call. I had a couple of just quick follow-up questions; most of mine have been answered. I was wondering if you could break out \u2013 you broke out the water treatment and purifier sales increases in China, but I didn't capture the water heater number anywhere. What was the growth in water heaters in China, residential? John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We really haven't given that out, but both our electric and instantaneous were up. David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. Up in mid-single digits, low-single digits? John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It depends. I mean gas continues to grow faster than electric, which we expect. David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then lastly is on Lochinvar. I didn't hear a growth number out of Lochinvar, maybe I missed it. What did they grow in the quarter? John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Lochinvar had an interesting quarter. As we said, they were up about 15% on the boiler business, but they were down significantly on the residential side. And the reason for that was last year they had a pre-buy. Their units were up 44% compared to the prior year, while the industry was only up 14%. This year, their units were down 39% versus the industry as we said was down 16%. So their residential water heater sales were down over $2 million. So when you incorporate that into the boiler growth, they were up about 3% on a net basis, I think 4%, 5% on a gross basis. And why we're still comfortable with the 10% is they have favorable comps the last half of the year and their new boiler products have been very well accepted in the marketplace. So we think this residential piece was just a lumpy kind of quarter-to-quarter issue. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, with a very high buy-in last year. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. All right. That's helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And that looks like all the questioners that we have in the queue at this time. So I would like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. Patricia K. Ackerman - Treasurer & Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you all for joining us today. Please take note that we will participate in numerous conferences during the second quarter. Those are Oppenheimer in New York on May 10; KeyBanc in Boston on June 1; Deutsche Bank in Chicago on June 8; Stifel in New York on June 13; and William Blair in Chicago on June 15. Have a wonderful day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you again for your participation in today's conference. This now concludes the program and you may all disconnect your telephone lines at this time. Everyone have a great day.",

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Patricia Ackerman, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Ms. Ackerman, you may begin. Patricia K. Ackerman - Treasurer & Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Danielle. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on our 2016 second quarter results conference call. With me participating in the call are Ajita Rajendra, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Kita, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin with Ajita's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning's press release. Also in respect of others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. I will now turn the call over to Ajita who will begin with his remarks on slide three. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Pat, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. The second quarter of 2016 was another excellent quarter for A. O. Smith., setting second quarter records for sales and earnings. We continue to see healthy end markets for our consumer products in China and commercial water heaters and boilers in the U.S. Here are a few highlights. Sales grew 2% to a record $667 million. Excluding the impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar against the Chinese and Canadian currencies, our sales grew 4% in the second quarter. China sales were up 16% in local currency. Record second quarter net earnings of $0.98 per share was 24% higher than our earnings per share during the same period last year. We continue to review our capital allocation and dedicate a portion to return to shareholders. During the first half of the year, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares for $82 million. We increased our dividend by 26% six months ago. John will now describe our results in more detail beginning with slide four. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Ajita. Sales for the second quarter of $667 million were 2% higher than the previous year. Net earnings of $87.1 million improved 23% from 2015. Earnings per share of $0.98 improved 24% over last year. Sales in our North America segment of $433 million declined 2% compared with the second quarter 2015. The decline in sales was primarily due to lower volumes of residential water heaters in the U.S. This was partially offset by price increases implemented in 2015 in the U.S. related to a regulatory change and in Canada throughout 2015 related to Canadian dollar weakness, as well as higher volumes of boilers and commercial water heaters in the U.S. The Rest of World segment sales of $240 million increased 8% compared with 2015. China sales increased 16% in local currency driven by higher demand for water heaters and A. O. Smith branded water treatment products. On slide six, North America operating earnings of $104 million were 21% higher than segment operating earnings in the previous year, and operating margin of 24.1% was significantly above the 19.4% operating margin one year ago. Higher prices in the U.S. and Canada and significantly lower material costs contributed to the improved segment financial performance. The positive impact to profits from higher U.S. commercial volumes essentially offset lower U.S. residential water heater volume. Rest of World operating earnings of $33 million improved 7% compared with 2015. Higher China sales were partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses in China and larger losses in India. Segment operating earnings were negatively impacted by approximately $2 million due to China currency translation. Higher selling cost in China to support expansion in tier 2 and tier 3 cities and our e-commerce platform, as well as higher advertising costs to promote our water treatment and air purification products in China were the primary drivers of higher segment SG&A expenses. Second quarter segment operating margin of 13.8% was slightly lower than one year ago. Our corporate expenses were flat in the second quarter compared with the year ago period. Our effective income tax rate in the second quarter of 2016 was 29.8%, lower than the 31.1% recorded in the prior year quarter, and benefited from the early adoption of a new accounting standard for share-based compensation. Cash provided by operations during the first half of the year were $155 million compared with $61 million during the same period last year, driven primarily by higher earnings and lower outlays for working capital in the 2016 period. Our liquidity position and balance sheet remained strong. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 16% at the end of the second quarter. We have cash balances totaling over $665 million located offshore. And our net cash position was approximately $385 million at the end of June. During the first half of the year, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of common stock for a total of $82 million. We had approximately 1.5 million shares remaining on our existing repurchase authority at the end of the second quarter. This morning, we announced an increase in the midpoint of our 2016 EPS guidance in a range between $3.58 and $3.64 per share. The midpoint of our EPS guidance represents a 14% increase in EPS compared with our 2015 results. Please turn to slide nine for several 2016 assumptions. We expect our cash flow from operations in 2016 to be approximately $340 million, which is similar to 2015. We expect higher earnings will be offset by higher outlays for working capital this year compared with 2015. Due to the strong growth of our water treatment business in China, we will reach the capacity of our existing leased facility in the next few years. Our 2016 capital spending plans of $105 million to $115 million for the total year include approximately $20 million related to construction of a new water treatment manufacturing and air purification assembly facility in China. Total cost for the facility, which is expected to be completed in 2018, will be approximately $65 million. In addition, we will complete capacity expansion at two North America plants in 2016 at a cost of approximately $7 million. Our 2016 capital spending plan also includes approximately $10 million to support the ERP implementation. Our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $70 million in 2016. We successfully completed three ERP go-live milestones since 2014. We expect to have converted the vast majority of our North America plant sites by the end of 2016. Expenses related to our ERP implementation were about $16 million in 2015 and are projected to be approximately $25 million in 2016, higher than the previous year due to the large number of scheduled go-live events in 2016. We had expenses of approximately $9.5 million in the first half of 2016, which was comparable to 2015. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $47 million in 2016, higher than the $43 million in 2015, primarily due to higher expenses at our Corporate Technology Center and expected lower interest rate than last year on cash deposits in China. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 30% in 2016, slightly higher than the 2015 rate. We expect to continue to repurchase shares at a value equal to our free cash flow after dividend or approximately $175 million in 2016. This is consistent with our stated policy to maintain our net cash balance at approximately $350 million. As a result, we expect our average diluted outstanding shares for the year will be slightly greater than 88 million. Primarily as a result of continued strong cash flow and escalating PBGC premiums, we expect to make a voluntary contribution to our pension plan of $30 million in the third quarter. The after-tax impact to our cash flow is approximately $18.5 million. I will now turn the call back to Ajita, who will summarize the business assumptions and our 2016 outlook and our growth strategy beginning on slide 10. Ajita? Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, John. We expect that our businesses will collectively grow approximately 8% to 8.5% in local currency and approximately 6% to 6.5% in U.S. dollars in 2016. The assumptions for currency underlying our organic growth forecasts are at current rates, with the exception of continued depreciation of the China currency rate to RMB6.80 per $1 in the fourth quarter. Specific to our North America segment, our announced 5% to 8% price increase on wholesale U.S. water heaters will take effect on August 1. We expect steel prices to remain firm, as they are up over $250 a ton since the beginning of the year. Partially offset by the August 1 price increase, steel will have a progressively negative impact on North America margin in the second half of the year. We expect U.S. residential water heater industry volumes will remain constant in 2016 at 2015 levels of 8.9 million units, including tankless. This forecast is lower than our earlier projection as the industry volumes in the first half of the year were lower than we expected. We continue to see a noteworthy trend emerge in the commercial water heater industry. The majority of the growth in commercial industry units so far in 2016 has been in the 55 gallon to 90-gallon electric category. You may recall similarly sized electric residential units were discontinued by NAECA III. Driven by continued growth in the small electric category, we expect U.S. commercial water heater industry volume will grow 35,000 units to 40,000 units in 2016 after strong growth in 2015. Lochinvar boiler sales increased 10% in the first half of the year and were partially offset by lower residential water heater volume, which experienced difficult comps to 2015. The net result was an increase in Lochinvar-branded product sales in the first half of the year, up 2%. Based on the first half of the year, we expect Lochinvar-branded sales will grow approximately 6% for the total year, implying that we expect sales in the second half of the year for Lochinvar will grow about 10%. We expect the historical transition from lower efficiency, non-condensing boilers to higher efficiency, condensing boilers to continue. This long-term trend, coupled with new product introduction and normalization of residential water heater volume, gives us confidence to project a 10% growth rate for Lochinvar-branded sales in 2017 and beyond. As John previously noted, our ERP implementation costs are expected to be $9 million higher than in 2015. The additional cost in the second half of 2016 will negatively impact North America margin by more than 50 basis points compared with the first half of 2016. These factors, in addition to the assumptions John discussed earlier, lead to our expectation that our North America segment operating margin will be between 21.5% and 22% in 2016. Some assumptions specific to our Rest of World segment. We are a consumer products company in China which distinguishes us from most industrial companies operating in China. In local currency, our sales in China have grown by 18% in 2014, 16% in 2015 and 16% in the first half of this year, despite a softer China economy. We have various growth drivers underpinning our China business which give us confidence to project an annual growth rate of approximately 15% in local currency for 2016. These drivers include overall water heater market growth driven by household formation and an emerging replacement market, geographic expansion, market share gains, growth in water treatment and air purification products, and improved product mix. We expect Rest of World segment operating margin in 2016 to be similar to last year's margin of 13%. I'm moving on to slide 11 now. Especially in these volatile and uncertain economic times, we believe our long-term annual 8% organic growth potential and our stable defensive replacement market, which we believe represent approximately 85% of North America water heater and boiler volumes, positively differentiates AOS among other industrial companies. Coupled with growth and stability, we have a strong balance sheet poised to take advantage of strategic acquisitions that adds shareholder value as well as allow us to return cash to shareholders. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, we are available for your questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from Robert McCarthy from Stifel. Your line is open. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone. I guess the first question I would have is maybe you could just amplify your comments around the price increases that you're going to be pushing through in August and kind of your thoughts about the cadence of volumes for the back half of the year in the North American business. How we should be thinking about that? John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, North America volumes, I guess, first half of the year to second half of the year we would actually expect to be relatively similar. The third quarter is traditionally quite a bit lighter than the fourth quarter but this year, well, we think in all it would be lightly less because of the price increases, et cetera. So, that's how we would kind of view the North America volumes. Obviously, very favorable comps compared to the last half of the year 2015, the opposite of what we had in the first half. So, that certainly will result in an increase of year-over-year. With respect to the price increase, we talked about it. I think we put out an 8-K and we said it's effective H1. Obviously, there can be some pre-buys, so it might ultimately be a little bit later in the quarter, but that's effective H1. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: You would expect some kind of modest pre-buy in association with that? John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I think that's typically what happened. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then my follow-up question I think would be just stepping back, obviously, continued commitment to share repurchase. Stock continues to work. You guys continue to perform. But, I guess, not the concern, but I guess the \u2013 what's out there remains capital allocation for doing just kind of a very high potential deal in M&A. And could you talk about the opportunity set there because it seems like it's perpetually very challenged? I mean, Lochinvar was obviously immediately a home run. But you've got a good, strong balance sheet. You've got a very high stock price. You've got opportunities to redeploy the capital aside from share repurchase. Could you talk about the capital allocation front? And are we any closer to something a little more dynamic in terms of a strategic deal right now? John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, I'll start and then, Ajita, you can - Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Kind of fill in. We've taken the position that, with our current balance sheet, we have enough in our war chest to do transactions. So, we've said we're going to leave our net cash position about $350 million. And we'll split that up between dividends and stock repurchase. And we've also said that we're going to be disciplined. We've said all along our preference would be to do a deal. We think that's the best value we can provide to shareholders if we do the right deal. And we've said we'll be disciplined. And, quite frankly, there are opportunities out there. And as long as you can get synergies \u2013 and we're holding steadfast. We need to get proper returns to return our cost of capital. So both Ajita and I want to do deals but we want to do the right deal. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. I think - Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: What's your theoretical constraint on a deal? Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt you, Ajita. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No. Go ahead. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Well, what's your theoretical \u2013 how much could you deploy on a deal given \u2013 what's your walk and chew gum number in terms of being able to deploy and then what's your existing cash generation and your comfortable leverage ratio? John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We said we'd be comfortable getting up to 35%. That's the capital. So, that leaves you quite a real bit of room there. You have a $600-some million offshore that we could also do. So, I think, realistically, we certainly have over $1 billion of available capacity. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, just to add on to a little bit of what John said. We are very comfortable with having the ability to do a large or a number of acquisitions up to about $1 billion. And what we've also said in terms of our capital allocation strategy is that we're not going to add to our cash reserves. And as we generate cash, we're going to be buying back stock approximately equal to our cash flow, so \u2013 to our free cash flow. So, I think, we are very comfortable with that position. And, again, as John said, there are opportunities out there. But we are going to be strategic and disciplined in terms of our approach. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks. I'll get back in queue. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Charlie Brady from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is open. Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, guys, and Pat. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Patricia K. Ackerman - Treasurer & Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning. Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Just on the North America margin outlook second half over first half, it looks like to get to you at the high-end of that range you've laid out for North America \u2013 it's about 160 basis point, 170 basis point year-over-year second half versus first half decline. Is that entirely due to your commentary about steel pricing or steel cost rather being a greater headwind as you go through the year or are there other some factors going on in there? John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, I think, there's a couple of things going on. Number one is ERP spending is higher in the last half of the year than the first half. So, we've said that will affect margins by over 50 basis points compared to the first half of the year. And I think the other biggest factor is what you alluded to. Steel is going to be effective July 1. The price increase will be effective some time probably mid-quarter. And then, also, anytime you put a price increase like this, it's customary for our industry to commit pricing to some projects. So, the entire pricing might not get in until later this year, early next year. So, I think, steel, certainly is the biggest factor. Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: So, you've got a lag on the pricing versus steel cost going up and you've probably got some pre-buy which skews the volume a little earlier? John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Right. Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Price hit. Got it. Okay. That's all for me. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Your line is open. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Yes. Good morning, everyone. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Mike (sic) [David]. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Just with respect to the residential water heater business, can you just discuss any differences you're seeing in growth patterns between wholesale and retail? John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I'll start. Wholesale is growing a little bit better than retail. There might have been some \u2013 and I'd say the opposite happened last year. I think retail probably grew a little bit more than wholesale. So, I think, you have that flip-back going on. But I don't think it's dramatic either way, if you will. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. The ratios really haven't changed much. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, right, not significantly. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : And just further to that point is are you seeing disparity within your retailer mix that would raise concerns or is it pretty even? John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. Not really. I mean I talked to our salespeople last couple days and where there is disparity is there is some geographic mix. I mean the Southeast is very strong. The Midwest isn't as strong. So, I mean, you have some of those things going on. I think that the comments they made to me as much were the market's steady. I'm not going to tell you it's robust, but they also said it's not weak. And our forecast of flat to last year results in us taking down our unit volumes by about 100,000 to 150,000, but in total that's less than 2% of the market. So, it kind of is what it is. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Right. Second question just on China. Your best assessment of China's market unit growth rate in second quarter and what are you assuming for the second half in your EPS guidance? John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Unit growth, I don't have \u2013 oh, yes, I mean, it depends what sector you're talking about. So, water treatment was up 30%, very strong. Our instantaneous gas very strong. We're still a little bit on the Combi Boiler and the commercial a little bit behind. And the electric is up. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So it's - Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And the mix in the first half is in local currency about a 16% increase. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Right. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And there is some pricing in there because average unit prices have gone up, as we've talked about, because with the new products we try to make sure that, with enhanced features and benefits, we are driving unit prices up. So the 16% is a combination of a little bit of pricing and unit volumes going up. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And, I mean, I think if you look at the last half, we're probably \u2013 given our 15% and we're up 16%. We're a little bit lower than the last half of the year, but that's just difficult comps quarter-to-quarter. So we kind of look at it on an annual basis. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Yeah. I guess just to that point, within that 15% second half, are you expecting a slightly better category and maybe just changes in terms of share and pricing or just if you could deconstruct that for us? John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, I think it's pretty much the same thing. As water treatment continues to do very well, we would hope commercial will come back a little bit more in the second half of the year. We're introducing a new product there. But all in all, I don't see anything dramatically moving. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. We have new products. We have Series 10 coming out in electric. We have an enhanced portfolio of air purification products. And that's a seasonal product, so that when it gets to the fourth quarter, December, January, is where you see the high volumes there. So, overall, pretty much continuation of the same. One thing I want to add in terms of \u2013 just to add some color to your question. When it comes to water treatment, which is probably the business segment that's growing the fastest, the penetration of that product in households in China is very low. It's single-digit. And that's part of what's driving this 30%-plus growth rate in the marketplace. And we have a high share position. And we continue to grow. So we are very bullish about the opportunities in that segment also. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And, I guess if you look at that first half margin for Rest of World, it looks about 13% and we're expecting the last half and the full year to be 13%. So, we'll come in relatively similar. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Right. Okay. Thanks very much. Appreciate it. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from William Bremer from Maxim Group. Your line is open. William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC : Good morning, gentlemen, and Pat. Patricia K. Ackerman - Treasurer & Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hi, Bill. William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC : Can we touch base a little bit on Lochinvar here? In your slide deck, you said that product sales growth of about 6% but yet your commentary was voicing first half of this year 10% and second half 10%. This is predominantly a North American play. I'm just trying to get a sense on how is it progressing and have we started to consider bringing this internationally. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, I'll try to clarify the numbers. Maybe we didn't clarify them quite correctly. So, we really split it into, I'll say, two segments. One is I call their core business, which is the boiler business \u2013 residential, commercial boilers. And we said year-to-date that was up about 10%, okay. But they do have, as you know, a standard commercial and a residential business, and that residential business the first half of the year was down 18%. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Residential water heater. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Residential water heaters. So what we said is, for the first half of the year, the total Lochinvar was up 2%. William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC : Okay. Got you. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Then we went to the second half of the year and we said the run rate, we think, will be at about a 10% run rate for the second half of the year, again, led by boilers, which will be up double-digits. And residential will again have some drape but not as much. So, what we've said is, that gets us to kind of that 6% for the year, less than we expected. And, quite frankly, we just didn't build in the residential volatility that we saw. We had a very strong residential last year and we're seeing it come back. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. And that's a key point there too because the residential water heater business for Lochinvar was very strong in the first half of last year. So they had tough comp. And so, we see it getting back on track in the second half. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : The other thing I'll say is as we look at our boiler business, we appear to be getting market share. So we're very pleased with that. William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC : Okay. The aftermarket there, has that been picking up as well? John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Up by 6%, up a little bit. Not dramatic. William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC : Okay. And finally, steel prices. The Q is not out yet. Just wondering. Do you take this opportunity or where are you in terms of positioning yourself? I know about the price increase, but more in essence on hedging tactics going forward. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, we talked about it. We've done some hedges on steel. It's not a very liquid market. And we have put some hedges in place that really didn't have much effect at all on the second quarter. And it's just difficult given the liquidity to do much. You have to have a \u2013 to be a buyer, you have to have a seller. And it's not a liquid market. It's developing. But we have put some hedges in place. William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Alvaro Lacayo from Gabelli Company. Your line is open. Alvaro Lacayo - G. research LLC : Good morning, everyone. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Alvaro Lacayo - G. research LLC : Just a quick \u2013 just some more clarity around a flat volume for residential water heater expectation. If you could just comment on the clarity you have into the market and maybe some commentary around sell-in versus sell-out. And you mentioned there is some pre-buy. Have you already seen some evidence of that? John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, I guess, what I would say and we haven't been very clairvoyant on that, but I would say that when I talked to our salespeople, they think that inventory levels are reasonable. And they'll actually be a little elevated obviously at the end of July because of the pre-buy which we expected. But all in all, inventory levels are reasonable. I think the myth was probably that the inventory levels were just much higher last year than we expected. I mean, Ajita talked in the first conference call that contract is pre-bought. That normally doesn't happen. We've actually seen some NAECA II products sold online recently. So, there's still some out there. But as our people look and talk to their customers, I think, I'd be repeating myself, but it's steady. Our completions are moving the way that was expected. And I think we're relatively comfortable with flat second half of the year compared to first half of the year. And we'll see. Alvaro Lacayo - G. research LLC : Okay. And then, secondly, just the organic growth assumption on Q2 versus Q1, it's down a little bit. Is that just the reflection of maybe a little bit lower volume on the residential water heater or are there other elements at play here? John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, I think, it's two things. We've changed our assumptions for currency from the first quarter. And that probably caused us $10 million, $12 million. I mean, the RMB has moved faster than what we thought. And so, we're assuming right now RMB6.7 kind of in the third quarter, RMB6.8 the fourth quarter. And that's up from our original assumptions. And I think the other adjustment would be the residential volumes. Alvaro Lacayo - G. research LLC : Got it. And the acceleration in the back half of Lochinvar is just purely comps related from the residential water unit? John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, not clearly. But I guess I'd say what happens is we don't have as much drag from residential, but the boiler business continues to do what it's been doing. Like I said the first half of the year up 10% and we expect the second half of the year to be up more than 10%. And then you throw in, yes, it does have favorable comps just like our North America water heater business does, so yes. Alvaro Lacayo - G. research LLC : Okay. Thank you. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): HI. Good morning. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Patricia K. Ackerman - Treasurer & Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): So, the expectation that you guys have for the full year residential water heater business, now, I'm not privy, I don't have it in my hands the tankless side. But it would suggest that the water heater side residential your expectation for the second half \u2013 year-end volumes are up more than 10%, which seems reasonable given the comparisons and what have you. I guess my question is, is that we're kind of \u2013 this has been a pretty long de-stock following the pre-buy, looking in your earlier comments. And what I'm wondering here is we're at like 7.8 million units trailing 12 months. That's a number we haven't seen since, well, three years ago. So, I'm wondering if there's anything else that you think is going on in the channels that might have gotten us to this level. They seem to be leaner than lean, but is there more going on in your view? John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I guess what I would say is, repeating myself, it turned out that the volumes were much higher in the pre-buy starting in 2014 and 2015. I think when we step back, Scott, we still look at \u2013 we had a run rate in this industry 2010 to 2012 about 8.1 million units. We're up to this year and last year we're staying about 8.9 million units when you include tankless in there. And completions have probably added probably 400,000. So, we've had some replacement growth in there. And I think our people are comfortable with the estimates we have in the last half of the year but - Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think the pre-buy \u2013 as John said, the pre-buy was greater than we thought. And the feedback we are getting from the marketplace is there are now distributors. There are run rates. They're saying, hey, things are okay. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. That's fine. So, there's really no change in your view that there is this still large amount of pent-up demand because the residential water heater volumes have still a ways to go catch-up-wise from how wicked bad it was last cycle. So, you're still thinking that the under-build on starts in particular still suggests that there is a significant amount of units of pent-up demand. Do you still \u2013 you're holding to that? Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Long-term, yeah. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yes, agreed. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Long-term, yeah. In terms of current run rate, things are okay. But long-term the fact is if you go, do the math in terms of the overbuild before the recession and the housing starts since then, there's a deficit in housing. And like I've spoken before, we don't think it's going to come back quickly but it will come back in terms of steady growth over the long haul. And, frankly, we prefer that. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah. Yeah. Got it. My second question is very simple. It's on the Rest of World margins which have been kind of like you get volume leverage and then you spend it and you \u2013 this is my phrase, not yours. You kind of manage the earnings of that business really well. I guess, the question is, at what point does Rest of World spending start to comp a little bit more easily and Rest of World margin actually starts to benefit from the volume leverage that you're generating? Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think you're right. We have been investing. And the level of investment in new businesses in the last few months has been a little higher than what we've done in the past. We still have air purification, which is an investment. We've gotten into commercial water treatment, which is an investment. We are investing in e-commerce business, which is growing at warp speed. I mean, it is just growing very fast. And we're also investing in terms of going into second tier and third tier cities, the smaller cities. So, we do have a lot going on right now. But longer-term, you should see an increasing leverage, an increasing profitability coming out of the China business as we continue to grow. And what we are doing now are investments to make sure that we are fueling that growth out into the future. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got you. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Because we continue to believe that our brand and distribution in China and our footprint in China has significant upside potential as we expand our categories and continue to grow in the categories we're in. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Just to emphasize, I think, China is having a great year. So, one, it doesn't affect their margins, but their currency has affected their absolute profits by $6 million to $7 million. And we've chosen to invest in two businesses specifically that Ajita talked about, air purification, which will probably lose an additional $3 million over last year and commercial water heating, which will probably lose $3 million over last year because we weren't in it. But we think, long-term, both those businesses can be very attractive. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You meant commercial water treatment? John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, commercial water treatment, yeah. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you. That's all I had. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Sam Eisner from Goldman & Sachs (sic) [Goldman Sachs]. Your line is open. Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. Thanks and good morning, everyone. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. So, if I look at your trailing 12 months operating profits in North America and the margins there, you're at roughly 22.5%. That's up from this time last year, on LTM basis up at 17%. So, this is now four quarters in a row where you generated north of 20% EBIT margins within North America. I was wondering if you could parse out how much would be isolated just the raw material tailwind. How much that really has been to you, guys? Because obviously now we're starting to lap some of those savings. So, I was wondering if you could just isolate how big the steel tailwind has been for you guys on an LTM basis. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I don't have that data. I mean, you've got things going on, commercial up and down during that time period. Clearly, steel was beneficial for us over the last three quarters, I'd say. But I don't have any data that would parse that out. Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : You have Symphony cost going plus and minus during \u2013 I mean not just the SAP cost going plus or minus. So, there's a lot of variables. But certainly steel was beneficial to us in the last three quarters. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And the timing differences too. Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And you've probably seen changes in there - Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think changes, timing differences, so there are lots of puts and takes in that. Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And maybe to ask a forward-looking question. You've given some margin targets for the remainder of 2016. You gave us kind of the organic growth medium-term algorithm. But is there a way to think about what the medium-term algorithm would be for margin profiles for North America and Rest of World? Going back to the last question, should we expect some type of harvest mode for Rest of World at some point in the future? Is a 22% trailing 12-month operating margin in North America the right way that we should think about the long-term profitability of that segment? Perhaps you could just put some parameters around the way that we should think about kind of the medium-term algorithm for you, guys. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, I guess I'll say it this way. We haven't done our 2017 plan yet. I think the full year of 21.5% to 22% is a reasonable starting point to look at. Again, by that time, the entire price increase will be in, et cetera. Symphony, we'll get some inventory SAP. We get some benefits. By the way, internally, we call SAP Symphony. That's why I keep using that word. We'll get some benefits from that next year. So, again, we really haven't done our plan to really determine. But I don't think that's an unreasonable starting off point. Rest of World, it just depends on some of these businesses that we've talked about that have had some issues, if you will, partly because they're starting out such as commercial water treatment. I won't call it an issue. We're getting in to do business. We've got to make an investment. Air purifiers, we're getting into new business. We've got to make the investment. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Actually, when it comes to volume and when it comes to the growth of both those businesses, I'm very pleased about how it's going. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : But we haven't put out any long-term aspirations for Rest of World except that Ajita and I are both in agreement that we ultimately have to grow those margins. And we do that by leveraging SG&A. We do that by improving performance in India. And we do that in performing some of these businesses that we've investing in. Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And then I realize that your price increase is just about to take effect in a few days here but I was curious with your wholesale customers what the conversations have been up until this point. Is anybody pushing back on that? Are you seeing that they are willing to accept 5% to 8%? Maybe you can give us some kind of clarity on what expected realization off that 5% to 8% would ultimately be? Thanks. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I don't know about you, Ajita, I have not heard any negative feedbacks. Obviously, steel is up. Cold rolled is up $300 a ton from the beginning of the year. Hot rolled is up $200 a ton from the end of the year. So it's been significant increases in steel. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think our distributors expected it and it's very little conversation. Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin Maczka from BB&T Capital Markets. Your line is open. Kevin Richard Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets : Thanks. Good morning. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Morning. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Morning. Kevin Richard Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets : Can we just do a clarification on the ERP spend expectations for the year? So on a full year basis we'll be $9 million higher this year than last year. Is Q4 a very heavy spend quarter in the back half, a heavier spend quarter and any sense yet on how much that declines into next year? John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. So, yes, I'll try to clarify it. First half of the year we spent about $9.5 million. That was very similar to last year's first half of the year. Okay. The second half of the year then we'll spend a delta of $15 million, $15.5 million. That's going to be about $9 million more than the prior year. And I would tell you we will be spending that $15 million or $16 million a little bit heavier in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. So, does that clarify it this year? Kevin Richard Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets : It sure does. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. So, then, when you go into 2017, our expectation \u2013 and, again, we haven't done our planning process, but I would think a reasonable run rate is going to be closer to $15 million versus the $25 million. Now, with one caveat, we have not made a decision on what we're doing internationally. I think we've talked on this call that China has a good ERP system. So, at this point, we'll see where we go. It probably is not necessary to put SAP into China. And with that caveat, I would say we think a reasonable run rate would be $15 million. And that kind of covers the amortization, that covers the hosting cost, that covers the service, and those sorts of things. Kevin Richard Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets : Okay, John. Very helpful. Thank you. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Bhupender Bohra from Jefferies. Your line is open. Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC : Hey. Good morning, guys. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Patricia K. Ackerman - Treasurer & Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning. Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC : First question on China here. We have seen like year-to-date now the organic sales growth about like 16%. Could you give us like the second quarter the core water heater sales as well as the water treatment and air purifier? John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Air purifier was not much. It was up probably $1 million, but that's off a very low base because I think that the two big quarters for air purifiers are the fourth quarter and the first quarter. So, it was up. It's doing well. Ajita talked about a new project we've introduced. We'll see how successful it is in the \u2013 that's the first point. It's going to be significant is in the fourth quarter. I would say, in local currency, electric was up. Gas was up more than that. And water treatment was up 30%. Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Do you have numbers for water heater, like electric and gas, on an organic basis? John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Combination, you think, Pat, probably 5%, 6%, 7%? I guess the two combined. Patricia K. Ackerman - Treasurer & Vice President- Investor Relations : Yes. Right. Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC : Okay. So, somewhat in line with the market growth, what you've been - John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I think we're very consistent when we look at our market share. And if you're getting at our first growth situation where we talk about the market growing at 7%, the data we've got in our appliances, of which water heaters are a part of that, grew a little bit more than 7%. And certainly all the share data we see we are maintaining share in electric and gaining share in gas. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And other indicators we look at like residential square footage of residential sales, home sales is up nicely, 20%-plus. There's no direct correlation we see, but we track those numbers because all of those impact what our demand is going to be. Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC : Okay. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Everything we see in China, the move to the consumer-driven economy, retail sales numbers, consumption, all seem in place. And then we've said many times on this call, we're a consumer products company in China. Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And the other question was around North America commercial products, commercial water heaters. Maybe, Ajita, you talked about the shift and we have seen that in the air dryer numbers here from the residential electric to the commercial electric here. How should we think about like from all-in perspective and when does that anniversary, because we're seeing growth rates of like 70% or 60% like month-over-month here at least the last two months, three months here? John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think it anniversaries probably at the end of the quarter. But I should emphasize there's two things that could be happening. One is residential clients could be buying commercial units, but there were also smaller commercial customers who, gas stations, et cetera, that very easily could have been buying residential products and can't now. But you're right, almost all of the growth has been in that 55-gallon to less than 90 gallons and that probably continues through the first quarter of next year. Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Okay. And I believe you guys actually introduced a new product in that particular channel here on the commercial side. I think Pat was talking about it earlier this year. How is that doing from market share perspective, especially on the commercial side? Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. We were late getting into that segment on the commercial side. And we have products in there now. And they're doing well. Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Okay. And lastly on the North America residential here, I've done some channel checks here. Like people, some of the wholesalers have been talking about some good traction in the tankless water heater because of the NAECA III regulation kind of made, as you said, like an 80% changes to your SKUs. So, have you heard anything on that? It's a pretty small category, about 0.5 million in North America. Have you seen some more traction in that category and any thinking about the medium-term growth in that particular category? John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, it's grown 500,000 last year. It will probably be 550,000 or so this year. As we've talked about in the past, it's more new rather than retrofit because it's more expensive. I will also tell you that tankless unit is more expensive than our tank unit. And so, there is some growth in it. We don't expect it to be enormous. We have a product in that category. So we're covered in that category either way. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, either way. So, this year, if you look at the first part of this year, tankless has gained market share faster. I mean, tankless has gained. It's growing faster than the tank types. From our perspective, we are actually gaining market share in the tankless. So, either way, from our perspective, yes, you've got both categories. We are covered in both categories and somewhat indifferent as to which grows faster. Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Okay. And any reason behind why year-to-date it has grown faster than the tank? Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think a lot of it is driven by NAECA III and the fact that you had that significant buy-in last year of the tank type. Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Okay. Got it. That's all I have. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc. Your line is open. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, guys. Just on China, a couple questions. One, can you just talk a little bit more about your investment in commercial water treatment? What you think the opportunity is, growth rates long-term? And then also, Ajita, you mentioned e-commerce growing dramatically. What's driving that market? How big is that business for you? What do you see as the growth rates? John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I'll answer the last one. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Go ahead. Yeah. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : You take the first one. The last year, we sold about $140 million in e-commerce. We're up year-to-date very nicely. Our expectation is we'll be over $180 million this year. I can't say what's driving it as much as obviously the Chinese consumer is very willing to buy online. And all the statistics show that that they're more willing to do that than the U.S. consumer, et cetera. And it's an opportunity for us because we have good distributions. So, when they buy online, we have the capability to install the product, and we're doing that. So, our management team saw this in China, saw this about four years or five years ago and started putting in the infrastructure. And we're doing advertising on the net, et cetera. So, we think we're in very good position with respect to that category. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. And we've added significant amount of people and skill sets in terms of being able to sell our products online, merchandise our products online, do the search engine optimization, so that our products pop up and people do the searches. And interesting statistic, more than 75% of online sales are done through your smartphone, okay, in China. So, that takes another skill set in terms of how you market and merchandise your products on the smartphone because obviously the amount of information you can put on the screen is so much less. But so, we are building all those skill sets and this channel is growing very fast. It's another channel that allows us to reach new customers and especially customers in smaller cities. So, I mean the fast growth is really something that we like and we are leveraging it as quickly as we can. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : The answer to your first question on water treatment, we entered that market \u2013 commercial water treatment, we entered that market this year. It's a little bit different model. It's a lease model and typically it's a five-year type lease. So, unfortunately, you don't get the benefit of the sales upfront. You obviously don't \u2013 you only have one-fifth of cost, but you do have all the SG&A, et cetera, to get in there. So, that's going to be a little bit of a drag, but we think it's a natural extension of - Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Right. And it's an annuity based. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Our capabilities to - Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Once you're in, the lease goes on and so annuity ends. The products will last longer than the amortization. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. So, we think it's just a natural extension of our residential water treatment business. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert McCarthy from Stifel. Your line is open. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Just a couple more in the interest of time. I mean, have you sized, just in terms of annual numbers for 2016 for your water treatment business here, purification business. You've given us some numbers in the past. And then now given the growth rates we've seen, whether you can give us those updated numbers? And then, I have a follow-up on India. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, last year, in our branded business we sold about $110 million. We would expect to be close to 30%, although again, you have currency playing issues there. But we are certainly expecting to be in that $135 million to $140 million range, I would say, for our business for water treatment. And that's after a fair amount of currency drag. You throw in, in Vietnam, we'll sell $3 million or so this year. India we'll probably sell about $3 million this year. And Turkey we'll sell $5 million to $6 million this year. And then, our base legacy business that we bought will sell about $15 million. So, water treatment is starting to get to a reasonable scale, and we think there's potential in that area. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Air purification is still, what, $10 million to $15 million, what are we talking about? John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, air purification last year was $10 million and we said that we expect it to double this year. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, $20 million-ish. And then just in terms of \u2013 you did cite the losses in India. Could you speak to them? And is there any kind of gut check there around the level of investment, the market, et cetera, or maybe you can just give us some metrics around the growth opportunity there, an update? Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think that our comps have been a little higher because we are expanding into more cities in water treatment. And that's costing us more. And also one of the things that's happened in India is that it's been a very, very hot summer. And so the water heater sales volume \u2013 the whole market is lower than we anticipated when we went into the year. So, it's a combination of those two that \u2013 where our expenses have been a little higher than we anticipated. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We have put in a new management team. And I think we're impressed internally in the last six months or a year. And there's certainly a marketing focus. And we're making the investment in the water treatment because as we talked about it in the past we think it's a larger category than water heater. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And can you size what you think the revenues will be this year and what the loss will be or have you probably - John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. I think we've said that last year revenues were about $15 million to $16 million. This year, it will be about $20 million. And we said last year we lost $9 million. And we'll probably lose a little bit more than that this year. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So, there's no major change to those assumptions? Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. Nothing from what we've said earlier in the year. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Well, we're up against the hour. We'll leave it there. John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good. Thank you. Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Patricia Ackerman for closing remarks. Patricia K. Ackerman - Treasurer & Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, all, for joining us today.

Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the A. O. Smith Corporation Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this may call be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Patricia Ackerman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. You may begin, ma'am. Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.: Thank you, Rania. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on our 2016 third quarter results conference call. With me participating in the call are Ajita Rajendra, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Kita, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin with Ajita's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning's press release. Also, in respect of others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. I will now turn the call over to Ajita, who will begin his remarks on slide 3. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Thank you, Pat, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. The third quarter of 2016 was another excellent quarter for A. O. Smith, setting a record for sales. We continue to see healthy end markets for our consumer products in China and commercial water heaters in the U.S. Here are a few highlights. Sales grew 9% to a record $684 million. Excluding the impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar against the Chinese and Canadian currencies, our sales grew 11% in the third quarter. China sales were up 17% in local currency. Third quarter net earnings of $0.47 per share were 15% higher than our earnings per share during the same period last year. We are delighted to welcome the Aquasana team to the A. O. Smith family through our acquisition of the US Water Treatment Company in early August. Aquasana fits squarely in our acquisition strategy to grow our core and expand into new geography. In this case, we are expanding our Asia-based reverse osmosis water treatment platform into the U.S. We are also excited about the opportunities Aquasana's carbon-based products bring us to cross-sell water treatment products in China. We continue to review our capital allocation and dedicate a portion to return to shareholders. During the first three months of the year, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares for $100 million. We increased that dividend by 26% six months ago. We also announced a 2-for-1 stock split, which became effective on October 6. John will now describe our results in more details, beginning with slide number 4. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Thank you, Ajita. Sales for the third quarter of $684 million were 9% higher than the previous year. Net earnings of $83 million improved 13% from 2015. Earnings per share of $0.47 improved 15% over last year. Sales in our North America segment of $451 million increased 8% compared with the third quarter of 2015. Increase in sales was primarily due to higher volumes of residential and commercial water heaters in the U.S. The purchase of Aquasana in August added $6.2 million to our North America segment sales. Rest of World segment sales of $240 million increased 11% compared with 2015. China sales increased 17% in local currency, driven by higher demand for our water heaters and water treatment products. On slide 6, North America operating earnings of $101 million were 11% higher than segment operating earnings in the previous year. An operating margin of 22.3% was higher than the 21.7% operating margin one year ago. Higher volumes in the U.S. were the primary driver of the improved North America segment financial performance. Rest of World operating earnings of $31 million improved 14% compared with 2015. Higher China sales were partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses in China. Segment operating earnings were negatively impacted by approximately $2 million due to currency translation, higher selling costs in China to support expansion in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities and higher advertising costs to promote our products in China during the Summer Olympic Games and the European Football Championship were the primary drivers of higher segment SG&A expenses. Third quarter segment operating margin of 12.9% was slightly higher than one year ago primarily due to smaller losses in India. Our corporate expenses were higher in the third quarter compared with the year-ago period primarily due to $1.2 million of Aquasana acquisition-related costs and higher expenses at our corporate technology center. Our effective income tax rate in the third quarter of 2016 was 29.8% which is lower than the 31.3% experienced during the third quarter last year and similar to our 2016 guidance. Cash provided by operations during the first nine months of 2016 was $264 million compared with $237 million during the same period last year. Higher earnings in 2016 were partially offset by higher outlays for working capital in the 2016 period. Our liquidity position and balance sheet remain strong. Our debt to capital ratio was 18% at the end of the third quarter. We have cash balances totaling nearly $680 million located offshore, and our net cash position was approximately $343 million at the end of September. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Aquasana, as we previously discussed. Primarily, as a result of continued strong cash flow and escalating PBGC (sic) [PBCG] premiums, we made a voluntary contribution to our pension plan of $30 million in the third quarter. The after-tax impact to our cash flow is approximately $18.5 million. During the first nine months of the year, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of common stock for a total of $100 million. We completed a 2-for-1 stock split in early October 2016. Adjusting for the split, approximately 2.6 million shares remained on our existing repurchase authority at the end of the third quarter. This morning, we announced an increase to the midpoint of our 2016 EPS guidance in a range of between $1.81 and $1.83 per share. The midpoint of our EPS guidance represents a 15% increase in EPS compared with our 2015 results. Please turn to slide 9 for several 2016 assumptions. We expect our cash flow from operations in 2016 to be approximately $325 million, which is lower than the $344 million generated in 2015. We expect higher earnings will be more than offset by higher outlays for working capital this year compared with 2015 and the voluntary $30 million pension contribution made earlier this year. Due to the strong growth of our water treatment business in China, we will reach the capacity of our existing leach facility in the next few years. Our 2016 capital spending plans of $95 million to $100 million for the total year include approximately $20 million related to construction of a new water treatment manufacturing and air purification assembly facilities in China. Total cost for the facility, which is expected to be completed in early 2018, will be approximately $65 million. In addition, we completed capacity expansion at two North America plants in 2016 at a cost of approximately $7 million. Our 2016 capital spending plan also includes approximately $10 million to support the ERP implementation. Our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $66 million in 2016. Expenses related to our ERP implementation were about $16 million in 2015 and are projected to be approximately $25 million in 2016, higher than the previous year due to the larger number of scheduled go-live events in 2016. We recognized expenses of approximately $15 million during the first nine months of 2016, and we expect approximately $7 million of incremental expenses in the fourth quarter compared with the prior year. This, in combination with a significantly lower cash rate in 2015, will result in fourth quarter 2016 earnings per share being approximately flat compared with the prior year. We started the final phase of our ERP system implementation on October 1, which consists of three major manufacturing sites. We expect to conclude our implementation efforts at a few of our small factories next year. At this time, we do not expect to implement the system at our foreign operations. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $46 million in 2016, higher than the $43 million in 2015 primarily due to higher expenses at our corporate technology center and acquisition-related costs. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 29.7% in 2016, similar to 2015. We expect to repurchase shares in the amount of approximately 235 million in 2016. As a result, we expect our average diluted outstanding shares for the year will be approximately 176.8 million shares. I will now turn the call back to Ajita, who will summarize our guidance, the business assumptions for the remainder of 2016 and our growth strategy, beginning on slide 10. Ajita? Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Thank you, John. We expect our businesses will collectively grow approximately 8% to 8.25% in local currency and approximately 6% to 6.25% in U.S. dollars in 2016. The assumptions for currency underlying our organic growth forecast are at current rate, with the exception of continued depreciation in the China currency rate to average RMB 6.8 per dollar in the fourth quarter. Specific to our North America segment, we will experience the full impact of higher steel costs in the fourth quarter due to the timing of steel cost realization in our P&L. We expect slower growth in our Lochinvar-branded sales than we've originally projected. Our Lochinvar-branded products have historically grown as a result of the transition from lower-efficiency boilers to higher-efficiency boilers, new product introduction and market share gain. In 2016, we expect our condensing boiler business to grow at 10%, which will be essentially offset by a decline in water heater and non-condensing boiler volume, resulting in minimal growth this year. These factors, in addition to the assumptions John discussed earlier, lead to our expectation that our North America segment operating margin will be between 21.75% and 22% in 2016. This implies North America margins will be down sequentially in the fourth quarter as a result of several unusual events. First, the incremental ERP spend will impact margins negatively by over 100 basis points. Second, we expect lower commercial volumes in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter as we encourage our distribution partners to hold more inventory in advance of our October 1 SAP implementation, which included our commercial water heater plants. And, third, we will experience the full impact from higher steel costs in the fourth quarter. Specific to our Rest of World segment, we are a consumer products company in China, which distinguishes us from most industrial companies operating in China. In local currency, our sales in China have grown by 18% in 2014, 16% in 2015 and 17% in the first nine months of this year despite the softer China economy. We have various growth drivers underpinning our China business, which give us confidence to project an annual growth rate of over 15% in local currency for 2016. These drivers include overall water heater market growth, driven by household formation and an emerging replacement market, geographic expansion, market share gain, growth in water treatment and air purification product and improved product mix. The Rest of World segment operating margin in 2016 will be slightly higher than 13%. I'm moving now on to slide number 11. We have refined our growth model to reflect the growth in our China business, which is now 32% of sales. Additionally, we modified our Lochinvar brand growth rate. During our ownership, our Lochinvar-branded condensing boilers have grown at a double-digit pace, driven by the continued transition to higher-efficiency boilers, market share gains and new product introduction. We think this is a reasonable assumption going forward. Assuming 4% growth for Lochinvar-branded water heater sales, our projected growth rate for total Lochinvar-branded sales is 8%. Our refined total company organic growth model continues to assume 8% growth for the foreseeable future. Especially in these volatile and uncertain economic times, we believe our organic growth potential and our stable defensive replacement market, which we believe represent approximately 85% of North America water heater and boiler volumes, positively differentiates A. O. Smith among other industrial companies. Coupled with growth and stability, we have a strong balance sheet poised to take advantage of strategic acquisitions that add shareholder value as well as allow us to return cash to shareholders. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, we are available for your questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Good morning. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Just wondering if we could \u2013 on the third quarter margin, it looks like steel impacted less in the third quarter than it will in the fourth quarter. Could you give us \u2013 I know you said, John, and certainly in the text you said it was volumes. Was there anything else impacting the North American margin in the quarter? Was there an increment there from Aquasana that helped? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: No, Aquasana has very little impact in the quarter. In fact, it had a negative of about $700,000 or $800,000, but that's in corporate expense because those were the expenses we talked about regarding the acquisition related. So, no, it was primarily the residential and commercial volumes that dropped to the bottom line, if you will. We did have higher steel costs that was partially offset by steel \u2013 but price \u2013 partially offset by price, et cetera. But that's kind of the magnitude of it. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got you. Two other questions. Does the one's weakness \u2013 like, if we sort of use the year-end \u2013 the quarter-end rate, does that go from sort of $0.01 to $0.02 in the fourth quarter and then stay there? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: I'm not sure of your question, if you used the fourth quarter EPS or the fourth quarter operating margin or what. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): So, from your press release, you indicated there was about a $2 million segment income hit, which translates to just a little bit below $0.01. And just \u2013 I was just wondering if that's an average for the quarter rate. So, based on the end of the quarter 3Q rate, does that \u2013 is that now $0.02 going forward? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Two million currency (18:25) rate you're talking about? Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah... John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah \u2013 no, I think, in the fourth quarter, it will be similar to maybe a little bit higher because we're using a 6.8 rate. So, it'll be slightly higher than $0.01. But, yeah, a little bit higher than a penny. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Last question. In the last couple of conference calls, you guys have said that you're looking at more deals this year than you have in some time, both from a change in some of your external resources but also from internal resources. Could you give us an idea of, kind of, what the pipeline looks like? I know good. But is this something that we can expect six months \u2013 some type of monetization. I know Aquasana is done. I get that. But just kind of looking for more \u2013 size-wise, just some type of thumbnail sketch on what you think maybe the next six months looks like. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Scott, this is Ajita. The pipeline is active as it has been. But for obvious reasons, I can't comment on something that could happen in the future vis-\u00e0-vis acquisitions. We're active. The pipeline is interesting, and that's about all I can say at this time. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): All right. Let me ask the question in different way. Are you looking at a lot of Aquasana-sized acquisitions? Are you looking at some larger deals? And regionally, could you give us an idea of where you're more active, U.S. or... Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: There's a wide range of deals. There are little ones and there are larger ones. And that's been \u2013 that's about what it's been in the past. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: And in all geography. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): In all geography... Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Around the world. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got you. Okay. Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Alvaro Lacayo from Gabelli & Company. Your line is now open. Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company: Good morning. I guess, I just wanted some commentary about your expectations for both the residential and commercial water heater shipments and how they've changed and if Q3 had any sort of unique choppiness to it, and then how all that sort of translates to the updated Lochinvar guidance with respect to the water heater piece and the non-condensing piece? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Well, I'll take a shot at it, Ajita, and then you can \u2013 I would say that the residential buy-ins we saw in July, which is public, where the industry was up 9% or so, and as we looked at August and September, we think it was up more than that. So, I think we're tracking pretty well to where we thought. I would tell you, on the last call, we said 8%, 9% for the year. We would probably say 8.8% to 8.9% now. So, we're tracking pretty well where we thought. And on the commercial side, same sort of thing. I think we talked about a 2.25% to 2.30% (21:37) level. We saw the second quarter up 30%, which we know is being driven by that 55 to 90 gallon electric. We saw July up about 28% so it's kind of tracking at that level, so I don't think any surprises. Now, to answer your question on Lochinvar, it's really two things. They had a very strong residential market last year, and that's come back to bite us this year. They're going to be down probably 15%. And the non-condensing, which quite frankly we think is probably a shrinking market because of the move to condensing, has got quite competitive and will be down kind of 15% to 20% in that part of the market. Now, it's a relatively small part. It's just over 5%, but it hurts the growth rate. The way we're going to remedy that is we're coming out with some new non-condensing products late this year that we think will help us in that category, as well as other products that \u2013 two other categories that Lochinvar has coming out at the end of the year. So, they are having a difficult year from a growth standpoint. Their margins and margin dollars are growing, so that's very positive. And we think, with the new product introductions that are going to happen next year as well as some help from some of their key verticals, their education has been weak and their multifamily \u2013 that category \u2013 those categories have been kind of flat. We would hope they would grow a little bit. So, going forward, we're comfortable with that 8%. We've modified it a little bit to really just reflect the growth that we've seen historically and kind of modeled that going forward. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. Just to clarify, when John talked about the verticals, he was talking about the full market verticals have been tapped \u2013 those verticals that have been tapped. The only thing that I would add from a Lochinvar perspective is to just reinforce that the condensing boiler part is still growing double-digit, which is what we expect. And the other is that, in going back to residential water heaters, from what we are hearing anecdotally from our distributors, the inventories in the channel seem to be in good shape. And again, I want to remind you. We don't have real good information about that, but we do get anecdotal feedback that is usually pretty good. And the inventories seem to be in reasonable shape. Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company: Yeah. I mean, it seems like a lot of the moving pieces are related to sort of these one-time items and things that happened last year. So, I was surprised to see sort of a long-term growth rate come down versus just \u2013 maybe just the Q3 and Q4. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: You mean with Lochinvar? Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company: Yeah, correct. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. What happened with Lochinvar last year, and we talked about that at length, is China hurt them because they were down significantly in China last year, as well as the Canadian market last year hurt them. So, again, we just kind of relooked at where they are this year, the new product introductions. Historically, when we've owned them, the condensing has grown 10% and we think we are very much in a position to grow it at 10% going forward, and that's about 60% of the business. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: And the water heater part is \u2013 our guidance really gets in line with the rest of our North American water heater business at around 4%. Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company: Got it. Okay. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: So, it's just a logical shifting. Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company: Okay. And then, it will... Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: When you look at our total portfolio, it's still at the 8% type of growth rate that we've been talking about. Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company: Okay. And then, I guess, with regards to the Aquasana acquisition, maybe if you could just go over some of the synergies and how you'll be able to leverage the platform that you built out in China to support Aquasana in the U.S. and vice versa. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. What we've said is it's a very complementary acquisition. So, we are very, very strong in China in the reverse osmosis market. We do not have much in the way of carbon product. In the U.S., Aquasana is very strong in the carbon-related product. They have some RO but it's minimal. So, we think there is truly some sales cross-selling opportunities. One of their important products is a whole-house filter, and that is installed by plumbers. We think we have some potential capability there to expand that. So, much of the opportunities are revenue synergies that we're very comfortable that we can end up getting. And then, on top of that, they have direct marketing capability that we think in the long run will be beneficial to us. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: I think, just to add to that, from an acquisition and integration perspective, it's just about two months under the belt and things are on track, no surprises. And things are as we expected. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. What I didn't say is it obviously gets us into the North American market, which is a... Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: For water treatment. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah, for water treatment, which is a large market. Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville from Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is now open. Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Thanks. Good morning. I think, Ajita, it was in your closing remarks. You made a comment that you were encouraging some of your distributors to, sort of, I guess, for lack of a better term, pre buy, stock up, buy more than would normally be necessary ahead of I believe you've said an SAP implementation. Can you talk a little bit more about that, if that event has already transpired, how sort of that progressed, how the systems are functioning and, I guess, how much pull-forward, if you will, was there in the Q3, if I understood your comments correctly? Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Sure. We had three major factories and a distribution center go on live on SAP. And that's a fairly large portfolio of factories going live at the same time. The date was October 1. It was the go-live date, and all these things are in fairly long transition. Things are on track. I wouldn't say it's completely error free. When someone is doing an SAP transition and they say it's error free, I don't know how to say this nicely, but there's probably more behind the curtain, okay? But things are on track. They are where we expect. The teams are \u2013 when issues come up, we've been addressing them very quickly. And so far, the customer is not being impacted any more than we expected and we encouraged some of our customers to buy ahead just because it's a prudent thing to do, and we've done that with every one of our other SAP implementations with other factories. And there was some amount of buy-in, I don't have an exact number, in commercial. In residential, there was hardly any. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah, that's what we would have concluded from the numbers. In commercial, there was some buy-in, but very little on the residential side. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. But the gist of your question, in terms of how the transition is going and things like that, it's on track. Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Got it. And then, just as a follow-up, with respect to China, what's your expectation for the full year for water treatment and air purification revenue? And then, just moving over to India. Can you talk about at what point \u2013 if you have a vision to break even, when you think that business starts to break even? Thank you. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: I'll start. Water treatment had a very, very strong quarter. In the third quarter, it was up over 40%. Year-to-date, it's up, approaching 40% in local currency terms, so above 30% in U.S. dollars, and we expect \u2013 that's what we expect for the year. So, the water treatment business is doing very, very well. Air purification is on track. I think, at the beginning of the year, we said that we would be double sales from about $10 million to $20 million. We're on track to do that. We think we could be a little bit higher than that. So, I'd say both those businesses are doing as good or better than what we expected. With respect to India, you really got to break it into two categories. We have a water heater business there, which, I think we've said publicly, its sales are about $15 million to $16 million now. Let's say, this year, if we need to break even, at probably $30 million to $35 million to get that to break even. What we need is we need some help from the economy growth in housing, which hasn't taken place in the last two years. And then, we have a water treatment business which we've said is in its infancy. And this year will result in a (30:53) couple million dollars of it. We're in about six cities, and that's going to take \u2013 we haven't really done the break-even analysis yet on that business. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. Just to add a little bit of color to both those. In terms of India, the economy is doing well in many sectors, but not in housing and that's what impacts us. So, it's disappointing from that perspective, but we continue to add distribution and gain market share, which has been our game plan. In China, as we look at the growth that we've seen in water treatment and air purification, the really exciting part of this is the fact that, in China, what we have is very strong consumer brand and very strong distribution. And about four years ago or five years ago, we said \u2013 we looked at how do we translate that brand into new categories beyond water heating. And obviously, we've been very successful as we move into water treatment, and we think it's a little too early to spike the ball. But we've been on track or ahead when it comes to air purification. And that just tells us and gives us the confidence that there are a number of other categories and segments that we can get into, new segments where we can leverage our brand and our distribution to continue this type of growth in China. So \u2013 and when it comes to India, it's the same type of game plan. It's going much slower. But building the brand, building distribution and then saying how do we expand in terms of our categories to be able to access those hundreds of millions of people getting into the middle class. Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Got it. Thank you, guys. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Bhupender Bohra from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Good morning, guys. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC : Hi. So, just a broad question here. When I look at A. O. Smith, like, if you look at the gross margins over the last five years, you have done an excellent job. It used to be a 30% gross margin business. We are inching or have been consistently above, like, 40% over the last four quarters, five quarters here since the second quarter last year. How should we think about \u2013 I mean, this is kind of a light manufacturing company. How should we think about going forward over the next two years? And in the previous call, John had mentioned about \u2013 think about North America margins starting point to be like 21.5% to 22%. Can you comment on that going forward? Like, should we think about A. O. Smith has to be kind of a 40%-plus gross margin business with North America to be around that 20%-plus EBIT margin? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Well, yes. We're running about 40%, and we've kind of said that, historically, there's three businesses above that, our commercial, our Lochinvar, and our China. And our residential is below that. So, we certainly think those margin \u2013 those gross margin levels are sustainable going forward. You can have some volatility depending on steel pricing, et cetera. But we certainly think that's a realistic starting point. I was asked on the last call regarding margins. And I guess, my comment was we have not done the plan yet. We're in the process of doing it right now. But I certainly think that 21.5% to 22% is a good starting point. Now, we've got to incorporate things like Aquasana into that plan, which has a little lower margin. But we certainly think that's a realistic starting point. And now, it's our objective to obviously continue to grow margins. We've said that once we get SAP in, the objective is to optimize it next year. But certainly, we need to start getting some benefit from SAP as we look into the 2018 period, et cetera. Also, we think our spend on SAP next year is less that hits the expense. We don't have that finalized. It's probably $5 million to $10 million less, so we have some positive things helping us with margins, et cetera. And certainly, it's our objective to continue to grow margins. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: And also, just to add a little bit, Bhupender, we \u2013 when you look at \u2013 we have capacity. Most challenged margin business, as John mentioned, is our residential water heater business. And as you know, we have a deficit in housing that's not going to come back real fast, but it will come back. And our incremental margins in our residential segment are in the 30% type of level. So, there is leverage opportunity also as the volume grows. And this \u2013 at this stage, again, John mentioned SAP and our ERP system cost. But we also have a number of businesses where we are in the investment stage, probably more so as a portfolio than we would on a longer term basis. And \u2013 but all of those are investments for growth. So, as those markets get traction and continue to grow, there's certainly leverage opportunities in every one of those \u2013 the segments that we talk about. Lochinvar, we've consistently increased our margin. North America we've talked about. And China, because it's a consumer business, it'll be a little slower. But the opportunity to leverage is certainly there. Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot. Just a second question on price increases. I know, Ajita, you had mentioned that price increases went pretty well. Can you give us what would be the impact \u2013 or have they been realized, like, most of it or are we going to see that realization happen in the fourth quarter on both, like, residential? And was it also applied towards commercial? Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: We had a price increase effective August 1, and we are comfortable with what our guidance is in terms of how the pricing is impacting us. In terms of the marketplace and competitively and things like that, again, for obvious reasons, I'm just not going to comment on what's happening from a competitive perspective. But we are comfortable with the guidance that we have and the pricing that's built in there. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: And I think we said in the last call that it ranged from 5 to 8 (37:40) and to answer your question \u2013 apply to residential and commercial. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: That's right. I missed that. It did apply to both. Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Got it. Thank you so much. Operator : And our next question comes from David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Your line is now open. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Yes. Good morning. Just a few quick questions here. You've taken your cash flow from operations guidance down from $340 million to $325 million. Was that just the greater working capital that you referenced in your remarks? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: It was primarily the pension contribution. We decided, in August, to make a pension \u2013 voluntary pension contribution, and that was the primary reason. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: About $30 million. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. So, $30 million, $20 million or so, after tax. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah, after tax... David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Got it. Thanks. And then, secondly, when you were talking about your North American margins and the fact that you expect them to be down sequentially in 4Q, you talked about the ERP being negative or greater than 100 bps. You talked about the reduced commercial volumes. And then, you talked about higher steel prices. Is there any chance you could quantify for us just what you're expecting in the way of cost inflation pressure on North American margins there? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. We really haven't disclosed that. But we \u2013 I think we said on the last call that, sequentially, steel prices were going to go up because we have a delay, if you will, on what the impact is. And I can tell you the fourth quarter will be the largest hit compared to third quarter. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : 4Q will be the largest? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah, fourth \u2013 Q4 will be the largest. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : And then, have you \u2013 yeah, I realize you're not going to provide a lot of detail on this at this point. But can you say whether you've settled on your 2017 steel agreements yet, or is that still in negotiation? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Those are still in negotiation, I believe. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Thanks \u2013 great. And then, the last question is just on China. And I'm wondering if you can talk about any change in your share in the tier 1 markets and the extent to which you're seeing certain local brands trying to reposition to play more in the higher price points? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Well, I'll take it, Scott. (39:34) You were just there. So, you can probably say. I don't think we've seen, I mean, the data we looked at where units sold over $400 were still maintaining our share there. I think there's \u2013 it's certainly very competitive in the lower end, and I'll say the middle tier. But I think we still have very, very large market share on the high end. And we haven't really seen any change in that. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: No \u2013 and John is right. I was there last week in both Vietnam and in China and the teams are excited and very upbeat about next year and where we're headed, the new products that are coming out. And so, we feel pretty good about what \u2013 our guidance for China. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Hammond from KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Hi, Jeff. Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey. So, I just wanted to come back to price and the margin. So, your fourth quarter guidance, does that reflect that you're getting those price increases you put through? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah, I think it assumes the price increases we talked about. Now, a couple of things. We also said on the last call that, because of some project work, et cetera, you don't necessarily get all the pricing at that time, and we said some of that would carry over into the first quarter, if you will. But, yeah, for the most part, that does assume that. The biggest impact, as we talked about earlier, is SAP is going to add $5 million to $6 million in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter and $7 million compared to the prior year. So, that's certainly having an effect on fourth quarter margins that we don't think, going forward, will have that impact. And then, the stronger commercial, which was unusual for the third quarter, has \u2013 strong commercial is what it did. But again, that was due to the pre-buy. Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Because your implied margin is, kind of, right around 20% or sub-20% for the fourth quarter versus 23% in the first 3 quarters. So, it seems like, I guess, as you look into 2017, I guess, SAP costs roll off and the commercial issue goes away, but the steel dynamic stays with us? Is that the way to think about the moving pieces? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Well, yeah. That's one way to look at it. But I guess, if you talk about a 20% as your starting point and you adjust for SAP, you're over 21%. And then, you adjust for a kind of a leveling off of that \u2013 of commercial, you kind of get back to that starting point range that I talked about earlier, that 21.5% to 22%. Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay... John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: I mean, clearly, steel is having impact on the margins, without a doubt. We did have a price increase, but we didn't necessarily cover margin with that. Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then, the \u2013 in the \u2013 so, you mentioned the res industry numbers. How did your growth line up with that in the third quarter? And then, along those lines, I think you had a product hole in the \u2013 in that kind of small commercial category. How are you performing there as you've kind of filled that product hole? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: I think that the quarterly market share was pretty similar, up a little bit from the previous quarter. So, again, we're forecasting what the industry is going to be. So, residential is holding pretty well for us. We did introduce that product in the 55 to 90 (43:14). We have gained some share in that. Well, I'll also tell you, we're not back to where our overall commercial margin \u2013 I mean, market shares, but we have made progress on that. Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors from Boenning & Scattergood. Your line is now open. Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thank you. I wanted to discuss a little bit of Aquasana and, specifically, the recent news in, I guess, Milwaukee that the company is in talks with the city about rolling that product out in certain homes where there are lead service lines remaining in operation. Recognizing that you can't necessarily disclose too much on that specific deal but \u2013 other than what's in the press. But obviously, that issue is not unique to Milwaukee and there's a lot more attention to this lead issue post Flint, Michigan. So, my question is, how significant a growth opportunity do you think that is for Aquasana, that type of sell-in through a partnership with a municipality? And is that a transformational opportunity for Aquasana, or is that just incremental. And then, also, was that a specific element of the rationale for that acquisition? Or is that something that you're just sort of learning now more about as you get involved with the business? Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: I'll try to answer all of those. The specific issue in Milwaukee was not a driver for the acquisition. But clearly, the fact that there are lead issues around the country like Flint and many other cities was clearly an indicator for us, among a lot of other things that there is a water treatment opportunity in the U.S. And we have world-leading products that take care of all of these types of pollutants, especially world-leading reverse osmosis products. So, we clearly see the opportunity to bring that technology to the U.S. Aquasana was a great acquisition and a vehicle to get those products into consumers' hands and using the channel that we really don't have a lot of expertise in, which we expect to grow in the future, obviously, in terms of digital reach into every home. The specific instance in Milwaukee, we are working with the local government and the United Way and other agencies, especially since we live here, to get the product out and help as much as possible. That's not going to be necessarily transformational for Aquasana, but it really has a terrific impact in promoting the name and getting the name out there as being a leader in the solutions for some of the problems that we have in many of our cities. So, long term, that's absolutely going to help. Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc. (Broker): Yeah. And I guess, just following up on the topic. I mean, I guess, one of the things that really jumped out at me reading what the city had said was that it was going to cost them something like $800 million, if they wanted to replace all these service lines. But yet, they could buy every single affected home \u2013 the city could buy each home a water filter and it would cost less than $10 million. So, the \u2013 to the extent those are the two options for dealing with this issue, it seems like a no-brainer. Is there a model here where the cities actually get involved via some kind of a rebate or something like that and actually fund some of this? Or do you still think most of the sales will be funded by the homeowner? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: I think it's going to be a combination. I think cities will get involved and fund some of this. It's hard to tell. But the city of Milwaukee is getting involved. And again, I think that the big opportunity is not only getting the product out there, but getting a brand name out there in terms of being a leader in this category. Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc. (Broker): Got it. And then, just one final question on that. So, following up on the acquisition discussion earlier, do you feel that, with Aquasana, you've now got the platform you need in water treatment in the U.S.? Or do you feel like there could be a further roll-up on your part that you would still be interested in adding to that platform via acquisition? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Aquasana is a start. We would certainly be interested in appropriately adding to that platform. And that's an ongoing, and that's clearly on strategy, the way we've described our strategy. Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc. (Broker): Got it. Well, that's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Charlie Brady from SunTrust Robinson. Your line is now open. Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Wanted to just drill down on the Rest of World op margin assumptions. So, you're saying it's over 13% \u2013 slightly over 13% for the year. It implies a pretty strong Q4, call it, 13.5%. Is that a function of just some of the promo advertising spending dropping off from the level it was in Q3? And I know you're not giving 2017 guidance. But would you expect that number flat with where you are in 2016? Or do you see it ramping up again? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Well, I think it's a combination of two things. Traditionally, our fourth quarter in China is our strongest quarter from a sales standpoint. We think that will continue. And, yes, I would think that our advertising as a percent of sales will probably be a lower percentage than what it was in the third quarter because of those two events we talked about. So, I think both of those help, in effect, get the margin \u2013 I mean, a relatively strong margin in the fourth quarter. We have not talked about or \u2013 where our planning phase. Ajita and I have talked at length. Certainly, it's our objective to grow North \u2013 Rest of World margins, and you do that with a combination of things. You leverage the advertising spend and the SG&A in China. Number two, you turn a couple of the businesses that right now we're incubating like air purification. That's going to lose probably $5 million this year. We'll move that towards breakeven as we get higher sales level. We're also incubating the commercial water treatment business where we'll lose $3 million or $4 million this year. So, I think those are ways to grow margin. And then, we talked about we need to get India on a path of improved earnings. So, we haven't come out with an estimate. But certainly, those are some of the things we're looking at. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: And also, just to add to that, when we talk about these incubating businesses in China like air purification and commercial water treatment, et cetera, it \u2013 we usually have what I call a can-see plan, which is a multi-year plan, that says here's how we are going to get \u2013 here are the specific projects and here's how we're going to get our growth margins to the level that \u2013 then, we need for it to start contributing to the bottom line. So, it isn't \u2013 it's more than we hope it will get there. There's very specific things we know we have to do and executing to get those margins up there just like we did in water purification. Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah. That's helpful. Thanks. And just on the Chinese water heater market, I know it's tough to regauge this. But can you talk a little about what you're seeing in terms of the replacement market there. We're getting to the lifetime expectancy of some of these water heaters and kind of what that might add to growth going forward. Are you seeing much of it today? Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: We are \u2013 I'll take a shot. Then, John, you can jump in \u2013 from \u2013 again, there isn't any real good data, but they have reasonable data in terms of our own warranty cards and things being returned, so where people tell us where we ask the question as to the need for replacement or not. And in the largest cities, we think the replacement is around 50% and, in the smaller cities, probably 30% to 35%. That's the kind of range that we are seeing from the somewhat limited dataset that we have. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: (51:49) about comfort level from the standpoint, Charlie, that when we talk about the market \u2013 the water heater market growing at 7%, we think that's going to contribute to that. Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Right. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: And also, what we also see is that the \u2013 since the A. O. Smith is at the kind of the top of the food chain as a high-end brand, it's an aspirational brand. So, when people replace lower-end products, very often, they upgrade to the higher-end brands which is our brand. Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. Operator : And we do have a follow-up from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Your line is now open. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Yeah. Thanks for taking the follow-up. Just quickly, the 17% organic growth in China, how much of that was from expanded distribution versus kind of same-store sales? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: We did expand our distribution, but I really \u2013 we don't have a good way of really measuring that. We've tried to do same-store sales, but we've had difficulty because we're continually opening stores and we're continually closing stores that are inefficient, et cetera. I would tell you, the majority of it is the growth in the market and that certainly has been a contributor. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to management for any further remarks. Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.: Thank you for joining us today. Please take note that we will participate in several conferences during the fourth quarter. Goldman Sachs in Boston on November 2, Baird in Chicago on November 8, and Northcoast in New York City on November 10. Have a wonderful day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, the Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Patricia Ackerman. You may begin. Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.: Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on our 2016 results conference call. With me participating in the call are Ajita Rajendra, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Kita, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin with Ajita's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning's press release. Also, as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. I will now turn the call over to Ajita who will begin his remarks on slide three. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Thank you, Pat, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. 2016 was another excellent year for A. O. Smith, setting records for sales and earnings. We continue to see healthy end markets for our consumer products in China and for boilers and commercial water heaters in the U.S. Here are a few highlights. Sales grew 6% to a record of $2.7 billion. Excluding the impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar against the Chinese currency, our sales grew 8% in 2016. China sales are up 19% in local currency. Among several revenue growth drivers, A. O. Smith branded water treatment sales grew over 40% in local currency. Our e-commerce sales in China reached nearly $200 million. Net earnings of $1.85 per share was 17% higher than our earnings per share in 2015. We welcomed the Aquasana team to A. O. Smith through our acquisition of the U.S.-based water treatment company in early August. A. O. Smith global sales of water treatment product totaled $194 million in 2016. We continue to review our capital allocation and dedicate a portion of our cash to return to shareholders. During 2016, we repurchased approximately 3.3 million shares for $135 million. We announced a 17% increase to our dividend last month. The five-year compound annual growth rate of our dividend is over 25%. We announced a 2-for-1 stock split which became effective on October 6. John will now describe our results in more detail, beginning with slide number four. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Thank you, Ajita. Sales for the year of nearly $2.7 billion were 6% higher than the previous year and 8% higher in local currency terms. Net earnings of $326.5 million improved 15% from 2015. Earnings per share of $1.85 improved 17% over last year. Sales in our North America segment of $1.74 billion increased 2% compared with 2015. The segment benefited from a full year pricing related to the U.S. regulatory change in April of 2015 as well as a price increase related to steel and other cost inflation in August 2016. Higher volumes of boilers and commercial water heaters in the U.S. also contributed to higher sales. Lower volumes of U.S. residential water heaters partially offset these benefits. The purchase of Aquasana in August added $18.4 million to our North America segment sales. Rest of world segment sales of $966 million increased 11% compared with 2015. China sales increased 19% in local currency, driven by higher demand for water heaters, water treatment and residential air purification products. A. O. Smith branded water treatment sales in China totaled nearly $148 million in 2016, compared with $110 million in 2015. Sales of in-home air purification systems almost tripled to $26 million in 2016 compared with $9 million in 2015. On slide six, North America operating earnings of $386 million were 14% higher than segment operating earnings in the previous year. And operating margin of 22% was 200 basis points higher than the 20% operating margin one year ago. Pricing actions, lower material costs in the first half of the year and higher boiler and commercial volumes in the U.S. were partially offset by lower residential water heater volumes in the U.S. These factors were the primary drivers of the improved North America segment financial performance. Rest of world operating earnings of $129 million improved 14% compared with 2015. Higher China sales were partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses in China. Segment operating earnings were negatively impacted by almost $8 million due to China currency translation. Higher selling cost in China to support expansion in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities and higher advertising costs to support brand building were the primary drivers of higher segment SG&A expenses. Segment operating margin of 13.4% was higher than one year ago. Our corporate expenses were higher in 2016 compared with the year ago period, primarily due to $1.2 million of Aquasana acquisition related costs and higher expenses at our corporate technology center. Our effective income tax rate in 2016 was 29.4% which was slightly lower than the rate of 29.7% recorded in 2015. Sales for the fourth quarter of $698 million were 9% higher than the previous year. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of $83 million increased 4% from 2015. Fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.47 increased $0.02 compared with 2015. Sales in our North America segment of $436 million increased 5% compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase in sales was primarily due to higher volumes of commercial water heaters and boilers in the U.S. and pricing actions in August 2016 related to significant steel cost increases and inflationary pressure on other costs. Lower U.S. residential volumes partially offset these factors. Aquasana added $12.2 million to our North America segment sales. Rest of world segment sales of $268 million increased 15% compared with 2015. China sales increased 24% in local currency, driven by higher demand for our consumer products in the region, led by water treatment and air purification products. On slide nine, North America operating earnings of $89 million were 3% lower than segment operating earnings in the year ago quarter. And as expected, operating margin of 20.5% was lower than the 22.3% operating margin one year ago. The favorable impact from the pricing action in the U.S. and improved profitability of Lochinvar branded products were more than offset by higher material costs and over $6 million of incremental ERP implementation expenses. These factors resulted in lower segment operating margins in the fourth quarter of 2016 when compared with 2015. Rest of world operating earnings of $38 million improved 34% compared with 2015. Higher China sales were partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses in China. Segment operating earnings were negatively impacted by $2.5 million due to China currency translation. Higher selling costs in China to support growth and higher advertising costs to promote our consumer products were the primary drivers of higher segment SG&A expenses. Fourth quarter segment operating margin of 14.2% was higher than one year ago, primarily due to higher gross margins as a result of a more profitable China mix and improved water treatment profitability in the 2016 quarter. Our corporate expenses were essentially the same in the fourth quarter compared with the year ago period. Our effective income tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2016 was 28.9% which is higher than the 27% experienced during the fourth quarter last year. The fourth quarter 2015 rate was lower than 2016, primarily due to the extension of the U.S. research and development tax credit in late 2015 and additional R&D tax benefits in China. We finished 2016 with a strong fourth quarter when adjusted for the $0.04 per share unfavorable impact from the expected incremental ERP expenses and the higher tax rate. Cash provided by operations during 2016 was $447 million compared with $352 million for the prior year. Higher earnings and lower outlays for working capital, primarily in China, were the primary drivers of improved cash flow in 2016. China experienced a series of favorable cash flow impacts in the fourth quarter. First, accounts receivable balances declined from the prior year end, despite considerably higher fourth quarter sales. We received a series of unexpected large customer payments late in the fourth quarter and benefited from improved terms with a few customers, all resulting in lower AR balances. Second, trade payable balances were higher, most notably due to higher inventory in advance of Spring Festival occurring this week. And third, cash received in advance from distribution customers was higher than expected. Our liquidity position and balance sheet remained strong. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 18% at the end of 2016. We have cash balances totaling $755 million located offshore, and our net cash position was approximately $431 million at the end of December 2016. Our year-end 2016 net cash level was higher than we expected as a result of the working capital factors noted previously as well as lower capital spending than planned in 2016. We completed the acquisition of Aquasana, a U.S. residential water treatment company in August 2016, primarily as a result of continued strong cash flow and escalating PBGC premiums, we made a voluntary contribution to our pension plan of $30 million during 2016. The after-tax impact to our cash flow is approximately $18.5 million. During 2016, we repurchased approximately 3.3 million shares of common stock for a total of $135 million. At December 2016 meeting, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of an additional 3 million shares. Approximately 4.9 million shares remained on our existing repurchase authority at the end of 2016. This morning, we introduced our 2017 EPS guidance in the range of between $1.98 and $2.08 per share. The midpoint of our EPS guidance represents a 10% increase in EPS compared with our 2016 results. Please note that our first quarter, historically, have had the lowest EPS of our four quarters, resulting from softer sales in China during the New Year travel holiday and the seasonality of Lochinvar branded products which favors second half of the year. Please turn to slide 12 for several 2017 assumptions. We expect our cash flow from operations in 2017 to be approximately $350 million which is lower than the $447 million generated in 2016. We expect higher earnings in 2017, but also larger outlays for working capital due to the higher than anticipated cash flows in the fourth quarter of 2016. Over the two-year period from 2016 to 2017, we expect to generate operating cash of approximately $800 million which compares with $612 million during the two years, 2014 to 2015. We broke ground in 2016 on the construction of a new water treatment and air purification manufacturing facility in Nanjing to support the strong growth of these products in China. Our 2017 capital spending plans of $90 million to $100 million include approximately $40 million related to this plant. Total cost for the facility, which is expected to be completed in early 2018, will be approximately $65 million. After this expansion, we expect capital spending in 2018 and beyond to be at levels approximately equal to our depreciation plus amortization. Our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $70 million in 2017. Expenses related to our ERP implementation were approximately $25 million in 2016 and are projected to decline to approximately $17.5 million in 2017. We expect to conclude our implementation efforts at a few of our small factories in North America this year. At this time, we do not expect to implement this system at our foreign operations. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $47 million in 2017, slightly higher than the $45 million in 2016, primarily due to higher expenses at our corporate technology center. Take note that our interest expense will be approximately $4 million higher in 2017 as a result of higher rates, share repurchase activity and our acquisition last year. Our effective tax rate is expected to be between 29.4% and 29.7% in 2017 and similar to the rate in 2016. This assumption is predicated on no change to the current U.S. tax regime. With regard to tax reform and border adjustment proposals, we have had several discussions with Big Four accounting firms. As you can appreciate, the proposals are fluid. We believe A. O. Smith could benefit significantly from tax reform. Approximately 60% to 65% of our total profits are derived in the U.S. Our 35% federal rate is reduced by approximately 2% for our manufacturing tax credit which would likely be eliminated. The savings on federal income taxes as a result of using the proposed House plan tax rate of 20% or the Trump plan tax rate of 15% would be a significant benefit compared with our current tax rate. With this reform, we expect our net effective state income tax rate would increase approximately 100 basis points. As many of you know, we manufacture water heaters in the U.S. and export a portion of them to Canada and elsewhere. Additionally, we have manufactured a minority of our water heaters sold in the U.S. in our maquiladora plant for almost three decades, and we import our tankless water heaters for sale in the U.S. If the net import concept is adopted, we believe we would experience an impact from border adjustments as our net imports are estimated to be approximately $75 million. Depending on the final tax reform, we could incur one-time income tax expense associated with repatriation and remeasurement of deferred taxes. We expect to repurchase our shares in the amount of approximately $135 million in 2017 under a 10b5-1 plan. We may opportunistically repurchase additional shares up to $65 million. If $135 million of our stock is repurchased, we expect our average diluted outstanding shares in 2017 will be approximately $174 million. I will now turn the call back to Ajita who will summarize our guidance, the business assumptions for 2017 and our growth strategy, beginning on slide 13. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Thank you, John. We project revenue growth to be between 9.5% and 11% in local currency terms in 2017 and 8% to 9.5% in U.S. dollar terms. We expect Aquasana sales to be almost $60 million this year, an incremental $40 million in sales over last year and slightly accretive to earnings. With a full year of Aquasana sales as part of A. O. Smith, we expect our global water treatment product sales to be nearly $300 million in 2017. We predict the Chinese currency will remain at current levels against the U.S. dollar, resulting in a 5% or $40 million sales headwind compared with the average rate in 2016. We expect steel prices to continue to be volatile and decline slightly from current prices. This assumption is significantly higher than the average price in 2016 and results in the most difficult comparisons for the year in the first and second quarters. Specific to our North America segment, we project U.S. residential water heater volumes will increase approximately 200,000 units in 2017 due to new construction and expansion of replacement demand. We project U.S. commercial volumes will be up modestly with little growth in small electric units after the category grew significantly in 2016. Fourth quarter 2016 sales of U.S. commercial boilers were strong, up double-digits due to the introduction of new Lochinvar products and the continued transition to higher efficiency boilers. We expect the total portfolio of Lochinvar branded products to grow over 8% in 2017 which includes slower growing Lochinvar branded water heaters. These factors lead us to expect our North America segment operating margin to be between 21.5% and 22.25%, despite the headwind from lower Aquasana EBIT margin of almost 50 basis points. Specific to our rest of world segment. We are a consumer products company in China which distinguishes us from most industrial companies operating in China. We grew 19% in local currency last year after growing approximately 17% in each of the last two years. With several growth drivers underpinning our China business, we are confident to project an annual growth rate of 15% in local currency in 2017. These drivers include overall water heater market growth driven by household formation and an emerging replacement market, geographic expansion, market share gains, continued strong growth of water treatment products, and air purification product growth. With benefits from China growth, smaller losses expected in India and our air purification products approaching breakeven, we project rest of world segment operating margin to be at least 14% in 2017. Please advance now to slide 14. Our total company organic growth model continues to assume 8% growth for the foreseeable future. Especially in these volatile and uncertain economic times, we believe our organic growth potential and our stable, defensive replacement market, which we believe represent approximately 85% of North America water heater and boiler volume, positively differentiates AOS among other industrial companies. Coupled with growth and stability, we have a strong balance sheet poised to take advantage of strategic acquisitions that add to shareholder value as well as allow us to return cash to shareholders. This concludes our prepared remarks and now we are available for your questions. Operator : And our first question comes from Robert McCarthy from Stifel. Your line is now open. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Just the first question, I mean I think, John, Ajita and Pat, could you just expand upon your comments around the steel pricing and the volatility and the compare for 1Q and Q2 in terms of how you're thinking about how that plays out in terms of growth and profitability for the company in the first half as we get some texture around kind of the first half versus the second half dynamic for your guidance? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Well, so I can tell you it began in 2015 cold rolled steel was about $535 a ton or $550 a ton, I think. So we're now at $830 a ton. And so the first two quarters are certainly as we talked about on the call, are going to have negative steel costs compared to the prior year. And as you move to the end of the year, you'll be more equal to what we were paying in late 2016. It's, obviously, been extremely volatile. We have \u2013 we talked to many experts. I think their forecast is for it to go down from here, but there's a lot of variables. Capacity is at 70%, but cold rolled is higher than that. Some of the input costs have been coming down, but then you have some of the potential tariffs and duties that could take it the other way. But clearly, steel will be a negative comparison first half of the year of 2017 compared to 2016. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: You laid out a very impressive outlook for organic growth as you always do. And obviously, there's a lot of teeth and underlying assumptions that kind of support the organic growth. I guess my question is you do have this outsized exposure to China sales as everyone is well aware of. Is there anything \u2013 and you talked about border adjustability as well, so you \u2013 and then net export position, taxes, so you've given a lot of detail. But in terms of the potential for, I guess, trade war or tariff adventure in association with the Trump administration, how do you think about kind of your headline risk there with respect to your business because you are well entrenched locally in China? But is there anything on the fundamental basis you're concerned about, certain policies or certain regulations, certain actions that could happen in global trade between China and the U.S. that could really cause fundamental problems from you aside from a headline risk? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: So I'll take a shot at it, and then Ajita can add. The China entity is basically vertically integrated and sources and sells everything in China. From the U.S., we import very little from China. So, from that standpoint, we shouldn't have too much impact. And the other thing is both countries' trade is very intertwined. And our assumption is that ultimately it gets resolved reasonably. But with respect to China imports or exports, we really don't have much of either way going on. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: And just to reinforce that, I think the key is \u2013 because you're right that we do have a lot of revenue exposure there which we like. The growth has been fantastic and we have very strong fundamentals in China with a strong brand and strong distribution, a great team. At the same time, we do worry about it, nothing new now on an ongoing basis. And that's why we have, in fact, not just for the three of us and our team to be looking at it, but we hire outside experts to give us advice in terms of what's happening. And we've talked about it before. We have the Eurasia Group on retainer and we work with them in terms of understanding the risk out there. They're experts at this. And we've consulted with them. And we are very comfortable in terms of where we are and from a risk perspective and even in these economic times. And as John said, at the end of the day, the two economies are very intertwined and we feel that cooler heads will prevail as time goes on if there is anything. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks. I'll get back in queue. Operator : And our next question comes from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning, guys. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: So I really wanted to dig in on the res data. Looks like through November, it was up kind of 7% if you adjust for some of the NAECA III shift from res to commercial kind of low single-digits. Can you just talk about how you did relative to that? And what you see as kind of holding back the residential water heater business through 2016. And then kind of how you're framing it for 2017, I guess particularly where you can gain share or mix and price to kind of grow that unit number? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Well, you're right. The industry was up the first two months of the year, probably about 80,000 units. We were during that same time period down about 20,000 units and there was really two reasons for that. One is SAP went in at our wholesale plant, and our lead times extended a little bit there. So we didn't pick up as much on the wholesale side as we should have. And then number two, our largest retail customer dropped their inventory from September to December to more normal levels, consistent with where they were at the end of last year. And so we didn't participate as much on the retail side either. But those were, in our mind, kind of two one-time events, if you will. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: And they were approximately half and half... John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yes, half-and-half. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: ...in terms of the impact. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: What we're looking at in 2017 and we've done a lot of modeling, obviously, trying to forecast the industry. It's been difficult over the last three years. Our forecast base level kind of assumes that the industry is going to go up about 200,000 units, and that's 100,000 in completions and 100,000 in replacements. We think that's a reasonable assumption now that we think the inventory has kind of cleaned out of the system from all the activity that happened with NAECA between the combination of price increases and the elimination of some products. So that's our base assumption going forward. Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. So if I \u2013 it looks like \u2013 so your guide, all in, is 8% to 9.5% which it looks like FX can offset the Aquasana. Is that sort of a fair... John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Right, right. Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: So the China one's easy. I'm just trying to bridge your 8% long-term target versus your 8% to 9.5%. Like what's kind of the upside scenario? Because it seems like China, you're saying plus 15%, Lochinvar plus 8%. And so... John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah, I think what we have is a little bit of pricing carryover from 2016. So, on the high end, that certainly helps us. If the industry is a little bit higher than we expected, that gets us to the high end. To get to the low end, if the industry doesn't do as well as what we expect. So that's kind of the bridge. You're correct that essentially Aquasana and what we're assuming for currency effect on China in 2017 pretty much offset each other. Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay, helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : And our next question comes from Bhupender Bohra from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC : John, just wanted to \u2013 on North America margins, you have the guidance out as 21.5% to 22.25%. And I believe in the prior calls, I think you had capped the high end at 22%. What makes you a little bit more comfortable like extending that guide by 25 bps here at the high end, especially with the steel cost and some of the headwinds you've been talking about? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Sure. Well, as I had spoken, I said our starting point was 21.5% to 22%, and we hadn't done our estimate. I think on the high end, if volumes come in at the 200,000 to 300,000 range, those come in at a very attractive incremental margin. If steel does recede more than kind of a little bit, that would obviously help our margins. So it's a combination of those things. I think the high and low end of the margins will be driven primarily by the volumes in North America residential and commercial. I mean I think we're pretty comfortable on the Lochinvar of 8% to 10%. And then where steel goes, plus or minus. Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And any other \u2013 we have been talking about SAP cost and some of the synergies which you had \u2013 we had, not officially, but as we talked about you will be getting from the SAP implementation over the next two years. Is that built in the guidance too, like the North America margin guidance? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: No, I would tell you that the savings that I think we talked about on the last call that we would expect to start generating savings in 2018 were not completely installed yet. We'll finish that in North America this year. We'll make some improvements to the system. And then I think our focus will be on things like shared services, looking at our supply chain and the benefits we can get from consolidated spend and some of those things. So we would start seeing that, we think, in the 2018 range. I mean, one of the benefits to margin is we've said we spent about $25 million in 2016, and we're forecasting $17.5 million in 2017. So that does help the margins out. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: And this is \u2013 Bhupender, this is very consistent with what we've said in the past, so it's not any change. It's that 2017 is going to be a year where we really stabilize the system, really get to understanding how we use it. And then 2018 is when we really start \u2013 and setting plans to reap benefits. And 2018 is when we really think that's going to begin and 2018 into 2019 onward which, again, from talking to other people who put in systems like SAP, pretty consistent. Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC : Okay, okay. And my last question, on Lochinvar China growth strategy. I mean, we have \u2013 since your acquisition in 2011, I think the China strategy has been \u2013 it seems like it's delayed by a couple of years over the last several years now. And could you just update us like how big China is for Lochinvar in terms of potential? And we saw \u2013 I think you guys talked about some new product introduction in China in the third quarter last year, how the traction is coming along for that particular product. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Let me take a stab, and then you jump in. So, Bhupender, you're right. When we made the acquisition, we anticipated at the time that the Chinese market would become, would open up for \u2013 the timing would be that the Chinese market was opening up for this high efficiency condensing products that Lochinvar makes, obviously, world-class products. And we were wrong in the sense that that commercial \u2013 that condensing market hasn't quite opened up at the speed that we anticipated. But in the meantime, we did see the opportunity for high BTU input non-condensing products. And Lochinvar developed some products which we started shipping to China end of last year. And we also manufacture that product in China. So from a strategic viewpoint, we are doing what we said we would. It's been pushed out more, and it's a different type of product because the market for condensing product has not really developed at the speed we thought. We know it will. The indications are it's coming, but we just don't quite see it there yet. However, the non-condensing part, the high BTU non-condensing part, where the technology from Lochinvar really helps us, we've developed products. We are manufacturing some of them in China. We are exporting some of them. And the growth of that segment is going, actually, very well. Anything to add, John? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: No. Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. Operator : And our next question comes from Matt Summerville of Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is now open. Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Thanks. Good morning. With respect to China, you've sort of disclosed kind of revenue numbers and year-over-year growth numbers for the treatment portion as well as purification on the air side. What did your legacy water heater business do in China in local currency in 2016? And then I guess moving to 2017, the bridge to that 15% number that you're calibrating everyone around and you, obviously, had that number for a long time, what growth expectations do you have for those three pieces in 2017 that gets you to that 15%? Thank you. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah, when we look at the model compared to 2016, phase water heater, which is about 70% of the business, grew at 6% or 7%. Okay. So a little bit more than \u2013 contributed a little bit more growth than what we expected. Pricing was 4% to 5%. Pricing, market share was 4% to 5% as we expected. And then, obviously, the ancillary product lines added about 8%. So that's kind of the math on how you get to the 19%, if you will. And obviously, two prior years, we averaged about 17%. So, from a growth standpoint, 2016 was a very good year. Now, when we look into 2017, we're pretty much following our model, saying that we expect to get 5% from our legacy businesses, i.e., our electric and instantaneous gas. We expect to get 5% from either pricing, market share. And then we expect to get 5% from continued growth in water treatment, air purification, et cetera. So the model is tracking very well for what we thought, a little bit better the last couple years. And we're comfortable with the 15% growth. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: And I think the individual pieces of the model, long-term, we're very comfortable. Short-term, they're going to vary. But overall, we are very comfortable with the average. Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Got it. And then just as a follow-up, you talked about your ERP implementation costs and what they're doing from 2016 to 2017. I guess, long-term, what does that $17.5 million number go to? Does it eventually go to zero? Are you done? Is there a reason you're not migrating your SAP platform to your international operations? Can you just sort of give a picture on your ERP please? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Sure. So, as I said, we're about $17.5 million next year \u2013 I'm sorry, this year, 2017. We would expect a run rate is probably about $15 million. And the pieces of that are the amortization of what we capitalized is almost $6 million. So that's going on for the next 10 years or so. Then you have the services, the external services, the hosting services, the SAP support services which are $3 million to $4 million. And then you have the license fees that you pay these guys going on, whether it's SAP, whether it's SuccessFactors. So I think we think $15 million is probably a reasonable number. And then you have the COE which is people that are supporting the system, et cetera. So we're saying $15 million is a reasonable number. Now Ajita and I have had a lot of discussions on taking it internationally. And we're not saying we're not going to at some point. But right now, China, when we sold EPC in 2011, we put QAD, a very good system, into China. And it can handle their growth for quite some time. India, we think SAP at this time would be overkill for them. So we'll continue to evaluate. And again, our focus is, starting towards 2018, is starting to get savings in North America from the system. And that's where we're focusing on. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. And just to reinforce, QAD is a very good system and is working extremely well for us. And also, what we \u2013 we did do some \u2013 maybe this is more detail than you want. But we did do some customization with QAD so that it handles not only the manufacturing, but also giving us really good data on the retail side of the business which, as you know, is growing very well. So that's working really well for us. And we don't think that putting SAP in there today is the right thing from a long-term \u2013 from a consolidation perspective because it's working for us. Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Understood. Good color. Thank you, guys. Operator : And our next question comes from Charley Brady with SunTrust. Your line is now open. Patrick Wu - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi, this is actually Patrick Wu standing in for Charley. Thanks for taking my question. I'm looking at China, up 24% excluding FX. What was the number including FX, all in? And then what is the \u2013 sort of how would you attribute or maybe parse out some of the buildup normal seasonal demand leading up to the Chinese New Year versus the large customer orders that you talked about a little bit? Because I think versus last year ex-currency, it was up 19%. There was a 5% delta there, just wanted to bridge that gap. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Well, the first one, so I think we said that currency affected 2016 by about $50 million. And that was all China essentially. Patrick Wu - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: What about at the fourth quarter? Sorry. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: The fourth quarter, it took it from what, $20 million? Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.: (41:28) John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: $19 million, it was $19 million down to what? Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah, down. The impact was about $17 million. Yeah. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: So we have \u2013 I can tell you the fourth quarter impact for sales was about $17 million. So, in local currency, it was 24%, and in U.S. dollars, it was about 16%. So that was the fourth quarter impact. And we also talked about that it affected the profits by about $2.5 million. Does that answer that question? Patrick Wu - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Right. Yeah, the first portion, definitely. But I was more looking at in terms of normal seasonality. You generally have a buildup leading up to Chinese New Year in the fourth quarter. I think last year, ex-currency, it was up 19%. And the fourth quarter of this year, it's up 24%. How would you parse out the seasonality versus maybe some of the larger orders that you mentioned during your prepared remarks? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Well, I wouldn't expect much change from the prior year. And what we were trying to allude to is that the first quarter is always their weakest of the four quarters, just because of the 10- to 12-day China holiday. We did get some orders, but those came in late in the year versus \u2013 and last year, they would have came in early in the year. So that was part of the timing, et cetera. But what we're trying to get across is first quarter is clearly China's weakest quarter. But we would still expect to see nice year-over-year growth. Patrick Wu - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. When I'm looking at the water treatment sales for the year, I think if you ex out Aquasana and then ex out your China numbers, I think it leaves around $28 million in terms of water treatment. Is that mostly India? And then also can you frame a little bit about how you guys view the losses in 2017? I think you guys said that there will be smaller losses in 2017 than 2016. But can you maybe give a little bit more granular color on that? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Sure. So, in 2016, you're right. Branded was about $148 million. The legacy business we bought in China was about $18 million. Turkey was about $5 million. India was a couple million. Vietnam was about $4 million. And U.S., Aquasana, the $18 million we talked about. So that's how you kind of get to the $194 million for water treatment product sales. So that's the first question. The second one was with respect to India? Patrick Wu - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Right. How should we think about the framework for sort of losses into 2017 versus 2016? Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: You're fading. The last part of your question didn't come through. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: I think he said losses. Patrick Wu - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Just thinking about how to frame the losses in terms \u2013 in 2017 for India versus 2016 and how we think about that? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Sure. So, in 2016, we lost almost $10 million. That was the high end of the range. And we would say that the fourth quarter was impacted by the demonetization, I think, the elimination of large bills which you probably read about. So that had a negative effect. So we lost \u2013 our loss was towards the high end of the range. Our forecast when we look into 2017 is that sales will grow, we think, over 30% and the losses will reduce to, let's say, around $8 million. Patrick Wu - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey, good morning. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Morning. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): So really two questions. The one is the easier one. M&A, any type of update you can give us, Ajita, obviously, with the share repurchase upping in December. Is that any type of a signal that you're maybe not seeing a lot in the M&A pipe, or is that just sort of a just in case something doesn't happen? Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: No. There's no signal at all, no change in strategy. The market out there is active and we are looking with a wide net as we have talked in the past. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. I would attribute the, certainly in part, the performance or lack thereof of the stock during this Trump rally on concerns over China backlash, China consumer backlash on the US. So if you could walk us through again why you think the fact that you're landlocked, we all get that, but why wouldn't a U.S. brand as strong as A. O. Smith maybe not get any type of backlash? Certainly, we understand that you're kind of like the only game in town at your price point or what have you. But still, I think there is still a concern out there about that. If you can maybe address that more fully? Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: I'll give it a shot. In terms of \u2013 a lot of the rally has been around infrastructure related types of stocks that have really done very well. But I can't judge what's happening in the market. But from our perspective, like we said before, we are pretty much vertically integrated in China. We export a little bit from here to China, glass and a few components, very little. And we hardly \u2013 I don't think we export anything from China -- we export very little, very little from China to the US. So we are pretty much self-contained in China. So that's number one. And then also at the end of the day, the two economies are very intertwined. And what the experts are telling us, okay, because this is not something that Pat and John and I sit around the table and say here's what we think will happen because we are certainly not the experts. But what the experts are telling us is that as you look at all the pluses and minuses, that if there is anything, it'll be short-lived and is going to be impact more the cross-border type traffic and is not going to impact the companies that are self-contained in either place, okay. And we are comfortable with that. We don't see any evidence of anything happening. And so, from a risk perspective, we are comfortable in terms of where we are. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): So what I think I hear you saying is that ultimately cooler heads prevail. In other words, you have a powerful brand, everyone knows it's a U.S. brand. You've talked ad nauseum over the years about how the power of a non-China brand works so well in the customer segment that you're targeting. So it sounds to me like you're saying that if there is an impact, it will be short-lived because people will realize that everything you sell in China, you make in China. But I guess \u2013 and, look, it's impossible to handicap this at this point. But I think the greater, larger concern is not about necessarily being landlocked, but just about U.S. brands in China in general. And what the new president's \u2013 with the potential for renegotiating trade agreements, what that could mean. And I'm sure your experts probably have an opinion on this, but that was really the nature of my... Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah, but \u2013 so let me address that. There are two issues, okay. One is in terms of renegotiating trade agreements which is what will impact the cross-border type traffic, of which, we have virtually none, okay. So that's one. The second is the secondary impact of what that would do in terms of the relationship and impact on U.S. brands in China. I think that's what you're saying, okay. In terms of the latter, like we said, we \u2013 from talking to the expert, we aren't concerned. And also, if you go back and look at what's been happening historically in China, not with the U.S., but very, very similar circumstances with a country that there's been constant ups and downs, and that's Japan. Japanese brands continue to do very well in China. We compete with Japanese brands in China as you know. And when these issues flare up, and with Japan it flares up at least once a year, okay, with the visit to the shrine that happens in Japan every year, things flare up for a short while and then it goes back down. This is in terms of the rhetoric and all the newspapers and all the rest of it. We see no impact in the marketplace and it's business as usual. So we put it all together and we say the best we know and the best we are hearing from the experts, we are not concerned. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Understood. That's a comprehensive answer, Ajita. Thank you. Here's just my last one, if I may. The transitory issues or quote-unquote transitory issues you talked about, hitting the North American volumes. It sounds like from the guidance that you are assuming that that is, in fact, a transitory issue. But I was wondering if you could bring to bear what you're seeing in January as sort of proof that they are transitory issues. Are you seeing sort of a return to normal trade volume in the \u2013 did you see that in January? Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah, we've seen \u2013 but in the two areas, first of all, our lead times are coming down because \u2013 there were \u2013 John said, he used the word two one-time issues, okay, which are there, which explain about half and half, which explains the gap. So our lead times are coming down. Is it down to where I want it to be right now? No, but it's coming down very nicely. That's number one. And number two, we see our customer building back inventories and the order rate is up. So we are comfortable as to where we are. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: And we've lost no customers. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Right, , yeah, we haven't lost any customers. The lead time being down, but not a loss of customer. That's a good important point. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Very good. Okay. Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from Alvaro Lacayo from Gabelli & Company. Your line is now open. Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company: Good morning. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company: My question is in regards with, I guess, the comments around sort of the way volume went in the fourth quarter and tying it into sort of the August price increase. Can you just maybe talk about market acceptance on that price increase versus what you've seen in the past? And you mentioned those two one-time issues. Did rising price have anything to with the volume issues that you had in the fourth quarter? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Absolutely not, on the second one. No, no. The two reasons were we put SAP into our three major wholesale plants. Two of them are residential and our lead times extended a little bit associated with SAP. Number two is our largest retail customer from September 30 to December 31 adjusted their inventory levels down, putting them to more normal levels and very comparable to the prior year. So, no, it had nothing to do in our mind associated with price. Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company: Okay, great. And then I guess around just high level thinking on the M&A strategy and with everything that we've been talking about with regards to trade tensions, repatriation, tax reform. In terms of how you're developing the pipeline and how you think about what the strategic pieces are going forward, how do you see sort of any differences or potential opportunities, given all the changes that you're seeing in the market today? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: I'll take a shot at it. I don't think our strategy has changed. I mean, (54:20)... Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: No, our strategy certainly hasn't changed. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: ... (54:21) segments in areas we've talked about for the last couple years on where we're focused. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Our strategy has not changed, no. And also in terms of \u2013 there's a lot of speculation in terms of what's going to happen. We don't know what's going to happen. When things do happen, if that's going to impact our strategy or open up more opportunities because of repatriation, et cetera, then we \u2013 or differences in the tax impact, then that would certainly go into impacting our strategy and tweaking our strategy or changing our strategy. But right now, we are very consistent with our strategy in terms of where the opportunities are and where we want to grow. Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company: Okay, got it. And then in China, you talked about the better profitability. You mentioned better mix and better profitability in water treatment. If you could just provide more color on what the mix improvement drivers were, and then what was making water treatment more profitable? Was it just price increases or is something else going on? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: It wasn't price increases. It was just kind of scale and much higher, so we're starting to get more contribution, et cetera. And they have very \u2013 their water treatment has very attractive gross margins. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. So, just to add a little more to what John said, we've always said when we get into a new business segment, okay, obviously, there's going to be an initial investment in terms of getting into the segment. We're going to lose money for a while until we build up the scale. But also, remember, we are a consumer products business in China. So, in addition to building up scale like we would do with a normal manufacturing business, we're also investing in the brand and investing behind making sure the consumer knows that the A. O. Smith brand is in that category. And what our features and benefits are, I mean, typical marketing, okay. So it's that combination that makes that investment period and getting us to breakeven longer than a typical industrial type business, okay. But at the same time, whenever we get into a category, we make sure that our gross margins are high and that we have a plan and a can-see path to get us to the right level of profitability. And we make sure that the teams are working towards getting up there. So we are along that path. And as the volume grows, the scale grows and the contribution grows, and also we can appropriately scale our investment behind the brand in that category to make sure that we are reaching our profit targets at the right pace. So it's all of that. I know that's a mouthful, but that's all of that that's impacting us. And it's on track in terms of us getting the water treatment profitability to the levels we want them to be at. Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question comes from Sam Eisner from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah, good morning, everyone. I think actually most of my questions have been answered. Thanks. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Okay. Operator : And our next question comes from David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Your line is now open. Brandon Roll\u00e9 - Longbow Research LLC : This is Brandon Roll\u00e9 on for David MacGregor. I was going to ask you if you could talk quickly about your 2016 growth in commercial water heaters and to the extent that you may have gained share. And then also if you could just talk about what might change competitively, if anything, in 2017 with a possibly stronger U.S. dollar environment. Thank you. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: I think share \u2013 well, the whole industry grew about 20%. And I think we talked about the major reason for that being the 55-gallon and up electric which was eliminated under NAECA from a residential standpoint. So, if you look at the 20% growth, I think about 17% of the growth was specific to that. And then small electrics under 55-gallon were the majority of the reminder, the 3%. We really, from a share standpoint, it was pretty constant except we did talk about the fact that we didn't have equivalent share in the 55-gallon and up electric. We brought out a product to compete in that late in the first quarter, and the product has been doing fairly nicely. But clearly, that had an impact on our overall share. So the industry, except for that specific, was pretty level for the year. Does that answer your question? Brandon Roll\u00e9 - Longbow Research LLC : Yes, that answered my question. And also I was going to see if you could just comment on if you think there will be a shift in competitive dynamics with a stronger U.S. dollar in 2017? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Well, the good news for us is it's very hard to ship in water heaters from the outside. So the stronger dollar we're not concerned about \u2013 that's going to make imports better positioned. So we're not concerned about what the effect is here. The stronger U.S. dollar could have an impact on the Canada market a little bit. I don't (01:00:08). Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah, and we have some \u2013 we have some Canadian competitors in the U.S. market too. But they are seeing the advantage today. And we're not concerned about it. Brandon Roll\u00e9 - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Robert McCarthy from Stifel. Your line is now open. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Well, looks like we're drawing to a close here, guys. But maybe you just \u2013 have you provided any kind of implicit assumption for price in your outlook for 2017? Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: No. As you know, we can't speculate on price. And we talk about price only once something happens in the marketplace. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: All right. And then just in terms of thinking about ERP spend, how do we think about it beyond this year in terms of incremental spend over the next two or three years from a long-term modeling standpoint? Are we done or where are we in terms of a certain base level of spending? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah, I think what we tried to say is that was $25 million in 2016, about $17.5 million in 2017. And we would say probably the run rate is $15 million going forward. And it's those components I talked about which is the amortization of what we capitalized, the outside services, the license fees, et cetera. So I think the run rate after this, our best guess is $15 million going forward. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for your time. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. And the question comes from Bhupender Bohra from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC : Hey. Just one more question here, which I forgot, was on the Aquasana. You have some cross-selling synergies over the next two years which you gave last year. Could you just update us on that and how the cross-selling between China and the U.S., keeping in mind the border adjustment tax, which we think will play or not play, I don't know, but has anything changed along with your strategy, keeping that in mind? Thank you. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: No, I think at this time, nothing's changed. We expect their core business to grow over 20% this year, and then we will start to see some of the synergies associated with the cross-selling this year. We said it would be back end loaded, but we would expect that to be in the area of $5 million of cross-selling this year with the ultimate objective after a three-year period to be in the 25% to 30%, I think is what we've talked about. So I'd say Aquasana is on track, no surprises. And we're not going to change our strategy until there's something firm out there on... Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: On the cross-border. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah, that's (01:03:01). Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: And also, Bhupender, I think the overall question, if I can take a step back on your question, in terms of \u2013 and not to put words in your mouth, but how that Aquasana are doing. I think from our perspective, it's right on track. Strategically, we are absolutely convinced this is the right thing to do which is why we did the acquisition. And from a synergy perspective, one of the things we didn't talk about are the cost side of the synergies. It's going well. In fact, if anything, even a little better. Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Operator : At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ms. Patricia Ackerman for closing remarks. Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.: Thank you all for joining us today. Please take note that we will participate in a couple conferences during the first quarter. The first is the Alembic conference in Salt Lake City on March 1, and the second is the Boenning & Scattergood conference in London on March 23. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Ajita Rajendra : Thank you, Pat, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. A. O. Smith's solid performance in the first quarter set record for sales and earnings. We continue to see strong growth in our consumer products in China and our water heater end markets in the U. S. were very positive. Here are a few highlights; sales grew 16% to a record of $740 million. Excluding the impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar against the Chinese currency, our sales grew 18% in the quarter. China sales are up 27% in local currency. Amongst several revenue growth drivers, A. O. Smith branded water treatment sales grew over 50% in local currency, and air purification products grew over 80%. Net earnings of $0.50 per share were 22% higher than our earnings per share in 2016. We continue to review our capital allocation and dedicate a portion of our cash to return to shareholders. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 608,000 shares for $30 million. We announced a 17% increase to our dividend earlier this year. The five year compound annual growth rate of our dividend is over 25%. John will now describe our results in more detail, beginning with Slide 4. John Kita : Sales for the first quarter of $740 million were 16% higher than the previous year. Net earnings in the first quarter of $88 million increased 19% from 2016, and first quarter earnings per share of $0.50 increased $0.09 compared to 2016. Sales in our North America segment of $47 million increased 15% compared with the first quarter of 2016. The increase in sales was primarily due to higher volumes of residential and commercial water heaters in the U. S. and Canada, and pricing actions in August 2016 related to significant steel cost increases and inflationary pressure on other costs. Aquasana, acquired in August of 2016, added $10 million to our North American segment sales. Rest of world segment sales of $260 million increased 19% compared with 2016. China sales increased 27%, in local currency, driven by higher demand for our consumer products in the region, led by water treatment and air purification products, as well as the pre-buy in advance of a price increase related to steel and other cost inflation. On Slide 6, North America operating earnings of $104 million were 13% higher than segment operating earnings in the year-ago quarter. The favorable impact from higher sales of water heaters in North America and the pricing action and the U.S., were partially offset by higher steel and other input costs. The operating margins of the newly acquired Aquasana business, is lower than the segment average and explain the overall margin decline for the segment in the first quarter. Rest of World operating earnings of $33 million improved 21% compared with 2016. Higher China sales were partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses in China. Higher selling cost and advertising costs to support growth were the primary drivers of higher segment SG&A expenses. Currency translations reduced China earnings by approximately $2 million compared with the prior year. The China price increase had a minimal impact to earnings in the first quarter. First quarter segment operating margin was essentially the same as one year ago. Our corporate expenses were higher in the first quarter compared with the year ago period, due to higher spending in our Corporate Technology Center. Our effective income tax rate in the first quarter of 2017 was 27.2%, which was lower than the 29% experienced during the first quarter last year. The first quarter 2017 rate was lower than 2016, primarily due to a larger benefit associated with stock-based compensation and a change in geographic earnings mix. The lower effective tax rate, compared with the effective rate a year ago, benefited 2017 results by $0.01 per share. Cash used by operations during the first quarter was $11 million compared with $27 million provided during the prior year. Higher earnings were more than offset by higher outrages for working capital. These factors resulted in lower cash flow in 2017. Our liquidity position and balance sheet remains strong. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 19% at the end of first quarter. We have cash balances totaling $722 million located offshore, and our net cash position was approximately $353 million at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 607,000 shares of common stock for a total of $30 million. Approximately 4.3 million shares remained our existing repurchase authorization at the end of March. This morning, we increased the mid-point of our 2017 EPS guidance by $0.03 per share with the range of between $2.03 and $2.09 per share. The mid-point of our EPS guidance represents an 11% increase in EPS compared with our 2016 results. As a reminder, we do experience some seasonality in our business due to the boiler selling season, and China holidays, which benefit the second half of the year. Over the last seven years our first half earnings have consistently represented slightly less than 50% of our total annual earnings.  Please turn to Slide 9 for several 2017 assumptions. We expect our cash flow from operations in 2017 to be approximately $375 million, which is lower than the $447 million generated in 2016. We expect higher earnings in 2017 but also a larger outlays for working capital due to the higher than anticipated cash flows in the fourth quarter of 2016. Over the two-year period from 2016 to 2017, we expect to generate operating cash flow of approximately $825 million, which compares with $612 million during 2014 to 2015. We broke ground in 2016 on a construction of a new water treatment and air purification manufacturing facility in Nanjing to support the strong growth of these products in China. Our 2017 capital spending plans of approximately $100 million include about $45 million related to this plant. Total cost for the facility, which is expected to begin production in the second quarter of 2018, will be approximately $65 million. After this expansion, we expect capital spending in 2018 and beyond to be at levels of approximately equal to our depreciation plus amortization. Our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $70 million in 2017. As previously discussed, expenses related to our ERP implementation were approximately $25 million in 2016, and are projected to decline to approximately $70.5 million in 2017. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $47 million in 2017, slightly higher than the $45 million in 2016, primarily due to higher expenses that our Corporate Technology Center and commissioned water treatment market studies. Take note that our interest expense will be approximately $4 million higher in 2017, as a result of higher rates, share repurchase activities and our acquisition last year. Our effective tax rate is expected to be between 28.75% and 29% in 2017, slightly lower than the rate in 2016. This assumption is predicated on no change the current U.S. tax regime. We expected repurchase our shares in the amount of approximately $135 million in 2017, under a 10b5-1 plan. We may opportunistically repurchase additional shares up to $65 million. If $135 million of our stock is repurchased, we expect our average diluted outstanding shares in 2017 will be approximately $174.5 million. I will now turn the call back to Ajita who will summarize our guidance, the business assumptions for 2017, and our growth strategy beginning on Slide 10. Ajita? Ajita Rajendra : Thank you, John. We project revenue growth to be between 10.5% and 11.5% in local currency terms in 2017, and between 9% and 10% in U.S. dollar terms. We expect Aquasana sales to be between $55 million and $60 million this year and slightly accretive to earnings. With the full year of Aquasana sales, as part A. O. Smith, we expect our global water treatment products sales will be nearly $300 million in 2017. We project the Chinese currency will depreciate slightly from current levels against the U.S. dollar, resulting in the 5% or $45 million sales headwind compared with the average rate in 2016. Specific to our North America segment. We project U.S. residential water heater industry volumes will increase approximately 200,000 units in 2017, due to new construction and expansion of replacement demands. We project U.S. commercial water heater industry volumes to be up modestly with little growth in large electric units, after the category grew significantly in 2016. Lochinvar branded products grew 5% in the first quarter, driven by strong demand for water heater and modest growth in boilers. We do expect double-digit full year boiler sales growth, driven by continued market share gain, new product introduction and energy-efficient product growth. We expect the total portfolio of Lochinvar branded products to grow over 8% in 2017. Since our call in early February, steel prices have continued to move up, and knocked down, as we previously projected. We expect steel prices to continue to be elevated and volatile. This assumption is significantly higher than the average price in 2016, and result in the most difficult comparisons for the year in the second quarter. These factors lead us to affect our North American segment operating margin will be between 21.5% and 22%, despite the headwind from lower Aquasana EBIT margin of almost 50 basis points. Specific to our rest of world segment, we are a consumer products company in China, which distinguishes us from most the industrial companies operating in China. We grew 27% in local currency in the first quarter, driven by continued strong demand for our high quality products and a pre-buy in advance of an announced price increase. We expect the pre-buy will be negatively impact the next couple of quarter\u2019s sales. The several growth drivers underpinning our China business, we are confident to project an annual growth rate of at least 15% in local currency in 2017. These drivers include, overall water heater market growth driven by household formation and an emerging replacement market, geographic expansion, market share gain, continued strong growth of water treatment products and air purification product growth. These benefits from China growth, smaller losses expected in India and our air purification products approaching breakeven, we project rest of world segment operating margin will be at least 14% in 2017. I'm moving now to Slide 11. Our total company organic growth model continues to assume 8% growth for the foreseeable future. Especially in these volatile and uncertain economic times, we believe our organic growth potential and our stable defensive replacement markets, which we believe represent approximately 85% of North America water heater and boiler volumes; positively differentiate A. O. Smith amongst other industrial companies. Coupled with strong growth and stability, we have a strong balance sheet poised to take advantage of strategic acquisitions that adds shareholder value, as well as allow us to return cash to shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks and now we are open for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Charley Brady with SunTrust Robinson. Your question please. Charley Brady : Hi, thanks. Good guys. Good morning Pat. On the China pre-buy, I know you mentioned it's going to pull some stuff down from the upcoming quarters, but can you quantify any more on that as to how much you think you pulled forward, particularly from Q2? Ajita Rajendra : Well, it's pretty hard to calculate and actually determine what it is but we would say that we probably grew organically about 16%, which would result in approximately $15 million in pull forward. And we think that will be over the next couple of quarters. There's some promotion being run in the second quarter so sales will definitely be down, affected by that but it might leak into the third quarter also. Charley Brady : Thanks. And sort of a follow up, you talked about the pricing not having, I guess, material impact on the first quarter. Do you expect an impact in the second quarter and beyond? Ajita Rajendra : Yes, we think there will be some positive impact but clearly it was put in and it probably averaged about 3%, 3.5%, and it didn't cover all geographies but the major reason was to cover steel and also we increased what we're paying our installers, which we truly feel is a differentiator. Our service network in China is a differentiator. But there will be some net benefit coming in the last three quarters. Charley Brady : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Your question please. Jeffrey Hammond : So, just within the North America strength, which was a pretty big surprise. Can you give you a little more granularity on what you saw on Lochinvar and what you saw out of commercial and res, and maybe within that, talk about the issues that kind of hit you in the fourth quarter, in terms of cleaning those up, SAP and inventory destock? Thanks. Ajita Rajendra : Well, on the Lochinvar, we said it was up about 5% and that was primarily residential and commercial, and you probably saw the first two months of AHR data, and they were very strong. The industry was up 67 plus units \u2013 67,000 plus units in the first two months. And we think they're up even more given our March. So residential was quite strong. And when we look at commercial, it was up almost 4,000 units in the first two months and we think that trend continues. So the bottom line is, residential and commercial were quite strong for both Lochinvar and the base business would hit \u2013 quite to hit. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay. And then just as following to that, what's the coding and order activity in Lochinvar that would support kind of that 8% plus growth, and then also how do you feel about how you've addressed the product category that you're underserved in. Have you seen more business as a result of NAECA III? Thanks. Ajita Rajendra : Well, we\u2019ve made progress on the commercial, greater than 55 gallons, so we made progress on that. We're not up to the share that our other businesses \u2013 our other commercial businesses is, but we definitely made progress on that. Lochinvar, its somewhat the same story. If you recall we had a strong commercial boiler market in the fourth quarter and it was pretty flat, up a little bit, in the first quarter, still a significant amount of quoting going on. We think projects are going to be released. We are coming out \u2013 we've come out with a new product of 6 million BTU condensing. We've come out with some non-condensing new product and we also have a Combi boiler coming up. So I think when you add all that up and then you look at what the Dodgible Manheim index was talking about and the Architectural Builders index, I mean, I think we're optimistic that we can get that 8% plus growth in Lochinvar for the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets. Your question please. Scott Graham : Hi. Good morning all. I want to understand a little bit about, and you've certainly helped us with this little bit, John, price costs and kind of how it rolls through the rest of the year or so. My understanding, I think you guys talked about pricing up by 5% to 8% last summer to cover steel, and I think I heard you say that your realization so far have been 3% to 3.5%. Am I comparing apples-to-apples in here\u2026 John Kita : Say it again. I didn't hear the last part, Scott. Scott Graham : It sounded to me like you just said that there was a price realization taking place of about 3% to 3. 5%. John Kita : No, that's in China. Scott Graham : Fine. Okay, so then the 5% to 8% last summer that is now and I guess I would've thought, given your sort of lag on how you pay for steel that - I'm a little bit surprised that the margin guidance you're thinking for the second quarter is where it is. So I guess what I'm asking here is that would you expect to have prices in place at today's steel prices, that you're pricing in place now. Should mean that your second-half margins are up in North America? John Kita : Let me take a shot at. There are several questions in there. First of all, steel, I will tell you that we put in prices of approximately 5% of residential last year. Commercial might have been a little bit higher. Residential was about 5%, and we did get that 5%. Ajita Rajendra : And this is August of last year John Kita : Yes, this is August of last year. And so we also talked to you that we were about covering costs, we were not picking up margin and that's the case. So I would tell you, in the second quarter, for the most part, that they pretty much offset each other; price and cost. And that's what we've talked about in the past. Steel is much higher in the first quarter than the prior year. It's much higher in the second quarter than the prior year, and then it starts leveling off from a comparative standpoint compared to the prior year cost, if you will. So I don't know if that answers the question. So I mean when you look at it in the first half of the year, we're going to have favorable price compared to the prior year. We're going to have favorable Aquasana compared to the prior year, from a revenue standpoint. The last half, not so much, kind of starting about August. Scott Graham : Okay. And that's where the steel comps get easier? John Kita : The steel comps get easier and I mean you can conclude we've talked about 21.5% to 22% North America margins and we were at 21.30% or something, in the first quarter so yes, we would expect margins. When you add Lochinvar, remember Lochinvar is very seasonal. The second half of the year is significantly better sales and significantly better EBIT. So that comes into play also. Scott Graham : Got you. Thank you. The other question I wanted to simply ask you guys is that when we look at where steel has sort of reinflated to after that sort of downdraft in the second half of last year, and views that steel will edge down a little bit from here. But even notwithstanding that, your customers, from our conversations with them, pretty much expect you to increase prices each year and it does appear as if you with steel, having reinflated again recently, that that window is now open again. So what's the plan here? Are you looking to increase prices again in the second quarter? Ajita Rajendra : Scott, this is Ajita. As we\u2019ve discussed many times in the past, we are not going to speculate on pricing in the future. Scott Graham : Well that was direct. Okay. Ajita Rajendra : As it was meant to be. Scott Graham : I do understand that. I guess my last question would be. Where do you see your acquisition pipeline now versus, let\u2019s say, not even a year ago, maybe six months ago. I know there were some trade press that did some speculating that you were involved in one situation served the bidding. Just sort of wondering where that process is now, in your eyes, versus six to nine months ago? Ajita Rajendra : I'm not sure, what you're referring to in particular, but in terms of total acquisition activity, its very similar situation there. There is a lot of activity. There are opportunities out there. We are looking at opportunities. The prices are still high, and as we've always said, that we need to be able to speed the value proposition. We need to able to see returning across the capital to our shareholders in a reasonable period of time and we are running a very disciplined process. And for obvious reasons, we are not going to be able to comment on something until it's a done deal. So we're not going to speculate on something that's in process. We can't. Scott Graham : That\u2019s fine. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Giannakouros with Oppenheimer. Your question please. James Giannakouros : Thank you. Good morning everyone. On U.S. resi, are you seeing any influences on volumes from retail, storefront consolidation, and I guess an adjacent question there, are any sales, in a meaningful way, moving online in the U.S. specifically? Ajita Rajendra : I'm not aware of anything moving online, and from a retail storefront, I don't think it\u2019s really affected our major customers expect for obviously Sears. There is some impact from that as they the pull some stores. John Kita : You get the occasional water heater online, but its not anything big, but we do \u2013 Rinnai is on way fare, I mean it's a tankless product and that's the only thing I know of that's online. We know it\u2019s an online, we know it's a regular online retailer. James Giannakouros : Okay. And as a follow up, and I'm sorry if missed it. Rest of word margins, I think you said you are confident in getting to over 14%. How should we be thinking about mixed influences, price cost and volume leverage, if not the - if you can't quantify, I mean, just if you can rank order the influences there that would be helpful. Thanks. John Kita : Well, so we were at about very similar to the prior year, 12.4%, I think, compared to the prior year. And I will tell you first quarter margins that rest of world were negatively impacted by some decisions we made in the air purification market. That market has not been growing as fast as we expected. We want to position our brand strongly on that, so actually profitability was about $2 million worse than the first quarter of last year in air purification. We think that's going to be a good investment as we talked about. We think by the end of the year, where air purification loss $5 million last year, we think we'll approach breakeven, we probably won't get there, but we'll approach it. So we made that conscious decision to promote that product in the first quarter. So that's why you probably didn\u2019t see the contribution margin on that incremental sale to the level you would have expected. But as we go forward, it\u2019s a combination of volume, obviously, we talked about price increases going to be negatively affected by steel and what we're doing from an installation standpoint, but we won't get much benefit of that as we look out specifically in the second, third and fourth quarters. So it's kind of a combination of things. James Giannakouros : Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bhupender Bohra with Jeffries. Your question, please. Bhupender Bohra : Hi. Good morning, guys. The question for Ajita here. I'm just trying to understand the China - the rest of world margins here, if you can explain how? You said like there was pre-buy in the quarter and organically I think, John said I think you grew like 16%. So when you have organic growth, you definitely need to spend or do more advertising and selling expenses, but how does that work out when there is a pre-buy scenario like shouldn't - I believe like there should be less, those sales should be less SG&A weighted sales than actually organic sales? Ajita Rajendra : So there are a couple of things that happened. The price increase, which was 3% to 3.5% went in late in the quarter. So we had - John has made about $15 million of in sales. That was the pre-buy portion of it. Okay, most of the pricing, we\u2019re not going to be seeing until the second quarter. Also, the cost increases we were talking about, really but they are the fourth quarter, the steel price, the steel cost, the increase that they gave to our installer, et cetera was there for the whole quarter. Also, as John explained, we did some very aggressive promoting of our air purification product because again, we see significant opportunity for that category to grow and when we see the opportunities to drive those sales and make sure the consumer understands clearly, the value proposition of our product and the fact that we're in that market, which is a new market for us, we take the opportunity like we said, we saw about an 80% growth in air purification in the quarter. So, the opportunities to really drive home some very aggressive advertising too. So it's all of those things that come together that impacted. John you want to\u2026? John Kita : Yes. I think to just reinforce depend on I try to answer it, but obviously I didn't. Yes, the incremental sales, from the pre-buy, were about $15 million. We did get, we think, contribution margin on that but that was offset by our additional investment in air purification where we lost an incremental $2 million over the prior year. So that's why you didn't see as much drop in to the bottom line. Bhupender Bohra : Okay. Got it. I understand that now. The other thing was on the price increase, so that's basically broad-based on all the China products, not just water heater which is the bulk of the business there? John Kita : Yes, it covers most of the products and most of the geographies and we would guess it probably covers 85% to 90% of our business. Ajita Rajendra : There were some markets, some big markets there for example like Beijing, where we - the comparative situation we decided not to do things. So, it's like that and just giving an example, its wasn't an across the board, all geographies type of price increase. Bhupender Bohra : Okay. And my last question on the - we have seen the water treatment business kind of the market growth for that business has been kind of 40% plus, I think that's what you said on the fourth quarter call and we saw much higher than that. Do you think the market growth itself has accelerated or was this just kind of the first quarter was like one-off? John Kita : Some of that growth in water treatment was also associated with the pre-buy. We rose prices on water treatment. So there was a pre-buy in the water treatment segment. We grew 40%, but the industry, I think the last numbers we saw the industry in 2016 grew, about 30% to 31%. And I think the forecast for this year is about 30%, and we're certainly comfortable with that, but clearly water treatment had some pre-buy in the first quarter also. Bhupender Bohra : Okay. That\u2019s all I have. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Summerville with Alembic Global Advisors. Matt Summerville : Thanks. Couple of questions. First, have you been surprised by the continued strength we're seeing in the small commercial electric product in North America and I guess, what you attribute that continued strength to at this point, relative to how fast the non-res market is growing more broadly speaking? Ajita Rajendra : Well I guess when we saw the increase in the first quarter was a combination of two things. It was the greater than 55 electric and our guess is there is still some carryover associated with NAECA, where that product was eliminated. So you either have commercial customers that were buying residential are now buying commercial or you would have residential customers that were buying commercial are now buying residential \u2013 I am sorry were buying residential are now buying commercial. So we think that's part of it. And then yes, we saw pretty significant - I mean a couple of thousand units increased in the lower electric too. The less than 55 and the only thing we can come up with is high-rises and those sorts of things as the utilization of that has improved. Matt Summerville : Now you've owned Aquasana for a couple of quarters, is the $10 million contribution you saw in Q1 consistent with your longer-term targets and how you built up the revenue synergy case around to making that acquisition? And have you started to shift product from China into the U.S. through that channel and vice versa Aquasana into China through your established channels there? John Kita : I would tell you, Aquasana was up about 11% to 12% compared to the prior year which is what the expectation was. And very little process which was what the expectation was similar to the prior year. Their fourth quarter is traditionally their strongest quarter as a primarily retail provider and we never expected the revenue synergies out of the gate because there is government approval. We certainly want to as we've talked about we're doing some market studies. We want to understand the market and then make the determination of which products go where and under what brand et cetera. So we're in the process of that and we never expected that for the first couple of quarters. We should start seeing we hope some revenue synergies you know later on second half of the Year Later here but after that. John Kita : Yes. And the synergies are on track right? Ajita Rajendra : If anything maybe a little bit ahead of track so I'd say there is only and that's - that's good. Matt Summerville : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Your question please. Robert McCarthy : Good morning everyone congratulations on yet another solid quarter. I guess the first question Aquasana I think it should be about 10.3 million in revenues for the first quarter that's a little bit above bloats crew. Talk a little bit about the seasonality the business how should we think about modeling in? John Kita : Well, I think traditionally the fourth quarter is the strongest in the first quarter. And you know the other two quarters in between the two to move up. So again it's very close to what we project with what we did or planned. And no surprise again that the fourth quarter been strong. Robert McCarthy : Okay. And then obviously I think you're going to push this question back pretty quickly but you're not going to share with us in the quarter volume price acquisition on a percentage basis for North American or Western world. John Kita : Well for North America we told you that $100 million for Aquasana okay? Robert McCarthy : Yes. John Kita : We told you that the price increase that went in place for residential and August you guys can do some math. And residential was off and commercial was up. So I mean I think you can you can do your calculations for the world. What we tried to say is that we think about 15 million of that increase to free buy in China. India was fairly close. Europe was a little bit loss on profit and sales but - but again we continue to make big piece which is 15 million of what we think is pretty bad. Robert McCarthy : The last question I mean obviously I think Scott Graham touched on - on acquisition uppercase as a whole but is ready for us in terms of Boushey capacity and wherewithal our appetites and we're not apatite but where with all how much how big a deal you can do from your perspective. John Kita : Well if you look at we have 717 million or what up cash I think Pat 720 on cash we are under levered with 19% we said we could go up at 35 or 40 percent capital. So we have a significant amount of room obviously to acquisition and return cash to shareholders et cetera. Robert McCarthy : Clear. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your question please. David MacGregor : Yes. Congratulations on all the progress. I guess the question is on China as its kind of a bigger picture question, but a big part of the growth over there as I understand it is kind of expanding geographically, I realize you start from Q1 markets, you've been moving out to Q2 and Q3 and so. I guess the question is, underlying margin utilizations constant as you move out to those smaller markets? Or do fulfillment cost and other factors suggest that maybe that margin progression geographically is not constant? Thanks. Ajita Rajendra : I would say there are fairly consistent, to my knowledge. As we move out into Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities they are certainly, middle class and upper-middle class people in the outlying cities. Now, I will tell you our store sales in Tier 2 and Tier 3 as not as high as they are in Tier 1, on a per store basis. But from margin standpoint, I think not a significant. John Kita : And the other thing is that the cities in China are getting bigger also. Beijing is still growing, the whole drive to urbanization, is driving people from the hinterland into the big cities, so it isn\u2019t just second and third tier cities that are growing. The big cities are also growing. So we see that growing happening all over. David MacGregor : Okay. Thanks. Just as my follow-up, I guess, regulatory question on repatriation of cash under proposed tax reform. What would be your thoughts in term of repatriation of cash and how would you put those proceeds to work? Ajita Rajendra : Well, it really depends on how they end up doing it. I mean, the initial talk was there tax cash that you have overseas at one level and then the difference between cash and under remitted earnings had a different level. I haven't heard much about a holiday's so that won't, happen, doesn't appear. But the cash overseas, depending on how it all falls out, we may not bring it back immediately because we're looking, from an acquisition standpoint, globally. So obviously, if I did an acquisition in the U. S., I may bring it back. I if did an acquisition internationally, I'd rather have the money where it is now, in Europe and China, depending on where you do it. And then, there's also factors like do they eliminate interest expense. We have some interest expense in the U.S., we've evaluated, so we're not going to pre-decide what we're going to do until we see the ultimate. David MacGregor : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Connors with Boenning & Scattergood. Your question please. Ryan Connors : Great. Thank you. So my question was a little more strategic in nature. I want to get your take on kind of brand and channel management for the A. O. Smith brand in particular, which I understand has always been an exclusively wholesale brand. So we're a little bit surprised to see the news, I guess a couple of weeks ago, that the A. O. Smith brand itself is not going to be available at Lowe's, and so \u2013 and actually couldn't help but notice that they've already slapped the A. O. Smith brand on one of the NASCAR racecar, and so forth. So it seems like a bit of a shift there in terms of the branding and channel strategy for that particular brand. And I'm curious, how should we interpret that whether that means going to try to leverage the broader brand, as you have in China, through Aquasana and so forth and whether that's interpretation, and also just wanted the risks and opportunities are associated with going down that route? Ajita Rajendra : Ryan, it's a great question. From our perspective, as we see the traditional channel boundaries blurring, the decision being made more and more by the consumer because online searches, and that's the first place people go looking products. We feel that having the A. O. Smith brand both at wholesale and retail, it\u2019s just going to make it a stronger brand and help our growth across the board, in both wholesale and in retail. The brand being at Lowe, gives it the opportunity to have 13 million viewings by consumers every week, and all of that will strengthen the brand which will make it a stronger brand at wholesale and at retail. So long-term, we think a great growth opportunity for the company. Ryan Connors : Okay. And then just a follow up would be, managing the communication of what you've just communicated there with your wholesale and also hardcore contractor customers. I mean have you had any delivery efforts to manage that communication to make sure there was no misinterpretation of what you're trying to do and that sort of thing? Ajita Rajendra : Yes, so we\u2019ve - so we\u2019ve done that. We have talked to our major customers. I mean if there is public information it\u2019s out there. We met face-to-face with most of our major customers and extended to them, and they understand what we're trying to do with the brand. Ryan Connors : Okay. Great, well thanks for your time and congrats on the great results. Operator : Thank you. So there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ms. Ackerman for closing remarks. Patricia Ackerman : Thank you, all for joining us today. Please take note that we will participate in several conferences in the second quarter. We will be at Oppenheimer on May 10, in New York City. KeyBanc's Conference on May 31, in Boston, William Blair's conference in June 13, in Chicago, Stifel's conference on June 16, in New York City, and [indiscernible] on June 20 in Boston. Have a wonderful day. Operator : Thank you ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude this conference. Thank you very much for your participation. You may all disconnect. Have a wonderful day.",

Ma'am, you may begin. Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.: Thank you, Bridget. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on our 2017 second quarter results conference call. With me participating in the call are Ajita Rajendra, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Kita, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin with Ajita's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning's press release. Also, as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. I will now turn the call over to Ajita who will begin his remarks on slide 3. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Thank you, Pat, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Our double-digit sales growth in the second quarter was driven continued strong demand for our consumer products in China and positive end markets for our commercial water heaters and boilers in the U.S. and Canada. Here are a few highlights. Sales grew nearly 11% to $738 million. Excluding the impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar against the Chinese currency, our sales grew 12.5% in the quarter. China sales were up 20% in local currency. A. O. Smith branded water treatment sales grew over 40% in local currency and air purification product revenue quadrupled. Record-setting net earnings of $0.53 per share were 8% higher than our earnings per share in 2016. We continue to review our capital allocation and dedicate a portion of our cash to return to shareholders. Through the first half of 2017, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares for $66 million. We announced a 17% increase to our dividend earlier this year. The five-year compound annual growth rate of our dividend is over 25%. Many of you are aware that A. O. Smith joined the S&P 500 Index this morning. We are honored to join this prestigious group of U.S. company. Our inclusion is a significant milestone in our company's very rich history and a testament to the 15,000 men and women around the globe who work very hard every day, living our values and contributing to our success. Today marks a significant accomplishment for all of us. John will now describe our results in more detail, beginning with slide 4. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Thanks, Ajita. Sales for the second quarter of $738 million were 11% higher than the previous year. Net earnings in the second quarter of $92 million increased 6% from 2016. Second quarter earnings per share of $0.53 increased 8% compared with 2016. Sales in our North America segment of $471 million increased 9% compared with the second quarter of 2016. The increase in sales was primarily due to higher volumes of commercial water heaters and boilers in the U.S. and pricing actions in August 2016 related to steel cost increases and inflationary pressure on other costs. Aquasana, acquired in August of 2016, added $13 million to our North America segment sales. Rest of World segment sales of $273 million increased 14% compared with 2016. China sales increased 20% in local currency, driven by higher demand for our consumer products in the region, led by water treatment and air purification products, and pricing actions due to higher steel and other costs, which were announced earlier this year. On slide 6, North America segment earnings of $109 million were 5% higher than segment earnings in the prior year. The favorable impact from higher sales of commercial water heaters and boilers and the pricing actions in the U.S. were partially offset by significantly higher steel costs. Second quarter segment margin declined to 23.2% from 24.1% one year ago due to higher steel costs. The margin on our Aquasana products is lower than the segment average, which also contributed to the margin decline. Rest of World earnings of $32.5 million were essentially the same as one year ago. Higher China sales, including the price increase, were more than offset by higher steel costs, increased selling, general and administrative expenses and a less profitable sales mix in China. Advertising to support brand building and expansion of water treatment and air purification retail outlets in Tier 2 and 3 cities were the primary drivers of higher SG&A in China. Currency translation reduced China earnings by approximately $2 million compared with the prior year. As a result of these factors, second quarter segment margin was 11.9% compared with 13.8% last year. Our corporate expenses were essentially the same as one year ago. Our effective income tax rate in the second quarter of 2017 was 27.8%. The rate was lower than the 29.8% experienced during the second quarter last year, primarily due to lower state income taxes and a change in geographic earnings mix. The lower effective tax rate this year compared with the effective rate one year ago benefited 2017 results by $0.01 per share. Cash provided by operations during the first half of 2017 was $73 million compared with $155 million provided during the prior year. Higher earnings were more than offset by higher outlays for working capital. These factors resulted in lower cash flow in 2017. Our liquidity position and balance sheet remained strong. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 19% at the end of the second quarter. We have cash balances totaling $741 million located offshore, and our net cash position was approximately $366 million at the end of the quarter. During the first half of 2017, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of common stock for a total of $66 million. Approximately 3.6 million shares remained on our existing repurchase authority at the end of June. This morning, we increased the midpoint of our 2017 EPS guidance by $0.03 per share with a range of between $2.07 and $2.11 per share. The midpoint of our EPS guidance represents a 13% increase in EPS compared with our 2016 results. Please turn to slide 9 for several 2017 assumptions. We expect our cash flow from operations in 2017 to be approximately $375 million, which is lower than the $447 million generated in 2016. We expect higher earnings in 2017, but also larger outlays for working capital due to the higher-than-anticipated cash flows in the fourth quarter of 2016. Over the two-year period from 2016 to 2017, we expect to generate operating cash of approximately $825 million, which compares with $612 million during 2014 to 2015. We broke ground in 2016 on the construction of the new water treatment and air purification manufacturing facility in Nanjing to support the strong growth of these products in China. Our 2017 capital spending plans of approximately $100 million includes $45 million related to this plant. Total costs for the facility, which is expected to begin production in the second quarter of 2018, will be about $65 million. After this expansion, we expect capital spending in 2018 and beyond to be at levels equal to our depreciation plus amortization. Our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $70 million in 2017. As previously discussed, expenses related to our ERP implementation were $25 million in 2016 and are projected to decline to approximately $19 million in 2017. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $48 million in 2017, slightly higher than the $45 million in 2016, primarily due to higher expenses at our Corporate Technology Center and commissioned water treatment market studies. Take note that our interest expense will be approximately $3 million higher in 2017 as a result of higher rates, share repurchase activities and our acquisition last year. Our effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 28.5% in 2017, lower than the 29.4% rate in 2016. This assumption is predicated on no change to the current U.S. tax regime. We expect to repurchase our shares in the amount of approximately $135 million in 2017 under a 10b5-1 plan. We may opportunistically repurchase additional shares up to $65 million. If $135 million of our stock is repurchased, we expect our average diluted outstanding shares in 2017 will be approximately 174.5 million. I will now turn the call back to Ajita, who will summarize our guidance, the business assumptions for 2017 and our growth strategy beginning on slide 10. Ajita. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Thank you, John. We project revenue growth to be between 11.5% and 12.5% in local currency term in 2017, and 10% to 11% in U.S. dollar term. We expect Aquasana sales will be approximately $55 million this year and slightly accretive to earnings. Aquasana sales were up nearly 20% for the first six months of this year compared with last year. With a full year of Aquasana sales as part of A. O. Smith, we expect our global water treatment product sales will be over $275 million in 2017. We project that Chinese currency will depreciate slightly from current levels against the U.S. dollar, resulting in a 4% or $38 million revenue headwind compared with the average rate in 2016. Specific to our North America segment, we project the U.S. residential water heater industry volumes will increase approximately 300,000 units in 2017 due to new construction and expansion of replacement demand. We project U.S. commercial water heater industry volumes will be up 5% to 7% with most, if not all, of the growth in electric units. Lochinvar-branded products grew 5% in the first half of 2017, driven by strong demand for water heaters and solid growth in commercial boilers. We expect double-digit full-year boiler sales growth driven by continued market share gain, new product introduction and energy-efficient product growth. We expect the total portfolio of Lochinvar-branded products to grow 8% into 2017. In 2017, steel prices continue to move up. We expect steel costs in the third quarter will be the highest year-to-date. We recently announced the price increase of approximately 4% on the majority of our U.S. water heater products, effective late August. These factors lead us to expect our North American segment operating margin will be between 21.75% and 22% despite the headwind from lower Aquasana EBIT margin of nearly 40 basis points. We have received several questions about the Sears-Amazon announcement last week. We manufacture water heater exclusively for Sears with the Kenmore brand. Based on our conversation with Sears, water heaters are not part of the program with Amazon. Let me repeat that. Based on our conversation with Sears, water heaters are not part of the program with Amazon. Specific to our Rest of World segment, we are a consumer products company in China, which distinguishes us from most industrial companies operating in China. We grew 23% in local currency in the first half of 2017, led by water treatment and air purification products. With a strong start to the year, partially due to the pre-buy in the first half, we expect China sales will be up low-double digits in the second half of the year and approaching 17% in local currency for the year. We project improved profitability and operating margins in our Rest of World segment in the second half of the year compared to the first half due to a full-year benefit from the price increase and lower advertising expenses as a percent of sales in China. We made some adjustments to the price increase in China late in the second quarter to broaden its impact. Improved profitability in India due to the normal seasonality of water heater business will also contribute to higher Rest of World margin in the second half of the year compared to the first half. We expect Rest of World margins will be approximately 14% for the year. Please advance to slide number 11. Our total company organic growth model continues to assume 8% growth for the foreseeable future. Especially in these uncertain economic times, we believe our organic growth potential and our stable defensive replacement markets, which we believe represent approximately 85% of North America water heater and boiler volumes, positively differentiates A. O. Smith among other industrial companies. Coupled with growth and stability, we have a strong balance sheet poised to take advantage of strategic acquisitions that add shareholder value as well as allow us to return cash to shareholders. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Good morning, all. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Hi, Scott. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): John, the steel inflation has gotten a little tamer in recent months. But nevertheless, I'm sure we get your point here. Could you kind of, once again, go over how this rolls into the margin, because it seems like the price increase from last summer, which I think was geared toward offsetting inflation two, three quarters down the line, that something in the spot market, I guess, or the percentage of your spot purchases, has been an offset. Is that a reasonable characterization? But I'm just looking for you to sketch that out for us, because I wouldn't have expected steel inflation to continue to offset the price increase from last summer without some kind of impetus from the spot market. Could you help me with that? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: I'll try. I will tell you our steel prices have increased every quarter this year. And clearly compared to the prior years, they're up significantly from the prior year. So when we tear apart, for example, North America second quarter, the pricing could not offset the steel increases last year. I mean, the price increase last year did not offset the steel increases in the second quarter. However, as we talked about in our script, commercial water heaters was extremely strong for us in the quarter, as was commercial boilers. So, those were the contributors on why we had a net positive for the quarter. So, I don't know if that answers it, Scott, or not, but we've had continual increase in steel costs. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Well, you know. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Every quarter this year. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): No. And I get that, but I'm just trying to differentiate between, three quarters ago when we put this price increase out, that was supposed to be an offset. So obviously, something has happened in the spot market. What are your spot purchases in North America? Maybe that would help. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Well, I'll take that Scott. When we put it in, there was an anticipation that steel prices, and we talked about it on the year-end call that we thought steel prices would level off and maybe decline. We haven't seen that at all, and they've continued to increase. So, I think that's part of the factor on why we're seeing what we're seeing is they continued to increase higher than what we put. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Right, what our assumptions were. Yeah. Internally. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): All right. Two other questions, North American residential water heaters not talked about at all in the press release, in your prepared comments. Why was that seemingly softer in the second quarter? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Well, I'd say they weren't talked about because they were flat to the year, prior year. And you saw that certainly in the April and May data. And I'll tell you what we saw in June, it was the same. So, it was very flat with the prior year. And then, when you look, that's down a couple hundred thousand units from the first quarter. But I'll tell you, overall, we're pleased where the industry is. It's up almost 200,000 when you include tankless year-over-year. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. And I think a part of it is timing because we had a very strong first half. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: First quarter. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: First quarter, sorry. And so, it's just the timing of the cutoff, I think. If you look at the first half, it's about where we expected it to be. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Thank you. Last question is on the Amazon agreement last week. I think that there are some, including myself, speculating that the agreement doesn't end here, that it starts to, at some point down the line, one, two, three years, Amazon moves quickly, so, that's probably more like one to two years, starts to impact the water heater and HVAC markets. And purely, what would be a hypothetical, if that does happen, it would seem as if Sears would potentially stand to benefit and they're a large customer. But the flip side is that, has Amazon \u2013 has Sears told you about any designs that Amazon might have on private label, which would probably have to be a U.S. manufacturer, which could benefit you or could not benefit you, depending upon \u2013 again, this is speculative, but I'm just wondering what Sears has told you, potentially, on the water heater becoming part of that agreement, but also the potential for private label down the line? Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Scott, let me answer the question from a practical perspective, because I don't want to get into too much speculation. The white goods that are distributed by Sears go out of about approximately 200 different DCs around the country. Okay? The water heaters that are distributed by Sears go out of about six DCs around the country. So, the distribution network is nowhere near as close. The second point is that in most places, a water heater needs a licensed plumber to install it; whereas, a lot of white goods is plug-and-play. So, from a practical perspective, leaving aside the big, bulky, heavy, relatively low-value water heaters, moving these around one at a time just becomes economically not feasible. So, we're not speculating too much or don't see too much of an impact coming from this. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And the private label, is that something that Sears has mentioned that maybe Amazon has spoken with them about within appliances? Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: I mean, we private label for Sears under the Kenmore brand. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Right. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: We've been doing that for many, many, many years. And... R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Well, I... Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: I don't see that changing. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Certainly, no, I do understand that. But what I was talking about was maybe a new private label brand. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: We have had no indications of that at all. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah, I know. This is only a speculative question. I get it. It's hard one, and I appreciate it. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: It would be, in this it will be very difficult to really execute on something like that. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Is a good point. Thank you, Ajita. Thank you, John. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Charley Brady with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is open. Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Good morning, Pat. Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hey. Just on the price increases that relates to steel and the new one that's going through. Are you anticipating that that new pricing will fully offset or is there still a net negative headwind on pricing despite the price increase? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Well, obviously, it depends where steel goes, but we would expect it will offset. Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Well, assuming that steel stays flat from where it is today, it would offset it, correct? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then, in terms of the China, the drop or the pull back in advertising expense, is that something that we should expect from a longer-term perspective, or is it a temporary or transitory issue just kind of in the back half of the year, and in 2018, it needs to pick back up again? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: No, I would say, it probably doesn't need to pick up in 2018. You always have a situation where in the first half of the year, and we experienced that in the second quarter, you have some pretty significant trade shows, where we spent, gosh, $2.5 million, $3 million at the appliance and electronics shows in the second quarter at the Aquatech Show, at the Boiler Show, et cetera. So, we wouldn't \u2013 that's not going to repeat itself in the second half. But obviously, we've said all along, advertising is a key component of our SG&A expense as we maintain the brand and build the brand in some of our water treatment and air purification and combi businesses. But I think given some of those expenses in the first half that won't repeat themselves, we're comfortable advertising being down first half year to second half year. Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And just one more for me then. In terms of geographies where you really don't play in right now, you've talked previously about potential areas you can go into and the other areas where it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Can you kind of update on opportunities to expand beyond where you are geographically today? Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. This is Ajita. We're building a business in Vietnam, which is primarily water treatment, and there's potential for water heater to follow; wherein India, we are exporting into South America and other markets. So, from the point of view \u2013 and also we have now in addition to the U.S. exports, which have been established and been there a while, we have two other low-cost country manufacturing locations which we can export from; primarily India and also China, although China capacity is a little more limited \u2013 available for export. From that perspective, you could see us exporting from our current manufacturing bases to other countries. In terms of setting up factories in other countries, we don't see anything in the near future just because the scale isn't there to support a manufacturing location. Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open. Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Just back on the Rest of World margins, can you just talk about the \u2013 I mean, it seems like first half, you were running sub-12% and you're saying 14% for the year. So, maybe just bridge us first half to second half on kind of getting there. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Sure. Well, let's talk about the second quarter first, so you understand what happened, because sales were off and not much dropped to the bottom line. What we had is about two-thirds of our sales increase came from water treatment and air purification. We spent pretty significantly on SG&A and grew the distribution and advertising. So, their profits, even though on two-thirds of the profits \u2013 two-thirds of the sales were about flat. Our most profitable major SBU, water heaters, was actually flat in the second quarter which, quite frankly, we expected because of the pre-buy that happened in the first quarter. But we didn't expect is that profits would actually be down and it was a combination of conversion costs, but also some mix. We alluded to mix in the press release and what it was, was some of the high-end electric, fully featured was a smaller percent in the total for the quarter compared to the prior year. So then, we also spent on a new product that we're bringing out, the point of use softener, we spent about $1 million on that, had a loss of $1 million. So, what happened is the higher sales that we got from commercial, that we got from combi, that we got from parts was \u2013 parts business is doing very well, kind of offset those losses, so we ended up neutral. Now, when we look to the second half of the year versus the first half of the year, what we have is we're going to get the full benefit of the half-year price increase. And as we alluded to in Ajita's comments, we expanded that price increase in June. And so, we expect to get significantly more price the second half of the year than the first half of the year. If you recall, we basically got nothing in January \u2013 I mean, in the first quarter from a price standpoint. And then, two, as we said, SG&A, we expect advertising will be down second half compared to the first half, et cetera. So, that's kind of the major pieces of the bridge from the first half to the second half as well as what happened to the margin in the second quarter. Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then, Lochinvar, I think you said, Ajita, is up 5% year-to-date. I think you're still saying 8% for the full year. So, what's kind of second half visibility for that step-up? Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: I think we're seeing the boiler business pick up some of the things we talked about in the first quarter in terms of lots of quoting activity, but the projects being kind of slow. We see that picking up. We are picking up market share, because we were up in the first half. And best information we have is that the market was about flat. And we have some really interesting new products coming out. So, combination of all of that gives us confidence in terms of continuing that growth trend in the second half. Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for the color, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alvaro Lacayo with Gabelli & Company. Your line is open. Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company: Good morning, everyone. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company: Just two quick questions regarding pricing. In North America, the 4%, that's going to be across all the product lines, just wondering, or if it's going to be only specific to certain areas? And then, in China, with the price adjustment that was mentioned on the call, if you can maybe just provide a little more color in terms of is it from a magnitude standpoint or is it going to be extended across other products? And then, I didn't really hear a size, so in terms of how much that price increase or how it'll impact in the second half, that'd be great. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: So, I'll start with the China. The China, we did expand it to encompass more products, so it included commercial, it included combi. We also adjusted some of the prices on some of the existing products that we raised in the first quarter. So, to give you a percentage that kind of varies by SBU, I couldn't even give you an average right now. But we did expand it and we also added to some of the existing increases we had in the first quarter. With respect to North America, it would cover the majority of the products, but we did not raise it on things such as tankless and specialty water heaters, such as heat pump, et cetera. So, it was not an increase on that. And as you know, some of our customers have a pass-through for steel, so it didn't affect those. Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with Alembic Global. Your line is open. Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Thank you. Just a couple follow-up questions. First, on the commercial side of the business, I think you guys in the Q&A early on gave some color as to what you saw in the residential market in June. I was wondering if you could provide that same color for the commercial market. And then also remind us, sort of between gas and electric, what your relative market share is on the commercial side and, I guess, how that electric side has been progressing post that efficiency standard change? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Well, I'll tell you the first part, which is commercial, June was very strong for us and, we assume, for the market. So, if you look at the first two months of commercial, it was kind of a net flat, but we saw a very strong, and quite frankly, we were up in the first two months even though the market was flat, and then we saw a very strong June. So, that's with respect to commercial water heaters. And as Ajita alluded to, on the boiler side, if you look at our commercial boiler business, it was actually up high teens. The residential boilers were down, partly because of a difficult comp last year, and also as we bring out our new product, getting the heat exchangers is going a little slower than we thought. But we had a very strong commercial boiler business in the second quarter. So, commercial right now, and I know there's mixed signals out there, the Dodge Index is good, the Architectural Index is good, but they're starting to say adjustments could slow in the second half of the year, but we're certainly not seeing it. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. And just one point of clarification on the residential comp, we brought on a large new customer last year. So, there was a buy-in. Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Understood. And then just a follow-up with respect to China. You mentioned sort of the base water heater business was flattish in Q2, likely the result of the pre-buy you saw in Q1, so that's fairly understandable. Have you started to see, three, four weeks into the third quarter, have you started to see that base water heater business, from a volume standpoint, begin to rebound? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: One, I don't know and two, I'm not sure we'd really comment if we knew. I mean, I think I'll say we're tracking where we thought where we're going to be in July. Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors with Boenning & Scatter (sic) [Boenning & Scattergood]. Your line is open. Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Great. Thank you. I appreciate all the color earlier on the new arrangement with the Sears-Amazon, but wanted to just actually touch on the other shift in channel strategy that you mentioned on the last call, which is the new arrangement with Lowe's. And if you can give us any color there on how that's progressed in terms of sell-through, any competitive update there in terms of how that's impacted the wholesale side, if at all. Just any update there would be great. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: That whole changeover is on track. It's gone about as expected. And all the stores have the product and we haven't seen any major shifts. It's kind of as expected, on track. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. We're comfortable the inventory levels are where they should be. Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Right. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: So, that's a positive. So, they've been able to sell out the old, if you will. And so, the inventory levels are where we want them to be, if you will. Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Okay. And no sign that there's any impact on the wholesale side in terms of losing the purity there of being a wholesale brand and so forth? Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: No. Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Okay. And then, my other quick question was on air purification in China. Really, seems like that is gaining some pretty significant steam here. I know it's a small base, but at this pace, it could be material pretty quickly. So, can you give us an update there in terms of sizing that and whether you envision that now becoming a more significant material contributor to the overall picture in China? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: I guess, I'd say it's tracking where we thought. Last year, we sold about $25 million. This year, we expect to sell about $45 million. We did say it was 4 times and that's true, but last year, it was $2.5 million in the second quarter. So, it was about $10 million in the second quarter this year, which is \u2013 that's not the prime season. The prime seasons are the fourth quarter and the first quarter. I would tell you, and Ajita may disagree, but the estimates for the growth are not as good as what they are for the water treatment. I think most of them are kind of \u2013 estimates are high teens, versus water treatment, clearly, it's 30%-plus. But air purification, we're trying to get a position in the marketplace that we've spent on advertising, et cetera, and to build the brand, and trying to develop products that we think can differentiate it. So, I'd say we're tracking where we thought we were going to be. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. I think, in terms of just looking out into the future and the potential, it does certainly have the potential to be a much larger business than it is today. But it is a seasonal business. There's about half the year that it sells. There's robust sales, and then during the summertime it isn't as much. Whereas water treatment in comparison, is a year-round product, and just because of the reasonably low household penetration of water treatment products, frankly both products, we see lots of room for both of those businesses to grow. Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Got it. Well, thanks for your time. Operator : And our next question is from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is open. Robert Aurand - Longbow Research LLC : Thank you. Robert Aurand on for David today. Quick question on the pricing in North America, you say it's going to do effect in late August this year. First, I believe, was August 1st last year. How should we think about that gap in terms of profitability here in early 3Q? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: I'll try to answer. There is a gap between August and September. We wouldn't expect there would be much pre-buy. It'll happen mostly within the quarter because we'll try to limit it to a month or so. So, we wouldn't expect there will be much pre-buy effect on the quarter. But yeah, there is a gap in the pricing of modeling. Robert Aurand - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. And then, looking at China, we had maybe heard that some of the domestic manufacturers there are getting more aggressive in the high end of the market. Are you seeing that? And if so, what kind of impact might that have on ASP realizations there? Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Your statement is true, but it's not a new phenomenon. It's always been that way. So, from the perspective of any change, we really don't see a change. I've always said China is one of the most competitive markets in the world, because you have every manufacturer in the world there and fighting for space. So, we don't really see a change. It is very competitive. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: And I think our competitive advantage of having built up that infrastructure from an engineering standpoint and being first to market with products and with features that the consumer wants, that's still very much in agreement. Robert Aurand - Longbow Research LLC : Right. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: And so, the engineering, the advertising, the brand building, all of that that supports our premium brand position is intact and we keep strengthening it. Robert Aurand - Longbow Research LLC : All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Larry De Maria with William Blair. Your line is open. Larry T. De Maria - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks and good morning. As far as the air treatment and water purification, and Rest of World, which is obviously mostly China, can you remind us maybe the profitability either in the quarter or on an annual basis and if they're losing money this year and if they can swing to positive next year as we continue to grow like this given those mid-teens and 30%-plus growth rates you talked about, until we should swing positive next year? Can you just discuss the profitability of those businesses? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Sure. I'll start with air purification, we lost about $5 million last year. We'll lose probably about $2 million this year, but I think our run rate at the end of the year will be breakeven. So, we expect to be breakeven for the year, next year, or profitable in air purification. Water treatment, we are profitable and have been. I think that the litany of our water treatment is a good example of how we try to leverage the high gross margins that we have in this product to ultimately get them to profitability. So when we started the water treatment, we probably lost $10 million, then we lost $6 million, then we made $3 million. And last year, we were at about low-double-digit margins. So, it's a nicely profitable business for us, not at the average for the business, but certainly progressing that way. Larry T. De Maria - William Blair & Co. LLC: That's great. And can you just size that business for us as well, like you do for the treatment business? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Well, I think we said that water treatment will be about $185 million or so in China with the A. O. Smith brand. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: And the $275 million I referred to was worldwide. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. It was worldwide. Larry T. De Maria - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got you. Okay. Very good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Bhupender Bohra with Jefferies. Your line is open. Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC : Hey, good morning, guys. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC : Hey. Congratulations getting the stock into S&P 500 here. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Thank you. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Thank you. Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC : And my question was around the \u2013 Ajita, you talked about the retail expansion in the release, you've talked about like Tier 2 and Tier 3, especially on the water treatment side. Could you update us on the retail stores you have in China today? And I don't know if you're doing anything different specific to water treatment, air purification on the retail side? Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Go ahead. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Well, to give you an idea, we're over 9,000 stores in the water heater, so about 9,400, 9,500. We would be over 7,000 stores. We've grown that pretty dramatically this year, probably about 900 units or so this year in the water treatment. So, we're over 7,000. In air purification, we're probably at about 3,000 stores or so. Now, again, those last two would probably have a higher percent online. But from a store standpoint, we're continuing to do what we've always done is we'll be the first to tell you there are some underperforming stores. We evaluate those stores quarterly. And ultimately, if we're not comfortable with the forecast of being able to get them to a reasonable level, we'll shut them. And we'll continue to prune stores minus and add stores. So, I think it's a consistent philosophy we've had for the last several years. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: And also, in terms of the new categories getting into the stores, it's always an evaluation of the cost of getting in, which is training the people, getting the merchandising, the fixturing and all of that for a new category versus what we expect in terms of revenue and profitability. So, that balance and evaluation that we make whenever you're going to a new store versus not. So, that whole process is an ongoing process. Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And was there any specific portion to Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities? I mean, that's what, I think, you specified in the release here in the quarter. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: I think that's where the area of expansion is. That's where the growth in new housing, I'd say, is occurring. And so, we've been moving into that for the last couple of years. Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Got it. And just a follow-on on the Aquasana headwind, I think you mentioned, for this year, it's going to be about like 40 bps. It seems like that's a little bit less than 50 bps on the last quarterly call you mentioned. So, things are progressing well, I guess, on the Aquasana side. Can you give us some color, like how the cost-saving synergies, which you have talked about, are coming through? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. Well, I think we've said approximately 50 bps. Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.: Less than. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Less than 50 bps. I'd say, I think it's progressing well. Year-to-date, we're up 20% in sales. And the cost synergies that we forecast, I'd say, are probably a little bit ahead. Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC : Yeah, and... Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: The revenue synergy is probably slightly behind. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah, right. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: But overall, we are very happy with the performance and where we are strategically with that acquisition. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: And I'd say, their P&L impact has not really changed. They're on plan and meeting the expectations from a P&L standpoint. Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Just one moment while we wait for questions. I'm not showing any further questions. I'll now turn the call back over to Pat Ackerman for closing remarks. Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.: Thank you, all, for joining us today. Please take note that we will participate in the Jefferies Conference in New York City on August 9. Have a wonderful day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.",

I will now turn the call over to Ajita, who will begin his remarks on Slide 3. Ajita Rajendra : Thank you, Pat, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. A double digit sales growth in the third quarter was driven by continued strong demand for our consumer products in China and positive end markets for our boilers and residential water heaters in North America. Here are few highlights. Sales grew 10% to $750 million. Currency fluctuations had a negligible impact to sales in the third quarter. China sales were up nearly 13%. A. O. Smith branded water treatment sales grew 31% year-to-date and air purification product revenue doubled. So record setting earnings at $0.54 per share were 15% higher than our third quarter earnings per share in 2016. We are delighted to work on the Hague team to the A. O. Smith family, through our acquisition of the U.S. based water softener company in early September. Hague fits squarely in our acquisition strategy to grow our global water treatment platform. We are excited about the global opportunities, Hague's innovative and high quality products bring us as well as Hague\u2019s experience water quality dealer network. We continue to review our capital allocation and dedicate a portion of our cash to return to shareholders. Through the first nine months of 2017, we repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares for $103 million. We announced a 17% increase to our dividend earlier this year. The five year compound annual growth rate of our dividend is over 25%. A. O. Smith joined the S&P 500 Index in July. We are honored to join this prestigious group of U.S. Company. Our inclusion is a significant milestone in our company\u2019s rich 143 year history. John will now describe our results in more details beginning with Slide number 4. John Kita : Sales for the third quarter of $750 million were 10% higher than the previous year. Net earnings in the third quarter of $94 million increased 13% from 2016. Third quarter earnings per share of $0.54 increased 15% compared to 2016. Sales in our North America segment of $486 million increased 8% compared to the third quarter of 2016. The increase in sales was primarily due to increase sales of boilers, higher volumes of residential water heaters and pricing actions related to steel cost increases. North American water treatment sales comprised with weaker Hague as well as full quarter of Aquasana incrementally added approximately 8 million to our North America segment sales. Rest of world segment sales of $270 million increased 12% compared with 2016. China sales increased 13%, driven by higher demand for our consumer products in the region, led by water treatment and air purification products, and pricing actions primarily due to higher steel and installation cost. On Slide 6, North America operating earnings of $110 million were 10% higher than segment earnings in the prior year. The same from higher sales of boilers and residential water heaters and the pricing action in the U.S. were partially offset by higher steel cost. These factors drove third quarter 2017 segment margins higher to 22.7% compared with 22.3% last year. Rest of world earnings of $34 million improved 9% compared with one year ago. Higher China sales including pricing action were partially offset by higher steel cost, higher fees paid to installers and increased selling, general and administrative expenses. Cost associated with the expansion of retail outlets in tier two and tier three cities had sell the company\u2019s water treatment and air purification products and higher water treatment product development engineering parts was primary dives the higher SG&A in China. Third quarter segment margin was 4.5% compared to 4.9% last year due to these factors. Our corporate expenses were lower than one year ago. Our effected income tax rate in the third quarter 2017 was 28.8%, the rate was more than the 20.7% experienced during the third quarter last year, primarily due to lower state income taxes. The lower effective tax rate compared with the effective rate a year ago benefited 2017 results by $0.01 per share. Cash provided by operations during the first nine months of 2017 was $150 million compared with $264 million provided during the prior year. Higher earnings were more than offset by higher outlays for working capital. Our liquidity position and balance sheet remain strong. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 21% at the end of the third quarter. We have cash balances totaling $768 million located offshore, and our net cash position was approximately $318 million at the end of the quarter. We completed the acquisition of Hague, a U.S. based water softener company during third quarter for $44.5 million plus a potential earn out of up to $2 million. Primarily, as a result of continued strong cash flow and escalating PBGC premiums, we made a voluntary contribution to our pension plan of $30 million in the third quarter. The after-tax impact to our cash flow is approximately $18 million. During the first nine months of 2017, we repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares of common stock for total of $103 million. Approximately 3 million shares remained on our existing repurchase authority at the end of September. This morning, we increased the mid-point of our 2017 EPS guidance by $0.04 per share with the range of between $2.12 and $2.14 per share. The mid-point of our EPS guidance represents at 15% increase in EPS compared with our 2016 results.  Please turn to Slide 9 for several 2017 options. We expect our cash flow from operations in 2017 to be approximately $325 million, which is lower than the $447 million generated in 2016. We expect higher earnings in 2017 but also larger outlays for working capital due to the higher than anticipated cash flows in the fourth quarter of 2016. Over the two-year period from 2016 to 2017, we expect to generate operating cash flow of approximately $775 million, which compares with $612 million during 2014 to 2015. We programmed in 2016 on a construction of a new water treatment and air purification manufacturing facility in Nanjing to support the strong growth of these products in China. Our 2017 capital spending plans of approximately $100 million include $38 million related to this plant. Total cost for the facility, which is expected to begin production in the second quarter of 2018 will be about $67 million. Our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $70 million in 2017. As previously discussed, expenses related to our ERP implementation were $25 million in 2016, and are projected to decline to approximately $18 million in 2017. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $47 million in 2017, slightly higher than the $45 million in 2016, primarily due to higher expenses that our Corporate Technology Center and commissioned water treatment market studies. Take note that our interest expense will be approximately $3 million higher in 2017 as a result of higher rates, share repurchase activities and our acquisition of Aquasana and Hague. Our effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 28% in 2017, lower than the 29.4% rate in 2016, primarily due to lower state income taxes. The President\u2019s recently proposed tax plan and by Tax Reform Act to top of mind. We believe A. O. Smith could benefit significantly from cash reform. Approximately 60% to 65% of our total profits are derived in the U.S. We estimate the net impact form the combination of the proposed lower federal tax rate of 20%, the elimination of the manufactures tax credit and the smaller federal benefit from our state tax deduction would result in an approximately 40 million less federal income tax or over $0.20 per share based on 2017 earnings. Depending on the final tax reform plan, we couldn\u2019t hear one-time income tax expense associated with the repaid creation and measurement of differed taxes. We expect to repurchase our shares in the amount of approximately 135 million in 2017, under a 10b5-1 plan. We expect our average diluted outstanding shares in 2017 will be approximately $174.6 million. I will now turn the call back to Ajita who will summarize our guidance, the business assumptions for 2017, and our growth strategy beginning on Slide 10. Ajita? Ajita Rajendra : Thank you, John. We project revenue growth to be between 11% to 12% for the year. We expect Aquasana and Hague sales could be nearly $60 million this year and slightly accretive to earnings. Aquasana sales were up nearly 18% in the first nine months of this year compared to last year. Including North America water filter and softener sales, we expected on global, water treatment product sales will be approximately $300 million in 2017. We project full year depreciation of the Chinese currency will be 2% from 2016, resulting in a $20 million headwind to sales. Specific to our North America segment, we project U.S. residential water heater industry volume will increase over 300,000 units in 2017 due to new construction and expansion of replacement demand. This assumption includes tankless units. We project U.S. commercial water heater industry volumes will be approximately 10% higher this year, primarily due to strong demand for electric units as well as an anticipated pre-buy in advance of regulatory change driven price increase effective January 1. Lochinvar branded products grew 17% in the third quarter and 9% in the first nine months of 2017, driven by solid demand for boilers and new product related market share gain. We expect the total portfolio of Lochinvar branded products to grow over 8% in 2017. As a result of rising steel costs, we increased prices by approximately 4% on the majority of our U.S. water heater products effective in late August. These factors lead us to expect our North American segment operating margin to be similar to 2016 margin of 22.1%, despite a 40 basis point headwind to operating margin from North America water treatment. Specific to our rest of world segment, our China sales grew 13% in the third quarter and we expect over 15% growth in local currency for the full year. We expect improved profitability in India due to scale in our water heater business.  We expect improvement in China margins in the fourth quarter resulting in full year margin of approximately 15% and flat to last year. As a result, we now expect rest of world segment operating margins will be similar to last year. Our total company organic growth model continues to assume 8% growth for the foreseeable future. Especially in these uncertain economic times, we believe our organic growth potential and our stable defensive replacement markets which we believe represent approximately 85% of North America water heater and boiler volumes positively differentiates A. O. Smith amongst other industrial companies.  Coupled with growth and stability, we have a strong balance sheet poised to take advantage of strategic acquisition that adds shareholder value, as well as allow us to return cash to shareholder. That concludes our prepared remarks and now we are available for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Matt Summerville from Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is open. Matt Summerville : Thanks, good morning. I want to ask you a couple questions on China. You mentioned some year-to-date numbers in treatment and purification, I was wondering if you could give a little more detail specific to the third quarter how those products performed and then what your outlook is for the full year while also commenting on the performance in the legacy water heater business in China during Q3? Thank you. John Kita : So, water treatment was up about 13% in the quarter and it\u2019s up in local currency year-to-date about 35%. And we would expect for the year is going to be after that range of 30 or so in local currency. Air purification was up 75% in the quarter is more than double year-to-date and we would expect it to be more than double for the year. Didn\u2019t touch, what was your last \u2013 was it something else. Matt Summerville : Yeah, the performance system in the legacy water heater business in China in Q3. John Kita : Q3, when I look at electric and gas, it was probably up about 7% or 8%. Matt Summerville : Got it and then just one final question, you mentioned added spend in China associated with bringing water treatment, air purification in the Tier 2, Tier 3, can you may be talk about where you\u2019re at with the distributions of that product, how many outlets you are in currently, how many you would anticipate and how that\u2019s going to evolve over the next year or so. And then to some less spend back off a bit in Q4 is that why we should see margins snap back pretty meaningfully at least relative to where they have been in the last couple of quarters in Rest of World? John Kita : Yeah, sure. For example, yeah, water treatment margins were down about 6 points in the third quarter and that acquainted almost all the decline in the margins for the quarter and that was truly engineering and also investment in new retail outlets. We are at about 7000 \u2013 we\u2019re in 7000 stores approximately and then we have on important some special zones et cetera. I guess Ajita will comment, we think that growth will slow as we look to the next couple of years because we have been building it all pretty aggressively over the last two years. Ajita Rajendra : Yeah, I think if we went back two years ago, we would have said the rate of our build out would have been slower and I think we\u2019re just going to faster because we see the opportunity longer term. John Kita : Yeah, we had about 1,500 stores, almost 2000 outlets if you will over the last two years. Operator : And our next question comes from Charley Brady from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is open. Charley Brady : Hi, thanks. I just want to jump down a little bit on Rest of World margins because the guidance clearly implies a pretty big step up in the Q4 margin and I get them with the overall guidance it\u2019s what coming out of China, but is that just a function of this engineering cost that is going into water treatment or essentially you took a big hit and that\u2019s kind of largely done or certainly declining a lot or Ajita Rajendra : So when we look at the fourth quarter, that\u2019s always our highest volume quarter. We would expect that to be the highest volume this year also. So we are going to get contributions. We would expect SG&A will be down a couple of points and that is the combination of the engineering cost not being high, as high and the SG&A not being as high as a percent with advertising being lower. We have talked over the years that those spends could be lumpy and they clearly were in the second and third quarter and we are comfortable they will be lower in the fourth quarter. So I think you are right. We have a fairly aggressive fourth quarter but with the higher volumes, we think we will get a little favorable mix from new \u2013 introduction of a new electric unit and then lower SG&A, we are comfortable with the estimate. Charley Brady : Oaky and then just on North America, on the top line growth is sort of I guess implied in the guidance. Did you \u2013 you mentioned a pre-buy that you expect that \u2013 that is why it\u2019s kind of little bit maybe stronger growth in Q4 because you are pulling some stuff forward or is that just underlying stronger margin obviously Lochinvar is doing pretty good? Ajita Rajendra : Yeah, and we expect Lochinvar to be up. We expect residential to be up nicely in the fourth quarter. So those two and then we do expect some pre buy from the regulatory changes that\u2019s happening on the electric units on the commercial. So it\u2019s a combination of all three zones that\u2019s why we think sales will be up nicely in the fourth quarter. Operator : And our next question comes from Samuel Eisner from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Samuel Eisner : Hi, it\u2019s Sam Eisner here, guys how are you? Ajita Rajendra : Hi, Sam. Samuel Eisner : Just on the \u2013 just going back by the last question on the pre-buy, was there any pre-buy benefit this quarter that you guys saw that you can define them and then also given the Lochinvar performance in the quarter, is there anything in particular going on there that you guys want to comment about? Ajita Rajendra : Well, we don\u2019t think there was any pre-buy, I mean I will tell you in September residential was strong, but I mean the price increase that already been put in by August 1, so \u2013 I mean by I guess September 1. So any pre-buy we think would have happened in August if you will, so no. But September residential was strong and Lochinvar had a greater quarter, I mean their boiler business was up 25%. You break that into three pieces, their residential was up over 30, their condensing which is the big commercial boiler was up high single digit and then their non-condensing which we have talked about historically is their smaller business, but that was almost double and that\u2019s the reflection of a new product that they brought out, 2.5.million to 5 million BTU. They did have a large order in China well about $3 million during the quarter and so that clearly helped that to add a 3 or 4 points of growth. And that\u2019s from a distributor. We are also selling that product in China through our A.O. Smith operation. We expect that product will sell $15 million this year and with 12 or 13 of it in China. So Lochinvar just had a very good quarter, they grew margins, they grew sales significantly and we are very pleased year-to-date they are up about 9% and we are certainly comfortable with the 8% growth that we talked about earlier in the year portfolio. John Kita : And also Sam I think that the results, especially this quarter, but it\u2019s being building, as reinforced us the global demand for that Lochinvar product and the global opportunity that we have in leveraging the product and capability with our existing distribution and presence in various country. Samuel Eisner : Got it, that\u2019s helpful and maybe looking over on the Rest of World segment, the 13% growth that you guys are seeing is certainly a little bit below the kind of 15% rate that you guys have called out in your kind of long term, long term view. Is that something that we should be nervous about, you think that\u2019s kind of transitory and then maybe a second part of that on the Tier 2 and Tier 3 spending. Should that continue into fourth quarter and 2018? Thanks. John Kita : Well, I guess I will say and Ajita you can add, I mean we have never said that we are going to have quarterly growth of right up 15% and what we have talked about with our model, as we think on an annual basis they can grow 15%, as the matter of fact and year-to-date, I mean U.S. dollars they are up about 15%. So we are comfortable they are going to achieve that 15 plus percent in local currency for the year and it\u2019s going to be lumpy I mean it\u2019s not going to be 15% every quarter. We are looking at annual basis. So we are very comfortable. With respect to the spend, yeah, we did have some higher spend, specifically in water treatment and even some in the air purification in the third quarter. We think that will be less in the fourth quarter and that we are looking at our plan right now, I mean as Ajita said I think the role out of stores will slow as we look into \u201918 and \u201919 I mean so we will be looking hard at SG&A. Ajita Rajendra : Yeah, I think not much to add, am just reinforcing the fact that we are very comfortable with the 15% annual growth in China in local currency which is what we\u2019ve always said. And it is going lumpy especially China is driven a lot by different selling holidays and things like that, that make the spending and the sales from year-to-year can vary from one quarter to the other. So from that perspective, each quarter may seem lumpy, but for the year on an annual basis we are very comfortable with the guidance that we have given. Operator : And our next question comes from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open Jeff Hammond : Hi, good morning guys. Ajita Rajendra : Good morning. Jeff Hammond : Just to be clear Ajita, on the acquisitions, I think the presentation has 40 million of incremental growth, you said 60, is that all in and the 40s the acquired growth or just help me there. Ajita Rajendra : With what 60 is the full year Hague and Aquasana and that\u2019s about our incremental of about 40 over the prior year because we didn\u2019t have Hague and we only had Aquasana of course from August of \u201916. So the incremental was 40 and the total water treatment in North America this year will 60. Jeff Hammond : Okay. And then on cash flow, looks like you took cash flow from ups down 50 million, anything going on there? I think you cited kind of timing in 4Q, but we would have known there anything you know working capital supply chain that\u2019s driving that? Ajita Rajendra : Well, the biggest issue is the pension contribution, so that\u2019s 20 plus, about $20 million of that. We did not have that in our estimate. Probably the other most significant item is, we are probably building more inventory for our water treatment move that\u2019s going to occur in the first quarter and late second quarter then what we had planned and so that certainly benefactor but nothing out of the ordinary. We\u2019re still very comfortable with our days\u2019 sales outstanding and et cetera. Ajita Rajendra : Yeah, and some of that build is demand driven because I mean the business is continues to grow very well and so we\u2019re anticipating that. In that transition we want to make sure that we don\u2019t lose out in any other revenue. Operator : And our next question comes from Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Scott Graham : Yeah, hi. Good morning. Last question on \u2013 only one question on rest of world I promise. At some point, the 15% number is going be difficult to reach given essentially the size of the business, world large number or want have you. Do you think we\u2019re a year or two away for maybe kind of thinking that\u2019s maybe a low teens growth business rather than 15% which obviously there will be nothing wrong with that but I\u2019m just trying to gauge your thinking internally? Ajita Rajendra : I am comfortable with were we are now and the outlook that we have. And what you say from periodical perspective, we are going to be order of magnitude a billion dollar business which says it $150 million of new revenue every year, okay. So for the foreseeable future, we are comfortable. As soon as we see that is something that we say what we\u2019re going to have to turn that down a little, we will let you know. We will make sure that we communicate that to our investors. Scott Graham : Okay. Thanks. John Kita : Clear predict Scott, continue growth on water treatment and air purification, those markets are expected to grow significantly. See I am still toss about 30% growth in water treatment, I mean we have a pretty significant franchise now when you add the consumables, and you add our businesses in China, it\u2019s over $200 million. Scott Graham : So that is kind of what I\u2019m saying. Yes. Okay. That\u2019s fine, but if you go for the intermediate term right? Ajita Rajendra : Yeah and also it is part of the strategy as we\u2019ve talked about is to get into new categories, to leverage our brand and distribution getting into new categories. So we\u2019re not counting on just the same portfolio businesses to bring us that incremental growth every year, okay. So we balance that in terms of the right time to get into it and to leverage the infrastructure that we have in China. Scott Graham : Understood. I just \u2013 my second question is really about the U.S. business, both the results were pretty good. And as we look across the residential construction numbers over the last five months, which certainly is not a primary driver, but is a driver of the market. Those numbers have really been very strong sort of 15% last five or six months and we also \u2013 it looks like field might actually come down a little bit in the fourth quarter at least quarters you guys here, just sort of wondering how you are looking at the North American sales and operating margin sort of trajectory. And I know that you are going to probably not go far past, if any the fourth quarter, but it just looks like that the backdrop for North America sales and operating margin looks pretty good the next couple of quarters, would you agree with that, can you comment on that? John Kita : Well I guess I said we didn\u2019t see strong, we\u2019ve seen relatively strong growth in residential, it\u2019s probably about 300,000 units. Now, again that\u2019s on base of 8.7 million units. So that\u2019s what 3% or 4% and we have seen that the last three quarters with that some of that in the fourth quarter. Commercial been strong, it\u2019ll be up \u2013 it was up by I think year-to-date probably about 7% or so. And that looks like that continuing. I would tell you it appears steel has leveled off but we haven\u2019t seen a decline, we say it\u2019s leveled off which would be a plus because it gone up so much dramatically which is the benefit as it does kind of stabilize.You know again continuous go margin, so yeah I think we\u2019re optimistic as we look in the fourth quarter in next year from a North America standpoint. Ajita if you have any? Ajita Rajendra : No, I think that summarizes well. Operator : And our next question comes from Lawrence DeMaria from William Blair. Your line is open. Lawrence DeMaria : Hi, thanks, good morning. I have two questions, but first, just to clarify, it looks like we needed $16 million, $17 million increase in EBIT sequentially to get the rest of world record margins you\u2019re projecting. Sounds like the bridge is a reduction engineering around 6 million and then the rest is volume and slower growth in SG&A, is that right just to clarify, are we getting that right? John Kita : I won\u2019t say engineering going down $6 million is right. We think that SG&A will be down at couple of points. We will get the benefit of price again even in China last raw material costs have stabilized, so we think we will get some benefit net price compared to material. And then we\u2019re going to have some volume that\u2019s also going to contribute. So those are the major pieces then you throw in a little bit of favorable mix from the new electric units. Those are the kind of the pieces that get up there. Lawrence DeMaria : Okay. Thank you. And then secondly, staying in the rest of the world, how do you think about incremental margins going forward? Should we start to think about moving over 20% without any exception of the fourth quarter which would be good as the smaller businesses get scale and you are leverage infrastructure you referenced, can we look at over 20% incremental annual base now in rest of world, do have not scale there? John Kita : I am not sure, you said two different numbers, you said a 20% and then you said 20% incremental. Lawrence DeMaria : Over 20% incremental on an annual basis going forward since you are leveraging infrastructure and getting scale in those businesses? John Kita : Well, I\u2019ll take a shot at it. We clearly want our rest of world margins, we think it\u2019s a combination of India becoming more profitable, Turkey be capital I should say, reducing the loss in India and ultimately getting to a breakeven with the same statement for Turkey. And then yeah it\u2019s our intention to leverage China\u2019s SG&A and volume as we going forward. We have not put out any specific objective but certainly it\u2019s our objective to try to go rest of the world margins. Ajita Rajendra : And so incremental margins will be better than the average certainly but we have not put out the number. Operator : And our next question comes from Robert Aurand from Longbow Research. Your line is open. Robert Aurand : Hi, thank you. Robert Aurand downfor Dave McGregor, today. Stock in China by your water heater business and what extent increased competition from the domestic manufacturers is impacting your results? John Kita : Look, you know it\u2019s always been competitive as continually top, it\u2019s always been competitive. We\u2019ve seen in the market I\u2019ll say the electric not growing as fast which we assumed would happened because there is more distribution of gas in the city. So if you would asked us probably three years ago, we would have said electric was 55% in the market and gas was 45%, it\u2019s probably close to a flip now. Not sure if it\u2019s going to go much further but that happens. We don\u2019t have a stronger position but we\u2019re \u2013 we have a good position in gas and we\u2019re leading in electric. So I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s much the competition as the dynamics in the marketplace, but all that being said, water heater growth this year is going to be nice for us and it\u2019s led by gas. Ajita Rajendra : You know just to add a little more color to that, the changes John talked about have not happened overnight evolutionary type changes that are happening. From going back to your question on the competitive environment, yeah I\u2019ve always said China \u2013 the market in China is very, very competitive. You got all of the major players in the world there and they\u2019re all bringing in new products and being in a very competitive branded consumer appliance business. So none of that has changed, it\u2019s always been very competitive. Robert Aurand : Okay. Thank you. And just one more question on China, I mean just new flow throughout the year that there are really trying to kind of cool down, the real stay market in the major cities there, aren\u2019t get a property bubble, I mean what extent does that impact your results over there, do you guys think about that impacting you moving forward? John Kita : Well real estate is still the primary investment for the Chinese. The recent data does show that sales of property have slowed. It\u2019s kind of a one or two month, we don\u2019t that\u2019s a limp or not. We don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not really tracking as closely build, what we\u2019re tracking is sales, because that\u2019s what ultimately leads. The good news outside for us going forward is we think replacement is becoming a bigger component which just makes the sense the really good news about water heater in ultimately failed and with that you have a replacement market. And as you know here in the States, the replacement market is you know that 9 million build about 7-8 of this replacement. So we are nowhere near that in China but it\u2019s developing. So I think as we look forward, we still think we are going to be able to growth from the water heater segment and we have some of the best products in both electric and gas which differentiates us. Is that answers your question or not. Ajita Rajendra : And I think if you look at it from a longer term macro perspective, you know China is just completed or completing this week the latest communist party congress and you know you take headline coming out of that it\u2019s a continuation of the policies which drives urbanization, drives more consumption based growth and those things form a macro perspective also help us and really reinforce our strategy. Operator : And our next question comes from Andrew Cohen from Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Andrew Cohen : Hi, great quarter as always. Most of my questions have been answered but just a couple of small ones on water treatment. When this plans comes online in second quarter, is that going to materially affect margins or is it going to be roughly the same cost basis? John Kita : Well, I mean, we will, we\u2019re going through our planning process right now. It\u2019s certainly will pass initially probably the first and second quarter. I mean but we are moving a significant operation, the good news is we are not moving it far but we\u2019re going to have moving certainly in the first and second quarter. The new plans offering higher depreciation for the year, we have \u2013 ultimately we\u2019ll have some inefficiencies the first half of the year. But the good news is ultimately we think it\u2019s going to be a much more efficient plan. So there could there could hiccups early in 2018 and we\u2019ll talk about that when we get into through our planning process and possible talk more on year end. But I think for the full year that we\u2019ll have some marginal effect but not significant. Ajita Rajendra : Yeah, we\u2019ll be able to define it more three months from now. But just the team in China is very \u2013 they are used to doing this because they are constantly expanding building new factories and moving operations into new factories. And as John said that entails obviously in the new factory potentially higher depreciation which we will see in this factory. But at the same time, you know we\u2019ve designed this to have fairly significant operational benefits in terms of productivity. So we see both. John Kita : And we\u2019ll expect to see that later in 2018 and certainly when we get into 2019 that\u2019s you know real benefit. Andrew Cohen : Great. Second question it\u2019s probably fairly small but the Hague acquisition, is this portfolio also going to be sold over in rest of world or is it pretty much just a U.S. based set of products. John Kita : Yeah, that was one of the things that attracted us to Hague as we have looked at water softer manufactures, we\u2019ve been OEM in over there and we look necessarily successful and we looked for manufacturers and of all the way. And quite frankly we feel agents for that. And they can make a compact unit which is important for the China market and they started selling those in I guess about March, April. And you know it\u2019s been a nice sales, I think the sales probably in six months have been a million bucks sales over in China and it\u2019s of the Hague water heaters and in U.S. water softener. So new we are optimistic that they can really provide us the benefit in China. Ajita Rajendra : And these are Hague, you know water softener is made by Hague, branded A. O. Smith selling in China. John Kita : Yeah. So it\u2019s not something we are saying, we anticipate doing, it\u2019s happening now. Operator : And our next question comes from Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Scott Graham : Yeah, hi. I just \u2013 John, I was cut off before but the overwriting point that I was making was that residential construction has been very strong and residential water heater shipments have been just sort of okay. Is that gap seems to be pretty wide right now suggesting that the next couple of quarters could be fairly strong, are you hearing that from your guys is what I am asking? John Kita : I haven\u2019t been but again Scott just over, I understand better what you think. And it goes back to 9 million units, 7.8 of that is replacement. So completions you know are 1.2 and maybe up a little bit, but on the margin that might add 50,000 to 100,000 units. You know what I mean? So but I have not, I don\u2019t know that you have but I think that\u2019s partly what\u2019s driving that is you have that base of 7.8 million units and that\u2019s probably growing some this year because if you get 9 million units, you know and completions are up of 100,000 to 150,000 and the rest is replacement. So that\u2019s why I was trying to say. Ajita Rajendra : And I guess I make another comment Scott, which is you know not a quantifiable comment obviously but it may try and touch what you are saying. You know we just couple of weeks ago faced a ASA meeting which is the annual meeting where we have all of our distributors and you know there was you know people were pretty optimistic. I can\u2019t quantify that but you know people felt good about where things where. Scott Graham : Okay, well thanks on that. So I guess my other question would be, you know I am sorry for the rest of word double up here but you know the weakness in the margin off of the spending I mean I don\u2019t remember the last time you called out and need to increase your tier two and tier three spending. So I guess my question is kind of twofold, number one, I understand the markets are completive, but has there been some competitive uptick in either water treatment or air purification that\u2019s required this additional spending? Number two, the dynamic of you know the water heater distribution points versus treatment and purification is different which is requiring an incremental investment, can you talk about that a little bit? John Kita : Well, I guess I\u2019ll take the first one is where the market share lead the water treatment. And we have the best products and we\u2019re going to continue to invest in R&D to support that position. And I won\u2019t say that competitive environment for water treatment has changed, we want to build out our distribution. You know we talk about tier two and tier three cities not only do we want to see there that helps us from online position because somebody got to fulfill that and it\u2019s distribution locations we talk about. So when we\u2019re growing the retail, it\u2019s primarily I\u2019ll say our specialty stores and water treatment. Air purification, we are not the market share leader, we think we have some new products that we\u2019re going to be bringing out next year that we think will be beneficial. And so we\u2019re investing in R&D and also going out that portfolio. I think one think I want to mention is yes, rest of world, China did not meet the margins that we talked about beginning of the year, but when we are done with the year, we expect them to growth 15% organically and there is about 15% EBIT return. So I don\u2019t want to give the impression, they are not having a good year, they are having a good year maybe not what we expected and where the spend being more than what we thought and then raw material cost have hurt us. So as we look at the year, I having a good year and I don\u2019t think there is anything you need from a competitive or strategic standpoint that\u2019s really changing our things. Ajita Rajendra : And I think that summarized it well. And you know as we \u2013 you know the advertising and things like that in a branded consumer clients business that\u2019s a \u2013 those are things we need to do especially when we get into new categories and we just had some research come back that our brand is getting better and better known and very well known in these new categories. And as John said when it comes to water treatment which we feel has a huge, huge long term potential in China, we\u2019re the market share leader. So we feel pretty good about that. From a competitive situation, it\u2019s like I said earlier to a question earlier in the presentation, it\u2019s a very competitive market and it continuous to be that. And I don\u2019t see any material change either up or down from a competitive perspective. Operator : And our next question comes from Jeffrey Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeffrey Hammond : Hey, just a quick call. Actually you mentioned some inflection in international in China, and that seems to be an area that was taken along when a struggle. So what\u2019s really change there, are you starting to see an inflection where you can start to penetrate internationally? Thanks. Ajita Rajendra : Yeah, I think the key difference then Jeff you got a good memory, we are going back to the activation but we felt that\u2019s the time we did the acquisition. But that there would be a market for the condensing boilers in China that there was a market that is growing. What\u2019s taken time is that we didn\u2019t see that condensing boiler demand grow in China but what we did is continued demand for the lower efficiency non-condensing type products in China. Lots of reasons for that, low energy cost, I mean lots of reason for that. So we literally designed some products which are very conducive for the Chinese market and fit the market needs in China and we are actually selling those products two different ways in China. We are selling them a blocking wall manufactured products, branded blocking wall in China through one set of distribution. And then we also manufacturing those products in China and selling them under the A. O. Smith brand name. So \u2013 and both those are being very successful. So it is a change it\u2019s that we\u2019ve recognized that there was market for the non-condensing products, design some products for the Chinese market and we brought them out saying the last 12-15 months and they have been very successful. So we are very happy about that. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay, thanks Ajita. Operator : And at this time, I am showing no further questions. Patricia Ackerman : Thank you for joining us today. Please take note that we will participate in several conferences in the fourth quarter. The Baird Industrial Conference on November 8th in Chicago, the North Coast Conference on November 9th in New York City, and the Goldman Sachs Conference on November 14th in Boston. Have a wonderful day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

O. Smith Corporation Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Patricia Ackerman, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. You may begin. Patricia Ackerman : Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and thank you for joining us on our 2017 results conference call. With me participating in the call are Ajita Rajendra, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and John Kita, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin with Ajita's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning\u2019s press release. In order to provide improved transparency in to the operating results of our business, we provided non-GAAP measures, including adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted effective income tax rate for 2017 that exclude the estimate of our total tax expense related to US tax reform. Reconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and also on our website. Also, as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. I will now turn the call over to Ajita, who will begin his remarks on slide 4. Ajita Rajendra : Thank you, Pat and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Our double digit sales growth in 2017 was driven by continued strong demand for our consumer products in China and positive end markets for our boilers and water heaters in North America. Here are a few highlights. Record sales of $3 billion grew nearly 12%. China sales were up 18% in local currency and up 16% in US dollar terms, reaching over $1 billion in 2017. China water treatment sales grew 35% and air purification sales grew 75% to $45 million. Our global water treatment sales exceeded 300 million in 2017. We are very proud of the global water treatment platform we have built over the last seven years. Beginning in 2011 with about $35 million of water treatment sales in China, we grew significantly to almost $240 million last year. As we experienced rapid organic water treatment growth in China, we added several bolt-on acquisitions in the US and Europe, launched water treatment products in India and Vietnam and added a significant number of water treatment engineers and technologists to our global engineering center.  As a result of our investments, we project our global water treatment sales to be approximately $400 million in 2018. Record setting adjusted net earnings of $2.17 per share was 17% higher than our earnings per share in 2016. We are delighted to welcome the Hague team to the A. O. Smith family through our acquisition of the US based water softener company in early September. Hague fits squarely in our acquisition strategy to grow our global water treatment platform. We are excited about the global opportunities Hague\u2019s innovative and high quality products bring us as well as Hague\u2019s experienced water quality dealer network. We continue to review our capital allocation and dedicate a portion of our cash to return to shareholders. We repurchased over 2.5 shares for approximately $139 million. We announced a 29% increase to our dividend earlier this month. The five year compound annual growth rate of our dividend is over 25%. AOS joined the S&P 500 index as of July 2017. We are honored to join this prestigious group of US companies. Our inclusion is a significant milestone in our company's very rich history.  John will now describe our results in more detail, beginning with slide number 5. John Kita : Before we discuss the financial results of our fourth quarter and full year, I will provide details of the new tax law impact. Our one-time tax charge in the fourth quarter is estimated to be 82 million or $0.47 per share and is primarily related to the mandatory repatriation tax on undistributed earnings under US tax reform. The one-time charge is expected to be paid over eight years. We project our effective income tax rate in 2018 to be between 22% and 22.5%.  We expect to repatriate approximately 200 million in the first half of 2018 and use the proceeds to repay floating rate debt. Our capital allocation strategy will remain focused on three pillars. One, to support our growth with capital spending; two, to pursue acquisitions, which expand our core water heating and water treating platforms globally as well as expand our product lines, primarily in China; and three, to return cash to shareholders. We will continue to review opportunities within the three pillars and discuss with our board. Sales for the year of 3 billion were 12% higher than the previous year. Adjusted net earnings of 378 million increased 16% from 2016. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.17 increased 17% compared with 2016. Sales in our North America segment of 1.9 billion increased 9% compared with 2016. The increase in sales was primarily due to higher volumes of water heaters and boilers and pricing actions related to steel cost increases.  North America water treatment sales comprised of recently acquired Hague as well as a full year of Aquasana incrementally added approximately 40 million to our North America segment sales. Rest of World segment sales of 1.1 billion increased 16% compared with 2016. China\u2019s sales increased nearly 16%, driven by higher demand for our consumer products in the region, led by water treatment and air purification products and pricing actions, primarily due to higher steel and installations costs. The declining Chinese currency unfavorably impacted the translation of China sales by approximately 18 million and sales growth by 200 basis points. Water heater and water treatment sales in India increased approximately 8 million or over 40% in 2017, compared with 2016. On slide 9, North America segment earnings of 429 million were 11% higher than segment earnings in 2016. The favorable impact from higher sales of water heaters and boilers and the pricing actions in the US were partially offset by higher steel costs. As a result of lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales, 2017 segment margin of 22.5% was higher than the 22.1% generated in 2016. Rest of World earnings of 149 million improved 16% compared with 2016. Higher China sales, including the price increase, were partially offset by higher steel costs, higher fees paid to installers and increased SG&A cost. Expansion of water treatment and air purification product retail outlets in tier 2 and tier 3 cities, higher advertising related to brand building in our newer product categories and higher water treatment product development engineering costs were the primary drivers of higher SG&A in China. Segment margin in 2017 was essentially the same as 2016.  Our corporate expenses were 2 million higher than in 2016, driven by commissioned water treatment market studies in the US and higher engineering costs at our corporate technology center. Our adjusted effective income tax rate in 2017 was 27.4%. The rate was lower than the 29.4% experienced in 2016, primarily due to lower US state income taxes and higher deductions for stock-based compensation. Comparing the lower adjusted effective tax rate with the effective income tax rate of 28% originally projected benefited 2017 result by $0.02 per share. Sales for the fourth quarter of 769 million were 10% higher than the same quarter in 2016. Adjusted net earnings in the fourth quarter of 105 million increased 26% from the fourth quarter in 2016. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.60 increased 28% compared with the same quarter in 2016. Sales in our North America segment of 461 million increased 6% compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in sales was primarily due to higher volumes of boilers and commercial water heaters and pricing actions related to steel cost increases. We estimate the commercial water heater industry experienced the pre-buy of approximately 5000 electric units in the fourth quarter due to an anticipated regulatory change in early 2018. North America water treatment sales comprised of Aquasana and recently acquired Hague incrementally added approximately 9 million to our North America segment sales. Rest of World segment sales of 314 million increased 17% compared with the same quarter in 2016. China sales increased 16% driven by pricing actions primarily due to higher steel and installation costs and higher demand for our consumer products in the region. India sales grew over 40% compared with the same period in 2016. On slide 13, North America segment earnings of 105 million were 17% higher than segment earnings in the same quarter in 2016. The favorable impact from higher sales of boilers and commercial water heaters, pricing actions in the US and lower ERP costs were partially offset by higher steel and other input costs. These factors drove fourth quarter 2017\u2019s segment margin higher to 22.8% compared with 20.5% last year. Rest of World earnings of 51 million improved 33% compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. Higher China sales, including the price increase were partially offset by higher steel costs and higher fees paid to installers.  Fourth quarter segment margin was 16.2% compared with 14.2% in the same quarter of 2016, due to improved margin for our water treatment products sold in China, lower selling and advertising costs as a percent of sales as well as improved performance in India. Our corporate expenses were higher in the fourth quarter compared with the same period in 2016, primarily due to higher spending at our corporate technology center and higher employee incentive costs. Our adjusted effective income tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 25.8%. The rate was lower than the 28.9% experienced during the fourth quarter last year, primarily due to lower US state income taxes and higher deductions for stock based compensation. Cash provided by operations during 2017 was 326 million and similar to our previous projections compared with 447 million provided during 2016. Higher adjusted earnings were more than offset by higher outlays for working capital, primarily due to the higher than anticipated positive cash flows in the fourth quarter of 2016 as well as higher inventories in China to reduce the impact from our -- to our new plant this quarter. Over the two year period from 2016 to 2017, we generated operating cash of 773 million, which compares with 612 million during 2014 and 2015. Our liquidity position and balance sheet remain strong. Our debt to capital ratio was 20% at the end of 2017. We have cash balances, totaling 820 million located offshore and our net cash position was approximately 410 million at the end of 2017. We completed the acquisition of Hague, a US based water softener company during the third quarter of $45 million -- for $45 million plus a potential earnout of $2 million. Primarily as a result of continued strong cash flow and escalating PBGC premiums, we made a voluntary contribution to our pension plan of $30 million. The after tax impact to our cash flow was approximately 18 million. During 2017, we repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares of common stock for a total of $139 million. Approximately 2.4 million shares remained on our existing repurchase authority at the end of December.  This morning, we announced our 2018 EPS guidance with a range of between $2.50 and $2.58 per share, which includes the benefit related to our lower projected tax rate under US tax reform. The midpoint of our EPS guidance represents a 17% increase in EPS compared with our adjusted 2017 results. Excluding the US Tax Reform benefits from our 2018 guidance midpoint, in other words, using the 2017 adjusted tax rate of 27.4%, our operational performance is expected to improve over 9%. We expect our cash flow from operations in 2018 to be between 475 million and 500 million, which is much higher than the 326 million generated in 2017.  We expect higher earnings and lower outlays for working capital this year, specifically lower inventory levels. We broke ground in 2016 on the construction of a new water treatment and air purification manufacturing facility in China to support the strong growth of these products in China. Our 2018 capital spending plans of approximately 100 million includes 30 million related to completion of this plan. Total costs for the facility, which is expected to begin production in the second quarter will be about 67 million. Our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately 80 million in 2018.  Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately 49 million in 2018, higher than the 47 million in 2017, partially due to higher projected spending at our corporate R&D center. Our effective income tax rate is expected to be between 22% and 22.5% in 2018, lower than previous year's due to US tax reform. We expect to repurchase our shares in the amount of approximately 135 million in 2018 under a 10b5-1 plan, similar to 2017. We may supplement our 10b5-1 plan with opportunistic share repurchase in 2018. We expect our average diluted outstanding shares in 2018 will be approximately 173 million. We increased our dividend earlier this month by 29%.  I will now turn the call back to Ajita who will summarize our guidance, the business assumptions for 2018 and our growth strategy beginning on slide 17. Ajita? Ajita Rajendra : Thank you, John. We considered several tailwinds and headwinds, as we built our plans for 2018. First, our tailwinds. Both residential and commercial water heater volumes experienced strong growth in 2017. We project US residential water heater industry volumes will increase 250,000 to 300,000 units in 2018 due to continued new construction and expansion of replacement demand. This assumption includes [indiscernible]. Boiler revenues grew 13% in 2017, driven by solid demand for our condensing boilers and new product related market share gains.  We expect our boiler business to grow approximately 10% in 2018. We improved profitability in India in 2017 due to scale in our water heater and water treatment businesses from losing over $9 million in 2016 to $7.5 million loss in 2017. We met our projections despite uncertainty resulting from the implementation of a national goods and services tax and demonetization in the country in 2016. We project India water heaters will approach breakeven in 2018. Improvements for water heaters and water treatment will continue in 2019 and our total India business will be slightly profitable in 2020. The overall loss in India is expected to be $5 million this year. The headwinds include steel prices are rising and are above year ago levels. At current prices, steel will be a headwind to margins this year compared with last year. Following double digit volume growth in 2017, we project US commercial water heater industry volumes will be down 5000 units this year compared with last year due to the pre-buy of electric units in the fourth quarter of last year. Our China sales grew 18% in local currency in 2017, easily exceeding $1 billion and surpassing our 15% expected growth rate. China sales in the fourth quarter exceeded our projections by about $20 million. We believe the fourth quarter outperformance was driven by customer orders to qualify for volume incentives as well as larger than expected inventory build by our e-commerce customers for the notable online shopping days in November and December.  We project the fourth quarter outperformance of $20 million will negatively impact our first quarter and full year 2018 China sales. We believe China will grow about 13% for the full year. If you adjust for the $20 million pull in in quarter four, this is a 17% year-over-year growth rate. Our movement of water treatment and air purification manufacturing into our new plant in China will result in a projected incremental cost of approximately $5 million, the majority of which will occur in the first half of 2018.  I\u2019m now moving to slide number 18. Combining the impact of the tailwinds and the headwinds, we are optimistic about our growth and bottom line performance for 2018. We project revenue growth will be between 8.5% and 9.5% for the year and EPS between $2.50 and $2.58. We expect North America segment margin to be between 22% and 22.5% and Rest of World segment margins to expand 30 to 40 basis points over 2017.  Please advance to slide number 19. We have updated the components of our growth model to be consistent with the new disclosure rules, for disaggregation of segment revenue as well as to incorporate recently acquired and organically grown high growth businesses. We combined North America water treatment and India with our strong consumer products business in China and its mid-teens growth rate. This is our high growth category and its sales are 36% of company sales. We expect sales of North America water treatment composed of Aquasana and Hague product will reach nearly $100 million of revenue this year. India grew over 40% last year and we are enthusiastic about our distribution now being pan India for both water heaters and water treatment. Based on the investments we have already made and are expected to make in the future, we project this high growth portfolio to grow 14% per year. As many of you know, our Lochinvar branded products are composed of approximately 60% boilers and 40% water heaters. As such, going forward, our growth model will separate the boiler piece of our company with an assumed growth rate which matches its five year revenue CAGR of 10%. Sales of our North America water heater products remained the largest portion of our company sales at 58%, including our Lochinvar branded water heaters. Given the expected new construction required to support household formation and expand the replacement demand, we project water heater revenue growth at a rate of 4%.  The weighted average of our growth model continues to be 8%, which is consistent with our 8.5% to 9.5% growth projections for 2018 and is reasonable for the median term timeframe. Especially in these uncertain economic times, we believe our organic growth potential and are stable defensive replacement market, which represents approximately 85% of North America water heater and boiler volume positively differentiates A. O. Smith from other industrial companies. Coupled with growth and stability, we have a strong balance sheet poised to take advantage of strategic acquisitions that add shareholder value as well as allow us to return cash to shareholders. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, we are open for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Charlie Brady with SunTrust. Charlie Brady : Just I guess on the steel costs, I guess I didn\u2019t hear any mention of additional price increases being put through to offset that. Any particular reason why? I mean you guys have been pretty successful doing that in the past. Ajita Rajendra : Charlie, I think -- this is Ajita. We never comment about future price increases. And in terms of steel prices, it\u2019s tough to predict what's going to happen in the future. As we mentioned in the comments, the steel prices today are a headwind versus what they were last year. And if you look at our past history, over time, we've been able to pass along commodity prices to the marketplace. Charlie Brady : Could you quantify what the headwind is today from steel? John Kita : Well, I can tell you this. I mean, steel has gone up about 11% since the beginning of December, it\u2019s gone up hot rolled over 11% and cold rolled over about 8%. So it\u2019s been a significant increase. Charlie Brady : Yeah. I didn\u2019t hear a whole lot of commentary on US residential water heater sales in the 4Q. Can you just comment a little bit on how that fared? Ajita Rajendra : Sure. I think as you look at, we pretty much hit our numbers that we expected for the total company and we talked about China sales being up almost $20 million where we did miss what\u2019s on the residential side. The industry was up, I think, for the first two months about 90,000 units. We were up minimally during that time period. When we look at the full year though, I think which is important the way we look at it is our market share in the first three months, first three quarters had improved. In the fourth quarter, because we didn't grow as much as the industry, it came back down. But when you adjust for Sears decline, our market share was right on for the year. And I guess the other comment I\u2019ll make is there's really been no change in distribution over the years. So I mean, we're comfortable with our position. But it did not do as well in the fourth quarter as we expected. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets. Scott Graham : So I want to maybe look at the earnings expectations internally, maybe a little bit more holistically. And I remember way back when you guys had your analyst meeting over a lock in for some time ago, of course, one of the things I think was discussed was an earnings growth number and I don't want to put words in your mouth, but sort of in the 15% to 20% territory. Now that's several years back and the \u2013 of large numbers kind of catches up, but at least the last couple of years, we have had 17% earnings growth with the larger numbers being comped and still getting there. And it appears, this year, we\u2019re looking at sort of 8% to 9% base earnings growth. Could you give us an idea on sort of where maybe the push and pull points are to get that level of base business earnings growth higher and could one of them be share repurchases? John Kita : Well, I think you're right. We're forecasting a little over 9%. We have exceeded that over the last couple of years. I think there's a couple of factors involved when you look at what -- how 2018 is shaping up is one commercial business has been very strong in the last two or three years, up close to double digits each the last few years. And that certainly is a big contributor to the bottom line. We are actually forecasting it to be down this year because of the pre-buy, so that certainly has an effect on margins. Number two, when you look at, we\u2019ve talked about steel already on the call. I mean, steel has gone up, has gone up almost 10% since December. So that has an effect on margins. And I think the third, again that's why we laid out the headwinds and tailwinds is the new plant coming up in Nanchang, there is some headwind. Now all that being said, we still are comfortable with the 9% and the higher end of our range would be higher than that. So I don't recall the 15% to 20% that was there, but again we look at each year individually. Scott Graham : Right. I guess John though, my question wasn't why it's 9, my question is more, how it can go higher than 9. What lines on the P&L if you will, what regions or product lines maybe could offer some upside and again our share repurchases an acceleration of the same being contemplated. John Kita : Well I think we talked about that we're going to buy 135 million plus opportunistically buying more. So theoretically, yes, buying more shares could help the bottom line. I think the upsides we think that exist would be we have higher volumes. Commercial, we're underestimating the volumes we hope. Residential could be stronger. It's been very strong in the last couple of years. And we get some relief from this. So those would be kind of the major areas. China margins, because of the movement of the plant, we're not expecting much growth, but quite frankly, our expectations which we thought about is to grow those margins. So we would hope we\u2019re being conservative on the rest of world margins. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird. Mike Halloran : So just an easy quick one. The 13% China growth, is that a constant currency number? John Kita : We\u2019ve said that\u2019s US dollars and we expect the currency to be flat to maybe RMB, maybe a little bit stronger year-over-year. Mike Halloran : And then kind of continuing a little on the rest of world margin side. If I think about the puts and takes here, obviously the price cost side you lined out, the 5 million water treatment you lined out, anything unique that you think is going to happen this year relative to last couple of years on advertising, product expansion build out relative to what's normal or and then any other puts and takes on some of the other growth initiatives there this year that we haven't talked about, whether commercial rental, water purification and how some of those numbers kind of line out as we work through the year as well? John Kita : Well, I\u2019ll take a shot at it. Air purification is probably one of the items on the periphery that are important. I mean, we started the year saying we were going to break even and we lost $5 million, so it did not do what our expectations were in \u201917. So, our anticipation is we will approach breakeven in \u201918. So that's an important qualifier. Bringing the plant up efficiently, so I'll break out the $5 million for you a little that Ajita referenced. The first half of the year, as you can appreciate, we're going to have efficiencies where we have two plants. We're going to be operating two plants for a little bit. We're moving -- we're going to have moved costs, et cetera. We have higher depreciation because of the investment, we have higher operating cost, because of the electricity, et cetera. Now our expectation for the last half of the year, we start operating much more efficiently than we have in the past. So that kind of offsets the inefficiencies in the first half, leaving us with the depreciation, the moved cost from the operating costs, which as we go into the future, we think we can offset with the efficiencies, et cetera. So that's certainly a qualifier. I will tell you water treatment had a very good fourth quarter. I mean when you look at the margins of rest of world going up, water treatment accounts for about 100 basis points of that.  As we have talked about in the third quarter, they had a difficult third quarter comp, while fourth quarter, they reversed that, had a very good fourth quarter. The thing that we're optimistic about when we look at water treatment for the year, their margins were up about a point to a point and a half compared to prior year. I\u2019ll also tell you, we grow more than the market. We're up almost 35%. The market was up 18% to 19%. So as we've talked about in the past, we know the best products in the marketplace, it\u2019s a high growth market and we are very happy with our position in that market. So those are some of the puts and takes. Obviously, we need the market to continue to grow in China. We haven\u2019t seen a move from electric to gas. That's just as distribution increases. We used to talk about three years ago that electric was 55%, gas was 45%. I would tell you it's about flit now. That gives us a little bit of a headwind. I mean, we're doing extremely well in the gas. We're gaining share, but it's still not at the level that the electric is. So, the bottom line Mike is, there's a lot of putts and takes. Mike Halloran : And then one more specific puts and takes, just in the context of that. When we're thinking about the original guide, when you guys came in to \u201917, there was hope to maybe better leverage some of the -- essentially continue to grow your spend on advertising and promotions, et cetera, but get better leverage off of it. Is that the thought going into \u201918 at this point? John Kita : I would say yes, that is the thought going forward. It might get hidden a little bit by the new plant costs, et cetera, but I think Kevin, I and Ajita have talked, that\u2019s clearly one of the objectives is to start leveraging our SG&A as China gets bigger. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Robert McCarthy : I'm suffering from the flu, so I'm going to try to keep it high level as is my want. First, the capital allocation. Could you just talk about how you're thinking about the state of the balance sheet right now post tax and do some of the changes we've seen in the -- basically where you\u2019re positioned right now, how you see the environment, does that change how you\u2019re looking at M&A or what you pay or where your priorities are there specifically? I think I have a good sense of stack ranking how you're thinking about capital allocation overall, but could you talk a little bit about the M&A environment and challenges, opportunities, how you're thinking about it? Because I think as you\u2019d -- obviously you suffer from a really good problem, which is a strong organic growth outlook overall that you've been seeing, but a pretty high bar for deals. So just talk about what you see about the potential opportunities for M&A in the next couple of years, size, scope, geography, that kind of thing? John Kita : I'll start with the capital allocation. I'll give Ajita the easier one on M&A. So I mean, I'll just give you a little, I mean, a little background on our capital allocation strategy that hasn't changed. And if you looked seven years ago, we came out, we started our stock repurchase program and we\u2019ve said we're going to do three things. We're going to invest in ourselves and over the last seven years, we have had capital investments of over $550 million. And much of that has been in the form of capacity. We\u2019ve added India plant, we've added two plants in China, we've added on a lot. That's about 50% more than depreciation over that time period and we expect to continue to invest in ourselves. Number two, we said return cash to shareholders. Over the last seven years, when we started this cash -- stock buyback program, we've returned over $1 billion to shareholders. That's been in the form of about 400 million in dividends which we've raised our dividend 25% a year for the last five to seven years. But we've also done a fair amount to stock buyback. We\u2019ve bought back over $650 million worth at an average price of less than $30 a share. So we think that's been a good investment. Third, we've done acquisitions and I'll lead into Ajita. Quite frankly, Ajita and I both say, we haven't done the magnitude of the acquisitions we hoped. Six years ago, we bought Lochinvar, which was a home run. In the last two years, we've built out our platform with respect to the water treatment business and that we've added about, I guess, $80 million of organic sales that cost from $150 million or so. So, it's a long way of saying we've had this approach in place. I don't think this approach changes going forward. Those are still the three pillars and we're comfortable with all three of those pillars and we'll continue to do that.  I don't think tax necessarily changes that. I mean if you look at tax reform, we have about an $82 million cash charge essentially that we're going to pay over eight years and we certainly benefit from tax reform and that we're probably going to generate $30 million to $35 million of cash a year, lower taxes. So it's going to take a while -- two to three years to pay it off, but we certainly in the long term benefit from it and it gives us more firepower. Ajita Rajendra : And I\u2019d just like to reinforce what John said in terms of our overall capital allocation strategy has not changed. It\u2019s essentially looking, number one, investing in ourselves, looking at appropriate strategic acquisition and then returning cash to shareholders appropriately as John mentioned. In looking at the M&A outlook out there, prices are still high. But as you saw when we did Aquasana, we went -- certainly paid the high multiple, but that was a very strategic acquisition.  So we're going to be balancing what we do in terms of return, but at the same time, be very disciplined in terms of the financial goals we've laid out and the acquisitions will be very strategic, which is essentially in heating and cleaning water globally and in China, we expand that judiciously in looking at how we can leverage our brand and distribution in new categories that really fit. So that's been our strategy. I don't see any change in that capital allocation strategy or acquisition strategy going forward other than to reinforce, we will be very disciplined and any acquisitions we do will be very strategic. John Kita : And in theory, I guess I'd say that with a lower tax rate, if multiples don\u2019t adjust, it makes it easier for us, domestic ones to hit our ROIC targets. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jeff Hammond : Just on the 13% growth you explained that the pull forward, but can you walk through how you're thinking about growth for the traditional water heater business versus air versus water or versus the water treatment. John Kita : Sure. We would expect that water treatment is -- the market will probably grow 18% to 20%. We would expect water treatment would be 25% and 30%. As I alluded to earlier, we're very comfortable with our position. We would expect air purification to grow 35% to 40%. Again, we\u2019re bringing new products out there, which we think will be beneficial. The electric and gas markets, we would expect quite frankly gas will grow and electric will be somewhat flat because of the transition I talked about earlier. So we'll get some benefit because of the gas position and then some of the other SPUs, like renewable and commercial, we expect to grow nicely. So it's kind of a varied group to get to the 13%. Jeff Hammond : And then can you just walk through what the loss in India was versus what, I think you said it was going to be approaching breakeven or close to this minus 5 and just the ERP delta, 18 versus 17 as well. John Kita : Well, I\u2019ll give you the ERP, the ERP \u201917 to \u201916 first was about $6 million less. The ERP delta 17 to 18 will be down a couple of million bucks. So we're at that kind of run rate that we're going to be at above 16 million I guess, somewhere around there. Maybe, we need to clarify the India breakeven, but what we said is in 2016, India lost over $9 million. In 2017, it lost $7.5 million or basically hit exactly what our plan was. Even under fairly difficult conditions, given the GST tax changes and the monetization. So we think India had a good year. Our expectation now is next year, sorry this year, \u201918, we move from that $7.5 million loss to about $5 million. So, a pickup of about $2.5 million of less loss if you will. And then as we move into \u201919, and then \u201920, we expect to be breakeven. We actually expect to be profitable. So we this move down from over 9 to 7.5 to 5 to 2 million to 3 million to a positive by 2020. Operator : Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David MacGregor : I guess I had a couple of questions on sort of the longer term considerations in the business. And for starters, you talked about the rest of world margins being up maybe 30 to 40 basis points in 2018 and I realize there's a lot of moving parts in there. I guess I want to just tap you for your latest thoughts on where this ultimately could get to by 2020 or some point further down the road on a sort of a raw materials normalized basis. John Kita : Well I would tell you and we\u2019ve talked about this in the past and Kevin, Agita and I have talked about it, we need to raise rest of world margins. And that\u2019s the objective and quite frankly, the India improvement from 7.5 million to 0 by 2020 improves margin by 60 to 70 basis points, right there. But in addition, China obviously is the largest component there. The objective is to raise margins there. We hope to do it this year, but again, we have that implant tailwind, et cetera, but we hope to do it this year. So I mean I would hope that that 13.75 that we're forecasting this year is conservative, but we'll see. But long term, the objective is definitely to increase rest of world margins. David MacGregor : It just seems like there's a lot of other things going on in that segment beyond India and China, you\u2019ve got the [indiscernible] Turkey, you\u2019ve got China water treatment. It just seems like a lot of those things, if not all of them are currently a drag on rest of world margins. And so I guess \u2013 John Kita : And we would agree with that. So you take the air purification loss $5 million, the boiler loss $6 million, or $7 million, the commercial water treatment loss, $3 million. So I would agree with you. Our objective is if we can move dollars to breakeven, again that's -- I think what I just, $15 million. That's 1.5% right there based on this year, not where the sales are two years from now. Ajita Rajendra : And I think, that's a great point, because we are probably always going to have some businesses incubating where we are investing for future growth. It so happens that at this particular point, in the last year, couple of years, we've had more than a normal run rate of businesses intubating. But all of these, as you look at them individually, the ones we mentioned, clearly, are investments for longer term growth, longer term profitable growth. So the opportunity to continue to leverage that reservoirs margin is clearly there. David MacGregor : Second question again, just kind of a longer term question, but as we talk to distributors, it's pretty clear that within the commercial world, tankless is making some pretty good progress and you've got product in there that you rely on is disproportionately large in terms of its margin contribution lifecycle. And I\u2019m just wondering to what extent you're feeling the pressure in those sort of higher margin contributing categories for products from tankless and ultimately I guess longer term question is, where does A. O. Smith go with regard to tankless, what's the strategy there longer term and do we see a greater commitment to that format over the next two to three years? John Kita : There's no doubt we think tankless increase. It\u2019s been increasing kind of at double digits. We would still be of the opinion that the majority of it is going to new construction and going into retrofit, et cetera, residential. There is probably some going into commercial, but we don't think it\u2019s a significant amount. And so, but Ajita can talk about our position long term, but it\u2019s clearly growing, but again, it\u2019s still 700,000 units on an industry that was 9.2 million. So we're certainly watching it and we participate in it. We have a very attractive product offering in it, but you're right. We have a lower market share there than we do in the other businesses. Ajita Rajendra : Yeah. And I think if you look at it from a global perspective in response to your question about our commitment to the technology, clearly, we are very committed to the technology. In fact, if you look at our market in China, we are the leaders in our market in China. And we manufacture everything that we sell and we compete with the same players who are leading in the US. It's just that we got a later start in the US market. Now, in the US market, we source our product from Japan. In China, we make it ourselves and just to put in perspective in terms of numbers of units, John mentioned that the total market here was close to 700,000 units. We sell about 2 million units that we make in China as the leaders in the market. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We do have a follow up from Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Robert McCarthy : I guess conversely, looking at in terms of capital allocation and M&A, I mean you've done a great job, the returns have been strong, you've moved to the S&P 500, the company is a lot bigger, you\u2019ve got a lot of opportunity in China. Part of the attraction is obviously you can definitely leverage your channel in China and bring in a lot of products either through licensing or otherwise if you did some form of JV and I've asked this question of you before, but is that something you're looking at and the related question is, let's not talk about gossip or what you'd be willing to do, but would it make sense over the longer term for you strategically to be part of a larger company and what could it bring in terms of investment, brand, things like that that perhaps you could even execute an even faster, larger growth strategy in China, because you\u2019ve just got a very valuable channel you've been developing there. Not like for your core products, but for these add-ons. Just any thoughts there. Ajita Rajendra : First of all, I\u2019m not going to speculate in terms of the future, because obviously that doesn\u2019t get us anywhere. But from a strategic perspective, in terms of us being an independent company, we will always be an independent company. Okay. There is no, I mean, in your thoughts in terms of, there is no -- we are not looking at something that you mentioned in terms of combination and things like that. If we're looking at, can we license products, et cetera, everything is open that\u2019s strategic in terms of, if it's the right product that fits our brand name for us to leverage it, we can source that product in many ways. We can do a greenfield, we can do an acquisition, we can license our brand to somebody else.  We can buy them. So we've looked at all of those types of ways to say, what's the right pace to grow. And as we look at to grow, whenever we get into a new category, it takes $40 million, $50 million to break even because this is a branded consumer products business. So the advertising costs, the promotion costs, the entry costs into retail et cetera are very high. So it's that balance of the right pace to be incubating and growing businesses at the same time, growing our margins and as the businesses have been in for a long time, mature like our electric water heater business. So it\u2019s that balance that we look at all the time, and we leverage to keep the 15% growth rate that we\u2019ve been guiding to for the long-term, while also increasing our margin. Operator : And I'm showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back to Ms. Patricia Ackerman for any further remarks. Patricia Ackerman : Thank you all for joining us this morning. Please take note that we will participate in the Boenning & Scattergood Conference on March 8 in London. Have a wonderful day. Operator : Ladies and gentleman, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Smith Corporation First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Patricia Ackerman, Vice President, Investor Relations, and Treasurer. Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.: Thank you, Amanda. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on our 2018 first quarter results conference call. With me participating in the call are Ajita Rajendra, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Kevin Wheeler, President and Chief Operating Officer; and John Kita, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin with Ajita's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statement. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning's press release. In order to provide improved transparency into the operating results of our business, we provided non-GAAP measures, adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, and adjusted segment earnings, that excludes the restructuring and impairment costs associated with our plant closure in Renton, Washington. Reconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and also on our website. Also as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. I will now turn the call over to Ajita, who will begin his remarks on slide 4. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Thank you, Pat, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. A 6.5% sales growth in the first quarter was driven by continued demand for our consumer products in China and positive end market for our boilers in North America. Here are a few highlights. Record sales of $788 million, adjusted net earnings of $0.60 per share were 20% higher than our earnings per share in 2017. We continue to review our capital allocation and dedicate a portion of our cash to return to shareholders. We repurchased over 500,000 shares for approximately $33 million. We announced a 29% increase to our dividend in January. The five-year compound annual growth rate of our dividend is over 25%. We repatriated over $210 million during the first quarter using the proceeds to pay down floating-rate debt and improving the flexibility of our balance sheet. We announced earlier this month that A. O. Smith will be the primary water treatment brand at Lowe's beginning in August. The combination of our recent acquisitions of Aquasana and Hague, coupled with our globally accepted and innovative water treatment technologies, and internally developed products, selected tools and brand displays, delivered a compelling product and value proposition to the Lowe's merchandising team. We are very excited about the opportunity we earned because of our water treatment expertise and vision, and also to expand our relationship with our longstanding retail water heater partner. We expect $15 million in sales and a $1 million to $2 million loss due to start-up and transition costs this year. John will now describe our results in more detail beginning with slide 5. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Sales for the first quarter were $788 million or 6.5% higher than the same quarter of 2017. Adjusted net earnings in the first quarter of $104 million increased over 18% from the first quarter in 2017. First quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.60 increased 20% compared with the same quarter in 2017. Sales in our North America segment of $502 million increased 3% compared with the first quarter of 2017. Higher volumes of boilers and pricing actions in 2017 related to steel cost increases were partially offset by lower water heater volumes in Canada. North America water treatment sales comprised of Aquasana and recently acquired Hague incrementally added approximately $8 million to our North America segment sales. Rest of World segment sales of $294 million increased 13% compared with the same quarter in 2017. In China, sales increased 13%, including a benefit from currency translation of approximately $21 million. China sales in local currency terms were muted by the expected impact of a pre-buy in the fourth quarter of 2017. Pricing actions in mid-2017, primarily due to higher steel and installation costs as well as higher demand for the company's gas tankless water heaters and water treatment products, contributed to higher sales and were partially offset by a significant decline in air purification product sales, we believe, primarily due to improved air quality in China. On slide 8, North America adjusted segment earnings of $113 million were 8% higher than segment earnings in the same quarter in 2017. The favorable impact from higher sales of boilers and pricing actions in the U.S. were partially offset by higher steel and other input costs. Adjusted segment earnings exclude $6.7 million of pre-tax charges associated with the plant closing. These factors drove first quarter 2018 adjusted segment margin higher to 22.5% compared with 21.4% last year. Rest of World earnings of $36 million improved 11% compared with first quarter of 2017. Higher China sales, including the price increase, were partially offset by higher steel costs, selling and engineering costs associated with new products and the negative impact of earnings from lower air purification product sales. Translation gains compared with last year added approximately $3 million to earnings. First quarter segment margin of 12.3% was modestly lower than one year ago. Our Corporate expenses were slightly higher in the first quarter compared with the same period in 2017, primarily due to higher spending at our Corporate Technology Center. Our effective income tax rate in the first quarter of 2018 was 21.4%. The rate was lower than the 27.2% experienced during the first quarter last year, primarily due to lower federal income taxes, related to tax reform, which was partially offset by lower stock-based compensation income tax benefits. The lower effective income tax rate benefited first quarter 2018 earnings by $0.04 per share. Excluded from adjusted earnings was $5 million of after-tax restructuring and impairment costs associated with the closure of our Renton, Washington, specialty water heater plant. Efficiencies from manufacturing relocations will be offset by plant inefficiencies and move costs during the second and third quarter. We expect benefits from the relocation in 2019 to be approximately $3 million. Cash provided by operations during the first quarter of 2018 was $43 million compared with $12 million used during the same period in 2017. Higher earnings and a smaller investment in working capital were the primary drivers of higher cash flow compared with last year. Our liquidity position and balance sheet remains strong. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 15% at the end of the first quarter. We have cash balances totaling $680 million located offshore and our net cash position was approximately $387 million at the end of March. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 500,000 shares of common stock for a total of $33 million. Approximately 1.9 million shares remained on our existing repurchase authority at the end of March. This morning, we upgraded our 2018 adjusted EPS guidance with a range of between $2.55 and $2.61 per share. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance represents a 19% increase in EPS compared with our adjusted 2017 results. Our EPS guidance excludes $0.03 per share of plant closing costs. Excluding the U.S. tax reform benefits, our operational performance is expected to improve by over 11%. We expect our cash flow from operations in 2018 to be approximately $475 million, which is higher than the $326 million generated in 2017. We expect higher earnings and lower outlays for working capital this year. Our 2018 capital spending plans were approximately $100 million. Our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $80 million in 2018. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $48 million in 2018, slightly higher than the $47 million in 2017, partially due to higher projected spending at our Corporate Technology Center. Our effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 22% in 2018, lower than the previous year due to U.S. tax reform. We expect to repurchase our shares in the amount of approximately $135 million in 2018 under a 10b5-1 plan, similar to 2017. We may supplement our 10b5-1 plan with opportunistic share repurchase in 2018. We expect our average diluted outstanding shares in 2018 will be approximately 173 million. Kevin Wheeler will summarize our guidance, the business assumptions for the remainder of 2018, and our growth strategy beginning on slide 12. Kevin? Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Our outlook for 2018 includes several tailwinds and headwinds. First, our tailwinds. We project U.S. residential water heater industry volumes will increase 250,000 to 300,000 units in 2018 due to continued new construction and expansion of replacement demand. This assumption includes tankless units. Boiler revenues grew 13% in the first quarter driven by solid demand for condensing boilers and recently introduced product. We expect our boiler business to grow approximately 10% in 2018. As a result of significantly higher steel prices and inflation in freight and other costs, we announced a price increase up to 12% on U.S. water heater products effective in early June. We expect the price increase to average 10% on majority of our water heater products. While we previously expected a modest depreciation of the China currency during 2018, we now project a translation benefit of approximately $55 million to sales compared with the rates in 2017. Our projection is assuming modest appreciation of the China currency during the remainder of the year. The China currency is currently at an exchange rate which we experienced in 2015. And we expect the loss in India to decline from $7.5 million loss in 2017 to $5 million loss in 2018. The headwinds include, our China sales grew 13% in first quarter, including currency gains. The air purifier industry demand declined over 50% in the first quarter, our business was down $11 million from the prior year. We have reassessed our original expectations for our air purifier business and now expect sales to be down from 2017 and to lose $5 million, similar to last year. We expect second quarter China sales growth to be similar to the first quarter due to the pre-buy and decline in air purification sales. We expect the impact of the pre-buy up and the lower air purification sales, and now forecast 9% to 10% growth in local currency and over 14% in U.S. dollars. Our movement of water treatment and air purification manufacturing into our new plant in China will result in projected incremental costs of approximately $5 million, majority of which will occur in the second quarter of 2018. I'm going to move to slide 13. Combined the impacts of the tailwinds and headwinds, we are optimistic about our growth and bottom-line performance for 2018. We project revenue growth will be between 10% to 10.75% for the year. This includes approximately $15 million of revenues in the recently announced water treatment business at Lowe's, and currency translation gains in China of approximately $55 million over the prior year and the 2018 U.S. price increase. We expect U.S. segment margins to be between 21.75% and 22.25%, negatively impacted by the start-up and transition costs of the new Lowe's water treatment business. We project improved performance in China in the second half of the year as the China pre-buy and the plant move costs are behind us. As a result of China and India performance, we expect Rest of World margins to be at least 30 basis points to 40 basis points higher than last year. I'm now moving to slide 14. Last quarter, we updated the components of our growth model to be consistent with the new disclosure rules for disaggregation of segment revenue as well as to incorporate recently acquired and organically fast-growing businesses. We combined North America water treatment and India with our consumer products business in China. This is our high growth category and it represents 36% of company sales. China is expected to continue its mid-teens growth rate due to its strength in water heaters and water treatment products. We expect sales of North America water treatment, composed of Aquasana and Hague products, and the new Lowe's A. O. Smith branded business, will reach over $100 million of revenue this year. With the Lowe's business contributing $35 million to $40 million, we project North America water treatment sales to approach $140 million in 2019 and improve margins by 50% to 13%. Global water treatment sales are forecasted to exceed $525 million in 2019. India grew over 40% last year and we are enthusiastic about our distribution now being pan-India for both water heaters, and water treatment. Based on the investments we have made and expect to make in the future, we project this high-growth portfolio to grow 14% per year. As many of you know, sales of our Lochinvar-branded products are composed of approximately 60% boilers and 40% water heaters. Going forward, our growth model will separate the boiler piece of our company with assumed growth rate which matches its five-year revenue CAGR of 10%. Sales of our North America water heater products remain the largest portion of our company's sales at 58%, including our Lochinvar-branded water heaters. Given the expected new construction needed to support household formation and expanded replacement demand, we project water heater growth at a rate of 4%. The weighted average of our growth model continues to be 8% for the medium-term timeframe. Especially in these uncertain economic times, we believe our organic growth model potential and our stable defensive replacement market, which we believe that represents 85% of North America water heater and boiler volumes, positively differentiates A. O. Smith from other industrial companies. Couple that with our growth and stability, we have a strong balance sheet poised to take advantage of strategic acquisitions that add shareholder value as well as allow us to return cash to our shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Scott Graham of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Good morning. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): So, I have a number of questions, but I'll stay to your format of two and then get back in the queue. The first question that I think comes to mind for me is that the North American residential water heater market, which is your primary business, and it doesn't look like there has been a lot of growth there, frankly, for some time, in a market that has been growing sporadically. Could you talk a little bit about what's going on in that business, which is kind of your flagship? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Well, Scott, we are forecasting, as we said, it to go up 250,000 to 300,000 units this year. And the first quarter was interesting. It was very strong, January-February, and then down in March. Our guess is the industry was up about 40,000 units total, including tankless. We were pretty flat and that's driven primarily by last year's first quarter for us was with Sears was our strongest quarter. So, we kind of performed as expected. The industry was up 40,000. We're calling for 250,000. When I talk to our salespeople, they're very optimistic. The biggest issue both on the residential and commercial is getting labor. But as they talk to people, they're optimistic. So if we do hit the 9.4 million industry that we talked about, that's a pretty significant growth. And now, obviously, that growth goes back. But if you look at the industry in 2009 to 2012, it was 8.1 million units. So now going to 9.4 million over this four or five-year stretch, we have seen decent growth. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah. I understand that. I guess, I was talking more about you relative to the market, and I know that that's sort of one or two months off because of sell-in versus sell-through and all this stuff. It just seemed to me as if \u2013 like the bottom line here is that, are your salespeople saying to you that you are comfortable in retaining share, but at the same time, everyone is kind of losing like a 0.5 point a year to tankless? Would that be a fair statement? Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: This is Kevin, and I'll address that. One that, when you compare Q1, that was the strongest quarter we had back in 2017, which add over 50% growth. And embedded in that, Canada had a price increase in Q1 of last year. So when you put it all together, we're very comfortable \u2013 to answer your share question, we're very comfortable where we're at and being able to compete in the market. And if you look forward, we're very comfortable with the $250,000 to $300,000 (sic) [250,000 to 300,000 units] forecast based on what we see in projects, in feedback that we're receiving from our sales organization. And as far as tankless, we have low-teens share or low-teen share and that is capturing some additional parts of the market. It grew 19% last year, it's growing about 10% this year. It's primarily in California, where it's new construction-oriented. And it continues to grow and we continue to bring products and capture additional customers and share. So overall, we are fairly comfortable with our residential business, its growth rate and its forecast for 2018. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Kevin, thank you. That was very comprehensive answer. I appreciate it. The second question, even though that was kind of a triple-parter, is more about the statement that you make around air filtration, which the text in the press release was sort of around air quality improvement. And I'm sure you mean more than that, because China's air quality didn't suddenly improved in 90 days. Could you talk through what you mean by that and why sales on the market were down 50% in the first quarter? Is that potentially a secular thing? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Well, as you alluded to, the industry was down over 55%. Talking to our people, there was a focus on improved air quality during the quarter, without a doubt. They closed coal plants and what we've heard, they closed them locally as well as much more control on automotive. Now, we will also say we've heard anecdotally that closing the coal plants to just get better air did create some disruptions for companies manufacturing, et cetera. What we can't tell you, Scott, is this sustainable, that they can do it this way or not. But everything we've heard, talking to our people and talking to consultants, is the air quality was better in the quarter and that was the driver. Because otherwise there is no \u2013 the only other explanation that we've talked about in the past is that the consumer is not 100% sure these units are doing anything. Now, again, we told you we put sensors on there, we're doing a much better job of measuring PM2.5. But the only explanation we can come up with is better air quality. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.: Hi, Jeff. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey. So just on the revenue guidance increase, can you just kind of walk through that? Is that mostly FX, price and this incremental Lowe's, or are there some other moving pieces within that? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: I think you hit the majority of them. So when we estimated the year from a currency standpoint, we were expecting the RMB to appreciate a little less than 10 basis points. Last year, was about RMB 6.75 on average. We were expecting it to be a little above RMB 6.65. And now, we know rates are now RMB 6.30, we're expecting closer to RMB 6 \u2013 a little over RMB 6.40. So when you do that, that's about $40 million of incremental currency gain that we didn't have in our original estimate. Now, as you know, we took China down. If you look at we were 12.5% to 13% \u2013 12% to 13% when we talked in January, we're now saying 9% to 10%. That's about a 3 point difference, that's about $30 million, we're taking it down due to that. And again, we're saying that's basically all air purification. We expected \u2013 last year, air purification was $44 million, $45 million. We expect it to go to $65 million this year. Given the first quarter and given the second quarter, we're saying $40 million kind of at best. So that's the negative. And then, yeah, you add price and you add the Lowe's business. And that's why we're comfortable going from the 8.5% to 9.5% that we had in January to the 10% to 10.75% that we're forecasting now. So, there's a lot of puts and takes. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's very helpful. And then just on price, I know you guys don't like to talk too much about that, but have you seen similar size price increases from the other players in the water heater market at this point? And I guess just given the magnitude relative to kind of normal, what are you expecting in terms of any kind of pushback? Thanks. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Jeff, this is Ajita. As we've said before, we don't really comment on what anyone else is doing in terms of price. We put our pricing out there and we are very comfortable in terms of where we are. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Giannakouros of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good morning, everyone. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.: Hi. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Just to touch on Rest of World margin expectations. Obviously, lots of puts and takes there. But mix influences, leverage, marketing spend, obviously, FX clearly helping. Can you call out or at least rank-order the year-over-year impacts there and how you're kind of keeping your margin guidance for the year? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Well, actually the currency doesn't really have an effect on the margin because sales are going up and, correspondingly, the EBIT. So we're not seeing any effect there. When we look at Rest of World, we talked about India. India, certainly, we expect to be a contributor. If you lost $7.5 million last year, you lose $5 million this year, that's $2.5 million on whatever, $1.1 billion. So, we pick up 20 basis points there. We expect China to be at least as good from a margin standpoint, even overcoming two things; the loss in air purification that we had in forecast and the $5 million of inefficiencies of the new plant. We expect China to be flattish to maybe up a little bit. So, I mean, I'd say, when you flush through everything, the biggest thing is India, and why we're comfortable raising 30 basis points to 40 basis points from last year. Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Got it. Thanks. And maybe to tack on to Scott's original question, I mean, if you can give us an update on your sense of the state of the U.S. replacement cycle, just taking simple math on expected life of 10 years to 15 years for your water heaters here and the 2002 to 2008 swell on housing starts, should we think that that's going to taper in the next year or two? But if I recall, you still think that we have probably more runway there. So, I'd like to hear your updated thoughts there. Thanks. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah, I think all the studies we've seen, and they're done by independent third parties, say the average life of water heater is over 14 years, and that has increased. So if you look at the last figures of 2006-2007, that would take you out to the early 2020s. Now, we would also tell you that we don't think housing start of the 1.2 million are the right number, but we think that's going to continue to grow this year, housing starts and completions we're estimating up 100,000 units. So at some point, but I think it's in the future is when we'll have that, we'll have to evaluate that. Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Charley Brady of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is open. Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Good morning, Pat. Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.: Hi. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Just on the Lowe's deal, you talk \u2013 that's going to start in August. Are there costs that have to run ahead of that so that they slip into Q2 or should we expect those costs to all be mostly Q3 and into Q4? Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: This is Kevin. I'll take that. We expect most of it to be in around the timeframe that our implementation in August starts. As you know when you take on a significant amount of business, and certainly $35 million to $40 million of water treatment business from Lowe's is a significant win for our organization. But with that comes a inventory transition that we'll have to be working through. And again, that will happen about the same time as we're doing the transition in August. There'll be displays in point of purchase that we'll be resetting over 1,700 stores and the displays are going to be really focused on being consumer friendly and helping the consumer through the purchasing process of a very difficult purchase decision for them. And then there's just certification and packaging. Some of that will come maybe prior to August. But again if you look at it, most of it's going to be in that timeframe as we start to execute around August and get it fully implemented, hopefully, within 30 or so days. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: The only thing I'll add is we will have some costs in the second quarter, but Kevin's right, the majority will be in the third quarter. And then in fourth quarter, we start moving to profitability. Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. That's very helpful on the timing. Thanks. And just on just North America, broadly speaking, on the margin there as it pertains to price increases, you're obviously capturing that from the 2017 price increase. You've got another one going in, I guess, in June. In between where we're at now and June, are we raw material cost neutral or we have to catch up until we get to the price increase coming up in the summer? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Well, I'll answer it this way. Steel costs progressively increase throughout the year, but we really get affected in the second half of the year more materially than the second quarter. So, that will kind of be the transition, it will line up well with the price increase for the most part, which will be effective essentially in the \u2013 late in June. Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah. Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Matt Summerville of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Matt J. Summerville - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Thanks. Couple of questions. First, I don't recall you guys saying anything in your prepared remarks around the North American commercial water heater market. So maybe if you could speak to what you felt the industry did in Q1 and, specifically, what your outlook is for both the gas and electric side of the business for the full year? Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: This is Kevin. The first quarter was really flat year-over-year. And we were a bit surprised, because we did have a pre-buy in Q4. And we anticipated 5,000 being pulled in and that to have that impact in Q1. The pre-buy did not appear really to affect the commercial market. So, electric volumes were essentially flat. And so, as we go forward, we're going to change our forecasts. And given the neutral start of the commercial business and the industry, we revised our full-year forecast to be flat over last year, and that's both on gas and electric. Matt J. Summerville - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Got it. And then just a follow-up on China. You mentioned air purification sort of down maybe 10%, I think, is what your new assumption is for the year. Can you also talk about what your assumption is for China water treatment? And then, what you're seeing in the water heater volume versus price, specifically, in China? And I'm curious as to whether or not you're seeing volume in the legacy sort of electric product continue to grow. Thank you. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: So, the water treatment had a good quarter. The industry, we think, was up about 11%. We were up 14% in RMB terms and up over 20% in U.S. dollar terms. We're expecting for the year that water treatment is going to be up probably about 18% to 19% in local currency terms and well over 20% in U.S. dollar terms. From a volume standpoint, I would tell you that the electric was somewhat flat from a volume standpoint, as this transition that we see from electric to gas continues, and our gas units were up. So, that's kind of the broad on the water heater side. Matt J. Summerville - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mike Halloran of Baird. Your line is open. Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey. Good morning, everyone. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: So on the air purification side in China, has this changed your long-term thought process in terms of investment or approach? In other words, do you think this is a blip, is it structural? Do you still see the same opportunity set? Any color around that would be great. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Mike, this is Ajita. We don't know what the impact is going to be in terms of the \u2013 as John said, in terms of what the government did whether it is sustainable. If you recall, they did something similar before the Olympics few years ago. Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Cleaned up the air quality for a while and then things went back to normal. So here, what we did hear that there was significant disruption. People were not happy because it impacted their life, and because there was not enough capacity of other types of heating to compensate for the loss of the coal-fired plants. Okay? So, that's what happened in the past. How it's going to happen in the future? We don't know. However, from our perspective, we have some really exciting new products that are coming out and we are continuing like the market is going to be continuing to grow, but probably not at the pace that we've seen in the last couple of years. So, that's our approach. That's the best we know now. Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Makes sense, and then... Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: But we're continuing to invest in the new products and new capabilities and the products that we're putting out. Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks for that. And then another China question, obviously, North America, you're putting through the 10% price increase. Maybe just some thoughts on the price/cost in China. It doesn't sound like it's a big concern for you considering where the margin guidance is, but just some thoughts directionally and how you expect that to trend. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Well, we did put price increases last year. I would tell you there is steel increase in China, but it's not to the extent we've seen in the U.S. So, I think at this point, we're comfortable with the cost/price relationship. Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you for the time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Sam Eisner of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, everyone. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Just going to your North American margin guidance. So, midpoint of the guide is 22%. You guys last year did 22.5%. Obviously, doing much better here in the first quarter than we expected from a profitability standpoint. I guess, how do you guys think about the overall margin compression year-on-year? Recognized only 50 basis points, but John, your comments just before were indicating that you expect the inflation to be more 2H weighted, I guess that's when the pricing is heading. So I guess I'm failing to understand where the compression is going to come from or maybe I'm missing something in how you guys are thinking about it. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Well, the Lowe's, right off the bat, takes about 30 basis points when you lose $1.5 million on $15 million of sales. So, that's probably the biggest impact going from the 22.5% down to 20%. Otherwise, I would tell you, it's primarily noise. But clearly, the Lowe's business is the biggest factor. Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Understood. That's helpful. And then maybe a question for the long term for Ajita. Just the balance sheet has gotten cleaned up. It looks like, you paid down some floating-rate debt. Obviously, your net cash balance is approaching $400 million. Your water treatment business is getting much larger. You called out the fact that it's now a global business. And so, maybe you can talk about just the long term. What's the right way to think about this business in the next two, three years? What's the overall outlook for water treatment for A. O. Smith? Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: So I think, from a capital allocation perspective, in terms of what we've done in the past, you see that our acquisition targets have been very strategic. And as you look at \u2013 when you think about water treatment, I'm going to say, three, four years back as we laid out our strategy globally, we said this is going to be a global business. We targeted India \u2013 outside of China, India and the U.S. And in the U.S., you can see that there were some very, very specific strategic moves that we made, taking our brand to Lowe's, making the acquisitions that we did in terms of Aquasana and Hague that then rounded out our line and gave us a broad line that we could then be a serious player and go compete for this business with, I would argue, the most competitive environment in certainly this country, which is trying to get big-box business, which we succeeded in doing, displacing brands that have been around for much longer than we have in the water treatment business. So, we see water treatment as being a major growth driver for us in the future, both in China, in India and in the U.S. And us getting into Lowe's is the start of that with what we are hearing about in terms of \u2013 you have a number of \u2013 we've always said, there are a number of Flints (40:07) around the nation. The average municipal water infrastructure in major cities is over 75 years old. And as people start realizing what the quality of their water is, we see this business growing and we are investing behind it and counting on that growth. Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: All right. That's helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Your line is open. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Yes. Good morning, everyone. Can you just update us on Nanjing? I think you talked about the $5 million first quarter incremental costs. Can you provide some detail around how we should think about the impact for 2Q, 3Q, Q4 just over the next few quarters as we go forward? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: I think what we tried to say is for this year the impact will be about $5 million and we're expecting about $3 million of it \u2013 about $500,000 we experienced in the first quarter. We expect a little over $3 million in the second quarter. And that's really driven by \u2013 that's when the transition is going to be taking place. We'll be opening new plant. We're going to be operating two plants. We're going to have a move cost, just general inefficiencies, et cetera, depreciation and lease costs on both, if you will. And so then, as we get to the second half of the year, we'll start experiencing some Lowe's efficiencies that will offset the higher depreciation and utility costs. So I guess, I'd say, it's $500,000, $300,000 and probably, $750,000, $750,000, or what are the numbers in order to get to $5 million. And then next year, we're up and running and the plant is running efficiently, and we're offsetting some of those higher utilities and depreciation. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Got it. Thanks for that. And secondly, just to follow up on a previous question with regard to Lowe's, notwithstanding, you've got sort of all the loading costs and everything is going on this year, but if you think on more of a normalized basis, so I guess 2019 and beyond, I guess, two questions. Number one, how should we think about the growth potential in North American market for that Lowe's business, how does that revenue grow? And then, secondly, is it accretive or dilutive to the North American margins? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Well, I'll answer the last one. Ultimately, as we move up over the next couple of years, it's dilutive. But certainly, our objective is to get it up to North America margins in the next three years or so. But during this transition, and we grow sales, et cetera, it will be dilutive to the North America margins. Kevin, I don't know if you want to answer the... Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. From a sales perspective, I mean, as we get through the transition and get into 2019, we'll have the full benefit, as I mentioned the $35 million to $40 million. We see long-term growth there. We believe that the consumer has not been \u2013 they've been confused about the product category, how to pick, how to choose their products. And the displays and things that we have in there are going to help that process. We're bringing a full line of products as well as our high-end RO, high performance, leading product there as well. So when you look at it as a whole, I'm going to go back to what Ajita said about the strategy, we look at it as a long-term growth component of our business and we will \u2013 as far as how it generates additional sales into the remaining years is going to be depended up on our effectiveness of our displays and how we go to market as well as the things that may happen, like another Flint (43:43) and other things like that. And as education goes up, we're very enthusiastic about the water treatment business in the U.S. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : How do you think about the longer-term category growth rate then, if we could ask it that way? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: I think mid-single... Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: ...mid- to high-single digits is what we've been talking about. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: And we hope we can, through education, even improve it higher than that. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Right. Because there isn't any \u2013 there isn't a lot of good data out there, especially on the filtration side. There is good data on the softening side. And what we believe and our research shows, we've done a significant amount of consumer research on this category, which is what helped us also develop our portfolio of products and value proposition for Lowe's. We feel that this category is going to continue to grow, especially on the filtration side. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors of Boenning & Scattergood. Your line is open. Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Did want to stick with the topic of Lowe's just for a minute, and congratulations on the deal, seems very exciting. But I want to understand better the interplay between the incremental business here and the existing water treatment business that you have, and whether this is entirely incremental or whether there's some degree of channel overlap and could there actually be some near-term cannibalization of your existing business there? Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: This is Kevin. As far as overlap, we see very little to none. This is a new channel, a new category for us and we had no presence until Lowe's. Yes, we have a e-commerce business and, of course, we had some business through Hague. But we look at this as primarily incremental business and with very, very little or no cannibalization. Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Okay. And then my follow-on to that is regarding Lowe's from a bigger picture strategic standpoint. Obviously, this deepens your relationship with them. You had the move last year of moving the flagship water heater brand into Lowe's. So, you've got a pretty significant presence now there for the brand and for the company. Obviously, they're known for being aggressive at times in line reviews and that sort of things. So, I guess, my question is two-fold. Number one, do you see further opportunities in the future to continue to build on that relationship and how do you look at Lowe's strategically for the company? And then relatedly, how do you protect yourself against some of the things that can happen, dealing with the big boxes, as you kind of alluded to, Ajita, and then being this tough customer at times? Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: We feel very good about the relationship. Certainly, we want to be able to leverage it going forward. In terms of dealing with big boxes and all of that, we know we've been a partner with Lowe's for \u2013 when you go back to before the American Water Heater acquisition, I think it's been (47:00) 30 years? Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: At least. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: So 30 years plus, we have a very good partnership, I truly call it a partnership, and we're looking at any opportunity we can to grow the business there. The move of our flagship brand into Lowe's has \u2013 we are both very happy with the performance. I can't be specific about numbers, because Lowe's has not been public about the numbers. But I can say that we are both very happy with the performance of the brand at Lowe's. Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Great. Well, thanks for the color and congrats again. It's exciting. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yes. Hi. Thank you for allowing the follow-ups here. I don't remember when we had a 12% broad price increase like we're looking for next quarter. I'm just kind of wondering, have \u2013 other than that product line increases that are, whether NAECA or other trade driven, have you put out any price increase even close to this? And then the question by extension is kind of what's been the trade feedback in front of such an increase? Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: From a historic perspective, we have, and it's been driven by steel prices. I go back to the early 2000s, where we had significant steel price increases, and I'm going to say they were higher than this. They were high teens, from my recollection, high teens type price increases we had to put through. And in terms of the market, I'll have Kevin respond to that. Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: Over the years, on any price increase, particularly in water heaters, if there is a component out there that really drives that increase, and I would say steel has been the primary component, it's clear that there is a need out there. It's clear to our customers, distributors, retailers, to our contractors, and all the way down to builders and so forth. So, this is a need-based increase. And historically, those have been increases that have been put in the market, executed and implemented relatively without incident. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. And if you take a step back and look at the market in total, as Kevin said, the price increases are usually driven, the impetus for a price increase is a significant increase in some sort of cost, commodity cost or some sort of cost. This is not an industry that has an annual-type price increase. It's the impetus that drives it. And if you take a step back, with all of that, the price of a residential water heater with the warranties, about how long it lasts, et cetera, et cetera, is still very reasonable in the marketplace. So, I think those are the key drivers. Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. I would tell you, just the reaction from our customer, based on our announcement, has been relatively similar to the past. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And your escalator clauses with retailers versus your, let's say \u2013 and your newer pricing with distributors, that gap will be maintained? Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Scott, this is Ajita. That's getting into the type of detail we're getting uncomfortable with. But what we see overall is that the implementation of this is \u2013 we don't see major change from history. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. So, you're not fearful of, let's say, a pre-buy in the second quarter and potential mix shifts to retail, which is lower margin? Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: I think \u2013 let me answer, first of all, we've never talked about a mix impact between channels. Okay? But in terms of pre-buy, I think it will be within the quarter. So, it's not going to be \u2013 if there is a pre-buy, you're going to get the plus and minus within the quarter. So, you're not going to see an impact in the quarter. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got it. Okay. Hey, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Patricia Ackerman for closing remarks. Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.: Thank you all for joining us on our conference call today.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Patricia Ackerman, Vice President-Investor Relations and Treasurer. Ma'am, you may begin. Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.: Thank you, Mark. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on our 2018 second quarter results conference call. With me participating in the call are Ajita Rajendra, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Kevin Wheeler, President and Chief Operating Officer; and John Kita, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin with Ajita's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statement. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning's press release. Also as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. I will now turn the call over to Ajita, who will begin our prepared remarks on slide 3. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Thank you, Pat, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Our 13% sales growth in the second quarter was primarily driven by higher sales of water heaters and boilers in North America, and higher sales in China, including currency gains. Here are a few highlights. We achieved record sales of $833 million. Net earnings of $0.66 per share were 25% higher than our earnings per share in 2017. We continue to review our capital allocation and dedicate a portion of our cash to return to shareholders. We repurchased 1.1 million shares for approximately $70 million through the first half of the year. As a result of continued strong cash flow, our board approved an incremental 2.5 million shares to repurchase at its meeting earlier this month. We plan to continue buying back our shares at the previously stated $135 million annual pace using a 10b5-1 plan, and in addition, opportunistically buy back shares in the open market. We announced the 29% increase to our dividend in January. The five-year compound annual growth rate of our dividend is over 25%. We repatriated nearly $240 million in the first half of 2018 using the proceeds to pay down floating-rate debt and improving the flexibility of our balance sheet. John will now describe our results in more detail beginning with slide number 4. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Sales for the second quarter of $833 million were 13% higher than the same quarter in 2017. Net earnings in the second quarter of $115 million increased 24% from the second quarter in 2017. Second quarter earnings per share of $0.66 increased 25% compared with the same quarter in 2017. Sales in our North America segment of $534 million increased nearly 14% compared with the second quarter of 2017, primarily due to higher volumes of water heaters and boilers in North America and pricing actions related to steel cost increases. North America water treatment sales comprised of Aquasana and Hague, incrementally adding approximately $7 million to our North America segment sales. Rest of World segment sales of $308 million increased 13% compared with the same quarter in 2017. China sales growth was 12%, including a benefit from currency translation of approximately $19 million. China sales grew 4% in local currency. Pricing actions in mid-2017, primarily due to higher steel and installation costs, as well as higher sales of gas tankless water heaters and water treatment products, contributed to higher sales and were partially offset by the decline in air purification products and e-commerce sales compared with the prior year. On slide 6, North America segment earnings of $125 million were nearly 15% higher than segment earnings in the same quarter in 2017. The favorable impact from higher sales of water heaters, boilers and pricing actions in the U.S. were partially offset by higher steel and other input costs. North America segment margin was slightly higher than last year. Rest of World earnings of $35 million improved 7% compared with the second quarter of 2017. Higher China sales, including the price increase, were offset by higher engineering and advertising costs. In addition, higher depreciation and utility costs and inefficiencies, all associated with the new water treatment plant negatively impacted earnings. Translation gains compared with last year added approximately $2 million to earnings. Second quarter segment margin of 11.3% was lower than one year ago due to these factors. Our corporate expenses were similar to last year. Our effective income tax rate in the second quarter of 2018 was 21.7%. The rate was lower than the 27.8% experienced during the second quarter last year, primarily due to lower federal income taxes related to tax reform. The lower effective income tax rate benefited second quarter 2018 earnings by $0.05 per share. Cash provided by operations during the second quarter of 2018 was $173 million compared with $73 million provided during the same period in 2017. Higher earnings and a smaller investment in working capital were the primary drivers of higher cash flow compared with last year. Our liquidity position and balance sheet remains strong. Our debt to capital ratio was 12.5% at the end of the second quarter. We have cash balances totaling $658 million located offshore and our net cash position was approximately $410 million at the end of June. During the first half of the year, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of common stock for a total of $70 million. Our board approved the repurchase of an additional 2.5 million shares at its meeting in July. The new authority is in addition to the authority to repurchase approximately 1.3 million shares, which remained at the end of June. This morning, we upgraded our 2018 EPS guidance with a range between $2.59 and $2.63 per share. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance represents a 20% increase in EPS compared with our adjusted 2017 results. Our EPS guidance excludes $0.03 per share of plant closing costs. Excluding the U.S. tax reform benefit, our operational performance is expected to improve by 12%. Please turn to slide 9 for several 2018 assumptions. We expect our cash flow from operations in 2018 to be approximately $475 million, which is significantly higher than the $326 million generated in 2017. We expect higher earnings and lower outlays for working capital this year. Our 2018 capital spending plans are approximately $100 million. Our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $80 million in 2018. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $48 million in 2018, slightly higher than the $47 million in 2017, partially due to higher projected spending at our Corporate Technology Center. Our effective income tax rate is expected to be between 21.5% and 22% in 2018, lower than the previous year due to U.S. tax reform. We expect to repurchase our shares in the amount of approximately $135 million in 2018, under a 10b5-1 plan, similar to 2017. We may supplement our 10b5-1 plan with opportunistic share repurchase in 2018. We expect our average diluted outstanding shares in 2018 will be approximately 173 million. Kevin will summarize our guidance, the business assumptions for the remainder of 2018 and our growth strategy beginning on slide 10. Kevin? Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: Thank you, John. Our outlook for 2018 includes several tailwinds and headwinds. First, our tailwinds. We project U.S. residential water heater industry volumes will increase approximately 350,000 to 400,000 units in 2018 due to continued new construction and expansion of replacement demand. This assumption includes tankless units. Boiler revenues grew 10% in the first half of 2018, driven by solid demand for our commercial boilers and recently introduced products. We expect our boiler sales to grow approximately 10% in 2018. As a result of significant higher steel prices and inflation in freight and other costs, we announced a price increase effective in early June, which will average approximately 10% on the majority of our U.S. water heater products. Given significant depreciation of the China currency in the last month, we now project the full-year translation benefit of approximate $33 million compared with sales in 2017, which is $22 million smaller than our April forecast. Our projection assumes the China currency will appreciate slightly from current levels during the second half of 2018, resulting in a small translation detriment of approximately $7 million to sales in the second half compared with rates in 2017. We expect the losses in India to decline from $7.5 million loss in 2017 to a $5 million loss in 2018. The headwinds are higher steel prices and lower China sales growth. In the second half of 2018, we expect local currency sales in China to grow at a slightly higher rate than the first half or approximately 6%. Sales are expected to be negatively impacted in the second half of the year by high channel inventory levels, which we believe to be the result of recently significant declines in the growth rate housing sales in China. For the full year, we project more than 8% growth and 5% in local currency terms. We are confident the underlying fundamentals of our China business, including a well-known premium consumer brand and reputation for innovation, reliable products. In housing, sales recover before the end of the year, we project China's sales contribution of double-digit sales growth for the next year and beyond to remain intact. New product introductions, fast-growing water treatment products, improvement in housing formation and growing replacement demand are expected to drive future growth. Lastly, we launch our A. O. Smith branded water treatment products at Lowe's next month. The combination of our recent acquisitions of Aquasana and Hague, coupled with our globally accepted and innovative water treatment technologies and internally developed product selector tools and branded displays provide a compelling product proposition to customers interested in the quality and safety of their homes' water. We expect $15 million of sales and a $1 million to $2 million loss this year due to startup and transition costs. Please advance to slide 11. Primarily as a result of strength in North America, we are optimistic about our growth in bottom-line performance for 2018. We project revenue growth will be between 9.5% and 10% for the year. We raised our guidance for the full year to $2.59 to $2.63. As a reminder, our third quarter will be burdened by lighter water heater volume, driven by seasonality and a water heater price increase related to pre-buy, which benefited the second quarter, start-up costs for the new Lowe's water treatment business, and higher steel costs. Despite subdued third quarter performance, we expect 2018 second half earnings will be stronger than the first half of the year. We expect North America adjusted segment margin for the year to be between 22.25% and 22.5%, with the third quarter negatively impacted by the startup and transition costs of the new Lowe's water treatment business and lower water heater volumes. We project weaker performance in the Rest of World segment in the third quarter, but recovery in the fourth quarter as normal seasonality is expected to favorably impact China and India volumes later this year. For the full year, we expect Rest of World margins to be flat to slightly down from last year. Please advance to slide 12. Earlier this year, we updated the components of our growth model to be consistent with the new disclosure rules for disaggregation of segment revenues, as well as to incorporate recently acquired and organically fast-growing businesses. We're comfortable with our 8% local currency growth model for 2019 and beyond predicated on housing recovery in China. That concludes our prepared remarks and we're now available for your questions. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Before we go on, I want to just kind of summarize and put it all together. This is Ajita. 2018 is turning out to be a very solid year for us, where it's almost 10% top-line growth, 20% EPS growth over last year. And we are achieving this without all of our units performing at top performance \u2013 at top levels. And this shows the strength of the portfolio of businesses that we have. And as Kevin said, we're very comfortable with the longer-term 8% organic growth guidance that we've been giving you. Pat, anything else you want to add? Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.: I'll wrap up at the end. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Okay. I guess we're done and open for questions. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Hey, Scott. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And, Ajita, I know that you are not leaving us. But as this is, I'm assuming, your last conference call leading the call, I just want to say congratulations and good luck again, even though I know that you'll still be around. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Thank you. Yeah, I'll still be around quite a while (15:56). R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Sure. So, I guess, my question, of course, will be on China. And I guess the way I'm looking at this is that you have a CEO transition taking place. You've got an analyst meeting coming up in November. So, I'm assuming, internally, you've kind of flushed out what you're thinking on China, at least in large part, I'm guessing. And so, I guess my questions are these. First of all, the slowdown in housing in China has kind of been with us for a while. The completions have been weak for a while. I guess I'm kind of wondering why all of a sudden is there an inventory channel build as opposed to not having occurred earlier. And then, secondly, I guess my thinking here is that, obviously, water treatment is now kind of taking the lead there. Would you expect the water heater market to revert back to that 7% growth next year and why? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: So, Scott, I'll start and they can fill in. I mean, it is kind of a first half/second half, there are different items that have come up. We had talked about the first half being up about 4%, and that's about where it came up. And it was due to two reasons. The growth wasn't as much as we expected, but it was the 4% that we had talked about, and that was two reasons. One, air purifier's down about $18 million from last year's first half. And then the second piece is our online sales are down about 13% when you take out the air purifier portion of that. Now, we had talked on the January conference call that there was a pre-buy and we had actually even said that some of that was for online. So, the decline in online was impacted by that as well as, quite frankly, we didn't come out with a water treatment product for online as quickly as we thought we were going to. So that impacted the first half. Now, your question is what's changed with respect to the second half, and I would tell you it's a series of things. One is when we were talking in the first quarter, appliance sales were strong, consumer spending was strong, but you're right, it had started flattening. Housing had started flattening, which was the first time it hadn't grown for a long period of time. The inventory levels from the year-end to the first quarter grew exactly the same amount in units as the prior year December to the first quarter, okay? So when we look out at the second half, we were saying we think we can get back to more normal growth. Now, let's roll through the second quarter. What happened is inventories actually grew. They grew about 15%. Historically, first quarter to second quarter, they would've been flat or down. Number two, we re-looked at what we're seeing in air purifier. We talked on the first call $40 million. We are coming out with new products, but we think more realistic is last half down a little bit from last year's last half. So that's a $15 million decline from what we said about first quarter. And then as we talk to our distributors, I mean, there is concern, right? Consumer confidence, the economy is slowing down there. Housing hasn't turned. It's been flat now for two or three quarters. The currency has dropped dramatically in the last month. It's dropped 6%. So it really had us step back and kind of take a look and say, we need to kind of get through the inventory, we need to get through this half of the year. And that was really the driver on saying our second half sales are going to be up from the first half, but not what we expected. So, that's a long litany, but I mean that's how we looked at it internally recently. And again, our people have talked to distributors in July, and we just thought it prudent to take it down. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Well, that was very clear, John, as far as what's going on in this year. I very much appreciate that. I guess I'm hoping the part two of the question is, you guys have expressed \u2013 Ajita, your wrap-up comments as well expressed a lot of confidence in your business model in China, and it's understandable. I guess the question would be, you're comfortable with the 8% organic long term, but is 2019 the year where that business is just so big now in China that maybe the target shouldn't be 15%, maybe it should be 12%? Is 2019 the year where maybe we have to pull that down a little bit and then maybe water treatment in the U.S., for example, fills the gap between that and the 8%? Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. Let me make some comments on what you said. First of all, the longer-term fundamental, I feel very comfortable with, as I said. What's going to happen in 2019? I don't know, because right now what's driving this slowdown in China is the economy in China and the slowdown in housing. Now, we know that that's going to improve at some point. And in fact, you would have seen over the last few days, the Chinese government has started taking steps to increase liquidity and put more money into the economy. Okay? So when that comes back, we expect the economy to come back. The fundamentals in China in terms of the massive movement of people into the middle class, the strength of our very strong consumer brand and our distribution, all those fundamentals are very solid. And I think that as you look at this and you look at \u2013 put this, overlay this on our results so far this year and the guidance for the full year, which is almost 10% growth and the 20% EPS \u2013 10% top-line growth and 20% EPS growth, it just shows the strength of the portfolio that we have, that even without all the businesses at top performance, we are still able to get this kind of performance. So, we feel very comfortable going forward. The specific question you had in terms of what's 2019 going to be like, it really depends on how quickly the Chinese economy comes back. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: The only other comment I'd give you, Scott, is you know our growth model now talks about 14% growth for those high growing, and you're right, we do expect India to grow above that. We do expect North America water treatment to do that \u2013 do above that. We don't need China to grow at 14%, but we're not giving up by any means because of the issues that \u2013 I mean the macro factors that are there. But that's why we're comfortable in total with that 14% for 2019 for the high-growth piece (23:08). R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): With the understanding that you might have to lean on that diversification that I alluded to and that you're alluding to now that China might actually be going forward not to 15% organic growth, but maybe something a couple of points less than that. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. Again, I'd say we're certainly not giving up on that. But in 2019, that's certainly the possibility, without a doubt. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. It depends on when it comes back, but we've always said, every portion of that equation is not going to be hitting every time. But in total, we are very comfortable. And again, I go back to 2018 as a great example that we're hitting our longer-term guidance, top and bottom line, without every unit performing at peak performance. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Right. And I appreciate that. If I can just sneak in a follow-up here on the Rest of World margin, because I know you guys have been frustrated at its level for some time. In fact, 2018's Rest of World margin, call it, 13-and-change, there was a lot of trials and tribulations within that number. So, would that suggest that the setup here for after this year that you can actually start to push that margin up having, again, with the 2018 issues kind of doing a bit of a reset on purification, maybe even on water heaters, does that portend well for improvement in margin in the Rest of World after this year? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: I mean, I'll let Kevin answer the going forward. But I think this year, margins are certainly being impacted, and we've actually dropped them from our last call, because air purification, we had told you, was going to lose $5 million. It's now going to lose, we think, closer to $8 million. So, we certainly have an area there that we have to address. Number two, what also is having a factor on margins this year, which we've also talked about, is we brought a new water treatment plant on board, and we had inefficiencies. As we talked about in the script, we had higher depreciation and utilities, which we knew and that was all built into the $5 million. But you're right, going forward, we certainly expect efficiencies in that plant are going to help offset that. So, I'll let Kevin talk to going forward. Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: Well, going forward, we certainly will get efficiencies from our new water treatment plant. Some of the, I guess, headwinds behind us will be behind us. We'll improve our e-commerce sales. We'll have new products coming to market in number of categories, water treatment, tankless and in water heaters. So going forward, we do see being able to leverage our operations and also increase those margins. Again, they'll be incrementally 0.25 points, 0.5 points moving forward, but we do believe, and we continue to put programs in place where we believe we can move the Rest of World margins forward. Again, John talked about India. There's a number of other areas that are going to help us as we go forward to increase those incrementally over time. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville from D.A. Davidson. Sir, your line is open. Matt J. Summerville - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Thank you. Couple of questions. Just again, sticking with the China business. Can you give more specificity, you mentioned where you felt air purification would come in, where you feel the water heater business is going to come in, in 2018 versus 2017, as well as water treatment? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Well, I'll start with water treatment. So, water treatment was up in local currency terms about 15% in the first half. But again, it's a tale of two cities. The offline was up significantly, over 25%. The online was down almost 25%. And again, the online being two factors. One, there was an inventory build; and two, we didn't have the product that we wanted to bring to market. So, I would tell you, in general, we're very pleased with the first half of water treatment. When we look at the full year, we expect the second half growth to be more than the first half. So, we're calling for air \u2013 water treatment to be in kind of the 18% to 19% type in local currency terms, and even more than that U.S. dollar terms. So, we're pleased. Again, we get that new product out. It's going to eliminate a lot of the connections. So, we're optimistic on that product. But again, it's complex and we had a big move go on. So we're later than we expected. So, water treatment's doing very well. Water heater offline had a good first quarter, a good first half. But quite frankly, we're not expecting that in the second half as we work down the inventory. So, we'll say the second half is going to be somewhat flattish to up a little bit in RMB terms. But we think it's important to reduce those inventory levels. Matt J. Summerville - D.A. Davidson & Co.: And then as my follow-up, with respect to the price increase you've put in place in early June, would you say the majority of that 10% or the full 10% is sticking at this point? And then, can you also just maybe put that in the context of you mentioned, I think it was maybe, Kevin, in his prepared remarks, that you felt that the pre-buy you saw in Q2 would impact volumes in Q3. But I thought on your first quarter call, you'd felt that maybe that wasn't the factor. So, I guess, I'm trying to understand the change in stance on that issue. Thank you. Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: Let me take the \u2013 as far as the price increase that we announced in early June and the up to 12% with a 10% average across the board, that's been executed and implemented. With regards to the pre-buy, what we said is there would be a minimal to, we believe, no pre-buy just because of the timing of it, early June. If you look at our AHRI data, we had a very strong April, had a very strong May. And I will tell you, we had a strong June. When you put them all together, we believe the industry is up about 300,000 units. And that would indicate there was some type of pre-buy. The math that we've done, we figure somewhere in the neighborhood of 100,000 to 150,000 units were pulled forward. And I would tell you, that's about a week, maybe even a little bit less. So, it was minimal, but there was a pre-buy, and we felt that it was important for us to explain that to you on the call. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: And we don't know for sure. But I think, as Kevin said, June being up was a surprise to us. And we talked to our customers, and I'd say inventory levels are a little bit heavy, not bad, but a little bit heavy. So, I think we just assume, for the most part, that the June excess was pre-buy. That's our caution (30:34). Matt J. Summerville - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning, Jeff. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: So just on North America, is there a way \u2013 if you look at the 12% growth, is there a way to break out units versus price, and then maybe just speak to what \u2013 I jumped on late. I don't know if you mentioned what boiler growth was in the quarter. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Well, I'll start. North America, we don't traditionally break out price and volume. But I will tell you, residential volumes were up significantly in the quarter. Commercial volumes were up in the quarter, not as much. Boiler sales were up 10%. I will tell you, Lochinvar, as a whole, was up even more than that, because they were strong in their water heater and their custom commercial water heater. And then you throw in what we talked about North America water treatment of $7 million or so. It's all of those factors come into why volume was very strong in North America. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then just it looks like the margins year-to-date are 23%. North America, you're guiding to a lower second half. Can you just speak to why the margins stepped down just given that price seems to be running through? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. And it's really the third quarter. I mean, we would expect fourth quarter margins to be fairly consistent with last year. It's really the third quarter and it's a few factors. One is, we talked about the loss we're going to experience on Lowe's as we buy back the inventory and the transition costs. Much of that hits in the third quarter. Seasonally, third quarter residential volumes are lower than normal, than the other three, I'll say. And then we think that gets extended because of a little bit of pre-buy. So, I think those are probably the two biggest factors on why the third quarter margins, we would expect, would be down. But, again, fourth quarter back to normal. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then D&A, it looks like you're running \u2013 you're saying $80 million and you're running, I think, $35 million through year-to-date. What's the dynamic there that that steps up? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: I would have to look. I think we've obviously had some capital, but I would say that number might be a little bit high. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Charlie Brady of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Good morning, Pat. Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hey. Can you guys quantify the Lowe's impact that's going to hit in Q3, either dollars or margin wise? Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. Right now, we anticipate Lowe's to be on the sales side about plus $15 million. And then there'll be a loss of about $1 million to $2 million just due to the various transition costs, the displays and so forth that we'll need to do to convert the 1,700-plus stores. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: In the third quarter, it costs us almost 1 point compared to \u2013 if you didn't have North America water treatment and just the other businesses, it costs us almost 1 point. Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Got it. Got it. Makes sense. And then just in terms of the \u2013 talked about China advertising cost and I guess looking at the Rest of World margins, I mean, and you talked about getting that up. I mean, can you just \u2013 is there something driving a short-term spike in some of that? Is it a function of you trying to get air purification sales up and doing more advertising in that area? Or what's really pushing some of that? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Well, we have done some of that. We had run some promotions. If you're talking the second quarter, the second quarter is traditionally higher because we have some of the trade shows, et cetera. And so, we have Aquatech, et cetera, et cetera. So, those costs normally are more in the second quarter. We would expect those to come down as we go into the third and fourth quarter. Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then just one more on the planned efficiency ramp, is that a one quarter kind of ramp or you think we're just going through 2018 and we get the full efficiencies starting in 2019? Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: The inefficiencies will be second quarter, and then part of third. And we look to make up the balance of our deficit by the end of the year. So, it will be contained within the 2018 timeframe. Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Halloran of Baird. Your line is now open. Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey. Morning, everyone. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: So, first, just following up on the Lowe's water treatment side. Obviously, you have probably a little bit of revenue on-boarding above trend and then, obviously, the profitability level pressures. Could you help, on an annualized basis, once you get past the startup costs, talk a little bit about what that annual run rate for revenue looks like and then also how you're thinking about profitability on that business? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Well, I think we talked a little bit about that on the last call, and we had said that next year \u2013 so Lowe's is adding about $15 million this year and we said it could be adding about $20 million incremental next year, so up to $37 million. This year, North America water treatment, because of the one ramping up and then these transition costs are going to be in the high-single digit. But, as we go into next year, I think our focus is \u2013 I think we even talked on the call, to get those to about 13% for the entire business, and then be able to continue to grow that as the Lowe's business continues to grow. So, as we go down the road, I think we're still focusing on trying to get to that 20%. It's going to take us probably three years to get there, 2019, 2020, 2021, but we think those are achievable as volumes pick up and we get through this transition. Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: That makes sense relative to previous comments as well. So then the follow-up there from an earlier question. Did I hear right that you said 300,000 units on-boarded for the front half of this year for residential water heaters? Is that accurate? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. I would say we're up a little bit over 300,000, probably in tankless, you're close to 325,000 or so. Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: And then, full year expectations are in that, what was it, 350,000 to 400,000, kind of implying a slowdown in the back half of the year. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Well, so what you have is you have to move, right? If you say you're up a little over 300,000 and you expect that about 100,000 of it was maybe a pre-buy that would have had the first half be up closer to 200,000, right? So, I would tell you, the pre-buy is probably the biggest factor in that year-over-year. Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: All right. That's what I was looking for. And then, what you're essentially saying then is you normalize for pre-buy relatively smooth consistent underlying demand pattern. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. And I'll tell you, and Kevin can talk better than I can, but I talked to the salespeople couple days ago, and the industry is strong, there's no doubt about it, as they talk to their customers, et cetera, both commercial and residential. Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: I would say that it's across the board in our distribution contractors, both businesses, Lochinvar and our U.S. water heater business. There's just a solid trend and good growth rates across the board. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: And we haven't talked enough about Lochinvar, probably. We talked about them being up 8% for the year. First half of the year, they're up over 10% and we expect them, for the year, to be up over 10%. So, that's one of the pluses when we looked at the full year is we're taking Lochinvar up because not only has their first half been strong, their orders are strong, their backlog is strong. And as you look at some of the data, quotes are up. So, we're optimistic on it. Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Appreciate the time. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors of Boenning & Scattergood. Your line is now open. Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to first talk about the China situation from a bit of a different angle. There has been a lot of talk in some of the popular financial press about branding impacts for American companies more \u2013 that talk's been more on the auto side and things like that. But obviously, your brand is an American brand. It's English characters on the brand and all that, so it's clearly American. And you've got all the saber rattling and there's talk about that having a negative impact on American brands in China. So, what's your take on that? Obviously, it's a tough issue to handicap it with any kind of granularity, but what's your take on that and what are you doing \u2013 you talked about advertising and so forth, what are you doing to kind of ensure that there is no negative impact on the brand with all this talk? Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Let me take a stab at that, and I was in China last week. So, this is pretty up to date. There's a lot of chatter in social media and stuff like that. But we haven't seen any impact that we can directly point to it impacting our brand, and we don't really expect it, because compared to much more visible brands like Coca-Cola, or KFC, or Apple, we kind of fly under the radar. So, we don't really expect to have much. In terms of advertising, it's the normal game plan. We're not doing anything too different. We are not pulling back. It's the normal game plan. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. And we probably stopped what, I think we pulled that two years ago focusing that it's an American company. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Right, in terms of our advertising. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Because we had so many different SBUs that we're working with that we had pulled back on that from an advertising two years ago. Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: Our advertising is much more focused on products, innovation, bringing benefits to the consumers and the markets, rather than what it has in the past. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Right. We started off way back as being U.S. water heater company was the focus of our advertising and our brand. But now our brand has evolved into water technology innovation brand. And so, our old advertising message has evolved with that. Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Got it. Okay. And then, I guess, my second one just had to do with Lowe's. And my question is, is there a aftermarket service element to the arrangement with Lowe's? I assume Lowe's play some role in installation. But then in terms of aftermarket servicing on the systems, is that something that's going to be taken care of for the customer through Lowe's or is that something that A. O. Smith is involved directly and how does that work? Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: Well, certainly there's an aftermarket with filters. And so, Lowe's will carry a full line of our filters as far as from a replacement standpoint. So yes, there is some installation which Lowe's will provide on some whole-house activity that we have in products. But overall, the products will have a replacement market for many years as the filters \u2013 the various filters we have are used in and replaced. Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Got it. Okay. But in terms of service, you're not involved directly in any kind of service work, not the resell, the filters or the replacement filters, but an actual system troubleshooting if there's a problem or something like that? It's not something that... John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: No, we're not involved in that at all. Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Thanks for your time. Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: I'll just add to that, we'll have toll-free numbers and call centers and so forth to walk people through. So yes, we'll be involved in, if they need some questions, certainly, we'll have some items on the Internet to walk them through the process. But overall, to service them on an ongoing basis now. Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Got it. Thanks again. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Your line is now open. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Just a question on China again. If you think about the situation there, you've got a slowing macro, you've got high channel inventories. In the Western world, this would be ripe for some very aggressive promotional sort of channel clearing. Maybe in China, business practices are a little bit different. But given that you're up against Midea and Haier, which are both pretty aggressive players, it would seem to me that the promotional environment must be picking up here pretty aggressively. And I was just wondering if I can get you to comment, and maybe Ajita, you mentioned you just got back. What are you seeing there in terms of inflection in promotional activity and how is that likely to impact the margin play here in the second half? Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: Well, there has certainly been quite a bit of promotional activity by various competitors. We talked about that during the air purification. Our approach is we certainly have many programs to move our inventory and we'll do some promotions, some bundling. We'll do it in a systematic way. We'll also do it looking at where our inventories are at, what categories do we have higher inventories, and we'll continue to move that forward. But our approach will be not \u2013 it will be, again, a thoughtful, a systematic approach to reducing inventories over time. And we're going to be looking to reduce our inventory somewhere in the neighborhood about 30 days by the end of the year. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: And it's the balance between how do we get the inventories down by \u2013 but still maintaining the type of price points that our brand calls for. So, it's that balance and our team is very good at doing that and has done it in the past, and we are very comfortable with the programs that we have. And we tend to, as Kevin said, bundle with other products and promote in that manner. So in that sense, it is somewhat different in China than the U.S. market. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Do you sense that your channel inventory situation is unique to you and your competitors are not seeing a similar situation, or do you feel like maybe all the major players are dealing with this inventory surplus? Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: We don't know. We don't really have any data that can say what the other competitors are like in terms of inventories. But the slowdown has to be hitting everybody. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : I'm just wondering... John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: We don't see the numbers. From a share standpoint haven't moved much. So as Ajita said, we don't know, but you have to assume everybody's kind of in the same. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Sure, that would make sense. I guess that you've always demonstrated tremendous price discipline and you talked about your commitment to continuing to do that. I'm just wondering how you manage \u2013 maintain that first discipline dealing with this inventory and also maybe competitors that aren't quite as disciplined and historically haven't been. How do you manage those potentially mutually exclusive goals? Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: It's a tough balance, but it's a day-to-day management of it. And in fact, there is channel conflict and pricing conflict and things like that in the market. And we try to stay very disciplined. And in fact, some of our customers, especially e-commerce customers, have come back to us and complimented us on managing that whole process as best we can, given the rules and the laws and what we can do and what's under our control. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Right. Well, you've got a history of doing well there, so good luck with that. Second question, if I could, is just on your raw material inflation. What's your expected second half steel cost inflation versus the first half? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Up significantly. It really started, as we said, there's a three, three-plus month delay depending on the situation. So, we've said that on the last call that first quarter \u2013 the second quarter was up, but the last half of the year was up significantly. And that's why we had this price increase, matches up with that pretty well. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Yeah. Is there any chance of getting a little more granularity than up significantly? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: No. But I mean I can tell you these facts. I can tell you how much steel is up. Steel is up from the end of the year, it's up 20-some-percent. It's up 20% from the first of the year. Hot rolled is up 41%. When we talked in April, hot rolled is up even more from that, while cold rolled has steadied, which is good. And again, a lot of that impact is coming in the second half of the year. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : But those are spot price dynamics, I'm guessing through your contracts... John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: No, we end up getting price off of spot, to a degree. So, I mean, plus or minus. So... Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. Because even though we have contracts, they're based off of pricing indices, the steel indices. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: So, I guess, you can assume that the majority of that increase is in the second half. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : And presumably, those contracts, there's some leakage of inflation coming through. So, you're not getting perfectly fixed costs there? As the spot price is increasing, you're getting some \u2013 leakage of that inflation is coming through your contracts? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: I'm not sure what you mean, but I guess we're not going to get into details of the contract with our suppliers. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Well, thanks for the detail that you provided. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Alvaro Lacayo of Gabelli. Your line is now open. Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company: Good morning, everyone. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company: So I just wanted to start with the Rest of World. Two questions, one, for that 5% organic China growth number or if you want to just talk about the first half, the 4% organic number, how much of that was volume driven? And maybe comment just on water heater and water treatment products, separately. And then, can you quantify the inefficiencies from the water treatment plant? And with regards to the delay of the product launch, if the inefficiencies had anything to do with that? And if not, what was the cause of the delay of the product launch? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: I'll start with the last. The cause was it's a complex product and that we were in the process of moving a major plant from one to another. So, those were the two factors that entered into where we thought we would have that product, which is going to help us on the online in the first half. And now, it's going to be probably later third quarter, I think. But when you look at volumes, volumes in the first half of the year, water treatment was up significantly. I don't have the percentage in front of me, 10-plus percent. So, there was some price in there. And I think water heater volumes were up a little bit, as the transition continues, where electric was down a little bit, but gas was up. And then we had some pricing in effect. So I don't know if that answers all your questions or not. Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company: Yeah, it does. Thank you. And just the inefficiencies, is there a dollar amount with regards to how... John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: So, I mean, if you break out the efficiencies, so if I look at that $5 million we talked about hit this year, the efficiencies (sic) [inefficiencies] hit in the second quarter primarily. It's really three pieces. I'll tell you, the electricity, because of the size of the plant, is probably about $2 million of that increase. The depreciation is about $ 1 million for the remainder of the year. So, you have that $3 million. And you had efficiencies (sic) [inefficiencies] running first half, first half and the first and third quarter, and what Kevin's saying, by the end of the year, we start offsetting those efficiencies. Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: So, that's how you end up in kind of the $5 million-ish. Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company: Got it. Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: And I'll tell you, the plant \u2013 the feedback I received, the transition's going well. It's producing at the levels we thought or better. So, those numbers are well within line, what we told you. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: But it was a major move. Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: Major move. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: It's a major move. Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company: Got you. Okay. And then in North America water treatment, if you can maybe update us on just the organic sort of industry growth that you're seeing. And then just from a selling point expansion standpoint, what kind of opportunities you have, if you can quantify that in any way, that'll support that 14%-plus growth rates or even higher than that going forward. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Well, so I think we've talked about, and it depends if you're talking softening, you're talking about treating, et cetera, I think the numbers we've seen this year is kind of high-single digit kind of increases. I think what we confidently can do is leverage our distribution channel. So, we've talked about expanding it ultimately to plumbers. We think we're the premier online seller of water treatment. Now as we get in Lowe's and we're able to leverage that role, I think as we look at those opportunities and bring new products, I think we're comfortable as we look out for that 14%-plus growth for North America water treatment for the next several years. Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. And I would just add the dealer network that we have and continue to expand and grow that in the markets that we have some gaps in. So, overall, the wholesale business is still very early stages. Plumbers are very early stages. Dealers, we're continuing to expand; and Lowe's, we're just in the process of getting in the store. So, you put that all together and you look forward, the water treatment business has a good runway heading into 2019 and beyond. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: And also, when you look at the opportunity, I mean, the awareness of how good our water is in the country is getting more and more. And the whole water treatment category in North America, I think, has tremendous opportunity to grow very fast. Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company: Great. Thank you very much and congratulations to Ajita and Kevin on the transitions. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Thanks. Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Larry De Maria of William Blair. Your line is now open. Larry T. De Maria - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Curious. I believe you guys said you want to reduce inventory by 30 days, I guess, by the end of the year, I think, is what you said. Just curious, what is the normal level of inventory? Obviously, it's at least a month different than that. And would that be normalized? If you get it down 30 days, going into next year, if we have a similar rate of growth, call it, mid singles in local in China, would that be an adequate inventory reduction or would that require further inventory reduction next year? Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: I would tell you that that is going to be a move in the right direction. If we're close to where we want to be, we'd probably like to drive it down just a little bit more over time. But, again, moving to 30 days would get us right into the level that we think is appropriate going forward. Larry T. De Maria - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And you're moving it down to 30 days or you're moving it down by 30 days? I'm just trying to understand what's the normal level of inventory in the market? Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: I'm sorry. Moving it down by 30 days. Larry T. De Maria - William Blair & Co. LLC: Down by 30. And what would that be then? That's like you end up with a quarter's worth of inventory? How big is the inventory normally? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: That would be a little bit less than a quarter. Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah, bit little less than a quarter. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: (55:04) level. Larry T. De Maria - William Blair & Co. LLC: Little less than a quarter. That's great. Thank you. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: And that's kind of what we run. Days kind of in the 70, 80, 85 range. Larry T. De Maria - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Given the complexity of the channels, that's about the level that's required to keep it efficiently moving. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: (55:20). Larry T. De Maria - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. So, it can't go down much more than that. And then, secondly, are you guys dramatically rethinking the China air purification strategy long term? And to also be clear, can we get that to breakeven next year if we have, obviously, continued volume headwinds there? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: My answer is no, we don't if we continue to have volume headwind. Kevin can talk about the new product we're bringing out and... Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. At this time, we're certainly committed to the air purification market. Granted there has been some \u2013 the air and the things we've talked about in the past. But you look at the products that we recently introduced that are going to address formaldehyde, and that's a year-around issue within most Chinese homes, that's still in the very early stages. As we have mentioned in past that we remain committed. Our engineering product development continues to move forward. And it's early, but we still believe there is a place in air purification for A. O. Smith and the products that we can bring to market through our distribution. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: I mean, it's like we talked about on the last call is what is \u2013 some of the stuff that the government's doing, is that sustainable from an air standpoint, and time will tell. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Right. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: It's difficult to shut down plants and do some of the things they're doing and have that impact on business. So, we'll see if they continue to do that in the fourth quarter and first quarter of this coming year. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Right. And I think just to expand on that a little, when you look at the air quality in China, it's impacted by two things. One is what's outside in the environment, and that's what we kind of focus on and that's driven by pollution and coal-fired power plants and all of that stuff, cars and all that. Then there's also the air quality that's impacted from the inside of the apartment or the home, which comes from furniture and the glues that are used in furniture, and things like that. And this is where the formaldehyde comes out. And as we've talked before, if you recall, a few years back, we had the Lumber Liquidators issue, et cetera, which was the formaldehyde concerns in this country. And that was driven by the glues and the adhesive used in cheaper-quality furniture. Okay? So, that's another issue that's very prevalent in China. We have the products that Kevin talked about that we just introduced. It's the only credible product in the market today that addresses that formaldehyde issue. Now, certainly, there'll be other products that follow. But we feel that with this and the initial \u2013 it's very early because we just introduced it. But the initial reaction from the marketplace, especially our retailers, has been very positive. So, we feel there is going to be a market. We are going to be in the air purification market. The size of the market we can't tell, which is why we are being conservative in pulling it down, because we don't know how sustainable the actions that the Chinese government has taken to clean up the outside air is going to be. But the inside part, the pollution caused by furniture, et cetera, that's going to be there for a while. There's no indication there's anything happening to address that, and we have the products to address that. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: To address your earnings question, I think everybody at this table and Chinese management realizes we can't lose $8 million on a $25 million business. But I will tell you we spent a lot on engineering this year to bring the formaldehyde product, we'll bring a fresh-air product to market late in the year, but we all understand you can't lose $8 million on that size business. So, there will be an improvement. We just can't add $25 million sale be breakeven. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. We won't get to breakeven, but there will be... John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: But there'll be improvement. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: ...there'll be certainly improvement. Larry T. De Maria - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. That's really helpful. Thank you and good luck to you all. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Cohen of Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. Andrew Cohen - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Thanks. Very nice quarter. My question and I don't know how well you can quantify it, but you're talking about the Chinese housing market slowing or flattening. But one of the underlying things that's supposed to be supporting you is the growth in the upper middle class. And I'm just wondering if that is also mitigated with the slowdown or if they're independent variables? Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: I think they're independent. I think the growth in the middle class and the move in the middle class or the massive amount of people moving into the middle class is continuing. Those macro drivers in China, the indicators are very strong and continuing. And in addition to that, the move made by the Chinese government to move their economy to be much more consumption-based and less dependent on exports, all that is happening. And all of those things and all of those drivers are very positive for our business long term. We have the short-term impact of housing, and we expect that that's going to come back. It has to come back at some point. We just don't know when. Andrew Cohen - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Thanks. My other question, it's actually fairly simple, but this formaldehyde and the furniture issue that you brought up, does that exist in India as well? Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: I don't know the answer to that question. There is certainly an air purification opportunity in India. We haven't fully investigated it yet. The issues in the Indian market are different. The homes are built differently. So, it's not a one-to-one match, but there certainly is an opportunity. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: But the price point is... Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: The price point's high. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: ...is much different in India. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Right. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: So, that's why we're not focusing on it at this point. Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.: Right. Price points in, really, all appliances are different in India. Andrew Cohen - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Okay. Got it. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Patricia Ackerman for closing remarks. Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.: Thank you for your participating in our call this morning. Please take note that we will participate in the D.A. Davidson Industrial Conference on September 20 in Chicago.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Patricia Ackerman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead. Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.: Thank you, Adam. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on our 2018 third quarter results conference call. With me participating in the call are Ajita Rajendra, Executive Chairman; Kevin Wheeler, Chief Executive Officer; and John Kita, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin with Kevin's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning's press release. Also, as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. I will now turn the call over to Kevin, who will begin our prepared remarks on slide 3. Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: Thank you, Pat, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Here are a few comments about our third quarter. We achieved sales of $754 million, net earnings of $0.61 per share or 13% higher than our earnings per share in 2017. We continued to review our capital allocation and dedicated portion of our cash to return to shareholders. We repurchased 1.7 million shares for approximately $106 million through the first nine months of the year. We plan to continue buying back our shares at a previously stated $135 million annual pace using a 10b5-1 plan. We expect to opportunistically buy back up to $65 million worth of shares in the open market in 2018. We announced a 22% increase to our dividend in October. This is the second increase this year. The five-year compounded annual growth rate of our dividend is about 30%. We repatriated nearly $300 million during the first nine months of 2018 using the proceeds to repurchase our shares and pay down floating rate debt. Our A.O. Smith-branded water treatment products are now in 1,700 Lowe's stores nationwide. John will now describe our results in more detail beginning on slide 4. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Sales for the third quarter of $754 million were 1% higher than the same quarter in 2017. Net earnings in the third quarter of $105 million increased 12% from the third quarter in 2017. Third quarter earnings per share of $0.61 increased 13% compared with the same quarter in 2017. Sales in our North American segment of $487 million were flat compared with the third quarter of 2017. Pricing actions in 2018 on water heaters and boilers related to higher steel and freight costs were more than offset by lower water heater volumes. North America water treatment sales comprised of Aquasana, Hague and our recently-launched water treatment products at Lowe's, incrementally added $9 million to our North America segment sales. Rest of World segment sales of $274 million increased 1% compared with the same quarter in 2017. China sales growth was 2.5% in local currency. Higher sales of water treatment products and air purifiers in China were partially offset by a decline in electric water heaters compared with the prior year. Currency translation reduced sales by approximately $6 million compared with the third quarter 2017. On slide 6, North America segment earnings of $106 million were 4% lower than segment earnings in the same quarter in 2017. The unfavorable impact from lower sales of water heaters and higher steel and freight costs were partially offset by pricing actions. Spending associated with the launch of water treatment products at Lowe's amounted to approximately $2 million. As a result of these factors, North-American segment margin of 21.7% was lower than last year. Rest of World earnings of $39 million increased nearly 16% compared with third quarter of 2017, primarily as a result of lower expenses associated with employee incentive programs and smaller losses in India. As a result, third quarter segment margin of 14.3% was significantly higher than one year ago. Our corporate expenses were higher than last year as a result of several miscellaneous items. Our effective income tax rate in the third quarter of 2018 was 20.5%. The rate was lower than the 28.8% experienced during the third quarter last year, primarily due to lower federal income taxes related to tax reform. The lower effective income tax rate benefited third quarter 2018 earnings by $0.06 per share. Cash provided by operations during the first nine months of 2018 was $289 million compared with $150 million provided during the same period in 2017. Higher earnings and a smaller investment in working capital were the primary drivers of higher cash flow compared with last year. Our liquidity position and balance sheet remained strong. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 10% at the end of the third quarter. We have cash balances totaling $618 million located offshore. And our net cash position was approximately $425 million at the end of September. During the first nine months of the year, we repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares of common stock for a total of $106 million. Approximately 3.2 million shares remained on the existing Board authorization at the end of September. Primarily as a result of lower U.S. and China water heater sales than previously forecasted, we reduced our 2018 adjusted EPS guidance by approximately $0.02 per share with a range of between $2.57 and $2.60 per share. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance represents a 19% increase in EPS compared with our adjusted 2017 results. Our EPS guidance excludes $0.03 per share of plant closing costs. Please turn to slide 9 for several 2018 assumptions. We expect our cash flow from operations in 2018 to be approximately $475 million, which is significantly higher than the $326 million generated in 2017. We expect higher earnings and lower outlays for working capital this year. Our 2018 capital spending plans are approximately $85 million. Our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $75 million in 2018. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $48 million in 2018, slightly higher than the $47 million in 2017, partially due to higher projected spending at our Corporate Technology Center. Our effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 21% in 2018, lower than the previous year due to the U.S. tax reform. We expect to repurchase our shares in the amount of approximately $135 million in 2018 under a 10b5-1 plan and to supplement our 10b5-1 plan with opportunistic share repurchase up to $65 million. We expect our average diluted outstanding shares in 2018 will be approximately 172.5 million. Kevin Wheeler will summarize our guidance, the business assumptions for the remainder of 2018 and our growth strategy beginning on September on slide 10. Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: Okay. Thank you, John. Our outlook for 2018 includes the following assumptions. We project U.S. residential water heater industry volumes will increase 250,000 to 300,000 units in 2018. This assumption is lower than our July forecast. Based on our shipments in September, we believe the industry will be down approximately 100,000 units in the second half of the year. This assumption includes tankless units. Similarly, we revised our forecast for U.S. commercial water heater volumes. Based on year-to-date shipments and a difficult fourth quarter comparison, we now forecast a 5% decline in volumes. As a result of significantly higher steel prices and inflation and freight and other costs, we announced a price increase effective in early June, which average approximately 10% on the majority of our U.S. water heater products. Given recent significant depreciation of the China currency, we now project a full year translation benefit of approximately $23 million compared with sales in 2017 which is $10 million lower than our July forecasts. The translation benefit to earnings is approximately $3 million for the year. Our projection assumes that China currency will appreciate slightly from current levels during the fourth quarter of 2018, resulting in a translation detriment of approximately $12 million to sales and $2 million to earnings in the fourth quarter compared with the rates in 2017. We expect the losses in India to decline from $7.5 million loss in 2017 to approximately $5 million loss in 2018. For the full year, we expect sales in China in local currency to grow approximately 3%. Sales continue to be negatively impacted by a slowdown in housing sales, which we believe is primarily driven by a slowdown in the China economy, increasing consumer anxiety surrounding international trade issues. We launched our water treatment product portfolio in over 1,700 Lowe's stores last month. The launch was mixed. We fulfilled 100% of water filtration systems and replacement filters on time. However, we had issues as we attempted to double the manufacturing capacity of our water softener plant simultaneously with ramping up volumes to load our new customer. We project $14 million of sales to Lowe's in 2018. Please advance to slide 11. We project revenue growth will be approximately 7% in U.S. dollar terms for the year. The midpoint of our revised EPS guidance range is 19% higher than last year. We expect North America adjusted segment margin for the year to be approximately 22.5%. We project weaker performance in the Rest of World segment, primarily as a result of our lower China growth forecasts. For the full year, we expect Rest of World margins to be approximately 13%. We're in the middle of our 2019 planning process. Preliminarily, we project 2019 China sales growth in local currency to be 3% compared with 2018, as inventory levels remain elevated into next year with slower housing growth. Given the depreciation of the China currency, we expect a $50 million headwind to sales and over $7 million to earnings, if the currency rate stays where it is. Combining our China projections with a full year of price for North America water heaters, a full year of Lowe's water treatment business and the remaining businesses growing similarly to the recent past, we project organic growth in 2019 of 5.5% to 7% in local currency and 4% to 5.5% in U.S. dollar terms. We plan to update this revenue guidance on our January 2019 conference call. We continue to have confidence in our business model in China for the long term. The investments we have made in our premium brand, broad distribution and innovative products over the past 20 years has resulted in a reputation for reliability and safety and driven significant growth. We are proud of the profitability and the high return on the assets that we have achieved in China. When the housing market recovers and consumer confidence returns, we believe once again we will grow double digits. In the meantime, we are taking appropriate steps to protect our profitability and we'll continue to bring innovative products to market. The fundamentals of our global business model, market leadership, 85% replacement market in U.S. water heaters and boilers, strong cash flow and organic growth, coupled with the optionality of our balance sheet bodes well for us to successfully navigate through and thrive in these volatile times. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we are open for your questions. Operator : And your first question comes from Doug Clark of Goldman Sachs. Doug, your line is open. Doug Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. My first one, just looking at China, lower growth for this year and then also kind of lower growth again for next year. I'm curious, and you didn't really mention just competitively and even this morning, a competitor actually had a fairly nice kind of year-on-year growth in water heaters. So, I'm wondering if there's anything kind of competitively that you think has changed recently, and then also if you could comment on just how inventory levels sit today. It sounds like that might be a little bit of a headwind heading into next year as well. Thanks. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: I'll start, Kevin. Our market share has been basically held steady year-to-date so in the water heater business. And so, we saw the industry declining actually some in the third quarter. So, I'm not sure which competitor you're talking about. But our market share has held steady for the year-to-date. Inventories are up about the same percent from second to third quarter, as they were last year from second quarter to third quarter. That's not unusual because we're entering our highest-selling season, which is the fourth quarter. I will tell you, though. Inventory levels are still elevated as we talk, and we'll kind of evaluate as the fourth quarter happens with respect to the online selling holidays, et cetera. Doug Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And then, my follow-up. I'm just curious on the traction with the formaldehyde product that I believe you launched in 3Q in Rest of World. Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: The new products were received very well by the Chinese consumer, growing about 40% growth rate. They have done very well during the summer months. And during the winter months, the leaching of formaldehyde will decline a bit. So, we'll see a sales drop in Q4. But overall, the products were received well. We believe formaldehyde has a benefit to the consumer, and we look forward to next year as we get into the summer months and growing that particular business with our Chinese consumer. Doug Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: All right. Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : And your next question comes from Matt Summerville of D.A. Davidson. Matt, your line is open. Matt J. Summerville - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Thanks. A couple of questions. Can you just provide a little more granularity around China in the third quarter? What did the water heater business actually do on a year-over-year basis water treatment? And then, I just want to understand, was the air purification business overall up 40% year-over-year? I want to make sure we have that number correctly. John, if you can just go through... John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. Air purification was up 40%, but it's off a very low level. So, I think it was up about $3 million. And as Kevin said, it was really the formaldehyde sales, which quite frankly we saw declining a little bit as we got into the last month because you're getting out of the summer months. But air purification was up about $3 million. Water treatment, we said, was up over 20%. Then, you had the two negatives, were the currency of $6 million. And then, electric water heaters were down. And that's how you ended up flat. Matt J. Summerville - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Got it. And then, I guess, relative to the inventory position you guys described coming out of the second quarter in China, have you made any progress to-date in drawing down those inventories? Or do you sort of need to wait for the online season to really kick in in the back part of the year before you're able to do that? Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. I'll tell you, our days on hand were down in the third quarter. However, that's really not a great measurement, considering the volatility. We used the \u2013 a 90-day forward forecast, and we have some seasonality that could be misleading. So, we're using a variety of inventory measures by customer, by product category, by percentage increase, offline, online. And so, overall, inventories are elevated. We look for a stronger fourth quarter, and we'll continue to evaluate our sales through the busy season, Singles' Day and other promotions 12-12. And we'll determine, if necessary, if we need to take additional actions on promotions or any kind of a bundling activity. Matt J. Summerville - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jeff, your line is open. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks for the color on 2018. Just \u2013 maybe just hitting on the comment about China and the lower growth rate into 2019 but confidence back to double digit. Just as you think about that 15% long-term growth rate and some of the maturity in water heaters growth in that market, how are you thinking about kind of potentially revising that long-term growth rate? Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: Well, I'll tell you, the \u2013 long term, we firmly believe that the U.S. and China economies are intertwined in that the trade issues and so forth that we're facing today and some of the slowdown in the economy will get resolved. There is certainly a growing middle class that will continue. Right now, they're saving money rather than spending due to some of the uncertainty. But going forward, we expect to \u2013 for the economy to grow certainly double digits as we go forward as the consumer confidence comes back. And as far as rating part of the business? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. I think, Jeff, when we modeled, we've done some modeling out. And basically, we think China can get back to low-double digits once the economy recovers and housing starts growing. And when you look at that weighted average models there, you end up with about a 7% growth going forward. We just felt it's not appropriate to pull that out at this point because we are entering a period here where housing has been down. Now, as Kevin said, China and the U.S. need each other. We've talked to a lot of consultants. I mean, there is a possibility this thing gets resolved at the G20. If it doesn't, I think the thought process is sometime early-to-mid next year it does get resolved. And so, we certainly think, as Kevin said, you have a growing middle class. You have the urbanization going on. You have household formation. And right now, the consumer is saving. We've got that from some of our banks because their confidence is down. But we do think, going forward, certainly a 7% or so once we get through this hiccup, if you will, is achievable \u2013 total company. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay then. Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: And I would just add, again, our premium brand, our broad distribution, the innovation that we bring to market, as the economy turns around, we feel good that we can leverage those going forward into the future. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then, just help me with the 4Q bridge. I think year-to-date, you're up 6.6%. You're saying 7% growth for the year. Maybe I'm confused with some of the moving pieces on currency. But how should we think about 4Q core growth rate in North America and China? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Well, so in North America, we would tell you we're forecasting the industry to be up over 150,000 sequentially. So, we didn't really talk about residential. But in our mind, what happened is July and August were kind of proceeding as we expected. And then, quite frankly, September was down quite a bit. And so, we think the quarter was down close to 125,000 units. Now, when we look at October, we look at our order rate, we look at our shipments, sequentially we're getting back to where we thought we would be. So, we're forecasting the fourth quarter to be up about 50,000 to 75,000 over the prior year, but up 150,000 to 175,000 over the third quarter. So, I think that's \u2013 we'll certainly see health on both commercial and residential as we move to third quarter to fourth quarter. Quite frankly, on China, we're forecasting it to be relatively flat, up a little bit year-over-year but that's \u2013 in the fourth quarter. That's really driven by the fact that you may recall last year's fourth quarter was up 25% almost from the prior year. So, we have a very difficult comp there. So, then water treatment continues to grow in the quarter. And Lochinvar we think will be sequentially relatively flat, but that's a good fourth quarter for them. So, I don't know if that helps. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Yeah. That's perfect. And then, just last one on the inventory destocking. I mean, it seems like you're not going to make a whole lot of progress this year destocking. When do you think that destock, as you model it out, when do you think that destocking or what are you assuming when that destocking is kind of out of the way? Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: I think that primarily will be driven by the economy in its recovery. So, as we look at it, right now, we're continuing to drive some inventories down, use the promotions that we talked about in Q4. And again, as the economy returns, when that is, we're not 100% sure, but that will be the primary driver for us to drive some of our inventories down. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : And your next question comes from Scott Graham of BMO Capital Markets. Scott, your line is now open. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah. Hi. Good morning. I just want to make sure I understood one of your statements there, John. Is this the official day when you, as a company, take down your 8% organic goal to 7%? Is that what you're saying? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: I mean, Scott, what I said is we did the modeling and if China grows at 10%, what we certainly think is doable, then the growth model is 7%. And quite frankly when, from where we are, we think that's a reasonable objective, obviously. And you've talked about it in the past. You have law of large numbers. We now have a $1.1 billion business, so growing at 15% becomes difficult. And so I would tell you, as we look forward, once the China economy recovers, we think that 7% is achievable. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Right. But then, I think you all \u2013 that's very helpful, John. Thank you. I think then I also heard you say that, in these sort of more turbulent times, be it some things going on in the U.S. which I want to ask you about as well as China, that your organic guidance for this year is kind of what you expect during that period. Is that, am I putting words in your mouth? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: I'm not sure the question. So, this year, what we've said is 7%. And I think when we look at next year, organically in local currency, we're saying our best estimate, by the way it's preliminary, is 5.5% to 7% and then imputed in there is China growing at about 3%. And what we would think happens is China starts growing a little bit more as the year goes on next year as some of these trade issues become addressed. I will tell you. We were all in China two weeks ago. And you don't have to do anything but pick up the paper and turn on the TV to see that there's discussions about the trade. And the consumer confidence levels we see are down. But again, if you look at China's 1.2 billion people, it's got a growing middle class and they say they're saving now instead of spending, that will turn. So, as we look into next year, China is not as much as the model but North America is more as we have the price increase, we have the addition of Lowe's and we think boilers continue to grow at 10%. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah. Got you. On North America, what I want to maybe triangulate toward is maybe some type of an idea on the volumes. It looks to me as if when we consider the pricing realizations that you're getting that the organic volumes were \u2013 in North America in total were sort of close to down low-single digit. And if that assumption is correct particularly on \u2013 well, frankly both sides, the water heater side which is just as replacement-oriented in commercial as it is in residential, why would we see a number that weak this quarter? Was there destocking in North America? Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: I would tell you that, when we looked at Q2, it was very strong. And then, as we got into Q3, as we talked about, it was much weaker. And what it indicated to us that there was a larger pre-buy than we anticipated. So, in Q3, we had an adjustment there. We were probably a bit too optimistic. But again, we had a really poor September. We see October coming out and rebounding very well. And I will tell you, I've been in this industry about 30 years and there is always a difficulty in predicting how a price increase is going to be implemented and how it's going to be executed in which the balance between the quarters and this proved out to be very similar. But as you look at it going forward into Q4, we think that adjustment has been made. We look for solid growth in Q4 and any of the gap, I think we can attribute to a larger pre-buy than we initially thought. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: And I think the other thing, Scott, is we still are forecasting the industry to be up 250,000 to 300,000, and you're working with completions that are probably up 50,000. So, I mean, we're still having a strong industry for the year. When you talk about replacements being up 200,000, completions being up 50,000 plus because we're saying 250,000 to 300,000, so we- as Kevin said, we are probably a little optimistic as we saw in the first couple of quarters. But these volumes can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Understood. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Charley Brady of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Charley, your line is open. Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good morning, guys and Pat. Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I just \u2013 on China, on the margin in Q3, you commented you had some lower employee incentive. I see on the guidance you got out for 2019. Can you give us a sense, I mean, we've permanently taken some costs out of there because you obviously \u2013 the expansion rate has probably slowed or this was sort of a kind of a one-off aberration in Q3 that the margin really popped up there? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Well, so the way \u2013 Charley, what we looked at is China was fairly optimistic at the midyear point that they were going to be able to meet their objective, which would have called for bonus somewhat similar to the prior year. But as we got through the quarter \u2013 through the third quarter, it became obvious that they were not going to. So, there was an adjustment down at the accrual that they had made in the third quarter. I think you have to look at it kind of year-to-date, to kind of look at the margins, et cetera, because there was some benefit in the third quarter because of what we had booked in the first and second quarter. Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Can you quantify what that reversal would have been? I guess, I'm trying to get to what a normalized \u2013 given the volume rate in Q3 in China, what a normalized margin would have been for Rest of World. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. It was close to a $5 million reversal of the accrual, if you will. So where we stand now at the end of the third quarter is where you should be which is three quarters of what you expect to pay. Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it. Thanks very much. And I guess, on the \u2013 as we look to the U.S. market in water treatment, you've rolled out in the Lowe's, you commented there was some disruption there as you tried to ramp up capacity. Can you just expand upon that a little bit and where have sales been pushed from 3Q into 4Q or even into 2019? Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: The disruption that we talked about was we had to double our capacity at our Hague facility in Columbus. That \u2013 for the most part, the equipment came in. Everything was going according to plan. But we did have some labor issues up there. So, we were unable to really produce the quantity that we needed for Lowe's. We are \u2013 expect to be back on track but we're close to on track now. And we \u2013 you're looking at \u2013 as I mentioned in the remarks that we'll sell about $14 million to Lowe's, which we anticipated $14 million to $15 million. So, there'll be no disruption there. But there's one that it just took a little bit longer for us to ramp up and to get the inventory in the stores and into their distribution centers. Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks for that. And then, just continuing on the water track, that's an area, in terms of M&A perspective, you made a few acquisitions in there, you're kind of building up a platform, you got the Lowe's distribution. I mean, can you just talk about kind of opportunities you see \u2013 the additional opportunities you see in the water market in North America to make that a bigger piece of North America? Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: From \u2013 on the water treatment side, I think we've demonstrated that there are opportunities as we've entered this particular business segment. If you look back several years, we didn't even have a water treatment business. And through acquisitions in China and then recently with the acquisition of Aquasana and Hague, we've been building that portfolio. It certainly widens our lens for the ability to look for acquisitions that will complement the other parts of the business. So, the answer, is it our lenses is wider? Absolutely. I'll be continuing to look for opportunities that complement our business and also enhance our capabilities? The answer is yes. And we'll continue to look for those and we'll \u2013 again, we have to look for the right business, the right return and the right fit for our company. But certainly, there are opportunities out there for our business to expand in water treatment and to acquire additional companies going forward. Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Halloran from Baird. Michael, your line is open. Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: Good morning. Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: So, just one for me, back to the Rest of World margin questions. I certainly understand the dynamic around incentive comp. But as you look forward to next year and you guys see a lower growth rate, how does that impact your variable spending process? Because, obviously, a lot of the margin \u2013 lack of margin leverage in that segment has come from the magnitude of growth opportunities, promotional opportunities and all those things to drive the top line growth. Does that calculus change at all as you move into next year at a slower growth rate? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: I mean, certainly, Mike, we're \u2013 for example, we're putting in a hiring freeze right now from an SG&A standpoint primarily. We're accelerating the closure of \u2013 our store closures, the nonproductive stores. And, yes, we are very \u2013 going to take a very hard look at our direct selling and our advertising budgets as we go into next year to rightsize it until the market recovers, which we expect it will. Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thanks. That's what I needed. Appreciate it. Operator : And your next question comes from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. David, your line is open. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: Hi. Good morning. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : I'm just wondering, you may have covered this and I may have just missed it. But within the China water heaters, did you talk about units versus ASPs? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: I think they're pretty similar, Pat, right? Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yeah. John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Yes. The decline is pretty similar, yeah. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. And then, you talked a few points here in the call this morning about just the weaker consumer, the weaker sentiment, the weaker consumer confidence over there. I mean, I guess I'm not all that familiar with the Chinese consumer. But it seems like, in America when that happens, the consumer typically trades down. So, are you seeing them trade down over there? And if that's the case, I'm just wondering, does that bring you more in conflict with sort of mid-price point product and from a competitive standpoint, does this sort of mandate or require you to kind of extend your line structure down market and just adjust for that? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: Well, I'd say we're not necessarily seeing trade-down, but I don't think you necessarily see the trade-up that you had been seeing. We've talked about in, on previous calls that especially on the online market, we're bringing out, I'll call them, some mid-priced products that are more in the sweet spot. I mean, what happened is, if you think of the, I'll call it the RMB 3,000 to RMB 5,000, we were in that spot for some of our category and then we raised prices a year ago and moved out of that category. So now, we're bringing back some products to attack the high end of that market, which we think will help us from a sales next year. But I would say we haven't seen trading down. But I think, as you said, if consumer confidence wanes, you probably don't see them trading up. I think what we're really seeing is they're saving rather than spending. That's it, point. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Right. And just second question just if the 8% is now 7% and kind of the growth across the model maybe slowing here a little bit. As you think about kind of the next platform for growth, and it certainly sounds like there's a lot of potential in water treatment. Congratulations by the way on the progress with sort of the listings at Lowe's. But do you start looking at tankless water heaters a little differently now and start thinking about maybe making a bigger commitment to that category? Thanks. Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.: Well, tankless today, in the U.S., represents about 8% of the total market. And I would tell you that we have made a commitment to the tankless category and new products and in bringing them out both with rack systems on commercial and so forth. So, the way we look at it is we are in the hot water business. And so, we provide hot water solutions to our various customers in various channels. And tankless is a component of it, which is growing, and tank is also a component of it. And again, trying to provide the best solution for that consumer is our goal. Not so much guiding towards one technology or the other. So overall, we'll continue to invest in tankless technology and bring new products out that we need to compete, as well as on the tank side of the business. So, for us again, I would go it's more of a solving a consumer's hot water issue rather than it is more from a tankless perspective because we look at both of those as products that we need to have to be competitive in the market long term. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : And your final question comes from Alvaro Lacayo from Gabelli. Alvaro, your line is open. Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company: Good morning. Just two questions. One, the small question I didn't quite hear what the growth rate for the quarter was for Lochinvar and separately for boilers. And then secondly, bigger picture, I wanted to hear some updated thoughts on how you guys are seeing the replacement cycle in residential water heaters in the U.S. and sort of how you're seeing it and how it's incorporated \u2013 in what level it's incorporated in the long-term growth rate that you guys are seeing, whether it be 7% or 8% or however you guys are seeing it shape up? John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.: So, Lochinvar for the quarter was a little bit of a mixed bag there. Condensing boilers did very well. They were up about 7% to 8%. Their non-condensing boilers were down year-over-year about $3 million and that maps directly to their China distributor whose sales were down $3 million compared to last year's third quarter, and we believe that was driven by tariffs. And then, when you look at the residential water heater \u2013 I mean, the water heater portion of the business, that was also down. So, they were up almost 2%. When we look at the full year and we look at the whole product portfolio of Lochinvar, we expect them to be up over 9% for the year. The second question was kind of, how do we look at the water heater going forward? We've done a fair amount of modeling of water heater. I assume you're \u2013 what you're really talking about is the drop in the industry from 2007 to 2011. We've done a lot of modeling work and gotten some replacement data. And as we've talked in the past, the replacement is about 14 to 14.5 years. But it's a very elongated bell curve. It goes from 5 all the way out to plus-20. In fact, over half of them are replaced in over 15 years. So, when we incorporate that and then you look at \u2013 so it's going to be spread over a wide period of time. And then, when you incorporate the housing stock, which is about 120 million houses and we're talking about an industry of 9.5 million units, we think that we'll be very muted at that. And BRG has some estimates of the water heater industry through 2021, and I think those estimates are 3-plus-percent. So, in that \u2013 when we were talking about the 7%, we think that 4% growth is very reasonable. Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company: Thank you. Operator : And that concludes our Q&A session for today. I will now turn the call back over to Ms. Ackerman. Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.: Thank you very much for joining us today, and have a good day. Operator : And this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to introduce your host for today conference, Patricia Ackerman, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please begin. Patricia Ackerman : Thank you, Norma. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on our 2018 results conference call. With me participating in the call are Ajita Rajendra, Executive Chairman; Kevin Wheeler, Chief Executive Officer; and John Kita, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin with Kevin's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning's press release. In order to provide improved transparency into the operating results of our business, we provided non-GAAP measures, adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted effective income tax rates. For 2017 that exclude the estimate of our total -- that exclude the total tax expense related to U.S. Tax Reform. And for 2018 that exclude the restructuring and impairment costs associated with our plant closure in Renton, Washington. Reconciliation some GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and also on our website. Also, as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. I will now turn the call over to Kevin, who will begin our prepared remarks on slide four. Kevin Wheeler : Thank you, Pat, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Our mid-single digit sales growth in 2018 was driven by positive end markets for our boilers, residential water heaters in the U.S. and continued demand for water treatment products in China. Here are a few highlights. Record sales at 3.2 billion grew over 6%. Record adjusted earnings per share grew 20%. We are proud of the global water treatment platform we have built over the last seven years. Beginning in 2011 with about $35 million of water treatment sales in China, we significantly grew to approximately $400 million in 2018. As we experienced rapid organic water treatment growth in China, we added several bolt-on acquisitions in the U.S. and in Europe, launched water treatment products in India and Vietnam and added water treatment engineers and technologists to our global engineering centers. We achieved exclusive supplier status for Lowe\u2019s water treatment business in the U.S. We continue to review our capital allocation and dedicated portion of our cash to return to shareholders.  In 2018, we repurchased nearly 4 million shares for approximately $200 million. We announced two dividend increases in 2018 and the five year compound annual growth rate of our dividend is 30%. We repatriated over $300 million in overseas cash to the U.S., increasing the flexibility of our balance sheet. John will now describe our results in more detail beginning with slide five. John Kita : Sales for the year $3.2 billion grew over 6% compared with the prior year. Adjusted net earnings of $449 million increased 19% from 2017. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.61 increased 20% compared with 2017. Sales in our North America segment of $2 billion increased 7% compared with 2017. The increase in sales was primarily due to higher volumes of residential water heaters and boilers and pricing actions related to steel cost increases. North America water treatment sales including the newly launched Lowe's business in the third quarter incrementally added approximately $29 million to our North America segment sales. Rest of World segment sales of nearly $1.2 billion increased 5% compared with 2017. China sales increased nearly 2% on a local currency basis. The Chinese currency favorably impacted the translation of China sales by approximately $23 million. In China higher water treatment sales including consumables were partially offset by lower sales of electric water heaters and air purifiers. Water heater and water treatment sales in India increased approximately $8 million or over 40% in 2018 in local currency terms compared with 2017. On slide eight, North America adjusted segment earnings of $471 million were 10% higher than segment earnings in 2017. The favorable impact from higher sales of residential water heaters and boilers and the pricing actions in the U.S. were partially offset by higher steel costs and onetime costs associated with the launch of the water treatment products at Lowe's. As a result of these factors 2018 segment margin of 23% was higher than the 22.5% generated in 2017. Rest of World earnings of $149 million or flat compared with 2017. The impact of profits from lower sales of electric water heaters and air purifiers, as well as higher SG&A expenses were offset by the favorable impact to profits from higher water treatment products sale and improved performance in India. Higher advertising related to brand building and higher product development engineering costs were the primary drivers of higher SG&A in China. Segment margin in 2018 declined as a result of these factors. Our corporate expenses were essentially flat compared with 2017. Our adjusted effective income tax rate in 2018 was 20.4%. The rate was lower than the 27.4% experienced in 2017, primarily due to U.S. Tax Reform and benefited 2018 results by $0.02 per share compared with our October guidance. Sales for the fourth quarter of $813 million were 6% higher than the same quarter in 2017. Adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter of $126 million increased 21% from the fourth quarter in 2017. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.74 increased 23% compared with the same quarter in 2017. Sales in our North America segment of $522 million increased 13% compared with the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in sales was primarily due to higher volumes of boilers and residential water heaters in the U.S. and pricing actions related to steel cost increases. Rest of World segment sales of $298 million declined 5% compared with the same quarter in 2017. China sales were down 3% in local currency as the Chinese economy continued to weaken. Higher sales of water treatment products, including consumables were more than offset by lower sales of water heaters and air purifiers. The weaker Chinese currency unfavorably impacted translated sales by approximately $12 million. India sales grew over 25% compared with the same period in 2017. On slide 12, North America segment earnings of $128 million were 22% higher than segment earnings in the same quarter in 2017. The favorable impact from higher sales of boilers and residential water heaters in the U.S. and pricing actions were partially offset by higher steel and other input costs. These factors drove fourth quarter 2017 segment margin higher to 24.4% compared with 22.8% last year. Rest of World earnings of $40 million declined 22% compared with the fourth quarter of 2017, the impact to profits from lower sales of water heaters and air purifiers and higher advertising costs in China related to online selling holidays more than offset the benefits to profits from higher sales of water treatment products and improved performance in India. China foreign currency -- foreign exchange negatively impacted earnings by approximately $2 million. As a result of these factors, segment margin declined significantly from the same quarter in 2017. Our corporate expenses were lower in the fourth quarter compared with the same period in 2017, primarily due to several miscellaneous items in the fourth quarter of 2017. The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 18.4% was lower than last year's rate due to tax reform. Cash provided by operations during 2018 was $449 million and compared with $326 million provided during 2017. Higher adjusted earnings and lower outlays for working capital were the primary reasons for the improved cash flow. Our liquidity position and balance sheet remains strong, our debt-to-capital ratio was 11% at the end of 2018. We have cash balances totaling $645 million located offshore and our net cash position was approximately $424 million at the end of 2018. During 2018, we repurchased approximately 4 million shares of common stock for a total of $203 million. Our Board increased the number of shares eligible for repurchase by 5 million at its December meeting. Over 6 million shares remained on our existing repurchase authority at the end of December. This morning, we announced our 2019 EPS guidance with the range of between $2.67 and $2.77 per share. The midpoint of our EPS guidance represents a 4% increase in the EPS compared with our adjusted 2018 results. Please turn to slide 15 for several 2019 assumptions. We expect our cash flow from operations in 2019 to be between $500 million and $525 million, which is higher than the $450 million generated in 2018. We expect higher earnings and lower outlays for working capital this year. Our 2019 capital spending plans are approximately $85 million, and our depreciation and amortization expense is estimated to be approximately $75 million in 2019. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $50 million in 2019, higher than the $47 million in 2018, primarily due to inflation. Our effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 21.5% in 2019. We expect to repurchase our shares in the amount of approximately $200 million in 2019. We expect our average diluted outstanding shares in 2019 will be approximately $168.5 million. I will now turn the call back to Kevin, who will summarize our guidance and business assumptions for 2019 beginning on slide 16. Kevin Wheeler : Thank you, John. Our outlook for 2019 includes the following assumptions. We project U.S. residential water heater industry volumes will increase between 100,000 to 150,000 units in 2019 due to continued new construction and expansion of replacement demand, as well as continued growth in tankless units.  Boiler revenues grew 9% in 2018, driven by solid demand for condensing boilers and new product related market share gains. We expect our boiler sales to grow approximately 10% in 2019. We improved profitability in India in 2018 due to scale in our water heater and water treatment businesses from losing over $7 million in 2017 to under $5 million loss in 2018.  We project India water heater EBIT will be positive in 2019 and improvements to continue for water treatment. And our total India business will be profitable in 2020. The overall loss in India is expected to be $2 million to $3 million in 2019. Our forecast for the Chinese currency in 2019 is slightly weaker than it is today and over 4% weaker than last year. Almost all of the FX impact is expected in the first half of 2019. As previously discussed, we believe customer inventory in China grew in the first half of 2018, with the majority of the growth occurring in the first quarter and was relatively flat the last half of the year after a decline in the fourth quarter. We estimate 2018 sales increased at least 5% due to the customer inventory built. We are assuming continued weakness in the Chinese economy and relatively flat consumer demand for the full year in 2019. Without the impact of the 2018 China or channel inventory build, we're projecting full year sales to be down approximately 3% to 6% in local currency, all of which will occur in the first half of the year. Combined with an expected 4% unfavorable currency translation our 2019 China sales projection is a decline of 7% to 10%. The first quarter of 2019 faces some significant headwinds. Due to our estimates that the majority of the China inventory build in China occurred in the first quarter of 2018, creating a difficult comp. We project China sales in local currency will decline approximately 20%, or approximately $50 million for the first quarter of 2018. The earnings impact in the first quarter will be approximately 50% of the sales decline. As headcount and SG&A savings will unfold as the year progresses. In addition, China currency was at its strongest level for the year in the first quarter of 2018. As a result, we estimate currency translation will unfairly impact first quarter sales by approximately 7%. In addition, steel costs will be significantly higher in the first quarter of 2019 compared with 2018. Please advance to slide 17. Continued momentum in North American water heaters, boilers and water treatment collectively expected to grow up to 7% in 2019. Our business model in China is solid and continues to achieve low-teen margins. We have near-term challenges to navigate through as the Chinese economy remains week. We project revenue growth will be between 1% and 2.5% for the year in U.S. dollars and 2.5% to 4% in local currency. EPS is projected to be between $2.67 and $2.77. We expect North America segment margin to be between 23% and 23.5% and Rest of World segment margins to be between 12% to 12.5%. Especially in these uncertain economic times, we believe our stable defense replacement markets, which we believe represent approximately 85% of North America water heater and boiler volumes positively differentiates A. O. Smith from other industrial companies. We have a strong balance sheet poised to take advantage of strategic acquisition that add shareholder value, as well as allow us to return cash to shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks and we are now available for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Graham of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Scott Graham : Yes. Hi, good morning. Kevin Wheeler : Hey, Scott. Good morning. Scott Graham : So China, the 2019 view that you have, I guess, the simple 40,000 [ph] question is as we've been kind of chasing what the declines or the deteriorating situation in China is with sales guidance for some time. And now we have a first quarter that looks very difficult. I guess, the questions that come from there are; A, what gives you the confidence that you can eliminate the inventory in the channel mostly in the first half of the year. I guess, because I -- you thought you'd be able to do that by the year-end. And secondly, it does appear as if your sales in China throughout 2018 were -- I understand that housings has been weak, but retail sales which is also an important number weaker, but still pretty decent. Do you think you're losing away from the inventory build, do you think you're losing share in China now? John Kita : A lot of questions there, Scott. So I'll start with the last one, from a share standpoint when we look at the water heater market, what we're seeing for data it was probably down 2% to 3% in 2018. And if we lost any share it was minimal. So the water heater market was just very weak and it's what you said. I mean housing -- every housing metric we look at is weak and it's gotten weaker.  Water treatment, we had a good year especially on consumables, but we'd also say we lost a few points of share there and that was really driven by the fact that we didn't have those mid-price products that we had talked about on an earlier call and we now have those late in the year. I mean, your real question is we were up and we thought we'd be up for the year in October and we're now down and I think it's a variety of factors. One is, we didn't take the inventory down in the fourth quarter as much as what we anticipated and that's because the online holiday sales were not as good as what we thought. Number two, we had originally said that we thought that the second half of the year would be better in China. We are not forecasting that now. This is based on kind of a level the economy stays weak. Then when we look at next year now the assumptions are that our sell out if you will is kind of level with 2018. So we're not going to have much of a pickup. We're going to see some recovery in air purifier water treatment because of the new products, et cetera. But you're right, the first quarter is difficult because last year we picked up our inventory build occurred in the first quarter. And we say that\u2019s not\u2026 Scott Graham : So it\u2019s actually not what I -- there's an opportunity here now in this first quarter for you to essentially flush this channel inventory out, we can suggest that you had. John Kita : No, Scott, I wouldn't necessarily agree with that. What we're really saying is last year's first quarter probably had let's say $40 million to $50 million of inventory build in it and we're saying that's not going to repeat itself. So no, I don't think that's flushes out the inventory because we're having a weak quarter. It's just I'll say a very difficult comp because we built the inventory up last year and we're saying we're not going to build it up. We hope to take it down some in the first quarter. Now whether that'll happen will depend. But I will tell you every housing metric we look at is negative. We ask the same question about retail sales that they're up 8%. And actually one of my advisors said, well you know retail sales also include some consumer commercial spending, et cetera not capital spending but -- so it's not a good number in our mind.  All I can tell you is the market decline in water heaters was 2% to 3%. So it was very weak, water treatment was up and air purifier was down 30%, 40%. So we think after the first quarter we get to kind of a stable point. Again some of the new products we have in place starts adding. Water treatment consumables had a very good year, we went from $20 million to $30 million and we expect that to continue to increase. So it's just getting through the first quarter. So I don't know, if I answered all your questions, Scott. Scott Graham : For the most part John and I very much appreciate the broadness of your answers. If I could just sneak this one in within China would the down 2% to 3% market estimate that you're suggesting here was it weaker on the electric side than it was on the gas side would you say? John Kita : Surprisingly the gas was weaker. I mean, if you would have asked me I would have thought that the electric would have been down the numbers we saw for the year was gas was down 4% electric was down about 1%. Scott Graham : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Summerville of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Matt Summerville : Thanks. Just to clarify, are you talking about the channel has $50 million John of excess inventory? And then A.O. Smith itself is sitting on some amount of excess inventory. Can you just sort of\u2026 John Kita : No, let me -- I'll clarify that. So we're only talking about channel inventory and that's why we can't be exact, right. I don't know exactly what's in my customer inventory levels. I have pretty good indication, we've done a lot of discussions with them, we've done some analysis, we've looked at what we think is sell out year-over-year. And that's why we\u2019ve come to this 5%. Our inventory levels at A.O. Smith are really not up at all, they are no different than what they were. So we're only talking about channel inventories and that's why we're estimating because we don't have exact information. Matt Summerville : Got it. And then for -- just sticking with China, for 2019, can you also clarify how much you expect water treatment to grow as well as air purification? And then what is A.O. Smith doing from a costs reduction standpoint in China and how much savings is baked in to that 12% to 12.5% segment margin? Thank you. John Kita : Well. So air purifier, we expect to be up it was about $23 million, $24 million, it will be in the low-30s. We think that's the new product that we're bringing into play. We think water treatment will be up low-double digits, again led by the consumable piece, which is doing very well. Whereas -- and these numbers have base headcount, ultimate headcount reduction of about 10%. And we're expecting to take advertising down 10% to 15%. And that will occur throughout the year. I will tell you certainly one of the factors we face is that a decent portion of our SG&A expenses is fixed because it\u2019s labor and we can take some of it out obviously, which we're doing and also store set kind of amortization. So we are certainly looking at every opportunity on SG&A that we can. Kevin Wheeler : Yes, I would just like to add on that, I mean, those are the three areas that we've outlined over the last couple of calls. Certainly headcount is going to be reviewed regularly so that we get the right size of the business. SG&A, constantly looking for ways to improve productivity and make those cuts that are appropriate for the business so the business continue to go forward. In the end, the store efficiencies remain high in our list as we continue to evaluate unproductive stores and take action with them overtime. But all the SG&A and all the cost reductions that we've talked about, we've implemented those over the last six months or so and we'll continue to make progress on them, but they're going to come in time. And we'll eventually get to that point where the business is right sized to the amount of sales that we have into the market. So that's an ongoing priority for our businesses along with increasing our sell out and driving new product sales. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Hammond of KeyBanc. Your line is open. Jeffrey Hammond : Hey, good morning guys. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Jeffrey Hammond : So just back on the margin in China, so I think you said down $50 million in sales and down kind of a 50% decremental on that, is that incorporate any kind of onetime restructuring charges in there or is that the true decremental? And then, I guess, with that big dip I'm just struggling on how you get back to kind of near flat margins in Rest of World? John Kita : Well, so no that's really kind of it -- we said kind of publicly in the past, if you look at our gross margin at 41% that's more than in China in our commercial and Lochinvar boiler higher than that, Lochinvar boilers. So looking at that sort of -- and then contribution margin would be a little bit higher. Now obviously we're going to have some benefit from reduction in headcount and reduction in some SG&A. But you also have significant plant efficiencies when you\u2019re taking out -- when you compare that to the prior year. So that is a significant decline over the first quarter. And then we are taking our margin assumptions down about on the low end of point. And again we expect India to improve, and so how we get there is the headcount reductions continue throughout the year, the SG&A and specifically advertising continues. And then you start getting hopefully our estimate of this low-end of 3 comes to play and you'll have some volume benefit. So that's how we get there. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay, helpful. Just on North America, do you announced any or contemplated any additional price in North America? Kevin Wheeler : We -- pricing is always a subject that comes up on these calls. And what I would tell you is that and what we said in the past that A. O. Smith has the history of dealing with costs and addressing those over time. And that's our position and will continue to be our position as we go forward. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay. And then just on -- there has been some deflation in steel, what's kind of the timing where you\u2019d start to see some of the benefits from some of these lower inputs on cold roll? Kevin Wheeler : It starts a little bit in the second quarter, and certainly the last half of the year if it stays where it is now, we\u2019re assuming, we've talked to our consultants and I think their feeling is and I can't tell you necessarily why, but their feeling is we\u2019ve kind of hit the bottom and that their expectation is that steel costs will increase from here, we'll continue to monitor that, et cetera. But you really get -- we start getting the benefit starting in the second quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert McCarthy of Stephens. Your line is open. Robert McCarthy : Good morning, everyone. How are you today? Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. John Kita : Good morning. Robert McCarthy : All right, great. I guess, the first question, in terms of China and the 1Q compare, give us some sense of when do you think you're just going to have a better sense of the trajectory and visibility? I mean, do you think you'll have a comment sometime during 1Q in terms of how you're thinking about things shaking out, because obviously, your guidance is highly predicated on kind of how this all plays out in the near-term, and it's going to affect the various outcomes for the full year. And obviously, bears are somewhat skeptical given the fact that you've had to take down numbers for China versus October.  What gives you any greater sense of visibility? So maybe you could just talk about what you're going to be looking for and what will that allow you to cast maybe a better view on China for the full year? When will we expect an incremental update, because, 1Q is really the hinge? John Kita : Well, I'll start, Kevin can add, I'm not sure we'll have an incremental update. Obviously, we're going to continue as the quarter goes along, monitoring it very closely. I think what we have to kind of see as some of the statistics come out to play. So again housing has continued to be negative there's no doubt about that. Certainly, it would be positive we think from a consumer confidence standpoint if something got resolved with respect to the U.S., China trade issues. So we certainly think that would be a positive. So those are kind of the things we're monitoring. Kevin Wheeler : Okay. Just to add on to that, Q1 is normally one of our lower quarters. So spring festival is coming up and so we'll get a better read as we continue to get through March and then obviously into the second quarter, which is a busier quarter for us. And again, as we're going to look at this, it'll be by product category, by channel really looking closely at our sellout as organization. And then also making sure that we introduce a lot of mid-price point products and in a lot of different channels and we expect those to add incremental sales to our business. So as we get into the latter part of the second half of the year, we'll get a read on the China economy. As John said, we'll get a read on tariffs, so where they're going. So there's a few things that have to kind of work themselves through for us to give you a better answer than we are today. Robert McCarthy : Okay. And then just switching gears over the longer term then. Obviously you mentioned the strength in tankless and I think in particular tankless gas in North America, that's a solid product category overall and you do have a suite of products there and a reasonable share. But that seems to be an area that seems to be gaining some strength and anecdotally it sounds like the cost of installs coming down. Are you concerned over the longer term that that product category could eat into kind of traditional tank and kind of what would be your response there? And how we manage that going forward, because it seems to be a category that could be, particularly attractive in the context of the replacement cycle. Kevin Wheeler : Okay. And are you talking North American or? Robert McCarthy : Talking North America tankless gas. Kevin Wheeler : Yes. Our view hasn't really changed. We were in the hot water business. And as we go forward, we bring various solutions to consumers whether that be tank, tankless, if you look at very strong tank year just recently, we expect to be up in the 300,000 to 350,000 units increase this year. Tankless, we expect we\u2019ll probably come -- we\u2019ll decline a bit from 2017 a strong year, but still be in that low-double digits growth. So, overall, I would agree probably the installation would decline, the cost of it would become more affordable. But again, as we step back as an organization, we provide various solutions because not every solution is the right solution for every consumer. And I think the broad breadth of our product line both residential and commercial provides those solutions. So as we go forward, we're comfortable where the market is moving. I think we're in position with products to capitalize on that. You look at our brand, our strength in distribution, our sales organization. So as a whole, the industry itself were comfortable where it's going and we believe A.O. Smith will continue to be a major player and a market leader in those categories. John Kita : It still is obviously we are monitoring it\u2019s very close, but it still is about 8% of the total market. So, I mean, it is a small part of the total market. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Connors of Boenning & Scattergood. Your line is open. Ryan Connors : Great, thank you. Just want to continue on the China topic for a minute. On some of these past calls you've talked about the issue of consumer trade down I guess and we've seen some of that all the way up to the apples of the world. And you mentioned John that you've got limited if any share loss, but can you just talk about the growth or lack thereof in the various strata of the market from the high end on down and how that's impacted you as a player presumably on the high end. John Kita : Well, I would tell you and there's no good data. But I would tell you we don't think the high end has been growing in this marketplace. You still have well to do people in China that there's still that group that is buying. But my guess is you're not seeing a lot of trading up going in this environment where the economy is not doing very well. But again the fact that we really haven\u2019t lost share on the water heater, I think kind of says that that's the place so that everything's kind of stable when you look at the different strata. But that\u2019s an estimate, we just don't have good data on that. Kevin Wheeler : And I would just echo that that's kind of the feedback that we get back from our sales organization, distributors and our store promoters that the premium market is relatively stable and not a lot of trade down. But the trade up has slowed or is not where it has been in the past. Ryan Connors : Got it, okay. And then my other question is just can you discuss the relative impact and I guess the interplay between the deceleration in growth in China just on an organic basis versus the trade issues. When you mentioned Kevin potential trade resolution of some kind being a catalyst, but -- I think you'd be right in terms of the stock price certainly would probably trade that way.  But what, -- how do you divvy up what's happening to you in China from people were discussing a slowdown in China long before these trade issues. So how much of this is just a natural deceleration in the market versus really related to trade and therefore potentially that being a catalyst? Kevin Wheeler : Yes, I would tell you from a macro perspective we don't know exactly how that would parcel out. Wonder there has been a slowing down in China, but certainly if you just take it back from a consumer point of view in tariffs or in your market starts to slow down and just simply the way we've described it is the Chinese consumer is no different than a U.S or any other consumer when their job has slowed down, when they've seen maybe some layoffs in various parts of the industry and their friends that they simply just pull back. And so, we believe that tariff has had some impact on consumer confidence on their spending patterns just for the fact that that's what we would do here in the U.S. And my comment is if the tariffs and when the tariffs get resolved it will take some time, but that will remove that one uncertainty for the consumer and that should free up. We know today based on some of the information we get back that the Chinese consumer is saving more and more and that normally is an indication of their uncertainty and again once they feel things are settled down and there's more confidence in where the economy is going to go, we believe those resources and funds will free up.  So that's where we're at. Certainly there has been a slowdown a bit from the housing side, but certainly on the other side, we really believe consumer confidence has been impacted by the tariffs and what's been going on in the recent months. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Halloran of Baird. Your line is open. Mike Halloran : Hey, good morning everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Mike Halloran : So first, what's the best estimate now that exiting 2018 for the splits on replacement versus newbuild oriented splits on China water heaters for your core business? John Kita : I mean, it\u2019s hard to say, I don't think we have a data, you're talking about the China business. I don't think, none of -- I haven't seen any different data except that\u2019s 50%. Kevin Wheeler : 50% in tier 1 and a little bit less. John Kita : And nothing that is necessarily increasing. I haven't gotten any updated data. Mike Halloran : And what percentage is replacement on your water treatment side at this point? What part is consumables? John Kita : I went all of -- the consumable part this year was about $30 million, so it was up from $20 million last year. So the consumable are tracking very nicely, we would expect that to again be over $40 million when we look at 2019. So that's progressing and tracking just the way we would have thought. Mike Halloran : And then in North America, just from a cadence through the year. I suppose on China as well. It seems like China you're saying stable cadence from here, if you can adjust for the inventory side. In other words, no improvement, no deterioration in market from current level. Maybe just give us some thoughts on the U.S. as well on how you're viewing the cadence of underlying trends from here? Kevin Wheeler : Well from the U.S. side of the business, I'll break that out residential and commercial. We talked about our residential guidance about $100,000 and $150,000. Again you got to remember that's coming off we believe a pretty strong year of over 300,000 residential type units. So modest growth, there is some talk about some housing slowdown, but still modest growth and of course 85% of that's going to be replacement. On the commercial front, as we talked earlier we just came back from a large industry expo AHR and the consensus from our customers, from our sales organization is that there is about a 3% to 4% growth out there.  Our order book is still pretty solid. And so, we're optimistic in the first half of the year, and we're a bit more conservative in their comments in the second half. But overall both sides of the channel residential and commercial not growing, extending rapidly, but solid growth in both sections. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Your line is open. David MacGregor : Yes, good morning everyone. John, just want to go back to China and you talked earlier in the call about building representation in middle price points. So just I guess first of all just some clarification, when you talk about stable 2019 in China, are you talking about still seeing maybe some weakness in the premium market, but that you're going to pick up share in the middle price points? And as a consequence of all in that's going to provide you with your stability. Or just what are you expecting that would come incremental to your growth from participating in a segment of the margin that presumes doing a little bit better. John Kita : Well we would hope and that's what we hope the last three quarters of the year that we will what I have said is that sell out we would expect for the year to be relatively stable. And if we can pick that up a little bit we'll be able to do two things, one either take inventories down a little bit or move from the 2% to 3% or whatever down for the year. So we don't expect basically where we are that the premium market is going to change much, we'll maintain share there. And we hope that there is some growth in the midpoint area and we have new products for that. David MacGregor : Can you give us any sense from a sizing standpoint, how much bigger the commercial opportunity is in mid-price point versus kind of your legacy franchise in the premiums? John Kita : I won't say it's necessarily significantly bigger, it's just when we had price increases going back kind of into 2017 and 2018, we had moved out of that market. And so, what we were trying to do so we have been in that market, the price increases we\u2019ll get out. So we call mid-price as RMB 3,000 to RMB 5,000. And so, now this is what we're putting products back into that, which will specifically help us we think on the online, which is growing. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Cohen of Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Andrew Cohen : Thanks. I understand with China the Tier 2 and Tier 3 city footprint has how you roll out or how many places you roll out the change at all, are you guys approaching I guess expanding the locations differently or how has that been impacted? Kevin Wheeler : Well, certainly we\u2019re much more selective in not growing at the same rate that we've had in the past. So yes, it slowed a bit again, we're continuing to opening new stores in distribution points, but at the same time as be candid, we're also making adjustment. So the net increase was -- is fairly marginal over the year. So that's where we're heading from a strategic standpoint. We still believe Tier 2, Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities have opportunity particularly 3 and 4 and we\u2019ll continue to look for those right partners and expand as appropriate. John Kita : And I think that's consistent with what the last couple of years have been and that we've been adding 100 to 200 to 300 net, but it's a combination of sum in the Tier 2, 3, 4 and then closing some of the nonproductive stores. So we think that pattern will continue. Andrew Cohen : Okay, thank you. And then on Lowe\u2019s do you consider it to be fully rolled out and if you could give any color on how you think it's tracking going into 2019? Kevin Wheeler : Yes, just some quick color, certainly we're -- I don't know if anything's ever always ruled out because you're always making tweaks and improving your displays and working with your customer to improve sales. But, overall yes, it's been rolled out and I would tell you it's -- the business is on track. We look forward to a terrific 2019 with Lowe\u2019s as a partner. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Charley Brady of SunTrust. Your line is open. Charley Brady : Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys. Good morning, Pat. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Charley Brady : So I'm going to continue beating the dead horse of China here for a little longer. I just want to make sure I understand the commentary around Q1 in Rest of World with China. You're saying China down 50% local currency in sales year-on-year with a 50%... Kevin Wheeler : No, I think, we said $50 million, 20% in local currency, which is 20% and that's about equates to $50 million. Charley Brady : Okay, great. Thanks. That's helpful. Connect with that question, I guess my bigger question maybe though as you look out to the back half of the year for Rest of World and China, I mean, what gives you the -- given the visibility you've got, what gives you the confidence that you're going to see maybe just a flat market and not a continuation of a down market in China? John Kita : Well, again we're assuming that some of our as ancillary product lines like air purification will improve a little bit. The commercial water treatment will improve, the commercial will improve, the new midpoint products we have will offset any further weakness in the market. But it's hard to say, I mean, what we are calling is for the market to really be stable to where it was or down a little bit and we have some items that will offset that decline. Operator : Thank you. And a follow-up from Scott Graham of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Scott Graham : Hi. Would you mind telling us specifically what the Lowe\u2019s number was in the quarter and how much is left to go on the field that was referred to a couple of questions ago for 2019? Kevin Wheeler : Yes, I would tell you that we hit the numbers that we talked about in the past. And that there's again we probably not get into specifics about certain customers, particularly Lowe\u2019s and other public companies. So what I would tell you is that, we launched the fil is in, there's always going to be adjustments to additional areas of our product displays and product inventory. And that the overall outlook that we had with Lowe\u2019s is on track and again we look forward to continue in 2019. Scott Graham : Understand. And then just this last one for me. So at the Investor Day, you guys talked about a couple of different initiatives that you're going to pursue. And I was hoping you can kind of update us on them with respect to what the plans are for 2019? Specifically tankless, your desire to increase your penetration there and also in digital. Kevin Wheeler : Well, I'll take both of those. Tankless, I'm not specifically understand exactly where it's going, but on the tankless side of the business we are going to continue to expand our product offering bringing new products to market with features and benefits to be more competitive. We've talked about that, we look to be doing that in the second half of the year.  And as far as digital, I think we're one of the premier companies, particularly in the water heater and the water treatment side, where digital has been an ongoing program for us for over a decade. We continue to enhance our websites, our e-commerce business, our ability to create demand through various digital media and marketing activities. And that's going to continue to move forward by both parts of our organization whether we are in water heating, boilers or quite frankly in water treatment. That was a very generic answer, but that's about I think where we're going to be at with that with any more specifics. Operator : Thank you. We have a follow up from Jeffrey Hammond of KeyBanc, Your line is open. Jeffrey Hammond : Yes. Just on North America, just wanted to kind of unpack. I mean it seems like you're implying kind of 5% to 10% growth on that business for the year. Is that the right way to think about it? John Kita : Yes, I think it's like close to low -- between 6% and 7%. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay. And then just what kind of growth rate so you're expecting for water treatment all-in? John Kita : Well, obviously we get the benefit of the full year of Lowe\u2019s. And we're probably looking at an increase well we are looking at increase of the other businesses. So it will be up 40% or so from the prior year. So with the benefit of the full year of Lowe\u2019s obviously. And we are expecting the other businesses to grow nicely. And then Lochinvar again we continue that to be we're talking about the boilers growing at 10%. And we haven\u2019t mentioned that Lochinvar obviously had a great quarter. I mean they're -- the boiler market was up 15% in the fourth quarter for us. So it was very, very good quarter. So I think their backlog is in good position going forward as we look to the first half of the year et cetera. So\u2026 Jeffrey Hammond : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next follow up is from Robert McCarthy of Stephens. Your line is open. Robert McCarthy : Got a few follow ups. If you can hear me right? Kevin Wheeler : Yes, we can. Robert McCarthy : Yes. So China, can you talk about just kind of in terms of the organic growth rate for the fourth quarter and for the first quarter. Any directional view of kind of the pricing impact, and how we should be thinking about it across your product portfolio? John Kita : I mean, I have not heard of the significant price adjustments at all. And I don't know, Kevin if you have. But talking to our China people, I don't think there has been significant price adjustments by any means. Robert McCarthy : So as you'd assembled organic growth you wouldn't see a negative price variance in terms of -- okay. And then two more questions, on the tankless gas side, again I think your share right now within that market is kind of high-single digit to low-double digits within this category in the U.S. I mean is there -- and you do have some products there obviously, but I guess the question is, do you think at some point is it make versus buy decision whether you could take a technology or good adjacency and use your brand. Would that be a particular area of potential acquisition for you? Kevin Wheeler : Well, I think we\u2019re always looking for potential acquisition that adds value. And again, going back to the tankless part of the business, we do have terrific products. We're continuing to bring new products out with our partners. And so it's again, I want to make sure we emphasize this is one of our solutions, not the solution. And yes, we're at low-double digits, but at the end of the day that's not where it's going to stay. And we continue to move forward and gain share and expand our products. So overall tankless is -- we're always looking for ways to improve our business whether it be products, manufacturing, logistics working with our customers. So I think our strategy is in space and we'll continue to execute it as we have in the past. Robert McCarthy : The last question is just North America kind of -- I mean, one of your areas of potential capital deployment is around or has been and will continue to be U.S. residential filtration or filtration products. I mean can you talk about the TAM there, the total investable market and where you want to play in there, because it seems to be a very difficult market that\u2019s highly unconsolidated, a lot of ready substitutes. I mean do you see a future there for capital deployment and do you see a future for a business there a little longer term? Kevin Wheeler : Certainly, long-term in the North America water treatment we see a significant business. We look at it somewhere as an opportunity when it\u2019s fragmented bringing somebody like us to be able to maybe do some consolidations and so forth in the right areas. I have said many times that this has opened a lens of our acquisitions possibilities and we continue to go down that path whether it\u2019d be capabilities, products, distribution dealers and work in our acquisition pipeline it certainly we\u2019re very active in that space. So, yes, 100% for sure that we believe there is a viable and going market in North America water treatment and we believe there\u2019s lot of opportunities for A.O Smith and our brand. Robert McCarthy : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you, this concludes the Q&A portion, I like turn the call back over to Patricia Ackerman, for closing remarks. Patricia Ackerman : Thank you for joining on our call today. We have one conference in the first quarter, we\u2019ll participate in the Boenning & Scattergood Conference in London on March 14. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect, have a wonderful day.",

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Patricia Ackerman. You may begin. Patricia Ackerman : Thank you. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today are Kevin Wheeler, Chief Executive Officer; John Kita, our retiring Chief Financial Officer; and Chuck Lauber, our incoming Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin with Kevin\u2019s remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning\u2019s press release. In order to provide improved transparency into the operating results of our business, we provided non-GAAP measures, adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share for 2018 that exclude the restructuring and impairment costs associated with our plant closure in Renton, Washington. Reconciliation from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and also on our website. As a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. I will now turn the call over to Kevin, who will begin our prepared remarks on slide four. Kevin Wheeler : Thank you, Pat, and good morning, ladies and gentleman. Our first quarter results met our expectations and are aligned with our previously communicated projection for China of over year-over-year sales, as a result of a channel inventory build in the first quarter of 2018. Company sales of $748 million declined 5% from the prior year. Earnings per share of $0.53 declined 12% from the prior year. We repurchased approximately 900,000 of our shares for approximately $46 million. We are pleased to announce the acquisition of Water-Right, one of the strongest names in residential and commercial water treatment solutions, earlier this month. Please advance to slide five for more details on this strategic acquisition. Water treatment solution providers, Water-Right squarely supports our growth trajectory in water treatment and enables us to expand beyond our strong presence in the direct-to-consumer and retail channels with Water-Right\u2019s capabilities in the wholesale and water quality dealer channels. The water treatment category in the U.S. is evolving from a taste and odor market to a health and safety market as families become more aware of contaminants in their drinking water. Water-Right brings us additional solutions for residential and commercial applications. Water-Right\u2019s product portfolio and channel access strengthens A. O. Smith\u2019s ability to serve customers seeking drinking water safety at any stage of their life, from school and college age where portability and refillable bottles are prevalent, through first apartment to home ownership when whole house products are desired. The purchase price of a $107 million represents a trailing EBITDA multiple of approximately 9 times, after the expected tax benefit related to a Section 338(h)(10) election. Water-Right meets our return on invested capital objective in the first full year. We expect Water-Right to add approximately $45 million of revenue in 2019. The positive impact to earnings in 2019 is expected to be minimal to the interest and purchase accounting and one-time costs. At this time, I would like to thank and acknowledge John Kita, who is on his last earnings call before retiring from A. O. Smith after about 30 years. We have transformed to a pure play water company during his tenure as CFO. And John was integral in communicating the potential of A. O. Smith to investors. We wish John well in his retirement. John Kita : Thank you, Kevin. We have been working diligently the last several months on my CFO transition to Chuck Lauber. Combining his background and 19 years of experience with A. O. Smith with the strong internal financial and accounting team, I am confident that transition will be seamless. Chuck will now describe our results in more detail, beginning on slide six. Chuck Lauber : Thank you, John. Sales for the first quarter of $748 million were 5% lower than same quarter in 2018. Adjusted earnings in the first quarter of $89.3 million, declined 14% from the first quarter in 2018. On slide seven, first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.53 were 12% lower than the same quarter in 2018. Sales in our North America segment of $522 million increased 4% compared with the first quarter of 2018. The increase in sales was primarily due to higher volumes of boilers and water treatment products and our mid-2018 water heating price actions related to steel and freight cost increases, which were partially offset by lower residential water heater volumes. Rest of the World segment sales of $232 million declined 21% compared with the same quarter in 2018. China sales were down 18% in local currency, primarily related to channel inventory build which occurred in the first quarter of 2018 and did not repeat in 2019. Our China results essentially met the forecast we stated at our January earnings call. The weaker Chinese currency unfavorably impacted translated sales by approximately $13 million. India sales grew approximately 30% in constant currency, compared with the same period in 2018. On slide nine, North America segment earnings of $116 million were 3% higher than segment earnings in the same quarter in 2018. Favorable impact from higher sales of boilers and the mid-2019 pricing actions were partially offset by higher steel and other input costs as well as the unfavorable impact from lower residential water heater volumes. Weakness in the North America water treatment business as a result of tariff related cost increases and lower than expected volumes drove first quarter 2019 segment margin slightly lower to 22.2% compared with the adjustment segment margin of 22.5% last year. Rest of the World earnings of $12 million declined 66% compared with the first quarter of 2018. The impact to profits from lower China sales more than offset the benefits to profits from lower advertising. First Quarter headcount reduction programs were offset by severance costs. Our targeted 10% headcount reduction was largely completed at the end of March. Weaker China currency translation negatively impacted earnings by approximately $1 million. As a result of these factors, segment margin declined significantly from the same quarter since 2018. Our corporate expenses were higher in the first quarter compared with the same period in 2018, primarily due to higher stock-based compensation. The effective tax rate in the first quarter of 20% was lower than last year\u2019s tax rate, as a result of a onetime adjustment due to refinement and estimated tax due to U.S. tax reform. Cash provided by operations during the first quarter of $22 million was lower than $43 million in the same period of 2018. Lower earnings and lower accounts payable balances resulted in lower cash flow from operations. Our liquidity and balance sheet remained strong. Our debt to capital ratio was 14% at the end of the first quarter. We have cash balances totaling $633 million located offshore and our net cash position was $349 million at the end of March. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 900,000 shares of common stock for a total of $46 million. Approximately 5.1 million shares remained on our existing repurchase authority at the end of March. This morning, we updated our 2019 guidance to a range of between $2.69 and $2.75 per share with no change to the midpoint, which represents a 4% increase in EPS compared with our adjusted 2018 results. We expect improved performance in China in the second quarter compared with the first quarter, but project lower China sales than in the same period in 2018 due to the second quarter 2018 inventory build. As a result, we expect our 2019 second quarter earnings per share will be slightly lower than the second quarter last year. We forecast the stronger second half in 2019 compared with the first half due to China performing better in the second half on a constant currency basis impacted by normal seasonality and selling holidays, new product launches, and cost benefits from lower advertising and headcount reductions. Growth as well as typical seasonality of boilers which are normally higher in the second half of the year, improvement in North America water treatment and India profitable in the second half due to volume growth, typical seasonality and improved operating performance. We project significantly improved second half year-over-year performance as a result of stronger water heater volumes as the third quarter 2018 is an easy comparison due to the price increase pull forward in Q2 2018, stronger boiler volumes due to tariff-related loss sales and supplier bottlenecks in the third quarter of 2018 also provides a favorable comparison, improved profitability in North America water treatment due to the absence of one-time product launch cost and softener production inefficiencies, and larger profits in India. We expect our cash flow from operations in 2019 to be between $500 million and $525 million, which is higher than the $450 million generated in 2018. We expect higher earnings and lower outlays for working capital this year. Our 2019 capital spending plans are approximately $85 million, and our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $75 million in 2019. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $49 million in 2019, slightly higher than last year due to inflation. Our effective tax rate is expected to be 21.5% in 2019. We expect to purchase our shares in amount of $200 million -- approximately $200 million in 2019; we expect our average diluted outstanding shares in 2019 will be approximately a 168 million. I will now turn the call back to Kevin who will summarize our guidance and business assumptions for 2019, beginning on slide 13. Kevin Wheeler : Thanks, Chuck. Our outlook for 2019 includes the following assumptions. We project U.S. residential water heater industry volumes will increase between 100,000 and a 150,000 units in 2019 due to continued new construction and expansion of replacement demand as well as continued growth in tankless units. Commercial industry water heater volumes are expected to be up 1%. Based on a strong first quarter, we expect our boiler sales to grow approximately 10% in 2019. We improved profitability in India in 2018 due to scale and our water heater and water treatment businesses from losing over $7 million in 2017 to under a $5 million loss in 2018. The overall loss in India is expected to be $2 million to $3 million in 2019. We project India water heater EBIT will be positive in 2019 and improvements to continue for our water treatment in 2019, and that overall in India, we will be profitable in 2020. Our forecast for the Chinese currency in 2019 is essentially level with where it is today, weaker than last year. All the negative FX impact is expected in the first half of 2019. As previously discussed, we believe 2018 Chinese sales increased at least 5%, due to the customer inventory build in the first half 2018. We are assuming continued weakness in the Chinese economy and relatively flat consumer demand for the full-year in 2019. Without the impact of the 2018 channel inventory build, we are projecting full-year sales to be down approximately 6% to 8% in local currency terms, the majority of which will occur in the first half of this year. Combined with our expected 1 point of unfavorable currency translation, our 2019 China sales projection is a decline of 7% to 9%. Please advance to slide 14. We see continued momentum in North America, with our water heater, boiler and water treatment products, collectively expected to grow up to 9% in 2019, including approximately $45 million in Water-Right sales. Our profitability improvement and sales growth in India is also encouraging. Our business model in China is solid for the long-term opportunity, and we continue to forecast low-teen margins for the full year. We have near-term challenges to navigate through as the China economy remains weak. We project revenue growth will be between 2.5% and 3.5% for the year in U.S. dollars and 3% to 4% in local currency. EPS is projected to be between $2.69 and $2.75. We expect North America segment margin to be between 23% and 23.25%, and Rest of World segment margins to be between 11.75% to 12%. Our stable defense replacement markets, which we believe represent 85% of North America water heater and boiler volumes, positively differentiates A. O. Smith from other industrial companies. We have a strong balance sheet, poised to take advantage of strategic acquisitions that add shareholder value as well as allow us to return cash to shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alvaro Lacayo of G.research. Your line is open. Alvaro Lacayo : Good morning. And congrats John on a very successful tenure as CFO. John Kita : Thank you. Alvaro Lacayo : I wanted -- my first question was around focus on North America, the volume in water heaters and water treatment volumes that you called out as being -- I guess water treatment soft and I believe residential water heater shipment was negative. The shipment data shows that through February, it looks like shipments were positive, think about 3%. Maybe if you could just give me some color around what March looked like and maybe some commentary around what that means for your performance in the quarter. And then, with water treatment, if you provide some color on the magnitude of the price increases and maybe just some commentary around competitive response, and what was the delta between the volume that you were expecting versus what you saw? Kevin Wheeler : Okay. This is Kevin. Let\u2019s talk about North America water heaters first. You\u2019re right. Through the first couple months, the market was up about 50,000 units. But, as we saw in March, based on our March shipments, we\u2019re actually estimating that the industry will be marginally down to flat. And so, we still feel the forecast of 100,000 to 150,000 is valid, but we gave back we believe some of the units in March. What that does for us is, we had a little bit of a share decline, and that\u2019s mainly just due to order patterns and how our distributors order. We don\u2019t see anything of a material issue going forward. So, we project our full-year market share will remain flat. And we expect that the industry will grow as we have previously forecasted. Now, with regards to -- you mentioned water treatment and pricing, I\u2019m not sure -- if you could clarify, that would be helpful. Alvaro Lacayo : I think, the comment was that volume was a little bit lower than anticipated due to cost base, price increases from reacting to the tariffs. I was just wondering what kind of a price increase you implemented, and then how the volume is -- the delta between the expectation and the actual on the volumes for water treatment. Chuck Lauber : Yes. This is Chuck, Alvaro. Really not pricing, it\u2019s really just volume. So, we\u2019re a little disappointed with our first quarter for water treatment. So, our volumes are a little off. We started a little slow with one of our major customers but we feel pretty good about the momentum that we have gone into the rest of the year. The tariff-related costs are just recovered some of those, but we still have tariff-related costs and some of the filtration products that we have coming out of China. And on the water treatment side, we\u2019ve got some inefficiencies we had in Q1 that really we believe are behind us. So, as we look at the North America water treatment business, Q1 is really the low point for us for the year, and we just see that number improving throughout the year. So, we see increased volume as we go throughout the year and we also see that the efficiencies in our softener production are overcome, and we see improvement in March, we see improvement in April. So, the momentum is good in our North America water treatment. Alvaro Lacayo : Thanks for the color. And then, just on Rest of World, are there any further actions from a cost reduction standpoint? And I appreciate the comment around the severance offsetting some of the headcount benefits in Q1. But, if you could tell me, maybe from a magnitude perspective, how much fixed cost reduction to expect from a year-on-year perspective going forward? Chuck Lauber : So, if we look at -- and we\u2019re talking China, right. So, China, so we did get the headcount reduction cost behind us. So, we only see improvement on the headcount going forward. When we\u2019re looking at magnitude -- and if you\u2019re looking at a percentage of SG&A, and most of the savings are cost and the advertising side that really are more building than they are direction promotion type costs. But, I will take it as a percentage of SG&A, and we\u2019re probably mid single digits as a percentage of SG&A when you\u2019re looking at cost reduction year-over-year. Kevin Wheeler : I just want to add a little bit to that. Again, we\u2019ve taken the steps and we\u2019ve talked about this our call a few times that we want to right size the business for the market that we\u2019re participating in today. We believe we\u2019ve taken the steps. But, you should all know that we continue to monitor the market. And if additional actions are required from us, we\u2019ll make those decisions as we go forward throughout the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Summerville of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Drew Haroldson : Good morning. This is Drew Haroldson on for Matt Summerville. I have just a couple of questions. First, do you believe that the inventory channel correction in China will be largely complete at the end of the second quarter, or if not, when would you expect that pressure to alleviate? Chuck Lauber : Yes. This is Chuck, Drew. Yes. So, we -- the inventory in China is -- it built last year really, we saw that build in the first half of the year and larger percentage was in the first quarter than in the second quarter. For the last three or four quarters, it\u2019s been pretty stable. Our assumption, when we kind of look at forward on the year is that it\u2019d be flat to down. But, we don\u2019t see a lot of decrease in that in our forecast for the rest of the year. Drew Haroldson : Got it. And then, just as a quick follow-up. Can you talk about the cadence throughout the quarter in China? It seems as though, some data points pointed to a better overall sentiment in March versus January and February. Did you also see that in your business? Kevin Wheeler : Yes. We -- that\u2019s gone up and down quite frankly. If you look at just the macro environment, we would tell you, it still remains a challenge. Consumer demand is weak, but we are seeing some stabilization and some -- I don\u2019t want to say improvement, but certainly just stable consumer demand. So, we are seeing some of those signs. But, I would tell you that we need to see more than just a few months. And so, as we\u2019re looking at it, going forward, that\u2019s why we project it relatively flat. And so, we see more of a positive sign with some of the government possible stimulus packages and some of the other things that could help consumer demand if the tariff issue gets resolved. But, we are seeing some, but I would tell you, we need to see a few more months before we\u2019re willing to say that there\u2019s a positive momentum in China. Chuck Lauber : Yes. This is Chuck. So, I mean, the first quarter is always difficult in China because of the spring festival, and it\u2019s a bit harder to get a handle on what the market is doing. So, as you kind of go into the second quarter, hopefully we\u2019ll see a little bit better feel. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeff Hammond : Hi. Good morning, guys. So, just on China. I think first quarter, you gave us some good color on kind of how first quarter was going to shape up. And I think you said you still expect decline. But, can you just maybe give us a finer point on the magnitude of the year-on-year decline you expect in China in 2Q and what kind of decremental margins you\u2019d expect? Chuck Lauber : So, for Q1, we gave the guidance that Q1 would be down roughly $50 million. And last January, we talked a bit about the inventory build happening in 2018, predominantly in the first quarter, but did happen throughout the first half of the year. I mean, we don\u2019t know our channel inventory numbers precisely. But, when we kind of take a step back and look at it, we would kind of gauge the Q2 impact to be made roughly half of that of Q1. So, the volume, we\u2019re saying 50 in Q1. So, we would take that in Q2 as roughly half. Jeff Hammond : Okay. Then, the decrementals tied to that, because I think you had pretty high decrementals? Chuck Lauber : No. It kind of would be similar to the first quarter. We had that ass kind of a 50% to operating earnings. Jeff Hammond : Okay. And then, how do you get to -- I mean, it just seems like a very backend-loaded year. How do you get to the margin assumptions for Rest of World? Like, what needs to happen in the second half to kind of get to that high 11% to 12% range? Kevin Wheeler : Yes. I mean, what really kicks in a bit is some of the cost reduction programs that we talked about. We really don\u2019t see the headcount reductions until we start entering into the second quarter. So we see that -- we would see -- we\u2019re really being hurt by volume obviously in this first 2 quarters, and we\u2019re talking about the numbers Q1 and Q2. And we expect that to flatten out, so the back half, the China -- from our sales perspective, we expect to be better. And then India, so we\u2019ve got improvement in India. When you look at kind of how India lays out for the year, it\u2019s very seasonal. They\u2019re clearly -- their strength is in the back half of the year. So, really when you look at India, all of our losses accumulate in the first 2 quarters, and we\u2019re profitable in the back half the year, when we look at our projection, which is a pretty big swing quarter -- half-over-half. Operator : Our next question comes from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Your line is open. David MacGregor : Just first of all, first question, really on China, and you had talked in the past about rolling out some mid-price point water heaters in China. So I guess, I\u2019d just start off by just asking if you could talk about the early experience with that rollout? And what did that represent as a positive offset within the Chinese growth compare? And what was the impact of cannibalization on the premium product? Kevin Wheeler : Well, let\u2019s just start out with the rollout. And we\u2019ve been rolling out midpoint products now for the last several months, and we\u2019ll continue to roll them out into the remaining half of the second quarter and third quarter this year. And I want to get specific because at the end, on the gas side, we are filling our line with the 0 cold water. We are in those mid-price point products, which are important because we vacated those gaps on the offline but we also supports our online sales. On the electric side, our wall-hung business, we\u2019ll introduce a mid-price steel jacket model. We\u2019re also going to upgrade one of our high end models with several features, with regulators and displays and slimline-type tank design. Water treatment, we will introduce 2 new high end products as well. One more of a DIY easy filter replacement. The other is boiling water with the tap -- luxury tap. So we have mid-price point products, and we also have new high end products that we are launching almost simultaneously, and they are -- right now, we\u2019re seeing improvement in our online sales. We are seeing some improvement in our mid-price point range. Now, I\u2019d tell you that this is early and each product takes some time to get out through certification. But the steps we\u2019re taking, we feel really good about our new product, we feel they\u2019re having the impact, and they will have the impact over the rest of this year. And as far as cannibalization, we have a high end part of the market, which we continue to do well in on the water heater side of it, that\u2019s tankless and electric wall hung. I would tell you, people aren\u2019t probably trading up, but we don\u2019t see a lot of trading down. Water treatment\u2019s a little bit different story, but we do see some trading down going on there, so maybe a little bit of cannibalization. But overall, the product offering is meeting our expectations, and it\u2019s just a matter of getting them out into our distributors, into our distribution to have the full impact throughout 2019. Chuck Lauber : Yes. And this is Chuck. And I talked a little bit about cost reduction but I just want to emphasize that we haven\u2019t cut back on R&D or our new product development or launching new products. So we\u2019re very upbeat and excited about the products that are coming out. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Graham of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Scott, if your telephone is muted, please unmute. Scott Graham : Hi. Good morning. And John, I wanted to just extend congratulations to you. You had a terrific run here at the company John Kita : Thanks, Scott. Scott Graham : I wanted to maybe first ask about the organic for the year or better yet, as you\u2019re calling it, sales in local currency, which I understand now means inclusive of Water-Right. It looks to me as if your organic expectation for the company is now 1.5% to 2.5%, is that -- am I calculating that right? Chuck Lauber : We are just taking a look at that, Scott. Patricia Ackerman : So, we said Water-Right sales would be $45 million this year. Scott Graham : So, I think, it\u2019s about 1.5%? Kevin Wheeler : It\u2019s about 1.5%. Yes. That\u2019s correct. Scott Graham : Okay. All right. The China water heater market, I know in the past you guys have had a pretty good beat on knowing what that market is running at, in total, not just your channel. Do you have an idea where that is right now? It was kind of -- I think you guys were kind of saying it was a little bit negative last quarter. Do you know where it is now? Chuck Lauber : What we look at from data, from our third-party -- this is Chuck, again. It\u2019s -- the ABC data that we use through the third-party, and it doesn\u2019t include our specialty stores, just the retail. What they\u2019re showing down for electric and gas is roughly in that 9% to 10% range for the first quarter. So they got the market down in that level with online and are performing a bit better, of course. Online is up a bit and offline down more than online\u2019s up. Scott Graham : Would you then say that\u2019s a deterioration from last quarter, right? From what you see? Chuck Lauber : Yes, we would say that. Last quarter was running less than that. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Robert McCarthy of Stephens. Your line is open. Robert McCarthy : Congratulations, John, on a great career. What I would say is the following, I guess the first thing I\u2019d like you to just go through. Could you -- could you all talk about in the context of some of these acquisitions kind of how you perceive the total addressable market for water treatment in North America? And where you want to play? Maybe if you could give us a sense of the total addressable market, some of the growth drivers and where you see the ability to create value for the company and where you want to play? Kevin Wheeler : Let\u2019s just talk about Water-Right and then I\u2019ll tug back into our other acquisitions. And we\u2019ve talked about Water-Right fits squarely in our strategy particularly from a residential and commercial point-of-view and some dealer network. But if you go back, you look at our strategy. Water-Right really complements our prior two acquisitions. Aquasana was our first acquisition and that provided carbon products and also provided a solid direct-to-consumer platform. That filled out 2 of our channels that we wanted to participate out of the 5. We also then acquired Hague, and there\u2019s a large water softening market out there, and Hague\u2019s innovative water softening products helped fill out that product portfolio for us. It also helped us enter into the water quality dealer network as well. And if you remember, we took those 2 acquisitions, we are able to put them together and offer a full package, which helped us in improving our big box retail position. Now as you go forward here, where does Water-Right fit in? Water-Right fits in that residential and commercial problem water area. And they bring new products that help fill out that part of our business. They will -- they also brought a stronger dealer network, which now -- we\u2019ve more than doubled our water quality dealer network, and by the way that was with minimal overlap. And they also helped us enter into the wholesale side of the business. More of the specialty wholesale side of the business as well. So when you put all 3 of these acquisitions together, they complement the 5 channels, which are residential and light commercial that we want to participate in. And as we go forward, our -- we firmly believe that the water quality in the United States, in North America will continue to deteriorate over time and that each one of these product or channel categories and the products that we offer will add value to those specific -- our customers that are purchasing through those channels. So going forward, we are very bullish on our water treatment business. We still believe that it\u2019s in its early stages as people become more aware of their -- the quality of the water throughout the United States and so forth. So those all tied together and having a filtration carbon, having a water softening, having RO system, now moving through now being able to leverage our commercial network that we have throughout the United States with water heaters and boilers that\u2019s another key component. And we believe you wrap this up completely, this will provide -- we had talked about at least high single digits growth going forward and improved profitability, as we continue to build out and implement our strategy -- our water treatment strategy across North America. Chuck Lauber : This is Chuck. And just circling back to the total addressable market. I mean we estimate the North America market to be around $2 billion as a total addressable market. So, as Kevin said, we like the trends, and it\u2019s a large market that we think has a lot of potential as it evolves. Robert McCarthy : Great. And then maybe if you could expand your comments with respect to China and the water treatment trends you\u2019re seeing there in terms of growth? And then touch on air purification as well. Just give us the latest state-of-play of what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the market dynamics there in terms of growth? Chuck Lauber : Yes. Water treatment continues to be a bright spot for us in China. It didn\u2019t pop in the numbers this quarter, and the reason why is because we\u2019ve talked about that inventory build last year. So if we look at kind of our water treatment business in China, we\u2019re looking at -- so for the quarter, we were down probably low single digits. Just slightly down on our sales. Now that the sellout was still kind of a bright spot when you look at what the sellout was and what we see in the marketplace. When we look at our year for water treatment, we see about 8% year-over-year growth, and we see consumables that are continuing to grow. So we\u2019re very happy with the consumable business. It\u2019s about a $30 million base last year, growing at about 30%. And it grew at 30% Q1, and we expect it to grow at 30% for the year. So water treatment continues to be a good product for us. Kevin Wheeler : And then, I would just add that this is not a -- water treatment is not a product that\u2019s tied to new construction, it\u2019s really tied to health and safety. And those are primary with the Chinese consumer, particularly with children. So we expect that to continue to grow and to have value for many, many years to come. Chuck Lauber : I think you touched on -- you mentioned air purification. We really have moved into more of a formaldehyde product as we go into air purification. I think we\u2019re kind of really just entering into that time of the season. So the summertime is when you really see formaldehyde in China being more of an issue. So we\u2019re -- we\u2019ve got some new products that we\u2019ve launched there. We\u2019ve got fresh air product that is well mounted, that we\u2019re excited about coming into the market. Last year, our sales probably in the -- down a bit obviously, but probably in the $25 million range. And this year, we expect with our formaldehyde product to grow a bit, probably grow up to maybe $30 million. This is what our projection is. So we see a little bit of a positive there, but it really predicates a bit on what happens this summer in the formaldehyde. Kevin Wheeler : We still believe air purification, based on what we know today, has a place in our portfolio. And we\u2019re also having a few new products there into more of the mid-price range to help the -- boost sales as well and address some of the consumers that we haven\u2019t been able to with our higher end products. So overall, air purification remains part of our portfolio, and we believe it will -- may not be as we\u2019ve talked in the past, may not be that 30% to 40% growth, but we still believe it\u2019s solid double digits going forward. Operator : Our next question is a follow-up from Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets . Your line is open. Jeff Hammond : Just a follow-up on water treatment. I just want to level set kind of how big do we think that business is in 2019, now that you\u2019ve included Water-Right? And what\u2019s kind of the core growth all in for water treatment? And does that change at all given the slow start? Chuck Lauber : So, Jeff, I think you\u2019re talking about just North America piece, right? Jeff Hammond : Yes, North America. Chuck Lauber : Yes. So, the Water-Right adds about $45 million. So we\u2019re looking at this year, the North America water treatment approaching $155 million of revenues and approaching a 10% operating margin return. And we would expect -- as we go forward, we would expect to have an expansion on the operating margin probably in the 200 to 300 basis points. When we look at kind of the growth rate. We kind of -- you break it down, and you\u2019ve got different growth rates probably for filtration products and get -- versus softeners. But overall, we would say, we\u2019d be approaching high single-digit growth rates going forward. So when we kind of roll it all in and you look at 2020 and you\u2019ve got a full year of Water-Right, we would be approaching $190 million, $200 million as we get into 2020. And we\u2019re looking at continue to expand margins and a nice growth rate for the North America piece. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Graham of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Scott Graham : Hi. Good morning, again. I got cut off at the knees there. I\u2019m not sure... Kevin Wheeler : Scott, that was John. Scott Graham : Yes. I actually thought it was you, Kevin. So help -- if you could help me understand the lows? It looks to me like -- you tell me if I\u2019m wrong on this, but you are maybe a little bit off track on where the lows water treatment selling lands in 2019. Kind of what happened there? And may be why? Kevin Wheeler : Well, I want to go back to we launched in August of last year, and we talked about on a couple of calls. We started out a little bit slower than we expected. We had some capacity issues in our Combi\u2019s facility. And so we just got off to a slow start. But as Chuck mentioned early on in the call, we\u2019re seeing month-on-month growth in the space, and our capacity issues are clearly behind us right now, and our efficiencies continue to improve as we continue to build scale. So are we behind a little bit? Yes, we are. Do we think we have the programs and the foundation set to go forward? And the answer is, yes. And like you said, we\u2019re starting to see that. We talked about having a good margin, we\u2019re off to a nice start in April. So it\u2019s -- moving forward, it\u2019s just going to be more timing, and we\u2019ll eventually get to the numbers that we talked. It would just be at a little bit slower rate. Scott Graham : Got you. And before I get cut off, so I do have another question. Going back to China, I have not in a long time heard as many new product launches being teed up for the rest of the year, and it\u2019s definitely exciting. It does also, however, beg the question of mix. Historically, I think you have always hoped to get Rest of World margin into the 15% range. I -- just trying to understand kind of how -- what you\u2019re thinking now with longer term on Rest of World margin with a lot of new price coming in that are undoubtedly going to be lower margin in China than your core water heater offering. Could you maybe talk around that a little bit? Kevin Wheeler : Well, let\u2019s just start with that, we have introduced a number of new products, particularly the mid-price. And if you remember, we were just trying to fill some gaps that we created through a price increase. But also, online is becoming more prevalent, and that just doesn\u2019t have the same type of price point. So we need to make sure that we have the products to compete to guard the volume and the share that we have. Now our margins -- I would tell you, our -- byproduct are not going lower. Now our price points are, but we are -- the reason we are introducing new products, we\u2019re taking steps to drive cost out and diminish that price cost ratio. So, margins are going to remain solid, as they have been. Our average selling price is going to drop a bit. But overall -- and by the way, just to go back, we may not have talked about all these new products that we\u2019ve launched, but we\u2019ve been very consistent over the last decade of introducing many, many products at a time. And of course, the number of products are going to get larger as you enter new categories. So this is not -- it\u2019s a little bit out of our behavior because of the mid-price points, but the rest of them are just normal business -- being in a consumer business, and plants business, we\u2019re always introducing new products every 12 to 18 months. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Cohen of Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Andrew Cohen : Hi. You kind of touched on some of the -- but I\u2019m curious -- I mean, you seem to have gone in China into some tangential lines of business recently, and I\u2019m wondering, if this is a one-off, or if you are trying to become more of a broad range scope of products in that market? Kevin Wheeler : I would tell you our strategy, let me just articulate that. We\u2019re always looking at new product categories to grow. In China there is a growth market, has a lot of opportunity but we have high criteria for our product launches. One, they have to be able to leverage our brand and our distribution, that\u2019s number one. And number 2, we don\u2019t enter any product category that we don\u2019t believe we can add significant value to the product category going forward. So if you look at your purification, we felt we could bring added value formaldehyde and so forth. But we\u2019re also going to continue. We\u2019re always incubating products. We\u2019re incubating Combi boilers today. We\u2019re incubating air purification. We have a very nice growing commercial water treatment business that\u2019s moving toward profitability. So yes, we\u2019re going to enter new product categories but they\u2019re always going to be within our core and being able to leverage what we\u2019ve been able to develop and build, which is our branded distribution over the last 20 years. Andrew Cohen : Does that include -- like you\u2019ve got now Hague and Water-Right which are North American products. Are you looking for how those fit into the Rest of World market, or kind of... Kevin Wheeler : I would tell you right now, we already are selling the water softeners that are from Hague. We\u2019ve been doing that over last couple of years, right? In fact that\u2019s how we started our -- we need to know the Hague business as they were customer -- or we were a customer of theirs from China. So yes, but that fits again squarely into being into the bathroom, being into the kitchen with our brand and our distribution it\u2019s not a large part of the market but it\u2019s one that it\u2019s a natural synergy from the companies and the products we have, both in North America and it can go both ways back to China which it does in reverse osmosis. Operator : Our next question is a follow-up from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Your lines open. David MacGregor : Yes. Thanks for taking the follow-up. I may get cut off again. So, let me just give you 2 or 3 questions in a row there. First of all, I guess, pricing your anniversarying the second half or the midyear 2018 price increase, do you have additional pricing actions in place to carry the third quarter compare? And secondly, I guess replacement demand from 2007 to 2009, industry sales were down about 20%, as I recall. And so I\u2019m interested in how you think about North American replacement demand against that historical pattern. How much of a drag, if any, is replacement demand on the overall growth? And then if I could just through a third in. I guess just on boilers. Can you talk us through, quickly how severe weather-driven spike in sales has impacted subsequent quarters\u2019 growth? And do you feel you may have pulled forward some growth there? Kevin Wheeler : That was quite a list, thank you. I\u2019m going to take the first one, if pricing -- and we don\u2019t comment on pricing as we go forward. As we talked about that was implemented last year, you\u2019re right, it\u2019s anniversarying right now. We are constantly always reviewing our cost positions and so forth, but we don\u2019t comment on future pricing actions. And as far as the replacement demand, I\u2019m glad you asked that because it\u2019s an important point that we get many times on the road with regards to \u201cI think you\u2019re going toward, hey, is there a cliff coming because of what happened in 2007, 2008?\u201d And what we\u2019ve articulated last few years so have done quite a bit of research and study. We went back to 1970 and really laid out our replacement market in a number of different ways and what we have concluded quite frankly is yes, so we have a bell curve but it\u2019s an elongated bell curve. It goes anywhere from 5 years to 20-plus years. And then if you look at the overall replacement market, our replacement market is really 14x what\u2019s the available housing out there, which is $120 million. When you put that all together, and our assessment that we may have some blips here and there, but there is no cliff at all affect. It\u2019s going to just kind of level out over the years as it always has and continue we believe at a similar replacement pace that we\u2019ve seen over the last 5 or 10 years. And as far as boilers... Chuck Lauber : Yes. And back to your question on boilers in Lochinvar and the -- or the seasonal weather, the cold weather I think was your question. I mean what we saw mostly was residential products, we don\u2019t believe that that\u2019s going to impact kind of the normal seasonality of the boiler business for the back half of the year. Operator : Our next question is a follow-up from Alvaro Lacayo of G.research. Your line is open. Alvaro Lacayo : My follow-up is just the North American water treatment market. If you could break down the $2 billion or so in sales that you gave as an addressable market, if you could break it down by channel, and I think you\u2019ve called out retail, direct-to-consumer, wholesale and water quality dealer. And then maybe you can give some commentary around how many stores you\u2019re actually at Lowe\u2019s or if you reach sort of the total amount of stores that you intend -- that you plan to reach? And then on the wholesale dealer channel, is that all incremental to you guys and how big is that? Kevin Wheeler : Okay. We\u2019ll give you some approximations here. When you talk about the overall water treatment market by channel, about 40% to 50% of it is dealers, about -- again 15%, and these are approximate, 15% to 20% is on the wholesale side of the business. 15% is retail and 10% is basically other. Chuck Lauber : Yes. I mean, that\u2019s why we\u2019re really pleased to have Water-Right joint because the largest part of the market is in that dealer wholesale piece and they bring us a bit of a footprint there that\u2019s going to be very helpful to us. Kevin Wheeler : And going back to how much is that going to be incremental, it\u2019s surprisingly the number of dealers that we brought on with the Water-Right acquisition and we lay them on top of the dealers we have in Hague, there was very, very little overlap. So, most of it is going to be incremental. And by the way, it\u2019s going to cover some areas that we were not in and give us a broader national footprint as we continue to grow that over the next few years. Alvaro Lacayo : And with Lowe\u2019s, are you fully launched there, or is there more stores in the pipeline? And just to give us an idea, how many stores you\u2019re in? Kevin Wheeler : For the most part, yes. We are fully launched, and we are just moving forward with our store displays and generating consumer demand for our products. I would not expect any real meaningful loading, if you will, going forward. Just so we\u2019re clear, I mean, Lowe\u2019s has over 1,720-plus stores so it\u2019s taken us a while to get in there, but we\u2019re fully integrated their displacement so forth. And prepared to go forward with them. Operator : There are no further questions. I would turn the call back over to Patricia Ackerman for any closing remarks. Patricia Ackerman : Thank you for joining us today on our first quarter results conference call. We will participate in the following conferences this quarter : Oppenheimer in New York on May 7th; KeyBanc in Boston on May 29th; and The William Blair Conference in Chicago on June 5th. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. And you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

I would now like to turn the call over to Patricia Ackerman, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability and Treasurer. Ma'am, you may begin. Patricia Ackerman : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2019 results conference call. With me participating in the call are Kevin Wheeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin with Kevin's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning's press release. As a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. I will now turn the call over to Kevin, who will begin our prepared remarks on slide 3. Kevin Wheeler : Thank you, Pat, and good morning ladies and gentlemen. Chuck will elaborate on our financial performance in a moment. And while China continues to be particularly challenging, I am pleased to highlight several items and actions, which help position us for future success. Number one, our solid operating margin performance in North America remained steady despite expected lower water heater volumes compared with last year. We announced a price increase of up to 4% on our North America wholesale water heater portfolio, effective August 1st. Excuse me, just August, early August. We joined our Hague and Water-Right water quality dealer sales organization together, so as to represent one customer-facing our customers in that channel, and the transition has gone well. Continuing our strategy to leverage our distribution channel, we launched our A. O. Smith branded water treatment portfolio in the U.S. wholesale channel. We revised our China sales expectations as we moved into the back half of the year, with a path towards more normalized channel inventory levels, which as previously discussed, has been elevated for over the past 15 months. Chuck will now describe our results in more detail, beginning on slide 4. Charles Lauber : Thank you, Kevin. Sales for the second quarter of $765 million were 8% lower than the same quarter in 2018. Earnings in the second quarter of a $102 million declined 11% in the second quarter in 2018. And second quarter earnings per share declined 8% to $0.61. Sales in our North America segment of $524 million declined 2% compared with the second quarter of 2018. Lower residential water heater volumes due to a tough second quarter 2018 comparison, driven by a pre-buying in advance of the price increase were partially offset by the mid-2018 pricing actions. In addition, our recently acquired Water-Right business added approximately $14 million to sales. Rest of the World sales of $249 million declined 19% compared with the same quarter of 2018. China sales were down 16% in local currency, primarily related to previously disclosed channel inventory build, which occurred in the first half of 2018 and did not repeat in 2019. The weaker Chinese currency unfavorably impacted translated sales by approximately $16 million. India sales grew over 30% in constant currency compared with the same period in 2018. On Slide 6, North America segment earnings of a $123 million were 2% lower than segment earnings in the same quarter in 2018. The favorable impact from mid-2018 pricing actions were more than offset by the unfavorable impact from the lower water heater volumes and higher steel costs and other costs. As a result, second quarter 2019 segment margin of 23.5% was essentially the same as last year. Rest of the World earnings of $22 million declined 35% compared with the second quarter of 2018. The impact to profits from lower sales -- lower China sales more than offset the benefit to profits from lower SG&A expenses. Weaker China currency translation negatively impacted earnings by approximately $2 million. As a result of these factors, the segment margin declined to 9% compared with 11.3% in the same quarter of 2018. Our corporate expenses of $9.6 million were lower in the quarter compared with the second quarter last year, primarily due to lower incentive-based compensation. Interest costs were higher in the second quarter than a year ago due to the acquisition of Water-Right in early April. For the year, we expect interest expense to be approximately $11 million. Cash provided by operations of a $144 million during the first half of 2019 was lower than a $173 million in the same period of 2018, lower earnings and higher working capital investment resulted in lower cash flow from operations. Our liquidity and balance sheet remained strong. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 17% at the end of the second quarter. We have cash balances totaling $578 million located offshore. And our net cash position was $219 million at the end of June. During the first half of 2019, we repurchased approximately 2.8 million shares of common stock for a total of a $133 million. Through yesterday, we purchased approximately 4 million shares at a cost of approximately a $185 million, accelerating the pace of our repurchase due to valuation. Approximately 6.3 million shares remained on our existing repurchase authority at the end of June. We continue to see prolonged headwinds in the appliance market in China. And recent indications from our customers in China inform us that they will reduce orders for the third quarter. As a result, we have revised our 2019 EPS guidance to a range of between $2.35 and $2.41 per share, a 9% decline at the midpoint compared to last year. We expect our cash flow from operations in 2019 to be approximately $400 million compared with $450 million in 2018, primarily due to lower earnings. Our 2019 capital spending plans are approximately $85 million and our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $75 million in 2019. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $49 million in 2019, slightly higher than last year due to inflation. Our expected effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 22%. We expect to repurchase our shares in the amount of $300 million in 2019. We expect our diluted outstanding shares in 2019 will be approximately a $167 million. I will now turn the call back to Kevin, who will summarize our guidance and business assumptions for 2019, beginning on slide 10. Kevin? Kevin Wheeler : Okay, great. Thank you, Chuck. Our outlook for 2019 includes the following assumptions. We project U.S. residential water heater industry volumes will be down 50,000 to 100,000 units in 2019 as replacement remained stable, but new home construction appears to be lackluster due to labor shortages and weather delays. Commercial industry water heater volumes are expected to be up 1%. Based on boiler sales growth of 7% in the first half, we expect our North America boiler sales to grow approximately 7% for the full year. We project India water heater EBIT will be positive in 2019 and improvements to continue for water treatment in 2019. Overall in India, we will be profitable in 2020. Our forecast for the Chinese currency in 2019 is essentially level with where it is today and weaker than last year. Essentially all of the negative FX impact occurred in the first half of 2019. We see continued and prolonged headwinds in the appliance channel in China. Our third party analysis of overall market performance in the second quarter showed the electric water heater market was down 8% to 9%, gas tankless water heaters down 2% to 3% and water treatment systems down 1% to 2%. As previously discussed, we estimated 2018 China sales increased due to distributor inventory build, primarily in the first half of 2018. We are assuming continued weakness in the China consumer demand for the full year in 2019. We continue to improve our process to quantify inventories, while we experienced seasonality, a normal inventory level would be two to three months. Our current view is that the channel inventory is approximately four months. Based on our recent conversations with key customers, we expect channel inventory levels to decline over the back half of the year to approach normal channel inventory levels by the end of 2019. Due to the 2018 channel inventory build and with the impact of the expected 2019 channel inventory decline, we are projecting full year sales to be down approximately 16% to 17% in local currency terms. Combined with our expected three points of unfavorable currency translation, our 2019 sales projection is a decline of approximately 19% to 20%. We expect third quarter 2019 channel -- China sales to be down 20% compared to the third quarter of 2018. Due to the decline in sales, we expect plant inefficiencies, reductions in headcount and higher mix of mid-priced products will have a slightly lower contribution margin will weigh on margins. We forecast China third quarter 2019 operating margin will essentially breakeven. We expect fourth quarter performance to be similar to the second quarter as the fourth quarter is typically the strongest quarter of the year, offset by expected continued channel inventory declines. Please advance to Slide 11. We continued -- we see continued momentum in North America with our water heater, boiler and water treatment products, collectively expected to grow up to 6% in 2019, including approximately $40 million in Water-Right sales. Our profitability improvements and sales growth in India is also encouraging. Our business model in China is solid, and we are committed to the region for the long-term. We have near-term challenges to navigate through in China as the economy remains weak. We continue to stay close to our distribution customers as they worked down channel inventory and we continue to review our cost structure to right-size the business. We project revenue will decline by 2% to 2.5% for the year in U.S. dollars and 1% to 1.5% in local currency. EPS is projected to be between $2.35 and $2.41. We expect North America's segment margins to be between 23.50% and 23.75% and Rest of World segment margins to be approximately 6%. Our stable replacement markets, which we believe represent approximately 85% of North America water heater and boiler volumes, the long-term growth drivers in water treatment solutions and boilers across North America and favorable demographics in China and India, coupled with our strong balance sheet position us well to enhance shareholder value. That concludes our prepared remarks. And we are now available for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Saree [ph] with Jefferies. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. Could you update us on how you're thinking about price cost in North America in the second half of the year and maybe into 2020 given your price increase announced today and then lower steel costs? Kevin Wheeler : We've been, typically we don't talk about price. I would say historically; we've been able to offset increased costs with pricing action. Our assumption -- I'll tell you that our forecast and assumption on steel is that currently we forecast that it will be like -- it will be in this level for the rest of the year. And we have seen recently this last month some increases in steel prices or some indication steel prices may be going up. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then, I believe you have previously done with headcount reductions in China, but given the lower outlook would you reduce this more or do you believe you have already right-sized the business for current market conditions? Kevin Wheeler : No, we're going to continue to review the business, as we always have and we'll be aggressive. The first headcount reduction was about 10%. We completed that in the first quarter of this last year. We are planning an additional 5% reduction in Q3. And then the SG&A that we continue to look at and scrutinize to make sure that we're spending our money appropriately there and investing appropriately. And we're going to continue to close on productive stores. And so at the end, as we look at it, as the market was to and continues to evolve, we'll aggressively adjust our business and we will right-size the business to the current environment. Unidentified Analyst : I appreciate it. That was helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our following question comes from Alvaro Lacayo with G. Research. Your line is open. Alvaro Lacayo : Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to start with Rest of World and maybe if you could try to categorize for us the visibility that you see, I know you mentioned that you believe that the inventories may be more normalized towards the end of the year. But given the big step change from last quarter to this quarter, maybe if you could just talk about visibility and what you could see going forward? And in terms of the numbers you highlighted about the volume declines has that stabilized or has that's -- in your view or have they not found a bottom in terms of year-on-year declines? Charles Lauber : This is Chuck. Let me just talk a little bit about China. So what we've talked about in the past is the weak economy and that continues. So we've continued to see weak economy that really has not changed. We've talked about elevated inventory in the channel that has not changed. The elevated inventory remains roughly or where it has been really since we started talking about at June of 2018. We've also talked about assuming our outlook last call, said assuming flat channel inventory, we'd be down 6% to 8%. What's changed in our visibility is that recently, as we come out of June and had conversations with customers, we've seen customers telling us that they are going to order less in the third quarter. Now, typically in the third quarter and we talked about this on last year's call because of the fourth quarter is typically our strongest call -- strongest quarter in the market, we would see inventories go up. What we're looking at now and the visibility that we see and we've scrubbed it and we think we have a clear -- we certainly have a clearer picture in the last couple of weeks, is that we would expect that those inventories would start to come down in the third quarter and by the end of the year, we'd be going out of the year, at least in our assumptions at an inventory level roughly at what we went out of 2017 at. So really, really reversing out the inventory that went into the channel last year and we'd be flushed out, and back to what Kevin said, more normalized two to three months inventory levels by the end of this year. Alvaro Lacayo : Got it, thank you. Kevin Wheeler : And just to add on to that, you have to believe hit the bottom and we certainly hope so. And we're still going to sit back and make sure that what -- we're watching our business. And as I've mentioned to the previous caller, if additional adjustments are needed, we'll aggressively go after those to continue to right-size the business, but we do believe that we've given the best outlook based on all that what Chuck had said in our visibility into the inventory and we hope this is the bottom. Alvaro Lacayo : And in terms of the cost reduction initiatives that you mentioned previously; can you maybe quantify for us how much savings you expect from the initiatives you've already taken? Charles Lauber : Yes. So for the year, it's approximately year-over-year $24 million to $25 million of savings within the SG&A category. Think of that in terms of the split roughly first half, back half equally. The back half is a little bit less and that's because we've got some investments in advertising we're going to do to -- for the fourth quarter, but that's roughly the amount. There is a little headwind on the back half as we do have some severance costs that would be associated with the headcount reductions. Operator : Thank you. And our following question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stephens. Your line is open. Robert McCarthy : Good morning, everyone. How you're doing? Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Robert McCarthy : Good. So I guess the first question is thinking through kind of I think you've guided to flat margins in China in third quarter and then 6% for the full year, you talked about some deleverage there. Could you just walk us through kind of a bridge of where you think, because I think your initial guide was kind of in the 11% range. Could you just bridge us what's deleverage, what's restructuring, what are the buckets, sales volume that get you from kind of the 11% to the 6% for the full year? Charles Lauber : Yes. So I'll just kind of take it in the big bucket. So we talked about the inventory coming down, that's a pretty big bucket. It's rather acute in the third quarter. So when we're thinking about third quarter, you have to kind of look to the first quarter to find something that's comparable which is 20% down from last year. And at that level, we've got some pretty meaningful plant inefficiencies that we were not had expected before that gets us through the third quarter. And then the fourth quarter looks quite a bit like the second quarter. So we still have some headwinds on channel inventory, but we get back to a little bit more of a normal, not normalized, but a little bit higher volume level that runs through the plant. So when you kind of take all the buckets together, first quarter -- I'm sorry, second quarter just gets hit fairly hard by the lower volume. Robert McCarthy : Okay. And then maybe as a follow-up, how are you thinking about perhaps your balance sheet right now in terms of M&A, maybe considering, I mean obviously it looks like today there has been an anticipation of this cut given how your stock has traded intraday. But nevertheless, you're in a bit of the fight of a lifetime in terms of what's going on in China and the organic growth story. If you see a material market break with your stock, do you think given the fact that you've got a balance sheet that's may be sub-optimal from a cash redeployment standpoint, you would consider being very aggressive in terms of share buyback. If you think about it, you might be able to get your business at a substantial discount over the next 12 months as you kind of right-size restructure this business. How do you think about that in this environment? Kevin Wheeler : Well, I would just back to China, I mean the China change that we have is we think we'll work through the inventories by the end of the year. Once we get through that, we would expect a bit more normalized operating performance. So we certainly have seen changes in China and we're going to work through them by the end of the year. So thinking of our balance sheet, we're going to buy back $300 million of shares or at least we're projected to buy back $300 million of shares this year. So we're going to continue to do that. So we're on track to repurchase more than we did last year. Charles Lauber : To add on to that about China a little bit. Certainly, we are in a challenging environment. I won't categorize it a fight of a lifetime. We have an excellent management team that's going to work our way through these challenging times and we'll come out the other end as a strong organization. Positively, we have some great mid-price point products that are gaining share. Our share in Q2 was higher than Q1. So there is -- and there has been Kevin Wheeler : No meaningful trading down, there has been really no noticeable effect to our brand. And as we look out, we still look at China as a long-term growth part of our business. We won't want to be any other place than China when it comes to the growth. And when you look at it, the urbanization, I would still believe it has a long runway, the move into the middle class. So yes, we have some short-term challenges here. We have the team in place. We're making the moves we believe are the right moves in the current environment and we'll continue to do that. We know how to do that. And then as we come out the other side, the company will be stronger. We'll probably be a bit leaner and we'll be in position to take advantage of one of the best growth markets in the world. So it's important for us to do the things we're doing. But again, I believe our management team has it under control and we have a line of sight of what we're going to do to manage our way through this challenging environment. Robert McCarthy : Last question. Given what you see in the U.S. in terms of slightly negative organic growth and obviously this could just be just timing and price increases and still, you still feel good about the fundamental long-term outlook for U.S. and obviously that could impact obviously margins because you got great margins there, you have for some time and that's I've been skeptical of it, you've been -- you've delivered, which has been great. But do you see anything on the horizon that would give you pause that the market is changing or the cycle is changing where you think that the organic growth there is going to be more challenging going forward than it has been over the past several years where you've had very solid stable organic growth in North America? Charles Lauber : Yes. The answer to your question first, we still believe there is stable organic growth there. What's going on in our opinion and what we believe is, if you look at the market through May residential water heaters; the shipments in the industry were down about a 150,000 units. And as we look at our June sales in our sales when we look out, we think it's going to be down another 100,000 units. And as we look at it, there has certainly been an impact of a wet spring that's limited new construction. There continues to be a labor shortage with most of the builders and so forth. So as we go forward, the reason we have a decline is we just don't think with the labor shortages out there that the industry can make up the full 250,000 units. We think it's going to be somewhere in the 150,000 range. But what's important, and we said in our opening comments, we still see a very stable replacement market. And again, as we go forward, we have no change to our North American growth pattern. Water heaters are at 4%. We believe a lot more will continue to grow at that 8% to 10% range. So no, that was a long answer, but no, the answer is, we feel really good about North America. We think this is just some weather-related issues. And hopefully as the labor shortages in the market start to become less that the new construction will continue to move forward. So, no change in our outlook on either of our North American businesses. Robert McCarthy : Well gentlemen, good luck. The market seems to be believing you today. Kevin Wheeler : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Matt Summerville : Thanks. Couple of questions. Why do you think it's taking either the channel or A. O. Smith so long to react to the inventory situation in China? Kevin Wheeler : We've had prolonged slowdown in China. So it's been a number of quarters that we've been talking about the elevated level and the prolonged slowdown. June typically is a favorable month for the appliance channel. It's a high promotion month. I think there is some disappointment perhaps in June, maybe wasn't as high as what expectations were in the customer base. And as we came out of June and the prolonged -- the prolonged level of what the downturn is, I believe our customers just said, it's time to de-lever a bit. So I would say those data points, and you know last year we went into Q4 with pretty high inventory levels and wanted and expected that the channel would flush those out and it was a little disappointing. So when they start looking -- when our customers start looking back historically and look at the data points of last fourth quarter June and maybe what they see in front of them, they've decided to take action in the third quarter. Matt Summerville : So maybe if you can flush out in Q2 then and what your expectation is for the year between the water heater business, the water treatment business and air purification in China. Can you give a little bit more granularity as to actual performance in Q2 and full year expectation for those three buckets? Kevin Wheeler : Well, let me kind of carve out water heating and water treatment. So water treatment, for the quarter, water treatment was down about 12%, largely channel flushing or you know reduction of the channel inventory impacted. When we look at our water treatment business over the course of the year, we would expect to be down about 12% on our sales. If you look at kind of the consumer demand, the customer demand and what we're seeing on sell-out, it's probably up about 8% to 10%. So we're seeing a little bit positive there. The water heater, you got to kind of look at the mix, right. So we've introduced some mid-range priced products. We've introduced new products. We do have headwind on the water heater side. Our outlook for the back half of the year is to be similar to the first half of the year as far as consumer demand. We see -- we saw last year 2018 slightly downtick on consumer demand from 2017. But we've seen the first half of 2018 be fairly similar to last year and that's what we're assuming for the rest of the year. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird. Your line is open. Mike Halloran : Hey, good morning, everyone. So just continuing on that, there's a lot of inventory machinations [ph], as well as just the timing of when you guys are manufacturing this year versus last year. Performance relative to the market in the core China product categories, how do you think that's track lately? And what's the assumption moving forward from here? Kevin Wheeler : Knowing that the best tracking for us is market share. And so, if you look at our product categories, we have -- we started the year at a couple of points down overall, but as we go forward, our market share in Q2 exceeded Q1. We're getting really good acceptance of our new products, mid-price point products in the market. So -- and as far as the premium channel is continuing to hold, it's down a couple of points overall, the channel, but the overall it's holding. So as we go forward, we believe we're getting our fair share and we're continuing to gain momentum on the online side of the business as well as with our offline. So overall, we think we're getting our fair share and we look for a back half on a sellout perspective, not so much as sell-in because that's the inventory side of it. We feel we'll continue to get our fair share and possibly move our market share up in couple of categories that we were down a point or so. Mike Halloran : So Kevin, was that commentary exclusive to the water heater business or did that include treatment as well? Kevin Wheeler : It includes both. It includes both. As we talk, we have so many different categories, but the three main categories that Chuck outlined, I feel comfortable that we'll be getting our fair share in all three of those categories. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open. Jeff Hammond : Good morning. Can you just talk about market share, how your market share is holding in North America on the res, commercial water heater side? And then just how are things progressing relative to plan within North America water treatment?<br><br>**Kevin Wheeler**: Well, let me take the North America water heater residential share question. We had a very good Q2. And our market share on all of our key categories, particularly residential and commercial were back in line with our 2018 levels, actually slightly up.<br><br>So we've -- we had a soft first quarter and we recovered in the second quarter and we don't see any reason that's going to change. On the water treatment front, we've -- Chuck will outline, but we've had a very good Q2. <br><br>**Charles Lauber**: Yes. We talked on the last call that we expect to be incrementally better in Q2 versus Q1 and that's -- that is happening. So the business is performing well.<br><br>For the quarter, our sales were about $37 million, $14 million of that again was Water-Right, which is integrating well as Kevin -- it's on track as Kevin mentioned. So the kind of the customer acquisition in core growth is low-teens for us on the rest of the business. Operating margins were high-single digits for the quarter. So we're pleased with the way water treatment North America is progressing. Jeff Hammond : Okay. And then just on China, can you give us kind of early read or feedback you're getting on this new price point product and when do you think it will start to really gain traction? Thanks. Kevin Wheeler : Well, the mid-price point products have gone in, in various phases; it does take time to certify. And I think what we've mentioned in the past, we just don't take a product and discount it and make it a bit price point. We will actually design the product for the right category with the right cost structure. So as you go across our residential water heating, it's continuing to do well and we're gaining share on the online side of the business. Gas tankless, we still have a bit of work to do to introduce a few new products to fill those gaps and those will happen by the second half of the year. And our water treatment continues to do well. So overall, the acceptance has been good. But more importantly, the products have been designed for the right price points with the right cost structure so that we could maintain margins. So overall, we've been accepted well. And we look at introducing just a few more to balance out our product portfolio in each of those categories. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is open. David MacGregor : Yes, good morning, everyone. Just while we're on the topic of the medium price point, can you give us some sense of what the mix is now in terms of premium versus mid-price point and where you think that might be a year from now? Charles Lauber : Yes. Right now, we're probably got a little heavier mix of the mid-price point as we work through the back half of the year. A lot of those products are new. As Kevin said, they're pretty well accepted. The channel -- as they work down the channel inventory, there is product that is not as new. So those price points are different. But we would expect this to normalize next year, more normalized next year. And we're always -- as we grow e-commerce and as we grow the mid-to-mid-price point product, it will be slightly less margin, but we would expect this to normalize. We get just pressure on our margins in Q3, particularly because the lower volume. So it's from gross margin to be a little pressure on us. David MacGregor : So when you say normalized, just from a proportional standpoint are we talking 50-50 or I'm just trying to get some sense of proportion? Charles Lauber : Off the top of our head, I don't have that information. I'll be more than happy to dig into it and get it for you. But there is -- what I would tell you it's going to change by product category. And so what we're going to have to -- it's a great question, we will be sure to take a note of that and make sure that we get back to you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Nick [ph] with William Blair. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning, guys. I was hoping to ask about a cash repatriation and maybe get a sense for how much of this currently disclosed cash number is in the U.S. and outside the U.S. and if you repatriated any cash from China in the first half or in the quarter? Kevin Wheeler : Yes, we have, we've repatriated. We did it in and out of China about $150 million or $150 million for the first half of the year. So all of the cash that we mentioned is offshore, just to be clear on that. We did in and out of $150 million out of China and we've repatriated about $85 million of that back to the U.S. Unidentified Analyst : So you said the $150 million is from China and the $85 million is back in the U.S.? Kevin Wheeler : Back to the U.S., yes. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks for that. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David MacGregor : Yes. Thanks for taking the follow-up. It's two quarters a row I've been cut off. I guess I'm not going to get a Christmas card. Kevin Wheeler : It's is not intentional. Sorry. David MacGregor : I'd just like [indiscernible] we got here, I guess there was an earlier question about raw materials and price cost, and you noted that raw material prices were still high or maybe up year-over-year and obviously spot market has been coming down, you guys are contract buyers, I understand that part. But one would think that by now you're starting to see some leakage on the indirect component as well as maybe some supplemental spot purchases. So I guess the question is, notwithstanding, I know the mills have sent out letters asking for price increases a few weeks back, but when do we start seeing the benefit of lower steel prices coming through? Do we see some here in the third quarter or just can you help us with the timing? Charles Lauber : Yes. We see a lag in 90 to 120 days to what you're kind of seeing in the marketplace. So we would expect to see a little bit of that benefit come through in the third and fourth quarter. David MacGregor : Okay. Is there any way to quantify that for us or think about it quantitatively? Kevin Wheeler : No, we'll just kind of go from the benchmark, which is quarter-over-quarter improvement. David MacGregor : Okay. Okay, that's good. And then it's something we picked up on our checks was just talk of moving to kind of a national pricing model. And people are in distribution I guess now that distributors are acting more on a national scale, they're pressing for more of a national price as opposed to the disparities where I guess the southern markets were usually a discount to the northern markets. How does that play out for you in terms of price realization? Do your ASPs move up or down as you kind of normalize to a national level and how does the timing also play out? Kevin Wheeler : Matt, pricing we're the only public company, okay? And so we just do not get into much detail on pricing with regards to strategy implement or expected implementation those type of things. And so, I just would prefer to keep that as kind of our policy. And again, what we've demonstrated over the years is being able to at the appropriate time, given time to address cost and inflation issues going forward. And I'm just going to leave it at that. Operator : Thank you. And we have another follow-up from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Matt Summerville : Thanks. A couple of follow-ups; first, can you talk about what you're doing in the wholesale channel with respect to water treatment. I know when you launched in the Lowe's, you threw a revenue target out there. Do you have a revenue target for this wholesale initiative if you will? Kevin Wheeler : What we have in for other revenue target for -- we just launched into that. We want -- it's right aligned with our channel strategy. So we're excited to have product into the wholesale market effective in May. What we will kind of talk about is because of our channel strategy, we are looking at growing water treatment year-over-year in that 10% to 15% range. So if you look at our whole portfolio of businesses, not guiding just for water -- wholesale, but we would look to grow year-over-year in that 10% to 15% range throughout kind of our, all of our channels. Matt Summerville : If you aggregate your global water treatment business, what's your revenue objective for 2019, I believe that's a number you've shared in the past? Kevin Wheeler : Yes. It's about 440 to 450. Matt Summerville : Okay. And then lastly just with respect to Lochinvar on the boiler side of the business, can you talk about what you saw in Q2 and maybe what gives you a little bit of pause with the 7% growth target versus the 8% to 10% sort of longer term objective you have there? Kevin Wheeler : Yes, that's -- let me just start with that. The backlog in the activity in the market remains -- it remains pretty active. But what I was talking about the wet weather and the labor shortages on the residential side of our business, water heating side, it's also spilling over into the boiler side and commercial side of the Lochinvar business. So the business remains solid. It's just -- we just don't think because of the wet weather and the labor shortages on either our water heater or our boiler side of the business that we'll be able to make up the complete ground in the second half of the year. So that's why we brought it down a bit to 7%. But the market is active and our coating is active. So the overall business is in -- it continues to move forward in the U.S. Operator : Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Patricia Ackerman for closing remarks. Patricia Ackerman : Thank you for joining us on our call today. We will participate in several conferences in the third quarter. We will attend the Oppenheimer Conference in Chicago on August 15th, the Longbow Conference in New York on August 21st, and the Davidson Conference in Chicago on September 18th. Enjoy your day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

I would now like to hand the conference to your speaker today, Patricia Ackerman. Ma'am, please go ahead. Patricia Ackerman : Thank you, Victor. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2019 results conference call. With me participating in the call are Kevin Wheeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning's press release. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Kevin, who will begin our prepared remarks on Slide 3. Kevin Wheeler : Thank you, Pat, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'm pleased to review several items regarding our third quarter performance. Sales in our North America segment increased 6%, and operating margin performance in North America improved approximately 200 basis points over last year. Our North America water heater and boiler operations continue to perform well. I'm particularly pleased with our commercial water heater performance, where we continue to outperform the market. Productivity within North America water treatment, manufacturing and the effectiveness of our direct-to-consumer channel continued to improve, and Water-Right's performance is right on track with our expectations.  We announced a 9% increase to our quarterly dividend rate in early October to $0.24 per share, which represents a 5-year CAGR of 24%. In China, while the third quarter came in where we expected, we are disappointed to see further weakness in demand and expect that to continue in Q4. Moving to Slide 4 please. As weakness in our end markets in China persist, we have implemented further cost reduction actions. Over the course of the last 10 months into Q1 2020, we are targeting a 20% reduction in headcount from December 2018 levels. We continue to review and rationalize brand building and advertising spend, selling expenses, travel costs and other SG&A spend. By the end of the year, on a net basis, we will close over 700 in non-productive stores. We are continuing our aggressive cost reduction programs in both manufacturing processes and product costs, and we'll continue to work with our distribution customers on programs to reduce their inventory.  Total annualized savings as a result of these actions is estimated to be $38 million to $40 million, of which approximately $28 million will be realized in 2019.  I will now turn over the call to Chuck, who will review our third quarter results in more detail. Chuck? Charles Lauber : Thank you, Kevin. Sales for the third quarter of $728 million were 3% lower than the same quarter in 2018. Earnings in the third quarter of $87 million declined 17% from the third quarter in 2018, and third quarter earnings per share declined 13% to $0.53. Sales in our North America segment of $515 million increased 6% compared with the third quarter of 2018. Higher water heating, heating, heater and boiler volumes in the U.S. were supplemented by $16 million in sales in our recently acquired Water-Right business. Rest of the world segment sales of $220 million declined 20% compared with the same quarter in 2018. China sales declined 20% in local currency, primarily related to weak consumer demand and previously disclosed channel inventory levels. The weaker Chinese currency unfavorably impacted translated sales by approximately $6 million. India sales grew at 9% in local currency compared with the same period in 2018. On Slide 6, North America segment earnings of $122 million were 15% higher than segment earnings in the same quarter in 2018, driven by the favorable impact to profits from higher U.S. water heater and boiler volumes as well as lower steel costs, improvement in the profitability of Water-Right sales without Water-Right and incremental profit from Water-Right. As a result, third quarter 2019 segment margin of 23.6% improved from 21.7% achieved in the same period last year.  Rest of the world earnings of $4 million declined significantly compared with to third quarter 2018. The unfavorable impact to profits from lower China sales and a higher mix of mid-price products, which have lower margins, more than offset the benefit to profits from lower SG&A expenses in that region. As a result of these factors, segment margins declined to 1.9% compared with 14.3% in the same quarter of 2018. Our corporate expenses of $10 million were lower in the current quarter compared to the third quarter last year, primarily due to incentive-based compensation. Interest costs were higher in the third quarter than a year ago due to higher debt levels associated with the acquisition of Water-Right in April. For the year, we expect interest expense to be approximately $11 million.  Cash provided by operations of $280 million during the first 9 months of 2019 was lower than $289 million in the same period of 2018 as a result of lower earnings, which were partially offset by a lower investment in working capital compared to a year ago.  Our liquidity and balance sheet remain strong. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 16% at the end of the third quarter. We have cash balances totaling $514 million located offshore, and our net cash position is $195 million at the end of September.  During the first 9 months of 2019, we repurchased approximately 4.9 million shares of common stock for a total of $230 million. Approximately 4.1 million shares remained on our existing repurchase authority at the end of September. On Slide 9, we expect our cash flow from operations in 2019 to be approximately $400 million compared with $450 million in 2018, primarily due to lower earnings. Our 2019 capital spending plans are approximately $80 million, and depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $75 million in 2019. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $46 million in 2019, essentially the same as last year. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 22% in 2019. We expect to purchase our shares in the amount of approximately $300 million in 2019, and we expect average diluted outstanding shares in 2019 to be approximately 167 million. On Slide 10, we continue to see headwinds in our markets in China. The fourth quarter is typically the strongest consumer demand quarter of the year. However, with continued weak year-over-year consumer demand and persistently high channel inventory levels, we are forecasting the fourth quarter in China to be similar on the top line and operating profit line to the third quarter of 2019. As a result, we revised our 2019 EPS guidance to a range of between $2.25 and $2.28 per share, a 13% decline at the midpoint compared with last year.  I will now turn the call to Kevin, who will summarize our guidance and business assumptions for 2019, beginning on Slide 11. Kevin Wheeler : Okay. Thank you, Chuck. Our outlook for 2019 includes the following assumptions. First, let me start with China. We saw year-over-year consumer demand in the third quarter decline compared with first half of the year and project full year sales to be down approximately 19% in local currency terms. Combined with our expected 4 points of unfavorable currency translation, our 2019 China sales projection is a decline of approximately 23%. Our forecast for the Chinese currency in Q4 substantially levels with where it is today.  The sales decline of 19% in local currency is roughly equally attributable to weaker consumer demand and the change in China inventory year-over-year based on our projections of year-end channel inventories. Total channel inventory remained relatively unchanged from the second quarter at approximately four months. Historically, channel inventory increases in Q3 as it did in 2018 as the market prepares for the higher fourth quarter sales. This year, the channel did not experience a third quarter inventory increase. While we expect that consumer demand will be higher than other quarters of the year as the fourth quarter is typically a period of high promotion and buying in China, our assumption is the fourth quarter demand will run at a year-over-year decline similar to what we saw in the third quarter. We project that the channel inventory will be reduced nearly 1 month. We expect that we would exit the year with channel inventory levels remaining above normal. Normal is in the 2- to 3-month range.  In the U.S., we project residential water heater industry volumes will be down 100,000 to 150,000 units in 2019. Commercial industry water heater volumes are expected to be up 4% to 5%, primarily driven by growth in the light-service electric models.  Based on boiler sales growth of 5% year-to-date, we expect our North America boiler sales to grow approximately 5% for the full year. We project India water heater EBIT will be positive in 2019, and we expect India will achieve breakeven in 2020.  Please advance to Slide 12. We project revenue will decline by approximately 5% for the year in U.S. dollars and 3.5% in local currency. We see sales growth in North America with our water heater, boiler and water treatment products collectively expected to grow approximately 4% in 2019, including $40 million to $45 million in Water-Right sales. EPS is projected to be $2.25 and $2.28. We expect North America segment margin to be between 23.5% to 23.75% and Rest of World segment margins to be approximately 4.25%.  We are pleased with how our North America segment is performing, particularly on the water heater side on lower industry volumes. We see long-term growth drivers in water treatment solutions and boilers across North America.  In the near term, the China economy remains weak, and we have taken further action to rightsize the business while continuing to invest in innovation. We have a strong brand, broad product offering in our key product categories, broad distribution and a reputation for quality and innovation. Over time, we are well positioned to maximize favorable demographics in both China and India to enhance shareholder value.  Our replacement markets remain stable, which we believe represents approximately 85% of North America water heater and boiler volumes. We have strong cash flow and balance sheet, providing an opportunity to continue to invest in ourselves, acquisitions and return cash to shareholders.  That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now available for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc. Jeffrey Hammond : Just on China, I guess, just a lower expectation, your margin top line. Are you seeing that as more aggressive destock or weaker consumer demand? And then just on inventory, should we expect kind of first half '20 to still be under margin pressure as you guys continue to destock? And when do you think that kind of wraps up and gets back to normal? Charles Lauber : Yes. This is Chuck. So when we look at kind of the change from our last guidance, what we really have seen is the consumer demand, our sellout, down a bit, which declined since -- it was kind of running flat year-over-year. That was our assumption. So we've seen a weaker decline in consumer demand of about 5% to 8%. So what that did is it pushed back a little bit our inventory reduction that we were expecting at the end of Q3. The good news is inventory did not go up. Typically at the end of Q3, inventories would go up in that 12% to 15% range. This year, it remained flat. So even last year, the inventories went up at that low end of that range. So as we go up the back half of the year, we're looking at a bit of a weaker Q4 based upon that weaker consumer demand and the needs that inventories are still going to be needing -- we still expect inventories to come down by about a month, which is going to cost a headwind. So to your question going out at the end of the year, we're looking at going out at the end of the year somewhere around three months. And as Kevin mentioned, typically, it's in that two to three month range that we would have this channel inventory. So we do have a bit of a headwind heading into next year. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay. And I think that you said commercial -- North America commercial sounds better and was good in the quarter. Can you just give us the water treatment core growth and just talk about, I guess, qualitatively at least, what you saw in residential water heaters? Kevin Wheeler : Well, I'll take the residential water heater side of it. First, in Q3, we expected residential to bounce back a little bit stronger than it did. And although it was positive, not nearly where we expected it to be at the end based on -- through August, the industry was down 194,000. We look at our September. We don't see much more of an improvement once we get that data coming out of -- from our industry.  So overall, we took the industry down a 50,000 compared to what we did in Q -- on our 2Q -- Q2 call. And simply, we just don't think in Q4, we can make up that delta. And so -- but when you look at it, again, you'll remember there's 120 million households out there, and we estimate somewhere in those households is about 132 million water heaters. And so 100,000, 150,000 units, there can be some variability there from year to year. We're coming off of 2 straight years of over 4% growth. This one looks like it's going to be down in the 1.5% range. So overall, we feel pretty good about our water heater business. We don't see -- we see going forward our replacement market remaining strong. So overall, the residential business, slight down year, but there is some variations from year to year. Charles Lauber : And on water treatments, on the water treatment side, the North America water treatment, that is, last year, we had a bit of a tough comp because we had some ramp-up going on with one of our major customers. But if you look at the base business, we grew at about 9% for the quarter. So the base business is growing nicely like the back half of the trajectory on growth as well as continuing to look at improvements in operations. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Saree Boroditsky from Jefferies. Saree Boroditsky : I appreciate the commentary on North America but wanted to see if you could dig into the results a little bit more. You talked about a 4% price increase back in August. How has this been received by the market? And are you seeing some more price increases from competitors? Or just in general, any changes in the competitive dynamic? Kevin Wheeler : We're going to be very consistent here since we're the only public company. What I will say is we announced and implemented a 4% increase as stated in August, and that's been implemented. Saree Boroditsky : Okay. And then based on the 20% total headcount reduction in China, can you just confirm if that would be another 5% reduction in the fourth quarter? And maybe provide some color on where those headcount reductions are occurring, if you feel like the business will be rightsized for the 2020 market conditions at this point. Charles Lauber : Yes. Saree, this is Chuck. So we've increased that percentage from 15% to 20% from the last quarter. We did that based on the continued weakness in consumer demand. We'll look at whether that would be increased as we go forward. There will be some of that, that goes into Q1. It's going to be over the course of probably the next 2 quarters that we'll see that come out. The areas impacted, it's been largely across the board. We have not -- what we've been very careful to do is maintain our R&D and engineering capabilities and maintain that investment so that we can continue to lead with innovative products. So we have not leaned on those types of headcount reductions, but it's been pretty much across the board. Kevin Wheeler : Yes. And a little color to that. What's important for us is we're going forward in making the adjustments for the current environment that we're in, that the business overall, whether it be in operations, manufacturing, engineering, we're still in position when the economy turns that we can ramp up quickly. So it's a very strategic way that we're doing it. And we know the economy is going to come back. We just -- we don't know exactly when, and we want to position our cost structure to the environment but also the ability for us to ramp up when the economy comes back and be able to service our customers at the appropriate level. So it's a balance here, and we're looking at it from all sides. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Mike Halloran from Baird. Michael Halloran : So just some thoughts on China here from a competitive dynamic, market share perspective. Last couple of quarters, you've given some good detail about how you think you're tracking versus the market, both at the high end as well as kind of overall. Maybe you can just give us an update there and then specifically talk about how you think you're performing versus the market as well as competitive situation. Kevin Wheeler : Yes. This is Kevin. Let's just talk Q3, because we look at this quarter by quarter, and it does vary. In Q3, our gas tankless shares, we held our share. And on wall hung electric and water treatment, we were down slightly, about 200 basis points. On the water heater electric side of it, we know exactly where those share declined. We've seen a couple regions. We'll take some action there. And you got to remember, in Q2, we also talked about that we had improved market share in Q2. So we gave a little bit back. But again, there is variation from quarter-to-quarter. We don't see any issues there. We expect to recover our share over time. And we have the products, the distributions to handle that.  With regards to competition, certainly, every -- China has been a competitive market for the past 20 years. We have people that are -- have entered into our space on the premium side, and we have to compete, and we're competing on a regular basis. Now again, we're in a market that's a little bit down. And so it's -- we have some mid-price point products that have done fairly well, and we have some premium products that continue to provide value to consumers. But there's a balance there. So overall, when you step back, our share is continuing to be in line with our expectations. And you'll tend to see a little bit of up and down quarter-to-quarter. Charles Lauber : And I think, Mike, on your comments or your question about high end of the market, the water treatment side, when we look at this year-to-date compared to 2018, we've seen it pretty stable. We haven't seen any decline, consistent with what I think we've talked about in the other quarters within the water heating side, both gas and electric. We saw the high end come down a couple of hundred basis points as far as the total market, percentage of market. Michael Halloran : Okay. That makes sense there. And then the margins in the fourth quarter, I think, Chuck, you said about consistent with the third quarter. I think the math I ran was closer to breakeven. Just to confirm that one way or another. And then more importantly, just maybe talk about some of the puts and takes going into the fourth quarter to get to that margin profile. How much of this is just really volume deleverage versus maybe including severance or some of these other one-off kind of cost items? Any kind of color on the puts and takes and factors there would be helpful as well. Charles Lauber : Yes. So the Q4 volume, it's largely volume and -- hold on a second here. Yes. It's largely volume, Mike. The puts and takes compared to last year, think of it in terms of 50% channel inventory carve out that's going to hurt our volume, and the other 50% of it being part of just lower consumer demand. The puts and takes on the headcount reduction and those other costs, I mean, we still have some costs going into headcount reduction and severance in Q4, although those benefits are higher than the cost that we've incurred. We've got a little bit of -- the plant's inefficiencies that occurred in the third -- or inefficiencies that occurred at the low end of that rate also. So those two kind of offset each other. But the risks on kind of the Q4 number probably relate more along consumer demand than what happens to channel inventory because we're forecasting channel inventory to come down by about a month. And back to your question on Q4. Yes, we think of it as being pretty much a breakeven quarter for the fourth of the quarter in China -- the fourth quarter in China to be pretty much breakeven. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow. David MacGregor : I wanted to start off by, while we're on China, parsing out, if we can, sort of the difference between what you might been seeing in your mid-price point product versus your premium price point product. And if we're able to talk about that four months of surplus inventory, are you able to parse out how many months are you in terms of just if we isolate the premium? Because it seems like the mid-price point is probably turning relatively well given where the markets migrated and maybe the concentration that might be in premium. So if it's four months on the aggregate inventory, what would it be on the premium? Charles Lauber : Yes. I mean I'll say that right now, in Q3 and Q4, what we're seeing as sell into the channel is more heavily weighted towards the mid-price, lower-margin product. The channel does have more of the higher price product that's taking longer to move in this sort of an environment. To parse it out and split it, we don't have that kind of clarity exactly right now. It looks like we see it changing over time because we know that we're selling mostly, and that's why our margins are lower in these two quarters, we're selling a larger percentage of mid-price product with lower margins. As far as the months, so we've got about four months of inventory, and I want to help define that a little bit. So four months, think of it in terms of the guidance we gave, so down 23% from last year. And we're thinking of four months as you take that number and divide it by 12, and that's roughly the number of dollars we kind of have in the inventory. So I wanted to frame it a bit because we're not looking at it as the next three months sellout. We're kind of looking at it as the 12-month average and working to get that down. So as the total year volume goes down, that's where we got a little bit more aggressive. But it's about four months looking to go to about three months by the end of the year. David MacGregor : Okay. And then, I guess, as a follow-up, just maybe talk about the boiler business. And I guess you've reduced guidance twice so far this year. Can you just talk about performance in the third quarter with maybe a little bit more granularity? And also, I guess, any color you can provide in terms of just the backlog dynamics? Are you seeing backlogs up or down the boiler business? And just what does quoting activity look like in the boiler business? Kevin Wheeler : Yes. The boiler business, it's kind of a mixed message I'm going to send here. The activity, bidding and quoting has been very active, and it's been that way throughout the year. It actually spilled in from last year, and we're getting a lot of activity there much more than -- it actually is turning into orders right now where we're seeing more and more jobs being delayed or postponed, and we can make some speculation around labor shortage and things of that nature. But when you look at it, the 5% that we're forecasting, we're gaining share in most of our categories that we compete in. But -- and we have this backlog of quoting that just has been released as we expected it. The good news is we do expect it to be released over time, but there is just a kind of a delay between -- much further delay between quoting and actually turning into orders than we've seen in the past. But overall, the commercial business seems to be good, and we're getting our fair share of the jobs that are being turned into orders. And we look for that to carry over into next year. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Robert McCarthy from Stephens. Robert McCarthy : Can you hear me? Kevin Wheeler : We can, Robert. Charles Lauber : Yes. We can. Robert McCarthy : I guess one thing, thinking about China, I mean, one thing we can say -- and I'm not trying to be impolitic, but clearly, there is a bit of a visibility issue here, understandably, with respect to the channel and what's occurring just given the fact that you've taken down your assumptions consistently and then obviously, certainly 2Q versus 3Q. But I think next year is the year of the rat as opposed to the pig, and New Year starts on the 25th. But are you going to be in a position to really guide with any granularity or visibility or conviction when you report fourth quarter for China given just the dynamic nature of what we're seeing right now? Kevin Wheeler : Well, let me take that. I believe I'm asked more than once, are we at the bottom? And we kind of said, hey, we hope so. And -- but we really don't know. The data is a little bit unclear. And what we're going to look at is we're coming off a difficult Q3. Consumer demand was down as we talked about. We're going to look at Q4, and that's going to give us kind of the vision into 2020. But it's one of these markets that we have to take month by month, quarter by quarter. And hopefully, we get to Q4, maybe there is a Phase 1 of the China agreement that may help going into 2020. But we don't know. What we do know is that we're trying to give you our best view based on the data we have today, and Q4 is going to be a critical quarter as we set up going into 2020. And we're in the middle of our planning process right now, but we just need to see how Q4 plays out. Robert McCarthy : All right. And then moving on to kind of back to North America. And obviously, I think there is some limits to what you want to talk about given competitive dynamics or whatnot. But just in terms of the granularity, I mean, is there anything you could say about kind of the relative growth rates in the near term for tank versus tankless? And have you seen a pronounced shift there given the fact that particularly some applications for tankless but the all-in cost coming down, there seems to be, at the margin, more of a preference for it. And this, historically, over the last couple of years, there's been a better growth rate in association with it. What can you give us? Because clearly, underneath the hood, we are seeing a little bit of a different growth rate for North America. And I'll just highlight the fact that you did miss consensus numbers for third quarter, and you did take down some of the assumptions for fourth quarter. So any kind of visibility as to -- if there's a potential sea change going on there in the fourth quarter would be helpful in terms of granularity. Kevin Wheeler : Let me try to take some of that. As far as sea change, no. But we don't see a sea change. If you look at the tankless side of the business, it's growing certainly faster than the tank type. That delta has changed quite substantially. We're down about 1.6% on tank, and tankless is up maybe in the 3.5% range. So there is -- if anything, there's a contraction between the 2. And -- so there's no meaningful change. Again, you look at this quarter-to-quarter, I've been in this industry 30 years, and I -- it's difficult to predict the swings because quite frankly, when you look at it, a couple hundred thousand, 150,000 or 100,000 units, that's a relatively small number when you bake it into the millions that we sell. So what I'll come back to is we believe our North American tank replacement market remains solid. We are still a participant in the gas tankless business and have a low double-digit share that we're continuing to improve. We're going to be filling gaps in that category, the tankless category, in 2020. So no changes. Our distributors seems to feel fairly confident going into the quarter, into next year. So overall, that was a long way to say that it's pretty much status quo what has been from the beginning of the year. Charles Lauber : And Rob, I want to come back to China real quick here and mention about visibility into the channel inventory in China. We have pretty -- we think we have good visibility into the channel inventory. What we're a little bit struggling with is sellout and consumer demand. That's really the change in our estimate quarter-over-quarter. And just remembering that we don't control the channel inventory. It's our customers inventory. We certainly work with them to try to help them move it through the channel. We have promotion programs and work with them closely. But the delta and variable from the last outlook is really the step down in consumer demand. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow. David MacGregor : I just wanted to ask about you filed an 8-K back earlier in October just looking at amendments to the articles of incorporation. And I was just wondering if you could just talk about the motivation for incorporating these various defensive measures. Patricia Ackerman : If I may? Kevin Wheeler : Sure. Patricia Ackerman : David, this is Pat. The amendment was basically to bring our charter and bylaws up to our peers and current standard. So it was really just some benchmarking that we had done and looked at what best practices for shareholder proposals and for director nominee. So it really was benchmarking and best practices that drove the amendment. David MacGregor : Got it. And then just a follow-up question. I asked you last quarter about the -- sort of the split between mid-price point and premium price point in China. And you said you'd get back to us with that. So just wondering if we could follow up with that question again and give us a better sense of proportion in the Chinese business and, I guess, if there's anything you could be doing longer term to improve the contribution margin on the middle price point product other than just scale. Charles Lauber : Yes. So this is Chuck. So we don't necessarily have granularity into the change of mid-price points. We have introduced many more products -- not many more products, we introduced more products in the RMB 3,000 to RMB 5,000 range, which, like we said before, the contribution margin isn't as high as the contribution margin in the high end of the market. But we are working on cost reduction programs like we always do. We have cost reduction programs to lower product cost as well as improve production -- productivity and process improvement. So we continue to work on that. Right now, it's just heavier mix towards the, what I'll call, the high end of the mid-price products because of the fact that the channel has more higher end products in it today than it does mid-price. But those newer models are really well received in the marketplace right now. And our customers continue to want to introduce those, at the same time, work diligently to, over time, take down the channel inventory and some of the higher-priced models that are in the market. Operator : And we have a follow-up from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc. Jeffrey Hammond : Just on the -- there's been the recent news article about Haier entering the North America water heater market and building a plant. Can you just speak -- I mean, clearly, the market's pretty rational, few players, good returns. Just what are you seeing out there? And what are your expectations from that new entrant? Kevin Wheeler : What I can tell you is what's been publicly announced is that they are going to -- they've indicate an announcement they're going to enter the electric water heater market and that they have investment in South Carolina of about $60 million. We have not seen any product in the market, and we don't know quite frankly much more than what they published. What I would -- now what I would tell you is that regardless, we always have competition. And A.O. Smith has a long-standing relationship with customers. We have the broadest portfolio of products in the market, technology, high service levels. And we have long-term relationships with -- and meeting market share. So at the end, there'll be a -- it looks like another competitor with a partial [one]. And if and when that starts to materialize, they're talking about next year, Q4. We'll deal with it as we have with all of our other competitors. So that's -- there's not much to say other than what you've read. And I think what we bring as value in our market share and our broad products of both residential, commercial, tankless and so forth that we're in good position to continue to move forward and be successful in this -- in our markets. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay. Great. And then just back to the water treatment. Chuck, was the 9% that -- did that exclude that large customer? Or that would've included that tough comp? Charles Lauber : Yes. That excluded the load-in of ramp-up of the large customer because we had an unusually high ramp-up of a customer. So the 9%, we view as more as kind of the baseline growth of the base business. Operator : And we have a follow-up from Robert McCarthy. Robert McCarthy : Yes. No. I mean I guess a question I would have is can you give us any kind of updated embedded expectation for the relationship with Lowe's? And has anything changed there in terms of what is kind of translated into your guidance for this year and thinking about next year? Kevin Wheeler : No. Really, we can't. I -- we're not going to talk about specific customers going forward, particularly on performance. Overall, our water treatment business, as we said, continues to improve, and that's in all categories, whether it be our dealer network, our direct-to-consumer, retail and wholesale. So overall, the business is improving. We're becoming more productive. Margins are moving up, and the business is moving in the right direction as we continue to penetrate these market segments. Robert McCarthy : And then just a follow-up on the entrance of GE and Haier. I mean I guess it stands to reason though that it worked through a material price increase several years ago. It worked out. But that was in the context of, I guess, to pass an oligopoly. I mean clearly, do you think going forward, if it gets to a more competitive environment with more players, that does lead to lower return thresholds and definitely could put a cap or put some pressure on the North American margins? How do you think about trading profitability versus growth in North America going forward if the market changes? Kevin Wheeler : One, I don't think they are mutually exclusive, and we don't trade. But let's just take this from a much more macro picture, okay? And I'm not going to get into specifics regarding this potential competitor. But if you look at the investment that they're -- they've announced making $60 million, I can tell you from our perspective, we're 10x that. It takes a lot of investment, engineering and relationship, sales organizations to be a major player in this market. And we feel we're in great shape. We've invested, as I said, about $600 million in building this business over the last 60 to 70 years. And it's one that we feel good about going forward. And we think we have the pillars to -- whether it be product, manufacturing, engineering and so forth, to compete down the road. And that's what we're going to do. That's what we've done for the last 60, 70 years. And we'll continue to do that in the future. Operator : And we do have a follow-up from David. David MacGregor : We haven't talked much on this call about raw materials, and you did indicate in your prepared remarks and in your press release that it had been a positive influence on the North American margins. Can you just talk about, I guess, the extent to which that contribution could grow going forward? I mean steel markets, from a price standpoint, has come down pretty substantially. Not clear to what extent your contract versus spot exposed in the U.S., but in -- your indirect is probably coming through favorably as well. How should we think about the margin contribution from raws as we move through 4Q and into the first half of next year? Charles Lauber : Well, for Q4, we'll just talk about those steel costs are set in advance. We kind of have the 90- to 120-day lag on when we see those steel costs, whether they go up or down. So you kind of can look back and look at Q4, and it's our best cost position in Q4 on steel for 2019. So -- and keeping in mind though just on the margin side, so we do have some large retail customers that have formula pricing that also moved the other way. So while there's some margin expansion certainly opportunity when steel goes down, there's also that corresponding headwind on pricing that offsets it. So looking through the end of the year, it is our best steel position in Q4. Operator : And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Patricia for closing remarks. Patricia Ackerman : Thank you all for joining us on our call today. We will participate in several conferences over the course of the fourth quarter. The first is the Baird conference in Chicago. We will be there on November 5 and in the morning of November 6; and we will participate in the Stephens conference in Nashville on November 14. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Smith, 2019 Results Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Patricia Ackerman, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Corporate Responsibility & Sustainability and Treasurer. Please go ahead Ma'am. Patricia Ackerman : Good morning ladies and gentlemen and thank you for joining us on our 2019 results conference call. With me participating in the call are Kevin Wheeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer.  Before I begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include among others matters that we have described in this morning's press release.  In order to provide improved transparency into the operating results of our business, we provided non-GAAP measures, adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted segment earnings for 2018 that exclude the restructuring and impairment costs associated with our plant closure in Renton, Washington. Reconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and also on our website.  Also as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up return. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. I will now turn the call over to Kevin, who will begin our prepared remarks on slide four. Kevin Wheeler : Thank you, Pat, and good morning ladies and gentleman. I'm pleased to review several items regarding our 2019 performance. Sales in our North America segment increased 2% and operating margin performance in North America improved 50 basis points compared with 2018. Our North America water heater operations continue to perform well. I'm particularly pleased with our performance despite a 1% decline in residential industry volumes.  Productivity within our North American water treatment manufacturing and the effectiveness of our direct-to-consumer channel continue to improve. We expanded our North America water treatment platform with the acquisition of Water-Right and performance is right on track to our expectations.  We announced a 9% increase to our quarterly dividend rate in early October to $0.24 per share, which represents a five year CAGR of 24%. In China the fourth quarter came in where we expected, with channel inventory declining by more than one month. Channel inventory ended 2019 within the normal range of two to three months of sales.  I will now turn the call to Chuck, who will review the results in more detail on slide five. Chuck? Charles Lauber : Thank you, Kevin. Sales for the year of $3 billion were 6% lower than 2018. Adjusted earnings in 2019 of $370 million declined 18% for 2018. 2019 adjusted earnings per share of $2.22 were 15% lower than in 2018. Sales in our North America segment of $2.1 billion increased 2% compared with 2018. The acquisition of Water-Right in April added $44 million to 2019 sales. The increase in sales was primarily due to incremental sales from recently acquired Water-Right, water heating pricing actions related to steel and freight cost increases and higher sales of water treatment products which were partially offset by lower residential water heater volumes. Rest of the world segment sales of $936 million declined 20% compared with the segment sales in 2018. China sales declined 19% in local currency, primarily related to weaker end market demand, elevated channel inventory levels at the beginning of 2019, as well as a higher mix of mid-priced products. The weaker Chinese currency unfavorably impacted translated sales by approximately $39 million.  India sales grew approximately 13% in constant currency compared with the same period in 2018. On slide eight, North America segment earnings of $489 million were 4% higher than adjusted segment earnings in 2018. The favorable impact from pricing actions, lower steel costs and higher sales of water treatment products, including the acquisition were partially offset by the unfavorable impact from lower residential heater volumes. As a result segment margins of 23.5% increased 50 basis points compared with 2018.  Rest of the world earnings of $40 million declined significantly compared with 2018. The impact to profits from lower China sales and a higher mix of mid-priced products which have lower margins, more than offset the benefits to profits from lower SG&A expenses and material costs.  Weaker China currency translation negatively impacted earnings by approximately $3 million. As a result of these factors, segment margin declined significantly from 2018. Our corporate expenses were lower in 2019 compared with 2018, primarily due to lower incentive costs. Effective tax rate in 2019 of 21.6% was higher than the 20.4% rate in 2018, primarily due to differences in geographic distribution of income.  Our fourth quarter results begin on slide nine. Sales for the fourth quarter of $751 million were 8% lower than the same period in 2018. Earnings in the fourth quarter of $91 million declined 28% in the fourth quarter in 2018. Fourth quarter earnings per share declined 24% to $0.56. Sales in our North America segment of $523 million were essentially flat compared with the fourth quarter of 2018. Incremental sales was approximately $14 million from Water-Right and growth in water treatment sales were offset by lower boiler volumes, and lower contractual formula pricing based on lower steel costs, associated with a portion of the water heater sales.  Rest of the world segment sales of $234 million declined 21% compared with the same quarter in 2019. China sales declined 23% in local currency, primarily related to weak consumer demand entering the quarter with elevated channel inventory levels and a higher mix of mid-priced products. The weaker Chinese currency unfavorably impacted the translated sales by $4 million.  On slide 11, North America segment earnings of $129 million grew 1% compared with the segment earnings in the same quarter in 2018. The net favorable impact to profits from lower steel costs essentially offset the unfavorable impact to profits from the lower boiler volumes. As a result, fourth quarter 2019 segment margin of 24.5% was the same as in the fourth quarter of 2018. Rest of the world earnings of $2 million declined significantly compared with the fourth quarter of 2018. Earnings were lower primarily due to the unfavorable impact to profits from lower China sales, the higher mix of lower margin products, and charges associated with customer support programs to reduce channel inventory, along with severance and other costs in the quarter.  These unfavorable impacts to profits more than offset the benefit to properties from lower SG&A expenses and material costs. As a result of these factors, segment margins declined to 1% compared to 13.3% in the same quarter of 2018. Our corporate expenses of $12 million were higher compared with the fourth quarter 2018, primarily due to the lower interest income earned on cash as a result of lower balances. Interest costs were higher in the fourth quarter than the previous year due to higher debt levels associated with the acquisition of Water-Right in early April. Cash provided by operations of $456 million during 2019 was slightly higher than $449 million in 2018. Lower investment and working capital essentially offset lower earnings compared with 2018.  Our liquidity and balance sheet remains strong; our debt-to-capital ratio was 15% at the end of the year. We have cash balances totaling $551 million primarily located offshore, and our net cash position was $267 million at the end of 2019. During 2019 we repurchased approximately 6.1 million shares of common stock for a total of $288 million; approximately 3 million shares remain on our existing repurchase authority at the end of 2019.  We expect our cash flow from operations in 2020 to be between $475 million and $500 million, compared with $450 million in 2019, primarily due to higher earnings. Our 2020 capital spending plans are approximately $80 million and our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $85 million in 2020.  Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $50 million in 2020, higher than 2019, primarily due to lower interest income on investments and higher incentive compensation. We expect our interest expense will be $10 million in 2020 compared with $11 million in 2019. Our effective income tax rate is expected to be between 21.5% and 22% in 2020. We expect to repurchase our shares in the amount of $200 million in 2020 and we expect our diluted average outstanding shares in 2020 will be approximately $162 million.  As weakness in our end markets in China persisted, we implemented several cost reduction actions in 2019. Over the course of 2019 and through Q1 at 2020, we reduced headcount by nearly 20% from December of 2018 levels. We continue to review and rationalize brand building and advertising the spending, selling expenses and other SG&A costs. We closed over 700 non-productive stores on a net basis. We are continuing our existing, aggressive cost reduction programs in both manufacturing processes and in product costs, and we continue to evaluate our retail footprint and rationalize where we find nonproductive stores and redundancies. To that end we expect to close 1,000 net stores in 2020. Compared with 2018, total annualized savings as a result of these actions is estimated to be approximately $45 million in 2020, of which approximately $30 million was realized in 2019. We introduced our 2020 EPS guidance this morning with a range of between $2.40 and $2.50 per share, a 10% increase at the midpoint compared with last year. Our 2020 EPS guidance excludes any potential impact to our businesses from the developing coronavirus originating in China.  I will now turn the call Kevin, who will summarize our guidance and businesses assumptions for 2020 beginning on slide 16. Kevin? Kevin Wheeler : Alright, thank you Chuck. Our outlook for 2020 includes the following assumptions, and I'll start with China. China inventory levels ended 2019 between two and three months of sales, meeting our expectations after being as high as four months in the second half to 2018 and earlier in 2019. As we stated, our customers tell us normal levels are between two and three months.  We estimate sell-in will be modestly lower than sell-out, resulting in a modest further decline in channel inventory levels. We project China sales growth in local currency of 2.5%. Our forecast for the China currency is a modest appreciation from today's levels, resulting in a 1% increase in U.S. dollar terms. In China as we walk forward from the fourth quarter of 2019 to the first quarter of 2020, and with the Chinese New Year holidays earlier in the quarter and our continued focus on monitoring channel inventory, we project first quarter China volume will be approximately $40 million lower in the fourth quarter of 2019. The earnings impact in the 2020 first quarter from lower volumes is expected to be 50% of the sales decline.  In addition, also compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, we do not expect customer support programs, severance charges or other certain costs of approximately $10 million to repeat. After 1% decline in 2019 we project residential water heater volumes will increase 225,000 to 275,000 units in 2020, driven by incremental new construction and expansion of replacement demand in-line with historical trends.  Commercial industry water heater volumes are expected to grow 2% to 3%, primarily driven by growth in electric models. We expect our North America boiler sales to grow approximately 8% for the full year. In 2019 our boiler sales were flat with low single digit growth in condensing boilers.  Several factors underpin our 2020 forecast. We believe the transition from lower efficiency to higher efficiency boilers continues and commercial condensing boiler volumes growth mid-single digits as they have historically.  The ABI data has been recently strong and encouraging. We will enhance our product offering in 2020 such as adding O2 sensing capability on our commercial condensing boilers, which addresses a gap in our product portfolio that we believe impacted us in 2019.  We continue to work with our reps to improve our visibility to track jobs. We are seeing and hearing that many projects in 2019 have been pushed into the first half of 2020. We ended 2019 with a $2.6 million loss in India and we are on track with our expectations to breakeven in that region in 2020. As the India economy has shown signs of weakness recently, we are monitoring our progress towards this goal carefully. Please advance to slide 17. We project revenues will increase by approximately 4.5% to 5.5% in 2020. We see sales growth in North America with our water heater, boiler and water treatment products collectively expected to grow approximately 6% in 2020, including $20 million in Water-Right sales which was acquired in April of 2019. EPS is projected to be between $2.40 and $2.50. Our EPS guidance excludes the potential impact to our businesses from the developing coronavirus originated in China. We expect North America segment margin to be between 23.25% and 24.25% and rest of the world segment margins to be approximately 5%. We are pleased with how our North America segment is performing, particularly on the water heating side. We see long term growth drivers in water treatment solutions and boilers across North America.  In the near term the Chinese economy remains weak. We have a strong premium brand, right product offering in our key product categories, broad distribution and a reputation for quality and innovation. Over time we are well positioned to maximize favorable demographics in both China and India to enhance shareholder value.  Our replacement markets remain stable, which we believe represents approximately 85% of North America water heater and boiler volumes. We have a strong cash flow and balance sheet, providing opportunity to continue to invest in ourselves, acquisitions and return cash to shareholders.  That concludes our prepared remarks and we are now available for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Saree Boroditsky : Thank you, and good morning. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Patricia Ackerman : Good morning. Saree Boroditsky : It may be too early for this, but just given your commentary around guidance, have you seen any disruption in your supply chain or any impact on retail sales as a result of the coronavirus? Kevin Wheeler : Let me take this in kind of the order that \u2013 the way we think about it. First, the coronavirus, our focus is on our employees and particularly the 7,000 employees we have in China. So we are focused on safety and doing the right things to make sure that our employees are safe during these difficult times.  Secondly, to answer your question, at this time our supply chain we see no issues currently and going forward. So as we look at it right now, no immediate disruption expected by us at all. Saree Boroditsky : Great! And then given the decline in boilers in the quarter, can you provide some color of what you are seeing in that market that gives you confidence in the rebound for 2020 and maybe what you're seeing from the backlog of quoting perspectives. Kevin Wheeler : Yeah, sure. From the broader perspective, I\u2019m going to kind of look back on the year a bit. And first, the industry \u2013 we kept pace with the industry particularly in the commercial boiler sector. This year we as an organization are [planning mix skews] [ph] to more lower BTU models, and quite a few of our larger jobs this year as I mentioned in the comments have been pushed into the first quarter and the second half of the year. So \u2013 and on top of that our reps and our customers remain bullish about their activity. And as far as the market, job quoting and so forth remains active. And then on top of that we are introducing a O2 sensing device that goes on to our high commercial [commencing] [ph] boilers. So when you put all that together, the market, the ABI index, we had unusually skewed to lower BTU\u2019s this year, some projects that were delayed in the second half where we believe 8% is a reasonable number as we get into 2020. Chuck Lauber : Yeah, and this is Chuck. I mean we still can see you know that the higher efficiency boilers moving away from the less efficient, non-condensing boilers to higher efficient. Where we focus, we still see that trend. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your question. Scott Graham : Kevin, Chuck, Pat, how are you? Good morning! Kevin Wheeler : Good morning, thank you. Scott Graham : Hey, so I do have two questions around the organic guidance. The U.S. business you guys are looking for you know went up here, looks like in the 2% to 3% vicinity. Could you \u2013 you know in past conference calls, I think the last one in particular you talked about what your estimate was for the replacement business only for the last two years; I think it was 4% each. What did that number come in on for 2019 and what\u2019s baked in to your 2020 on the replacement only? Kevin Wheeler : Well, if you looked at it back at the \u2013 this year was, our guidance was for overall replacement to come in at about 100,000 to 150,000 units down this year and we feel it\u2019s going to fall in that range once everything is published. If you look at it, you're right, 2017, 2018 were well above market average, growing 4% to 5%. It\u2019s not unreasonable to have a correction as we did in 2019. So as we go forward, we're basically saying there's a reasonable new construction activity, builders remain confident and that our historical replacement market will return to their normal levels. That\u2019s what\u2019s baked into our guidance. Chuck Lauber : Yeah, if you take the mid-range of the residential units, that 250 range and you put 100,000 into new construction, new housing and you have the rest to the replacement. You don't quite get back to the 2018 levels. So you know we're kind of in between that. Scott Graham : That's a very sharp answer. Thank you, I appreciate that. So on the China business, it looks like we're going to start in the hole again in the first quarter, not unexpected, but you are expecting the China organic to be up 2.5 on a full year basis. So what is your thinking as to when those sales pivot upward? Would that be as early as the second quarter and I'm asking that, you know with the backdrop of mix likely staying negative, as well it looks like China completions continue to run down low single, down mid-single, which I have found to always be a pretty good proxy for the water heater market. So against that sort of backdrop, you know maybe give us a little more color around 2.5% local currency guidance for China if you will? Particularly if you can give us an idea of when you think it pivots to positive within that context? Chuck Lauber : Let me start out with \u2013 I mean look, Q1 as we came in, looking at next year we thought Q1 was going to be a challenging year regardless of what you're hearing on the virus situation right now, and the reason we have little caution on Q1 is because the Chinese New Year\u2019s festival falls into January. And anytime \u2013 it was January 25. Anytime it falls into January, what we see is more interruption in the appliance market, less traction. So as Kevin kind of outlined on his introductory remarks, even without those considerations we see the Q1 in China to be a challenging Q1 because of the disruption of the earlier holiday.  We would expect though going out of Q1, I think you've got a pretty spot on take on some of our assumptions Scott, so you know we expect going out of Q1 we're going to see a little headwind on channel inventories still. We were really happy with the progress that we made this year getting down into that normal range. We would expect another couple weeks perhaps come out of next year through the back three quarters of the year.  Low single digit or low single digit declines on the water heating side are really consistent with what we've seen this year and kind of roll into next year in our assumptions. Water treatment, if you look at our outside market data, some of those numbers are slightly, slightly negative. We are a little more optimistic on the water treatment side. We really like some of the new products we put out and we think we're going to outperform some of those projections on water treatment.  So and then you kind of roll into that some of the other \u2013 I'll call it less material categories that we have that kind of bringing up to that growth rate. I hope that\u2019s helpful. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Robert McCarthy : Hi everybody. Well, first of all good luck managing the situation. Obviously this is going to be dynamic and the human toll is going to be pretty challenging. And I guess you know it's like the old John Lennon quote, you know \u2018life is what happens when you're making other plans.\u2019 But how are you going to you know kind of come back to the market and kind of give us a sense of what you think is kind of fundamental end market demand in China versus the disruption you are going to see. Are we going to see a non-recurring charge in association with what happens in China or are you going to give some kind of \u2013 with your update on association with that. And then part and parcel of that, you know what\u2019s \u2013 how are you going to manage recourse in the channel for inventory? I mean, is there any force majeure we have to worry about? Just give us some sense about what we're going to see in terms of the disruption. So what is your guide, which was clearly baked and contemplated prior to these events? Kevin Wheeler : Hi, this is Kevin. Let me take that. Those are all really good questions, but right now when you look at this market and you look at the coronavirus and where it stands, it's really too early to speculate. We still have many people on holiday that need to come back and we see how they are going to behave going forward. We don't know the scope outside the key province since that had been restricted right now. So if you just step back from that, we're going to have to get a lot more data on how consumers are behaving before we enter into some further guidance and speculations; it's where we're at. Robert McCarthy : Okay, that\u2019s fair enough. And you know turning to North America, you know obviously you did talk about the phenomenon of you know potentially lower, all-in growth that you\u2019ve witnessed in years past. You know what are you seeing in terms of \u2013 you know in terms of your end markets, in terms of the shift to tankless gas and how are you feeling about kind of where your positioned from a market share perspective there, and do you think that still supports kind of still you know reasonable kind of low single digit growth here for the foreseeable future? Kevin Wheeler : Yeah, I think I\u2019ll. Let\u2019s just take from a market share perspective and remember, these are shipments, these are not sell outs. But if you look at it you know, we were down a bit on market share residential; we were up close to 100 basis points on commercial and as we go into this year, we just look at it \u2013 we\u2019ll be turning to a more normal level, and I look at the residential business and the residential industry, in 10 years it\u2019s been flat twice, down three times and up five. So it\u2019s not this linear equation, but you look at the positive news from a new construction standpoint, you look at a water being a must have product when again it stops operating. So our guidance is really getting back to historical levels and I think that's a reasonable guidance as we go forward. Our share is intact on both residential and commercial and to go back on tankless, that\u2019s an area that we continue to look at growing, expanding. We will be introducing some new innovative product lines this year, and that category actually has declined three years in a row, its growth rate.  So overall I think we're in good position as we head in. I think the guidance is kind of getting back to a normal year that we basically didn't have in 2019. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Halloran with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Michael Halloran : Hey, good morning everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Hi Mike. Chuck Lauber : Good morning Mike. Michael Halloran : So first on China, just some thoughts on how you think the market share trends are on both the water heater side, as well as the treatment side in China, what you could point to and then any delineation between how you think you're doing on the water heater side and in the upper tier versus the middle tier where I know you've been introducing a higher end, mid-tier product. A - Kevin Wheeler : Yeah, let me just start out with that one Mike, on the share. So you know we look at it online, offline, all the caveats that we've heard before. We used a couple of different triangulations to get there and not all of our stores are covered in the specialty side.  But on the offline what we're really looking at is quarter-over-quarter if you take heating, both gas and electric, relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. You moved into water treatment, we\u2019re up a couple basis points quarter-over-quarter, so we're pleased with that little movement up on the water treatment side. For the year, on the offline it\u2019s you know down a couple of hundred basis points on heating collectively and we\u2019ve held our share on water treatment.  If you go to online, heating both of residential \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, both electric and gas is relatively flat for the quarter and we\u2019re up about 100 basis points on water treatment. For the year if you look online, we're down about a point on all three categories. So we're pleased with the water treatment in particular and we\u2019re barely holding on the other category.  [Cross Talk] Chuck Lauber : Also just to extend, just on the upper tier premium market, you know when I look at Q4, there wasn\u2019t a lot of change. The upper tier stayed where it was and its down about a couple of hundred basis points and that\u2019s been pretty consistent throughout the year. As important, from a brand perspective there's been no real retaliation towards a former American brand. So really we came through Q4 relatively kind of the same as we thought, with no real changes other than we have filled in our medium price points and we feel good about that going into 2020. Michael Halloran : I appreciate it there. And then on North America side, maybe just an update on the treatment business \u2013 you sound pretty constructive on progress you've made. So any thoughts on how the channel builds going and custom receptivity at this point and how you think the build out of that market is going, because it's still in the early stage of the build out. Kevin Wheeler : It is in the early stage. We had a very good year mid-teens growth. We saw core growth in all segments and you know that's our direct-to-consumer, that's a professional water quality dealer, retail and wholesale as well.  So overall we feel pretty good about the way the business is moving forward, increased productivity as I mentioned in my remarks in our plants, on-time performance is up, and again part of our thesis is that water quality is becoming a bigger issue with consumers and we see that continuing not only with lead, but PFOA\u2019s and a number of other contaminants that are in the market, and we feel confident because we have the products that can remove all these chemicals and so the business is in good shape, had a good year and we look forward to building on it in 2020. A - Chuck Lauber : From a numbers perspective we're right on track to what we\u2019ve been talking about. Going into next year we look at you know revenues in the 170 to 180 range; we look at operating margins in double digits. So we're pleased it\u2019s in the progress. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeffrey Hammond with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Jeffrey Hammond : Hey, good morning guys. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Patricia Ackerman : Hi. Jeffrey Hammond : It just want to make sure I'm clear on the guidance. So I think you're saying 4.5% to 5.5% growth, and it just seems like a lot of these numbers are kind of low single digits, you know commercial res, you know China. So like what's kind of growing above average outside of Lochinvar to kind of get you into that 4.5% to 5.5% growth range. Kevin Wheeler : Yeah, I mean so Lochinvar goes back to a growth. So we see Lochinvar is at 8% next year, so that helps in blocking it forward. We also have growth in North America water treatment, so we expect America water treatment to grow in that low-teens year-over-year and that\u2019s starting to become a more meaningful base.  India, we expect to grow also. India's in that low-teens range that we expect to continue to grow. So that\u2019s the major components. You know with the rest, you know China is rather modest and will be positive or these are assumptions that it will be positive. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay, and then just a couple of questions on China. One, it looks like I think you closed 700 stores in \u201919; you\u2019re going to close another 1,000 in 2020 I think is what you said. Can you just talk about where store growth \u2013 stores are versus peak and you know just any kind of revenue impact you think you have from all those store closures and then just, you know any plans for repatriating cash from China this year. Thanks. Kevin Wheeler : Yeah, so you know the store closures, when you think about the terms of the stores that are kind of in the same geographic region, so it\u2019s really rationalizing stores that are pretty close to one another. So from a sales wise perspective, we do not view it as significant. What we view \u2013 our jobs do is to make sure we draw those shoppers into the stores that exist within the geographic region that\u2019s there. In some of the built-out years we had probably a little redundancy in some local areas. So the peak, you know the peak was about 9,800 and today we\u2019d be about 9 \u2013 yeah, it\u2019s about 9,000. So going forward that extra 1000 stores that we're looking at is probably not a significant impact on sale, and just a reminder that there are - some of those are our specialty stores, some of those are retail outlets, you know the cost for those. We do incur cost to support some of those stores, but it\u2019s our customers\u2019 storefront. So the closure cost on some of those are just not, not very significant. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Bryan Blair with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Bryan Blair : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Kevin Wheeler : Hey Bryan. Bryan Blair : Following up on Scott's initial line of questioning, asking from a slightly higher level, where do you think we stand in terms of the long term replacement cycle? Is there risk of an accelerated move off-of peak there and any differences between the resi andcommercial side you would call it? Kevin Wheeler : We did quite a bit of analysis on this and reviewed it in our Investor Day and continue to watch it quite frankly. The bell curve on the replacement cycle on water heaters is really elongated. We have water heaters that can go out within five years and others that can last 25 years. So as we looked at it, we see that bell curve smoothing it out and we don't see \u2013 I\u2019ll use the word because people have used in the past, \u2018equipped.\u2019 We see it went out to 22, 23 maybe a slight decline, but nothing of any dramatic nature.  We are even seeing some of our products even last even little bit longer. We've been using 14 years and then they are moving out to 15 years. So it's, from our perspective it's out a few years and the impact will be within that one or two point range. Chuck Lauber : And I guess the follow-up Bryan, you mention commercial, the cycle on commercial is shorter so we really just don't see the same tracking as residential. This is the shorter life cycle. Bryan Blair : Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Moving to China, obviously there's a P&L hit to start the year, then boring spillover effect from the virus seems like there will be a decent reset, you know at least since the back half. How should we think about ROW margin cadence throughout the year, netting for that mid-single digit range. Chuck Lauber : Well, typically in China our strongest quarter in Q4 you know, so. I think you can look at it that way, it was the strongest quarter this year for us even though it was down a little bit from consumer demand compared to last year. But we are pleased with where we ended the year on channel inventory, where our customers ended the year on channel inventory. We would not expect in Q1 to cause that inventory to go up and we would feel pretty good about coming into the back three quarters of the year in that inventory position compared to last year. But as far as cadence, I mean the fourth quarter is always our strongest. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question. David MacGregor : Yes, good morning. You may have mentioned this and I may have missed it, but could you just talk about raw material prices in your guidance assumptions and how are you thinking about lower steel prices in terms of the benefit to the P&L. Chuck Lauber : Yeah, for 2020 we're looking to have lower steel pricing than we have this year. Just as a reminder you know, we see steel costs kind of 90 to 120 days hit us. So if you kind of look at where the market is today, we expect, steel pricing next year to be just slightly lower than where the market is today. David MacGregor : And just \u2013 so can you \u2013 is there any way of quantifying that back into the margin guidance or the EBIT guidance? Chuck Lauber : We typically don't, but you can kind of get a projection just by looking at kind of taken it to the market. David MacGregor : Sure, sure. And then just with respect to China, can you talk a little bit about your online sales there, and I guess to what extent you may expect to see that accelerate as a consequence of coronavirus. But I'm more interested in just how you feel you\u2019re positioned in terms of market share or channel share on that platform. Kevin Wheeler : Our online sales last year were $207 million, really pretty flat to the year before. We've got our assumption is 2020 to grow at the mid-single digits. So we talked about reintroducing mid-priced products. So we feel pretty good about our position with mid-priced products which we do see more of in online sales. And you know our share, we still think there's opportunity to grow that share on the online side. So it\u2019s you know $207 million this year and we'll be growing mid-single digits. We feel pretty good with where we enter into 2020. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Larry De Maria with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. Larry De Maria : Thanks. Good morning. First question, the price actions you guys took for second half \u201919, how did they hold up through the rest of \u201919. I don't know if there is any push back in the market etcetera, and how you are thinking about price in 2020? Kevin Wheeler : Pricing question is always fairly sensitive to us you know. As we announced, we did put an increase through last year up to 4%, and really after that, we are really the only public company and we just don't want to comment any further on any pricing actions with regards to market conditions. Larry De Maria : Right. I know you guys have always been historically sensitive to that, but I\u2019m curious if it held up thought he rest of \u201819 or if there was push back in the channel, you know broadly speaking on price? Kevin Wheeler : Yeah again, we are just not going to comment on price with any detail like that. Larry De Maria : Okay, and then secondly in China, can you talk about that two to three months of inventory the you guys over the \u2013 this channel. Is that high end inventory, mid-tier inventory first of all; and secondly as it relates to the coronavirus which obviously you know originated in Wuhan, things from your competitors are there with fairly big production plants. You guys said that you know no big impact to your supply chain this far, but are you seeing or potentially seeing any interruptions in the market from \u2013 potentially in the industry from competitors because of what's going on in Wuhan. Kevin Wheeler : You know just to start with the channel inventory, so our channel inventory, I\u2019ll call it \u2013 it\u2019s a relatively even mix of higher end product, mid-priced product. As you know we've introduced quite a few mid-priced products in the last two to three quarters. So its maybe \u2013 I\u2019ll call it 50/50. So we think we're balanced on where we're it falls on in the channel inventory.  With respect to \u2013 I would say with respect to competitors and like I mentioned before, it's really too early to understand me. What I tell you from our supply chain, we did reach out to our suppliers and so forth and got feedback and we're comfortable with it, but we just don't have the information nor are we going to speak to any of our competitors\u2019 conditions. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Susan McClary with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Susan McClary : Thank you, good morning. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning Susan. Susan McClary : I just wondered if we could talk a little bit about, you know what are you seeing in terms of the new construction side of the U.S. market, especially on the residential piece supporting some good order growth and how are you thinking about that coming through? Kevin Wheeler : From a residential new construction, again if you look at it, there\u2019s been some positive information with builders. Certainly there was a spike in starts in December. So if you look forward it looks like from a new construction standpoint it\u2019s a positive, it\u2019s a tailwind. To what extent, Chuck talked about 100,000 units. On the commercial side, again things have been active there. However, there has just been a \u2013 items that are being pushed out. Labor is still an issue, I would tell you on both the residential and commercial side of the business.  So it looks positive to us, to the degree that we can get things in the ground and finished. We think it\u2019s within our guidance of the range we gave on residential and our guidance that we gave on our commercial and boilers. Susan McClary : Okay, alright thank you. And then obviously your balance sheet remains in a really strong position within that cash balance there. Can you just talk about maybe what you are seeing in terms of the some of the M&A opportunities and how you are thinking about some of the capital allocation, things that could come up over the course of 2020? Kevin Wheeler : Normally, on the M&A side we are always actively engaged in and looking for opportunities and until we have any of that really materializing, we just don't talk about them. However we are \u2013 we do have a nice balance sheet that when those opportunities come along we can execute. When it comes from our cash, allocation, I\u2019ll let Chuck just comment on\u2026 Chuck Lauber : Yeah, we are looking to repurchase next year. So as we talked about before, we always invest in ourselves. We got some good capital programs that we're planning for next year, we're looking at repurchasing about 200 million. That 200 million is really based on what we look at for generating cash for the year, our dividends, net of CapEx, the goal what we are looking at, just to size that borrowing and acquisition would be just to not grow cash for 2020. So that's kind of how we are sizing that up. Operator : Thank you. And out next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Robert McCarthy : Yeah, just back in queue with a couple of follow-ups. Thank you for taking the questions. The first would be just in terms of looking at historical trends in the residential channel in North America. I mean obviously you know historically I hear your point about the fits and starts in terms of how you are thinking about the kind of the replacement cycle evolving. But you know you did go through a period of pretty significant price increase with that standard change five years ago, which created a different margin structure, which could attract new entrants in the market. So, I mean how do you think of it about prospectively, a threat of new entrants in the context of the replacement cycle, maybe challenging your historical assumptions about how the cycle is going to play out. Kevin Wheeler : Well, let me just take \u2013 how we look at it. One, to be a market leader in this industry you have to have a broad line of products, both residential, commercial and that investment and that's not only in the products but in the technologies; condensing, non-condensing, heat pump, non-heat pump, gas tank versus electric tank versus all the commercials we have are tanks. So from a new entrance, that\u2019s always possible and quite frankly Haier has announced that they are going to come in a market with some electric products. But as we look at it, what we do is we try to provide the best value proposition to our customers and its based upon this broad portfolio, it\u2019s based upon driving value, not only with products, services and also what we do in the, with the engineers and the specifications. And then on top of that, you really step back; we got 60 years of long term relationships in all channels.  So we're going to do the things that we believe make us the preferred brand of choice and so that's how we look at it, and as other people come in, it's going to take a broad portfolio, it\u2019s not an easy hurdle to come in and provide these broad portfolio of products and services that we have. Robert McCarthy : And then the final question for me is, I mean I think with the exception of probably Lochinvar, most of the growth initiatives are the positive growth variance to get the kind of 4% to 5% growth or the mid-single digit are growth to be decent growing business, business you are investing in, but clearly going to be challenge margin mix profile for you as a whole, at least on a normalized basis for China and certainly for North America. So are you concerned about that particularly in the context of what could be, you know a rougher traffic coming in China that you know the nature of the growth that you are going to see is dilutive and may create some incremental earnings risk or headwinds even to your base outlook? Chuck Lauber : You know you are correct in the fact that some of these growth businesses right now have lower operating margins than what you know the lesser growth business going forward. China is difficult to you know peg as far as \u2013 when we pegged China we said what our growth rate would be next year. So you know in China we expect to continue to reduce product costs; we expect to continue to look at our costs and expect to expand the margin in China at the pace at which the consumer confidence and market allows us to grow.  In India and water treatment, we feel like we are making good progress in India. We expect to be breakeven next year. Water treatment, we're looking at you know 100 to 200 basis points improvement in the next couple of years to get that margin closer to North America water heating. So we feel like we're making progress on all those areas. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeffrey Hammond with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Jeffrey Hammond : Hey guys. Just I wanted to go back on the repatriation; any plans to repatriate cash from China this year? Chuck Lauber : You know the last few years we've repatriated a $150 million each year. We are going through that process and looking at the things that are in front of us. We would expect to repatriate some cash and when we come up with the appropriate number as we go through that process, we'll be talking about how much we bring back. But we would expect to, and we have in the last two years brought back $150 million each year. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay great. And then on your North American margins your range is typically like 25 to 50 bips, but this year you have a 100 basis point range and just wanted to understand the change or if there is any moving pieces that would support the wider range. Thanks. Chuck Lauber : You know it\u2019s mostly within our range, it\u2019s mostly just based on volume assumptions. That\u2019s what drives most of the volatility. Operator : Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Patricia Ackerman for any further remarks. Patricia Ackerman : Great! Thank you for joining us on our call today. We will participate in one conference in the first quarter, that\u2019s the Boenning & Scattergood conference in London on March 12. Have a great day! Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ms. Ackerman, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability and Treasurer. Thank you. Please go ahead. Patricia Ackerman : Thank you Michelle. Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the A. O. Smith first quarter 2020 results conference call. Joining me today are Kevin Wheeler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin with Kevin's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include among others matters that we have described in this morning's press release. Also as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have more than two questions, please rejoin the queue. I will now turn the call over to Kevin, who will begin our prepared remarks on slide three. Kevin Wheeler : Thank you Pat. Undoubtedly, these are unprecedented times. With safety and well-being of our employees as the highest priority, I am extremely proud of our entire teams supporting our customers with essential water heating and water treatment products to combat this virus. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and in support of continuing our manufacturing efforts during these times, we have undertaken numerous meaningful and in some cases extraordinary steps at our manufacturing plants to protect our employees. These steps include plant accommodations and reconfigurations to maintain social distancing, mask availability to all employees, deep cleaning, quarantine individuals with positive tests or potential exposure to the virus for 14 days and restricted access to facilities among others. While these steps result in lower manufacturing efficiencies in some cases, our focus is on safety first. The majority of our office personnel have been working from home and have done a great job in maintaining productivity and support of the business. As offices have reopened in China and will soon in other countries and in the U.S., we have implemented return to office protocol, which include bringing back office staff in waves over a two month period, making masks available, more frequent cleaning of common areas, sanitizing stations throughout the office areas and limiting the use of conference rooms for small group meetings to maintain social distancing. Our long term relationships, in many cases decades long and strength of our partners within various channels including wholesale distributors, DIY retail, hardware stores, plumbing supply and independent reps are particularly important as we provide the essential water heating and water treatment products, critical to uninterrupted operations of hospitals, clinics, grocery stores, food service companies and many more, including the households that many are now using to conduct business and education. Our global supply chain management team proactively monitors and manages the ability to operate effectively and identify bottlenecks. To-date, we have not seen any meaningful disruption in our supply chain. We engaged in ongoing communication with our supply chain partners to identify and mitigate risk, including multisourcing and managing inventory at higher levels. Our recent implementation of SAP has provide improved management tools and visibility into our supply chain. Additionally, we have improved our manufacturing flexibility as a result of water heater tank standardization projects over the last five years. Standardization greatly improves our ability to shift manufacturing from one plant to another, should the need arise. The stability afforded by replacement component in residential and commercial water heater and boiler demand, which we estimate at 85% of the U.S. unit volume puts us in a position of strength as we navigate through this pandemic. We estimate replacement demand is 40% to 50% in China. While we are in a position of strength, similar to 2008 and 2009 timeframe, we expect to see lower demand for the majority of our products and have been proactive in managing costs. We have increased our cost reduction programs in China. We continue to monitor the North American environment and customer demand to potentially take further actions such as furlough programs and other restructuring. A.O. Smith is in a solid financial position with positive cash flow and a strong balance sheet. I will turn the call over to Chuck, who will elaborate on our cash and liquidity on slide four. Chuck Lauber : Thank you Kevin. While A.O. Smith has a strong balance sheet and capital position, we are proactively managing our discretionary spend and cash position. To that end, we suspended our share repurchase program in mid-March. In addition, while we continue to focus on strategic investments, including new products and production efficiency, we have reprioritized and reduced our capital spend plans for 2020 by approximately 20%. Through April, we have completed $200 million of dividends out of China and we have repatriated $125 million to the U.S. As of April 30, 2020, we had approximately $850 million in liquidity consisting of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and borrowing capacity on our credit facility which remains in place throughout 2020 and 2021, expiring in December 2021. We continue to focus on rightsizing the cost structure of our China business. We have achieved a 20% headcount reduction compared with December 2018 and we will continue to assess the need for additional workforce reduction. We are targeting 1,000 net store closures this year in China along with further cuts in advertising and other costs. Total savings are expected to total $55 million, an increase of $10 million from our estimate in January, of which $30 million was achieved in 2019. Our debt maturity schedule is shown on slide five. The next major maturity date is at the end of next year in December 2021 when our revolving credit facility expires. We are in compliance with all covenants in our credit facility. Our leverage ratio was 17.5% gross debt to total capital at the end of March, was significantly below the 60% maximum dictated by our credit and various long-term facilities. I will begin comments about the first quarter on slide six. First quarter 2020 sales of $637 million declined 15% compared to the first quarter of 2019. The decline in sales was largely due to a 56% decline in China local currency sales driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of lower sales in China, first quarter 2020 net earnings of $52 million and earnings per share of $0.32 declined significantly compared to the same period in 2019. Please turn to slide seven. Sales in our North America segment of $533 million increased 2% compared with the first quarter of 2019. Incremental sales of $16 million from the Water-Right acquisition purchased in April 2019, organic growth of 17% in North America water treatment products and higher water heater volumes drove sales higher. These factors were partially offset by water heater sales mix composed of more electric models which have a lower selling price and lower contractual formula pricing associated with a portion of water heater sales based on lower steel costs. Rest of world segment sales of $110 million declined approximately 53% with the same quarter in 2019. China sales declined 56% in local currency related to weak consumer demand driven by the pandemic. China channel inventories declined slightly from the levels at the end of 2019 and remained in the normal range of two to three months. On slide eight, North America segment earnings of $127 million were 10% higher than segment earnings in the same quarter in 2019. The improvement in earnings were driven by lower steel costs, incremental profit from Water-Right and improvement in the profitability of the organic water treatment sales which were partially offset by the mix skew to electric water heaters and lower contractual pricing. As a result, first quarter 2020 segment margin of 23.9% improved from 23.3% achieved in the same period last year. Rest of the world loss of $42 million declined significantly compared with 2019 first quarter segment earnings of $12 million. The unfavorable impact to profits from lower China sales and a higher mix of mid-priced products which have lower margins, more than offset the benefit to profits from lower SG&A expense. As a result of these factors, the segment margin was negative compared with 5.3% in the same quarter in 2019. Our corporate expenses of $15 million and interest expense $2 million were essentially flat as last year. Our effective tax rate of 23.6% in the first quarter of 2020 was higher than the 20% tax rate in the first quarter of 2019, primarily due to geographical differences in pretax income. Please turn to slide nine. Cash provided by operations was $54 million first quarter of 2020 was higher than $22 million in the same period in 2019 as a result of lower investment in working capital, including timing of certain volume incentive payments which was partially offset by lower earnings compared with the year ago period. Our liquidity and balance sheet remain strong. We have cash balances totaling $552 million and our net cash position was $209 million at the end of March. During the first quarter of 2020, we repurchased approximately $1.4 million shares of common stock for a total of $57 million. I will now turn the call over to Kevin, who will begin on slide 10. Kevin Wheeler : Thank you Chuck. During April, we saw differing levels of impact from the pandemic across our major product lines and geographies. In North America, our average daily orders for residential water heaters declined low single digits compared with the first quarter pace. Commercial average water rates in April were down 30% to 35%. It is difficult to interpret water rates in April as customers are likely adjusting inventory levels as they manage their inventory investment dollars. In China, the pandemic had a significant impact on our volume in the first quarter. 50% of our sales volume occurred before the Chinese New Year shutdown on January 24. With manufacturing, government offices, restaurants and schools now largely reopened and the majority of installers able to access apartments in China, we have seen sequential improvement in sellout and orders in April compared with February and March. Consumers remain cautious and it's too early to determine when consumers will return to normal levels in retail environments. A portion of the improvement could be pent-up demand. In North America, demand for residential boilers has remained soft following a warm winter. And we have delayed our early buy incentive program in this environment. Our commercial condensing boiler backlog has doubled from levels at this time last year but some orders have extended delivery dates. With construction sites closed in some states, timing of delivery is difficult to project. Safety and security of drinking water was a higher priority for consumers during this time. The North America water treatment end market strength we saw in the first quarter continued in our direct to consumer product portfolio, which skews to lower price, easier-to-install products. In April we experienced some challenges in parts of the country with installed and home products. In India, our water treatment products are considered essential but our manufacturing plant is closed as worker transportation is difficult in this environment. We believe the current environment does not allow for the forecast of performance with reasonable precision. And as a result, we continue to suspend our 2020 full year guidance. As the depth of the disruption and pace of recovery in our end markets become clear, we look to return to our practice of providing a current year outlook. Please turn to slide 11. In Mexico, similar to other companies, we temporarily suspended operations as governmental agencies continue to sort through the industries designated as essential and allowed to continue to operate as well as the conditions and safety measures under which businesses deemed essential are allowed to operate. We temporary shifted manufacturing from Mexico to the U.S. to minimize disruption of our customers. Each day, we move closer to an understanding of when we will resume production and believe that we will be in a week or two and at a reduced manning and capacity. These lower rates coupled with U.S. output are expected to support demand for customers over the coming months. Our global supply chain team has been proactive from early in the first quarter and continues to monitor and manage availability of components. Again, to-date, we have experience middle disruptions in our global supply chain. Our largest suppliers in Mexico, which are in different states than our Juarez plant, are now reopened, but at reduced capacity. While the disruption has been minimal, we have experienced reduced safety stock levels on certain items and our supply team is in ongoing communication with our suppliers to mitigate operational risk and manage inventory levels. We believe replacement demand for water heaters and boilers in the U.S. is approximately 85%. In 2006 through 2009, which captured the great recession peak to trough, industry shipments of residential water heater volumes declined 18%. The decline was primarily driven by 1.5 million decline in new homes constructed. During that period, we were able to flex our operations to maintain margins. At 1.3 million new homes in 2019, we do not anticipate the new home construction impact will be as great as the great recession. The replacement base of our core U.S. products provides a stabilizing buffer to the economic downturn expected in the remaining three quarters of 2020. Please turn to slide 12. After being closed for several weeks in February in compliance with local orders, our three plants in China are open and operating. Foot traffic in our retail network in China remains low and we are building to order at lower than normal operating capacities. Our suppliers are open and we are not experiencing disruptions. Customers continue to prefer products with fewer features, continuing the trend we saw last year, as you would expect in this environment. Our mid-priced products are positioned for this trend. Despite reduced headcount, retail footprint and advertising costs, we continue to invest in R&D in the region. Product development continues with a focus on taking cost of our most popular new products to improve contribution margin. Product development has been one of the pillars to our success in China and we are committed to our investment in engineering resources in China and around the world. Please turn to slide 13. After a hard closure of the economy in the first quarter, China is slowly returning to business. While we have seen April orders incrementally improve from February and March, it is too early to predict if the recent improvement is the result of pent-up demand or by consumers slowly returning to the market. In North America, we have previous experience in weathering through difficult economic conditions, most recently in the 2008 recession. However, with the massive and abrupt impact to jobs in end markets like restaurants, hotels and hospitals, it is difficult to predict if this current state of shelter at home and state-by-state closures will play out similarly to the 2008 recession. While we would expect that our replacement business in both water heating and boilers would provide a buffer in the same manner as we have seen before, the impact of construction and discretionary spend and closure of certain job site activity is difficult to predict for the remainder 2020. In India, it is clear that our target to breakeven in 2020 will be pushed out as the country battles COVID-19. Please turn to slide 14. We believe that particularly in these uncertain times, A.O. Smith is a compelling investment for a number of reasons. We have leading market share in our major product categories. We estimate replacement demand represents approximately 85% of U.S. water heater and boiler volumes. We have a strong premium brand in China, a broad product offering in our key product categories, broad distribution and a reputation for quality and innovation in that region. Over time, we are well positioned to maximize favorable demographics in both China and India to enhance shareholder value. We have strong cash flow and balance sheet supporting the ability to continue to invest for the long term with investments in automation, innovation and new products as well as acquisition and returning cash to shareholders. We will continue to proactively manage our business in this uncertain environment as we have seen consumer demand trends emerge in China where we were first impacted by the pandemic and now in our North America as the current economy begins to reemerge after the economic shutdown. We have a strong team which has navigated successfully through prior downturns. I am confident in our ability to execute through COVID-19. That concludes our prepared remarks and we are now available for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And your first question is from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Jeff Hammond : Hi. Good morning guys. Kevin Wheeler : Hi. Good morning Jeff. Patricia Ackerman : Hi Jeff. Chuck Lauber : Good morning. Jeff Hammond : Really good color on April and the trends. And I just want to understand this China sellout chart a little bit better. Is it fair to say that like the last five weeks, sellout has been kind of in line with prior year? And maybe how does that frame how you are thinking about 2Q for China versus the steep drop you saw in 1Q? Chuck Lauber : Yes. Jeff, so let me just kind of walk forward from January. Kevin said it on his remarks that half of our first quarter sales were before the holiday festival. So before January 24, we had 50% over the Q1 sales already in. February was by far the weakest. Sequentially, March got a little bit better. And we have seen April get a little bit better. And that's just our sales. When you look at demand, demand what we have seen in April is, demand is approaching, the sellout is approaching what we saw last year. So we are encouraged by it. We think some of it could be pent-up demand. But we are encouraged by the way it's starting to track to last year. Jeff Hammond : Okay. Chuck Lauber : And on top of that, I just want to come back to channel inventories. So you know, we saw channel inventories decreased slightly in the first quarter too. So we are really building to demand and we are pleased with that. Jeff Hammond : Okay. And then in North America, kind of stark difference between the commercial water heater commentary and I think what you are saying about Lochinvar. But it sounds like you expect Lochinvar to see declines as well. Can you just maybe differentiate between those two and what you kind of expect? Chuck Lauber : Well, let me just take the North America water heating side of the market first. As we talked about, our orders were down a little bit on residential in April. In the commercial, I wouldn't read too much into April right now, down 30%, 35% is, in our mind, probably our distributors rebalancing inventory. Keep in mind that their largest investment is in our dollar amounts in our commercial product. So there is probably some rebalancing going on there. As far as Lochinvar, again Lochinvar has had a very nice commercial start to the year. Again, some of those jobs are in New York and a few other states that have been suspended. But having a strong order book is really good. And we are still seeing, quite frankly, decent quote activity out there. So as we move forward, again, I would say, it's still too early to put a number on what new construction look like and when these jobs that have been postponed will be released. But overall, I like our position as we head into Q2 and then we are going to have to read and react as we see this market open up. It's very early right now. Jeff Hammond : Okay. Thanks guys. I will get back in queue. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Matt Summerville : To that point, would it be possible, Kevin, to just talk about what you believe sell-through looks like in April in the commercial business versus sell-in where you indicated? And then as my follow-up, can you talk about how the new entrants into the residential water heater market later this year may impact or not market stability? I would love to get your take on that. Thank you. Kevin Wheeler : Well, I would tell you, when you start talking about North America and sell-in and sellout, we don't really have great data there. So it would more speculative on my part as we go forward. I still believe the 85% replacement market is going to hold up and continue. But the new construction, it's just too early for us to put a number on that, knowing again, as I mentioned, a lot of the jobs have been suspended and quite a bit of activity up in the Northeast and so forth. So not trying to dodge the question, it's just we really don't have that kind of visibility to give you or for me to give you a reasonable answer right now. And as it comes down to a competitor entering the market at the end of this year, again, as we looked at it, A.O. Smith has dealt with competitors for a long period of time. As we mentioned on prior calls, we have very strong relationships with our distributors. I mentioned in my remarks, they go back decades. To be a full-time player in this market, you have to have a very complete product line of residential, commercial. And on top of that have excellent service levels. So we are going to focus on our self as we go forward and continue to do and provide value to our distributors as we have over the last decades. Matt Summerville : Thank you. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities. Scott Graham : Yes. Hi. Good morning Kevin, Chuck, Pat. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning Scott. Scott Graham : I was just hoping, on slide four, the $55 million in China, is the math there as simple as assuming at $25 million drops into operating income this year? Chuck Lauber : It is, Scott. We were talking about $15 million on the January call and we have increased that by $10 million. Scott Graham : Yes. Got you. And then, you have to look at each business individually and certainly within North America. But is there, particularly with concerns out there about the speed of release of the backlogs that are out there on commercial for that kind of start up again fully, I think that there is some concerns out there. And I guess my question is, you know, does that preclude you? Like, does your backlog, when you are quoting precludes you from maybe taking some structural cost out there? And maybe more broadly, in North America, what are the trigger points that you are may be looking at to get more aggressive on the cost side in North America, again more broadly? Kevin Wheeler : Well, let me just take the high level and I will have Chuck fill in some of the blanks here. But if you look at it, demand we have been able and we have demonstrated it through 2008 and the recession, to be able to flex our plants appropriately. And so that's a skill set that came out of the great recession that we continue to use today. So that would be simply demand driven and we will adjust appropriately, whether it's in our water heater facility or on the boiler facility. And as far as costs right now, the quarter came, I think, pretty reasonable for us. We are continuing to watch demand. Some of the things we have already taken. We have our headcount on hold. Travel and entertainment is down. But we haven't taken any major structural changes or decided to take any structural changes yet. We will continue to look at it. We are prepared, if necessary, to execute. But we just not in that position and we will continue to monitor demand and our customers as we head into Q2. Chuck Lauber : Yes. I mean the trigger point for us is really watching that demand. Back to your backlog question, we are pleased to have the backlog. We wish it was a little more predictable on when we were going to ship it. But that doesn't really preclude us from taking some of the actions that Kevin mentioned on taking some of the cost out as we watch the backlog. Operator : Your next question is from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David MacGregor : Yes. Good morning everyone. Chuck, I hope you are well. Chuck Lauber : Yes. You too. David MacGregor : Yes. Thank you. Just a question on China and I guess you know we have been talking now for a few quarters about the evolving mid-price point product that you have introduced into the Chinese market. I guess I wanted to tie this in a little bit with what you are doing on SG&A because clearly, you are making progress in terms of addressing the SG&A issue. But to the extent that you are relying more and more on mid-price point, one would presume that that's a more competitive segment of the market. And as a consequence, would require more in the way ad support, market support. And I am just wondering if the migration into greater mass in the mid-price point constrains you in terms of what you are able to do in flexing SG&A? Chuck Lauber : The products that we are introducing in that kind of upper mid-price point is really helping us, albeit on the online. So as you might expect, in Q1 we saw our online business doing a bit better than we have seen in the past. Our online historically has been 20% of our business last year, first quarter. This year it's approaching 30%. And the selling model is a little bit different on online after you make the sale than we do on the offline footprint. So some of the tie in to kind of mid\u2013priced products and some of the actions we are taking is looking at our store footprint. So the 1,000 stores that we talked about, that's the area that we are really looking at, low efficiency stores, trying to take some cost out. But it's really those mid-price products help us a bit online as well as in the offline and we are working on cost reduction projects that continue to reduce the cost on those. Kevin Wheeler : Yes. I would just add that, the cost to sell online is a little bit lower than offline. And a lot of the actions we are taking with the stores, we are going to repurpose some of those investments towards our online activities. But I don't view it as being an incremental add to our marketing efforts. I look at it more a repurposing in how we go to market. David MacGregor : Is there any chance we could get some sense of proportion from you in terms of what percentage of your business over there is mid-price point versus the legacy premium price point? Chuck Lauber : We don't have that split handy right now. I would say, certainly in this environment, we have seen a shift to more of the upper mid-priced than low end of the premium price product. But exact numbers, we just don't have in front of us. David MacGregor : Okay. And my follow-up question is really on the water treatment. Some pretty impressive numbers there this quarter. Just the improved profitability, is it really just being driven by scaling up business ops or is there product mix or channel mix issue? Could you just talk about some of the progress you have made in water treatment? Kevin Wheeler : Yes. It's all that. It's some scale. It's some process improvement that we have had. Strong demand always helps. With the organic growth of 17% in the business really improves it. And we are very, very pleased with the addition of Water-Right because Water-Right has performed very, very well for us and helps that margin as we get more scale. David MacGregor : I guess just in this kind of environment where there is so many concerns about how the consumer discretionary spend might respond to the macro, are you seeing anything in April that would give you pause? Kevin Wheeler : No. Actually, in the remarks, we talked about water treatment and we had a very strong, in our minds, a very strong Q1. And that really transferred over into April. Clean water is a critical element in the consumer's minds right now. And having the ability for us, one of the things in our water treatment, we have several channels that we market in. And this has proved to be a nice advantage for us, be it going through e-commerce, going through a dealer network, DIY, providing those opportunities to the various consumers played out really well in Q1 and we think will play out as we go forward into Q2. Operator : Your next is from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stephens. Robert McCarthy : Hi. Good morning everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Chuck Lauber : Good morning. Robert McCarthy : How are you doing? All right. So I guess first on China. Could you just talk and amplify some of your existing commentary about the cost actions you took in the narrative in the back half the last year and the incremental cost actions you have taken now? And how that's changed or what's accelerated? What's the difference? And then is there any granularity as to the negative margin you put up this quarter that could give us a better sense of the components of the loss, because that's a pretty sizeable loss? Chuck Lauber : Yes. So let start with the cost actions and I will take it by category. So headcount reduction, when we were on January's call, we talked about the fact that we were targeting 20% to happen through the first half of the year. And we have achieved that 20% and we are looking at some further headcount, if necessary. So we are looking very close at headcount as well as watching the consumer demand. We really increased our selling and our advertising expense. So the increase there is the 1,000 stores and we are looking at our footprint. We are targeting to take out further selling in offline infrastructure costs. Robert McCarthy : Okay. And then I guess as a follow-up, just a cash flow statement. Could you just give a sense of what's really been the change in current asset liabilities for three months 2020 versus 2019? Just give me some complexion around the conversion there in terms of what's going on in inventories and receivables? Chuck Lauber : Yes. Inventories are up slightly. I would say, the biggest swing in cash flow is just some timing of some volume incentive payments that occurred in the first quarter last year that will occur in the second quarter this year. Let me go back to China for a second because you mentioned about, I think you mentioned it was a pretty large decrement. The volume really matters in China when you get to that level. So we have been kind of consistently talking about, when volume goes down using a 50% decrement, I think it falls in line pretty close to that. Q1 was not much time for the China team to react. Q1 was very abrupt and leaving the spring holiday for the Chinese New Year expecting to be back in a week and not returning for several weeks. So reacting on cost in Q1 was quite difficult, particularly paying employees and doing all the right things that we did for safety. So it you not easy to make quick action or take quick action in Q1. But the 50% decrement held pretty true in Q1. We curtailed all the advertising that we could in promotions because it just didn't make sense to promote while people were not in the retail environment. So as I mentioned earlier, Q1 50% before the festival and then sequentially better. So we are watching the orders in April very closely and we are going to watch as we go into may to see what we can expect as the year progresses. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Ryan Connors with Boenning & Scattergood. Ryan Connors : Great. Thanks for taking my question. How you are all well. You too, Ryan. Ryan Connors : Thanks. Yes. I wondered if you could talk about the impact of all this on your channel partners and sort of the channel inventory situation in North America? I mean many of your distributors are small businesses. Certainly, the professional plumbers that they serve are small businesses. So presumably, their financial wherewithal to hold inventory may have been compromised in many cases. So how does that impact you? Will there be some requirement that you utilize more of your balance sheet to finance inventory going forward? Or any thoughts on that? Chuck Lauber : Yes. So many of our customers are also essential businesses in today's environment and continue to operate. We know that their volumes are lower because they have had to adjust to curbside pickup in some cases and other scenarios which has hurt their business. Certainly, water heaters are very important part of their business, also very important part of the replacement business. So that's more steady than some of the other discretionary spending that people would have for the other products that they carry. We are watching it close. If you go back to the recession and use that as our experience level, we saw very, very little interruption during the recession. We would hope and expect that some of the smaller distributors or customers that we serve would be able get some assistance through the government programs that are out there. But we are watching it very close. At this point in time, we haven't seen any indications of any slow-up or any issues in our channels. But we certainly are watching it close. Ryan Connors : Okay. So you don't see any structural change in terms of you having to hold more inventory at your level as opposed to the inventory capability of the channel itself? Kevin Wheeler : This is Kevin. If anything, from 2008 when the great recession hit, there was even more consolidations at some of our customers over that decade or so. And quite frankly, these are the same customers that navigated through the great recession. And basically, almost every one of our customers has been deemed essential and their customers have been deemed essential, so plumbers and so forth. Yes, some sales were down, but there has been, we have had to make no really adjustments to the way we do business with them other then making sure that they have product to serve the consumer and the commercial entities when necessary. And they have been navigating through it pretty well. And again, we stay close to them. Our sales force is virtually talking to them on a pretty regular basis. But yes, as a whole, I think I would be very comfortable saying most of our distributors and retailers and even our dealers are navigating through this current environment. And again, we will have to see how it plays out the rest of the year. But for the most part, everybody's doing business, a modified business, but nothing exceptionally different. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Susan Maklari : Good morning. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Chuck Lauber : Good morning. Susan Maklari : My first question is, can you talk a little bit to the decremental margins in North America? And especially as we think about it from a residential perspective as well as the commercial, just given the varying trends that you talked to there? Kevin Wheeler : Yes. We look at the margin incremental and decremental margins as about 30%, roughly, on the residential side. Commercial would be a bit higher. But this is a little different, right, because some of this disruption is pretty abrupt, some of it's stop-start, some of it is a little bit more costly. But that's ballpark. Susan Maklari : Okay. That's helpful. And then following up on that, you mentioned that the rate of declines that you saw during the housing downturn in 2008, can you talk to the mix shift that you also see with that? And maybe how you are thinking about mix shift in the U.S. coming through as we exit the virus and get into more of a recessionary period? Chuck Lauber : You know, back in that time, I don't believe we saw much of a mix shift at all. There may have been a slight, depending upon where the housing was located, typically some of the stronger markets are electric markets currently, when you go to Florida and some of those other geographic areas. But we wouldn't expect a significant mix shift. It's typically a like-for-like exchange on the water heater side on the residential side. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies. Saree Boroditsky : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Saree Boroditsky : So you talked about the impact from construction closures on commercial water heaters and boilers. Could you just provide any color on what you are seeing in regions with extreme shutdowns in North America, such as the Northeast versus regions that are less impacted by the shutdowns? Kevin Wheeler : Yes. I would tell you, this is Kevin, you just said, up in the Northeast, New York, that area took aggressive measures to shutdown a lot of their job sites. We are seeing some of that on the West Coast as well in California. And so, those are the areas and quite frankly we are starting to see some of those start to be released and coming back to work. But it was very regional and particularly very heavy in the areas, as you would expect like New York where the COVID-19 was having a serious impact. Saree Boroditsky : Is there a way to quantify the decline seen there versus some other regions so we can kind of get a sense of what underlying demand be versus COVID-19 impacts? Kevin Wheeler : I don't think we can get that granular with you as far as, again as we talked about, even our backlog that we have which is a nice backlog, those dates continue to move. We stay in contact with our customers and our buy and sell reps to kind of the best view going forward. But it's really early. Until these markets really open up, not just gradually open up, we are going to need to see some kind of run rate here before we can really give you a definitive response. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Nathan Jones : Good morning everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Chuck Lauber : Good morning. Nathan Jones : I just would like to follow-up to a comment you made, I think it was Rob's question about reacting on cost in China and how difficult that was due to the abruptness of the shutdown and that it happened so quickly. Could you contrast that with your ability to adjust the cost structure in North America depending on what we see going forward here? Chuck Lauber : Yes. You know, the biggest contrast in my mind is that we would expect that big of a drop in North America because of the replacement business being a larger percentage of the business in China. So I want to just kind of start with that statement. And we have got a little bit more flexibility probably when you look at some of the programs that Kevin outlined as we go forward to make adjustments. So that would probably be our ability to maneuver a little quicker. In China, we paid everybody 100% in Q1, a very difficult restart. The country was pretty hard close for a longer period of time. And we will have to see what happens in the U.S. Hopefully, we won't experience resurgence and hopefully that we will see the country continue to open up. Nathan Jones : Okay. That's helpful. And then a question on cash flow. The working capital for the remainder of the year, would you assume that that's going to be a source of cash, 2Q through 4Q? And any guidance you can give us on what you think the kind of cash conversion numbers are going to look like for 2020? Chuck Lauber : I am not going to frame it from an amount, but working capital, we are not going to pressure inventories a great deal right now in this environment. We are going to make sure we are caring inventories adequately to cover our needs. We may even increase a bit in certain areas where we would like to make sure we have safety stocks. In China, we would expect that there would be some growth because we have got expectation that we are going to see a little bit of growth over the course of the year. So not frame a number, but working capital, I wouldn't expect a lot of help on working capital for the back half of the year but we will watch it closely. Operator : Operator : And your next will come from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stephens. Robert McCarthy : Sorry. I am glutton for punishment. So I guess the next question is, maybe you can just comment qualitatively, I know historically, your gross margin in China has always been higher than North America, even with the price increases we saw just really over last four or five years. But clearly given what you have been seeing now, can you structurally still make that statement? Or are we starting to see some material dilution in gross margin in China? Chuck Lauber : Well, Q1, the gross margin in China was lower than our historical 40%. So Q1 certainly was, there was a couple things driving it. It's the dramatic volume shifts, that number one and the cost associated with that. And we have been talking about some of the mid-price pressure on margin. We have introduced a lot of mid-priced products or a number of upper mid-priced products that we are very, very happy about that are being well received. However, we have got some cost-out programs that are still yet to come on a couple of those. So when you look at Q1, yes, China actually was lower than our historical average gross profit. Robert McCarthy : And do you think it's still credible? I mean because I think you have been talking about the replacement cycle in China developing over time. And obviously, up until 18 months ago, you just an incredible success story in China. But you talked about the replacement market kind of developing and I think the replacement market maybe, if memory serves, is in the 40% to 50%, maybe 40% of the market as of, I don't know, 12 to 18 months ago. But given the interventions of these mid-priced product and what's going on, is it suffice to say that perhaps you can take a pause here? Or is it even the right thing to think about replacement market when you have this kind of switching to a lower price product? Chuck Lauber : Well, I will do my best to try to answer that. One, the replacement market is about 40% to 50%. So you are in line there. And 50% in the Tier 1, Tier 2 cities. And when you get out to the other lower tier cities, it's about 40%. And again, I would go back to, we still have again products for mid-price up to premium. We continue to drive both sides of the business. We are bringing new products to market, both in gas, electric and of course water treatment. But on the water heater side, there is a strong preference for like-for-like. and that's no different than in the U.S. If you take out a product, you are probably leaning towards putting one similar in. So the way I look at the replacement market, again it's a nice buffer for us that we are not relying on new constructions and so forth. And we think it's going to be, today it's 50%. We believe it's going to be a real advantage for us as that continues to grow throughout the year. So I don't see the mid-price point and the premium price point at odds with each other. They are just serving different types of consumers. Operator : And there are no other questions. I will now turn the call back over to Patricia Ackerman. Patricia Ackerman : Thank you ladies and gentlemen for joining us today. That concludes our session. and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Now, I would like to hand the conference over to your first speaker for today, Ms. Patricia Ackerman, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability and Treasurer. Thank you. Please go ahead madam. Patricia Ackerman : Thank you, Michelle. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to A. O. Smith second quarter 2020 results conference call. Joining me today are Kevin Wheeler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin with Kevin's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include among others matters that we have described in this morning's press release and on slide 2. On slide 3, in order to provide improved transparency into the operating results of our business, we provided non- GAAP measures : adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted segment earnings that exclude the severance and restructuring charges related to aligning our business to current market conditions. Reconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and also on our website. Also, as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. I will now turn the call over to Kevin, who will begin our prepared remarks on slide 4. Kevin Wheeler : Thank you, Pat. Before I summarize the quarter and Chuck goes through the results, I want to express how proud I am of our global team. We faced challenges and complexities to our business that we have never faced before. Our number one goal was and remains to keep our employees safe while delivering our essential products to our customers. I say confidently that our team met and often exceeded my expectations. Thank you to the men and women in the A. O. Smith family around the world for your dedication, and your spirit you truly make A. O. Smith a remarkable company. The business performed in the second quarter is largely in line with what we saw in April. Continuing the pace of growth we saw in the first quarter, our North America water treatment business, organically grew 19%. Direct-to-consumer and retail sales were particularly strong as consumers became more health-conscious during the pandemic and the shelter-in-place orders confined many of us to our homes. As expected, industry volumes of residential water heaters in the U.S. held up notably well. Based on our June shipments, we estimate industry volumes are flat to slightly less than the quarter compared to last year. Due to construction project delays and postponements in North America, we saw commercial water heater and boiler volumes decline in line with our estimates of the industry declines of 20% to 25% in the quarter compared with last year. Consumer demand for our products in China was flat to slightly positive compared to the second quarter of 2019, as restaurants and shopping malls reopened and retail foot traffic increased. We remained operational with no significant disruptions. Our Ju\u00e1rez Mexico plant, which we voluntarily closed in April, reopened in May and ramped up production of the latter portion of the quarter. We have taken numerous and meaningful steps to protect our employees, suppliers and customers in the pandemic. These important steps in many cases reduced efficiencies include : continuous communication and training to our employees on living and working safely in a COVID-19 world; plan accommodations and reconfiguration to maintain social distancing; masks for all employees; implementation of sanitizing stations; temperature taking; and regular proactive deep cleaning and sanitization of our facilities. Our global supply chain remained operational. We continue to monitor and manage our ability to operate effectively as tariffs and the evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related stresses on the supply chain and periodic marketplace disruptions impact our operation. To align our business with current market conditions, primarily in China and to a lesser extent in North America, we reduced headcount and incurred other restructuring costs totaling $6 million in the second quarter. I will now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on the quarter beginning on slide 5. Chuck Lauber : Thank you, Kevin. Second quarter 2020 sales of $664 million, declined 13% compared to the second quarter of 2019. The decline in sales was largely due to lower water heater volumes in China and lower commercial water heater and boiler volumes in North America driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of lower sales, second quarter 2020 adjusted earnings of $73 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.45 declined significantly compared with the same period of 2019. Please turn to slide 6. Sales in our North America segment of $481 million declined 8% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Organic growth of approximately 19% North America water treatment sales was more than offset by lower commercial water heater volumes, lower boiler volumes and a water heater sales mix composed of more electric models, which have a lower selling price. Rest of the World segment sales of $190 million declined 24% compared to the same quarter of 2019. China sales declined 20% in local currency related to higher mix of mid-price products and further reductions in customer inventory levels. Consumer demand for our products in China was flat to slightly positive compared with the second quarter of 2019. China currency translation negatively impacted sales by approximately $6 million. Our sequential sales in China improved through the quarter and China was profitable in May and June. India sales declined significantly as the economy was shut down during the majority of the quarter to minimize the spread of the virus. On slide 7, North America adjusted segment earnings of $108 million were 12% lower than segment earnings in the same quarter in 2019. The decline in earnings was driven by lower volumes of commercial water heaters, lower boiler volumes and a mixed skew to electric water heaters. Certain costs directly related to the pandemic, including temporarily moving production from Mexico to the U.S., paying employees during temporary plant shutdowns, facility cleaning, paying benefits for furloughed employees and other costs were $5.5 million in the second quarter. Adjusted earnings exclude $2.2 million in pre-tax severance costs. As a result, second quarter 2020 segment -- adjusted segment margin for -- of 22.4% declined from 23.5% achieved in the same period last year. Rest of the World adjusted segment loss of $2 million declined significantly compared with 2019 second quarter segment earnings of $22 million. The unfavorable impact to profits from lower China sales and a higher mix of mid-price products which have lower margins more than offset the benefits to profits from lower SG&A expenses. These results exclude $3.9 million in pre-tax severance and restructuring costs. As a result of these factors, adjustment segment margin was negative compared with 9% in the same quarter of 2019. Our corporate expenses of $10 million and interest expense of $3 million were similar to last year. Please turn to slide 8. Cash provided by operations of $179 million during the first half of 2020 was higher than $144 million in the same period of 2019 as a result of lower investment in working capital, including deferral of our April estimated federal income tax payment to July, which was partially offset by lower earnings compared with the year ago period. Our liquidity and balance sheet remained strong. We had cash balances totaling $569 million and our net cash position was $288 million at the end of June. Our leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter was 14.5% as measured by total debt to total capital. We had $332 million of undrawn borrowing capacity on our $500 million revolver. Within the second quarter, in our share repurchase activity continues to be suspended. During the first half of 2020, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of common stock for a total of $57 million. Please advance to slide 9. We've introduced our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance this morning with a range of between $1.72 to $1.86 per share. Our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance excludes $0.03 per share in severance and restructuring costs included -- that were incurred in the second quarter. Our adjusted guidance assumes that conditions of our business environment and that of our suppliers and customers is similar for the remainder of the year to what we are currently experiencing and does not deteriorate as a result of further restrictions or shutdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect our cash flow from operations in 2020 to be approximately $350 million compared with $456 million in 2019, primarily due to lower earnings. Our 2020 capital spending plans are between $60 million and $70 million and our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $80 million. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $47 million in 2020 slightly higher than 2019 primarily due to lower interest income on investments. We expect our interest expense to be $9 million in 2020, compared with $11 million in 2019. Our effective income tax rate is expected to be between 23% and 23.5% since 2020. Our assumption to assume no additional share repurchase, resulting in an average diluted outstanding shares in 2020 of approximately $162.5 million. I'll now turn the call over to Kevin, who will summarize our guidance assumptions beginning on slide 10. Kevin Wheeler : Okay. Thank you, Chuck. Our outlook for 2020 includes the following assumptions : We project U.S. residential water heater, industry volumes will be flat in 2020 driven by resilient, replacement demand and similar levels of new construction \u2013 home constructions as last year. We expect commercial industry water heater volumes will decline approximately 10% as job sites and business closures, due to the pandemic delay or defer new construction and discretionary replacement installation. It is encouraging to see consumer demand for our China product similar, if not a little higher than last year over the last four months. We are also seeing sequentially quarterly improvement in market share both online and offline for water heater and water treatment products, driven by our mid-price range products. We took additional charges in Q2 for further restructuring of the business. We believe these restructuring charges are largely behind us. We continue to target closure of 1,000 existing stores, while targeting to open 500 small store relationships in Tier 4 through 6 cities. Cost actions and restructuring activity are projected to result in $35 million of savings in 2020 over 2019, $15 million of which will be realized in the second half of 2020. We expect year-over-year declines in local currency sales of 18% to 20% and protract sequential quarter-over-quarter growth in the second half of the year as China appears to be making sustainable progress in reopening their economy and keeping the virus in check. We expect our North America boiler sales will decline approximately 10% for the full year. Commercial boilers represent 65% to 70% of our boiler sales. With many job sites temporary closed during the second quarter, we believe as job sites reopen, the orders will sequentially improve in the second half of the year. We project 20% to 22% sales growth in our North America water treatment products, which include incremental water right sales. We ended 2019 with a $2.6 million loss in India, and expect a similar loss in 2020 as a result of the pandemic. Please advance to slide 11. We project revenue will decline by 7% to 8% in 2020 as strong organic North America water treatment sales and resilient North America residential water heater volumes are more than offset by weaker North America commercial water heater and boiler volumes and lower China sales, largely due to the pandemic. We expect North America segment margin to be between 22.5% and 23% and Rest of World segment margins to be negative 1% to negative 2.5%. Please turn to slide 12. We believe particularly in these uncertain times A.O. Smith is a compelling investment for a number of reasons. We have leading share positions in our major product categories. We estimate replacement demand represents approximately 80% to 85% of U.S. water heater and boiler volumes. We have a strong premium brand in China a broad product offering in our key product categories, broad distribution and a reputation for quality and innovation in that region. Over time, we are well positioned to maximize favorable demographics in both China and India to enhance shareholder value. We have strong cash flow and balance sheet supporting the ability to continue to invest for the long term with investments in automation, innovation and new products, as well as acquisitions and return cash to shareholders. We will continue to proactively manage our business in this uncertain environment. We see improving consumer demand trends emerge in China, where we were first impacted by the pandemic and see China operations pivot to profitability for the remainder of the year. In North America, as the economy begins to reemerge at the economic shutdown persistent COVID-19 cases and related potential implications to returning to a more stable environment in the market workplace and supply chain will continue to be challenging throughout the remainder of the year. We have a strong and dedicated team, which has navigated successfully through prior downturns, and I'm confident in our ability to execute similarly through COVID-19. That concludes our prepared remarks, and then we are now available for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc. Your line is open. Jeff Hammond : Hi, good morning, everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning, Jeff. Chuck Lauber : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Hammond : Just want to dig in on this China dynamic. Sales down 20% and I think you said consumer demand was flat. So just help me square those two things. I know you mentioned mix and destock just maybe parse those out. And what's the expectation for this mix dynamic, and kind of inventory destocking to continue into the second half? Chuck Lauber : Okay. So, we're down \u2013 you're right it's about 20%, when you take out the FX. So right for the quarter, we're down 20%. There's two main pieces. One is mix and the other you're right is the destock. If you just kind of look at the mix of that 20% roughly a-third, less than half is related to sales mix. So you kind of -- you just get into that category of a little less than half to maybe one-third of that 20%. The rest is really destock and consumer demand. So it's -- inventories came down again in the channel inventory in China. So we were a little bit surprised it came down as much as they did. We don't project them to continue to decrease. They are now in the two to three-month range when we recalibrate to kind of what we see 2020 to be at. So on our forward looking, we think they're about as low as they're going to go they could go lower, but that's what our projection is. Jeff Hammond : And the mix dynamic in the second half, should that continue? Chuck Lauber : The mix dynamic is a little unique I think in Q2, right? So we've got -- our online sales were strong. So if you look at our online sales, they were 30% of our total revenue in Q2 and actually up quarter-over-quarter slightly, so online sales put a little bit more pressure on the mid-price products. As you know they kind of -- there's more mid-priced -- upper mid-price products on the online than there is in the offline. We would expect there'll continue to be pressure on mix going forward, but we would also hope and we expect sequential improvement in volumes and would hope that the offline market would grow a bit. And it might be a little bit improved over that, but we'll have to kind of see how that plays out. Jeff Hammond : Okay. And then just -- it looks like you got to do $30 million to $35 million in op profit in the second half in China to get your margin target. Is that strictly volume improvement from here? Or is there something else that's driving that profit improvement? Chuck Lauber : Well, it's two things. There's some volume improvement. So we've seen sequentially China improve month-over-month and we expect it to continue quarter-over-quarter. So we do expect growth in the back half of the year. We're -- if you parse out the math, we expect China to grow year-over-year in low single digits maybe in that 5% range. And then on top of that as Kevin mentioned, we've got cost reduction programs that we put in place. It's about $35 million for the year, and we expect $15 million of that to drop into the back half probably pretty even per quarter those savings. Jeff Hammond : Okay, great. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Scott Graham of Rosenblatt. Your line is open. Scott Graham : Yes. Hi, good morning to Kevin, Chuck and Pat. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning, Scott. Chuck Lauber : Good morning. Scott Graham : So, I just wanted to make sure just, sort of, like a housekeeper. The COVID $5.5 million, you did not pull that out. That is in your North American 22.4% right? Chuck Lauber : You are correct. It is in our -- it's in our numbers. The only thing we adjusted out was $0.03 on severance and restructuring. Scott Graham : Yeah, got it. I'm hoping you could maybe tell us a little bit more about the China percent of sales to premium in water heaters versus the percent to upper price point. I'm just wondering what that pie chart looks like right now? Chuck Lauber : Sure. Let me frame it. And as I mentioned just to Jeff, I mean it's a little unusual quarter because we got a little heavier mix on online. But just to, kind of, frame it let me go with the definition first though at mid-price as we're defining it for this information is on the electric it would be less than RMB3,000 and then on the gas it would be less than RMB5,000. So that's what we're considering in this kind of calculation at mid-price. If you go back two years ago, the percent of our sales that would fall into that category below those two thresholds is in that 25% to 40% range. If you, kind of, walk it forward to a year ago it is in that 35% to 55%. And then if you go to Q2, which again a little bit heavier online percentage than normal it's in the 55% to 70% range. So it's grown because we've reintroduced products into that category, which we feel now we've got the full range of products filled in there. Kevin Wheeler : Scott, I would just want to dovetail on what Chuck said is, we've been working over a year plus to fill those mid-priced categories and now we're there. So as we go forward, we look for our mix to hopefully move more towards our premium sector. But it was important for us from an overall perspective to compete both online and offline to have those mid-price products, which by the way are the upper mid part of the range in our product offering. So again going forward, I think as Chuck mentioned this is probably a low point when it comes to how many mid-price or a high point for mid-priced products should we look forward to see our mix shifting back maybe not to where it was in the past, but mix in higher to premium products. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Susan Maklari of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Susan Maklari : Thank you. Good morning. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Susan Maklari : My first question is just can you give us some color on the mix shift in the U.S.? I noticed in your press release you commented that that's kind of turned a bit negative more towards the electric side of things on the consumer business. Can you just give us some comments on how that has been coming together and your thoughts on the back half for mix? Kevin Wheeler : Yes, this is Kevin. If you look at our industry, we do have periodically some mix shifts for various reasons. The way we would look at this is from our perspective the Northeast has been one of the hardest hit. You go to New York, New Jersey, Boston those areas, Massachusetts have probably been the hardest hit when it comes to COVID-related shutdowns. That just so happens to be one of our strongest gas markets. So that could be part of it. We've also had strong growth in India with our customer base in a stronger electric markets. So the two kind of caused the shift -- the temporary shift. If I look at it though and look forward, we haven\u2019t seen any real systemic changes in the market. And over time I would expect that our mix would normalize over the year or into next year. Susan Maklari : Okay. That's helpful. And then just following up can you give us some color on raw material inputs? Steel prices seem to be a slight advantage for you in the quarter. But how should we think about that going out over the next few quarters as well? Chuck Lauber : Well I mean if you look at steel and 70% of our steel is cold rolled, 30% is hot rolled and we see kind of a delay in the cost of that 90 to 120 days. So if we kind of just take a data point of spot prices today and compare them to a year ago second quarter, we're down about 5%. So that kind of frames how to think about it. Steel has been lower, I guess for a couple of quarters now, but it has edged down a bit. Operator :   Next question is from the line of Bryan Blair of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Q \u2013 Bryan Blair : Good morning, everyone. Hope you are doing well? Patricia Ackerman : Hi, Bryan. Chuck Lauber : Hey, Bryan. Same to you. Q \u2013 Bryan Blair : Chuck, I believe you've mentioned breakeven revenue for China in the $55 million $60 million per month range in recent past and being profitable in May and June, would kind of validate that. Is that still the right range to think about? And then as we look forward beyond the structural savings that will come through in the back half, how should we think about incrementals as China revenue moves higher? Chuck Lauber : Yes. So you're exactly right. I mean that breakeven point is in that $55 million to $60 million. We're pleased that we saw it in May and June. We'd expect we're going to be profitable going forward. So we still see that as the range. We've got to continue to look at the structure. And we have taken a look at the structure and the restructuring charge we took of about -- it's about $4 million in China will result in some savings going forward. So the incrementals are probably in that 45% -- 40% to 45% range I would say. Q \u2013 Bryan Blair : Okay. I appreciate that. And really nice growth in water treatment. Can you remind us of run rate profitability there? And structurally where you think margin can climb as that business continues to scale? Chuck Lauber : Yes. Run rate profitability Q1 we were at 9%; Q2 we're about 8%. We see it continuing to be that for the rest of the year. We're still looking at cost reductions. We've got a little SAP implementation happening this quarter. So there's some costs that are going to burden it a little bit in the back half, but we still see that just approaching 10% this year. So we're pleased with water treatment. The order rate has been strong. I mean we were up 19% to 20% for the quarter. And when we look into July, we see the same strength in orders. It's at that same rate. A \u2013 Kevin Wheeler : Yes. I'd just make another comment on that as far as the growth has been strong and it looks to be continuing. And then just keep in mind there's a consumable part of this as we go forward and continue to put out our point-of-use in order entry type of products. That seeds the consumables as we go forward over the next few years. So there's a lot of positive trends in our water treatment business. And even as you look at it today even softeners are starting to come back as our dealers are learning how to sell in a COVID environment and using digital and how they're installing and so forth. They've made a remarkable shift in their selling methods and it's proven to be effective so far through July. Operator :   Our next question is from the line of Matt Summerville of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Matt Summerville : Thanks. A couple of questions. I want to get back to the electric impact. Can you -- North America was down 8%. Can you sort of parse out what the impact of that shift was on revenue? And what the operating margin impact may have been there as well? Chuck Lauber : Yes. We're just tracking down the impact of revenue. The percentage is really the same for gas or electric. So I mean the percentage runs roughly the same. It's really just a step function as far as sales dollars and then margin dollars. I don't have a good answer on mix, but I mean it's probably in that 10% to 15% of the total decrease. When you look at the decrease in margin of the 8% it's probably 10% to 15% of that. Matt Summerville : And then have you begun to see in your order book as of late looking into June, July, any evidence that these delayed construction projects are indeed coming back online? Have you actually that take place in your order book? Chuck Lauber : I think it's too early to see that. When we look at -- and I'm thinking about Lochinvar boilers at this point. But when you look at kind of the order quoting rate out in the marketplace, it is down a bit. The quoting rate is lower than what it has been but there's still activity out there. And orders coming back online I think it's a little early. And when we look at though just commercial water heating, Kevin talked about the decline in the second quarter. We have seen some uptick in order rates on commercial water heating. So, if you look at Q2 compared to what we saw in July, we see July up about 4% to 5% on commercial orders. So that -- I mean probably it's some delayed replacement that's coming back online and we would expect that to continue. So, I mean when we kind of think about commercial and it's both commercial water heater and boilers the front half of the year looks a lot like the back half of the year. We're down roughly 10% with a lot of disruption on boilers in the second quarter, but we expect some of that to come back online and particularly since our boiler season is a little strong in the fourth quarter. Kevin Wheeler : Yes, I think that's the key takeaway here. As we get closer to the colder months and so forth that's where we see again schools and businesses start to fire up their boilers. So, it's a little early. We do have a reasonably strong backlog that we're still working through and we'll probably have a better view. But if you talk to our reps who are on the ground they'll tell you that they're -- they expect the sites to reopen. They expect to see some projects move forward and that's kind of our assumption as we go forward the rest of the year. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ryan Connors of Boenning & Scattergood. Your line is open. Ryan Connors : Hey, great. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to actually talk a little bit about the sort of channel impact -- channel situation given everything that's going on. Obviously, many of your distributors are relatively smaller businesses. So, in some cases presumably there could be some balance sheet pressures and other issues. How has that impacted your wholesale business in terms of your own need to hold inventory, payment terms, et cetera? Any impact there -- anything that's evolving as this goes on with the channel? Chuck Lauber : Well, most of our customers if not all of our customers in the channel our essential businesses remained open like we did and continue to operate maybe with curbside pickup and other activities. So, we've been fortunate that most of our customers have fared pretty well from the perspective that they've been able to operate in a difficult time. We haven't seen significant impact on payment terms or any other ability of our customers to pay. Some of the smaller ones can qualify for loans. So there's opportunities for them to do that. So, at this point we fared pretty well. Our customers have fared pretty well. We have seen on -- particularly, on the commercial side some destocking. So, we've seen our customers work on maybe taking a little bit of their balance sheet down, cutting a little bit on the inventory side, particularly with higher cost commercial product. And we believe some of what we've seen in order rates and maybe it has been impacted by that maybe in the industry too just some adjustments within inventory within the channel. Kevin Wheeler : Yes, I would just add on to that. I mean you talked about construction talked about reopening. And of course all our distributors are also good at business and balancing their inventories. So, I wonder I would tell you that all of our distributors for the most part are managing through it. They've been through the financial crisis and they've come out of it. And at the same time they're going to adjust their inventories to the current demand. And so as we go forward and demand does pick up I would expect them to adjust those inventories appropriately going forward. So, overall, we have a tremendous customer base with legacies of 20, 30, 40 years, strong put positions in the market and they're navigating through fairly well based on the information we're getting from our sales organization. Ryan Connors : Got it. And then my follow-up was just really following up on the earlier discussion of water treatment. It really seems like you are building some pretty strong momentum there at this point in terms of the organic growth. Can you talk about just what is driving that? Is that more the market growth given all the PFOS concerns and lead and all that? Or is that share gain with your big box channel? I mean where is that growth coming from? If you can kind of give us some flavor there? Kevin Wheeler : Well, you actually outlined it pretty well. I think it's coming from all the things that you mentioned. Certainly, the pandemic has heightened people's awareness. But I would tell you at the same time I believe our water treatment team is executing very well. Through the process we've updated websites, our consumer engagement process is much better. We have a telesales activity. So, there's a number of foundational things that we put in to improve e-commerce to improve our dealer network. On top of the consumer becoming more aware of some health issues and particularly on water treatment, we're also executing, I think, at a higher level than we were last year, which I think is critical for us to go forward. And our close rates are up and that kind of ties in with our sales as well. So, overall, the water treatment business is doing well, but it's not just a combination of the market. It's a combination of execution as well. In water treatment, we don't have the data that we have, say, in water heaters. But if you look at -- we do get some information on water quality from our water quality association that tracks softener balance in tanks. Now that is a little old, because of the pandemic they haven't been able to update it. But we're up 20% plus in the market at the time that we had the data, which is, I believe, in February was flat. So, we are taking -- I believe, we're taking some share. We'll need some more time to validate that. But, yes, it's going well, but it's a combination of market and our team executing at a much higher level than we had in the past. Chuck Lauber : Yes. This is Chuck. I mean, I mentioned earlier that we've seen July demand continues strong and we've seen a better mix of some of our installed products, as people are more comfortable with installers, dealers getting into home. So if you kind of look through kind of the end of June or July time frame, the softener mix in some of the larger products, we've just seen that come back a bit. Operator : Your next question is from the line of David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Your line is open. David MacGregor : Hey, good morning, everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Chuck Lauber : Good morning. David MacGregor : I wanted to ask about Lochinvar. And you'd mentioned that quoting activity was down a little at this point, although, there's still some uncertainty, I suppose, with where that's going according to your comments. But under that situation or that scenario, one might sort of expect a higher level of competitive pricing pressure and just a more vigorous level of competition from some of the other players in the space. So, I wonder if you could just talk a little about what you're seeing on that side of the Lochinvar story? And also, to the extent you could talk about what you're seeing in terms of the mix of units sold within Lochinvar? And what might be changing there? Kevin Wheeler : Well, as far as, from a competition standpoint, we deal with that on a regular basis. We haven't seen much change from how we quote and how we can go to market. We\u2019ve had to get a little creative about how we do sales calls and engineering calls on Zoom. But, overall, not much change there. We've had a nice mix towards some of our crest boilers, which are the higher BTU-type products, which are in larger applications. So we saw that come back this year, quite well. So, yes, overall, again, I go back to the business. We're heading into our stronger half of the year. There's still some uncertainties there that we've outlined, but we're in a position to capitalize as the markets do open up. And I think it's really important, as we've been working our way through the pandemic, we've kept our operations ready to be prepared to come out of it as sales grow and as the markets reopen. So, overall, operational, we're in position to take care of our customers. And normally, there's a little bit of emergency activity that happens in the second half of the year, where people need things right away and we're positioning ourselves to take care of that as well. Chuck Lauber : Maybe just a little more color on mix too. And Kevin is exactly right. We've seen some of the larger boilers a little heavier in the mix in the second quarter. We've talked before about residential being light. So when we look at residential in Q1, it was a warmer winter and it was pretty light for us in the industry. Second, July activity is really kind of hard to read. We've can always -- typically, and we've done it this year again as we've got an early buy program. So, early buy program is specifically for residential boilers and that's running. We're seeing orders come in pretty well. We're fairly pleased with how that is typically playing out. So hard to read what's happening in July, but the residential orders on the early buy program might be running slightly less than last year, but it's not done yet and we're pretty pleased with how that's playing out. David MacGregor : Okay. Thanks for that color. Just a second question on China. And you had mentioned the shift towards more medium price points. So thanks very much for providing the detail on that mix. I know, it's something we've discussed in the past. I guess, the question is, with regard to capacity utilization rates, which I'm guessing right now, you've got plenty of headroom, but as you shift more to medium price point, what impact does that have on capacity and your need to invest CapEx in those facilities? Chuck Lauber : I would tell you right now, there's -- we do have plenty of capacity and operating leverage going forward. As you probably know we have three large facilities in China. And being where we're at today from our top line sales where we were, say a couple of years ago we'd be a plenty of capacity to handle it. So, there is -- we see no need for really additional capital from the production side of the business going forward for several years. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Nathan Jones of Stifel. Your line is open. Nathan Jones : Good morning, everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning, Nathan. Chuck Lauber : Good morning. Nathan Jones : I just wanted to follow-up a little bit on Ryan's questions, on water quality. That's a pretty fragmented market here in the U.S. Can you talk about where you think your market share is? What kind of market share targets you would have? And strategically thinking is this more of a build versus buy an organic growth versus roll off the market? Or do you see opportunities here to go about consolidating this market? And are there big advantages to that scale? Chuck Lauber : Well, I mean, it's tough for us to get a detailed handle on share, right? And you're right it is a fragmented market. I mean, we think, the addressable market when we kind of look at it in a couple of different ways, it's about a $2 billion market. So clearly there's opportunity for us to continue to expand our position. It's both, when you say, is it a build versus buy, I think, there are opportunities on both. We've entered -- our strategy is we've gotten into leveraging the channels that, we're in. So we've got the direct-to-consumer channel through Aquasana. And the Amazon channel through Aquasana. We've also got the dealer channel through the Water-Right acquisition along with the Hague acquisition. We've introduced product into wholesale and we're in retail through those. So we've entered all the channels and we would expect to continue to grow that out on channel expansion -- within those channels over the next several years. M&A, it's certainly an area that we've got our eyes open and we're looking at. So we think there's an opportunity in both. Kevin Wheeler : Yeah. I'll just add a little bit more on to that, its Kevin here. Certainly on the M&A front I think there's plenty of opportunity out there. Again, it's got to fit to where we're taking our strategy. But if you look out I've always said on any call any investor meeting, that the opportunity for -- on the water treatment front is I think an area that we're going to spend a lot of time in. There's opportunity there and there's still ways for us to leverage and consolidate over the long haul. And again A. O. Smith is always looking to make the industry better and raise it up. And we think there's going to be opportunity over time to continue to find those right fits for our business. Nathan Jones : Okay. Another question on China, I mean you guys have talked about the mid-tier priced products being lower margin than the premium, tier product. That's a relatively new introduction for you into China. Is there an opportunity through operational improvement and ramping up the productivity of those lines for you to close that margin gap between the mid-tier and premium tier price products, without just leveraging volume? Chuck Lauber : Yesah there is opportunity. We're working on cost reduction programs within the product, also working on cost reduction programs within the manufacturing process. So certainly you're right, volume would help us but we're coming at it from multiple angles. Nathan Jones : And just one quick one on capital allocation, you guys had started this year with a $200 million target for share repurchase. Based on your projections for the back half of the year cash flow, you're probably going to have about $500 million of cash on the balance sheet. So the balance sheet is going to be a little inefficient. Can you talk about when you think it would be appropriate to reinstate the share repurchase program? If that's next year would you look to kind of catch-up a little bit of the 2020 spending to go along with the 2021 program, if we assume that the markets are in reasonable condition? Chuck Lauber : Yeah. I mean it's a little early for us to reach out and make that call right now. I mean we're watching -- well we typically frame that program historically to not grow cash. And then in this environment we do have a cash projection. And you're right, we're pleased with projecting $350 million for the year. And we feel that right now though there's enough uncertainty out there that we want to just watch it for the next quarter and we'll be back probably talking about it next quarter. Kevin Wheeler : Yeah. I would just add on to that is we still believe there's better opportunities in the market. Acquisitions always are preferred method to invest in. I would like to see how things come out of the pandemic. And we're going to keep an eye on that. And again, we expect there'll be some opportunities. We want to be prepared from a cash position to capitalize, if they arise. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt. Your line is open. Chuck Lauber : Hi Scott. Hello, Scott, are you there? Scott Graham : Yeah. I am sorry about that. I was on -- I muted myself. Chuck Lauber : Okay. Scott Graham : So just a follow-up question on China, so we're shrinking the number of sites there I think by about 1,000 this year. And here we are with the channel destocking unexpectedly. Could one be the cause of the other? How is that? And how are you managing that site reduction? How is that going? Kevin Wheeler : Well, I don't think they're related Scott to be honest with you. One, the 1,000 stores that we keep referring to has to do with unproductive stores and there -- and we've done that over the years, but we've had to close some stores reopen other stores and so forth. So that to me is a productivity market issue because there's a heck of a lot of costs into offline sales and with promoters and so forth. So we -- because of the economic environment there -- certainly it's enhanced this. But -- so that's an independent thing that we do on a regular basis evaluate our stores and close and open appropriately. As far as the stocking it's really up to our distributors to determine what they need in their inventory. And again, I don't think a quarter or a month is something we should really be surprised of some shift. It wasn't a big shift. We're still in that 2 month to 3 month range of inventory. And what's important is that they have the right products in stock and that we're driving business to the consumer to sell-in. We're in great position. I think our distributors are in significantly better positioned than they were say six months to a year ago and our sales are growing. The opportunity to sell more products as the economy reopens is positive. We had the capacity and the lead times to take care of that. So again I think the inventories are just more of a separate business management by our distributors. And we're taking care of the retail stores because it's the right way to manage our cost of sales. Scott Graham : Got you. And then last one on -- back to the North American business with commercial which includes restaurant lodging. It does look like lodging and certainly in spots is coming back fairly strongly. But I think you have to emerge from this with -- we're going to emerge with a smaller restaurant footprint at least for the time being. They always seem to grow back in the out years. But is there a need here to maybe come back to North America and cut some costs on the commercial side both water heaters and boilers given that on a post-COVID basis? How are you looking at that? Chuck Lauber : Yes. I mean we think a lot of that demand that we're seeing in the second quarter and into July is postponement of some replacement going forward. I think it's a little early for us to predict if there's a great deal of change in the footprint of those types of customers. That's a portion of where our water heaters and boilers do go. But we'll continue to watch that. So we'll continue to watch it as it goes forward and see what happens. Right now we expect that's just delayed and there'll be replacement as those businesses start-up. Kevin Wheeler : Yes Scott I think it's a fair point a fair question, but I think it's a little bit early. And so if you look at where our sweet spots are you'd be hitting restaurants and hotels and so forth. Certainly the closures have delayed some of that. But again going forward depending on how we reopen we'll have to see how that plays out. But again the replacement market will be there. And we'll have to see what size it is as we come out the other end. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Kevin Hocevar of Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Kevin Hocevar : Hey. Good morning, everybody. Chuck Lauber : Good morning. Kevin Hocevar : On the water treatment guidance, I guess, I want to understand a little more for the full year 20% to 22% sales growth. It seems to imply a fairly sizable slowing in the growth rate in the back half of the year. But it sounds like the DIY -- well the organic growth in the second quarter seems to be carrying forward into July. And a lot of the companies that have seen DIY strength have seemingly said that that's slowing, but still quite robust and carrying forward. And it sounds like the contractor-based products seem to be getting a bit better. So I guess, I just want to understand what is there a reason to assume that there should be a sizable slowing? Is there some conservatism in there? Just trying to connect the dots there and understand the guidance there going forward for water treatment. Chuck Lauber : Yes. That's a good question. I mean we saw some fair strength coming into the second quarter. We think a lot of that or some of that and we talked a little bit -- Kevin talked a little bit before about the strength in the business is. It's consumer awareness and maybe the shutdown people thinking about their water a little bit more. The DIY channel you're right has been very, very strong. So the second quarter and into July we see a lot of a lot of activity on water treatment a lot of strength. Will that continue as people kind of hopefully get back to a little bit more normal and back to work? We'll have to see how that plays out. So you're right. I mean if you kind of to do the math we're expecting it to soften a bit in the back half and not be exactly that 20% to the high order rates that we're seeing in the current environment. Kevin Hocevar : Okay. Got you. And then on the -- I guess I just wanted to clarify in the opening comments I think you guys mentioned that based on where you see your water heater shipments in June that you think the industry is flat to slightly up. Was that a just a month of June comment? Or was that the full quarter? Because I guess if it's the full quarter it implies June was quite a robust month to offset the slow in April and May's AHRI shipments. And curious how you felt A. O. Smith has done versus the industry in the second quarter and into July? Chuck Lauber : Yes. That comment implies the full quarter. And again we did see a strong June. So that's the impetus going forward. And then as you look at it we've always felt people will do without a water heater for 24 hours that's about it. So that replacement market is still going to be there. And then we've seen decent new construction still holding up over the various markets. So you put those two together that's why we came up with a forecast of residential volume being relatively the same as last year, but you're right it comes off a strong June. Kevin Wheeler : Strong June. And just orders carried forward into July, we still see that playing out similarly. So, residential orders have been healthy. And market share is the same. There's really no shift in market share. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Susan Maklari of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Susan Maklari : Thank you. I just have a few follow-up questions. The first is you mentioned in your commentary that you're in the process of establishing 500 new relationships -- store relationships in China. Can you just give us a little more color on that? It sounds like it's in the Tier 3 to Tier 6 cities. And then how does that kind of balance against the 1,000 store closures that you've done there? Kevin Wheeler : Well, the -- it's Tier 4 to 6 cities and that's where a lot of the growth is. And we have -- those are much smaller stores, but they are in the areas that are growing. So we're working with our customers to establish those relationships to make sure they have the right selling tools and products for that particular environment. And we see the 4 and 6 Tier cities playing a bigger role particularly in the new construction part of the business and in housing. So that's moving. Comparing the 1,000 to the 500 is difficult, because again, there's really not a comparison. The 1,000 are underproductive stores not performing not recovering their costs and so forth. So we're just leaning up that part of our business where the 500 stores, which we've been expanding in Tier 4 and 6 cities for a while now are additional opportunities, they will be certainly less sales volume going through a Tier 4, 6 city store than obviously in a Tier 1, Tier 2 specialty store or retail stores. So there are really two separate actions on our part one is more growth, and one is more cost control. Susan Maklari : And so should we expect that they'll come online over the course of 2020? Or is that more of a 2021 impact in terms of the revenues coming through and some of the benefits? Kevin Wheeler : We expect those to come on throughout 2020. Operator : I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Ms. Patricia Ackerman. Patricia Ackerman : Thank you for joining us today. We plan to participate in two virtual conferences in the third quarter Jefferies' on August 5th and D.A. Davidson's conference on September 22. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect.",

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. After your speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker for today, Patricia Ackerman. Thank you. Please go ahead. Patricia Ackerman : Thank you, Steven. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the A. O. Smith's third quarter 2020 results conference call. Joining me today are Kevin Wheeler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin with Kevin's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning's news release. In order to provide improved transparency into the operating results of our business, we provided non-GAAP measures, adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted segment earnings that exclude the severance and restructuring charges related to aligning our business to current market conditions. Reconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and also on our website. Also as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. I will now turn the call over to Kevin, who will begin our prepared remarks on Slide 4. Kevin Wheeler : Thank you, Pat. Our business has performed well in the third quarter. Continue the pace of growth we saw in the first half of the year, our North America water treatment products grew 19%. All channels direct-to-consumer, retail and dealers contributed to the growth as health conscious consumers continue to drive sales higher. Industry volumes of residential water heaters in the U.S. surged in the third quarter. Based on our September shipments, we estimate industry volumes are up mid-teens in the quarter compared with last year. We believe and overall positive tone to new residential and remodel construction activity and extended lead times driven by pandemic related disruptions may have prompted some channel partners to build inventory during the quarter. Due to construction project delays and postponements in North America, as well as uncertainty surrounding commercial construction, we saw a commercial water heater and boiler volumes decline 9% to 10% in the quarter compared with last year. Consumer demand for our products in China increased by low single digits compared with the third quarter of 2019 as pent-up demand from the lockdown materialize and consumer confidence improved. We remained operational with no significant disruptions within our plants and our supply chain. We did see our North America water heater lead times extend in the second and third quarters due to self-quarantine absenteeism, which we mandated according to our COVID prevention measures. We shifted some production, added shifts, hire temporary workers to improve our lead times, which are now approaching more normal levels. I would like to thank our dedicated employees, who tirelessly worked overtime hours and accommodated shifting schedules to take care of our customers. We have taken numerous and meaningful steps to protect our employees, suppliers and customers in the pandemic. These important steps in many cases reducing efficiencies included open and regular communication with employees and customers in line with our values. Plant accommodations to maintain social distancing, employee temperature taking and regular proactive deep clean and sanitization of our facilities among others. To align our business with current market conditions, a process started in the second quarter. We reduced head count and incurred other restructuring costs totaling $1 million in the third quarter. I will now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on the quarter beginning on Slide 5. Chuck Lauber : Thank you, Kevin. Third quarter 2020 sales of $760 million increased 4% compared to the third quarter of 2019. The increase in sales was largely due to higher residential water heater volumes and water treatment product sales in North America. As a result of higher sales and cost reduction activities earlier this year, third quarter 2020 adjusted earnings of $107 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.66, increased significantly compared with the same period in 2019. Please turn to Slide 6. Sales in our North America segment of $544 million increased 6% compared with the third quarter of 2019. Higher residential water heater volumes and organic growth of approximately 19% in North America water treatment sales more than offset lower commercial water heater volumes and lower boiler sales. Rest of the World sales of $221 million were essentially flat with the same quarter in 2019. China sales were flat as higher consumer demand was offset by a higher mix of mid-price products. China currency translation favorably impacted sales by approximately $4 million. India sales in the quarter declined compared with last year. On Slide 7, North America adjusted segment earnings of $134 million or 10% higher than segment earnings in the same quarter in 2019. The increase in earnings was driven by higher residential water heater volumes, higher water treatment product sales and lower material costs. Lower volumes of commercial water heaters and lower boiler sales partially offset these factors. Adjusted earnings include $500,000 in pre-tax severance costs. As a result third quarter 2020 adjustment segment margin of 24.6% improved from 23.6% achieved in the same period last year. Rest of the World adjustment segment earnings of $18 million increased significantly compared with 2019 third quarter segment earnings of $4 million. In China, higher volumes, reduction in the SG&A costs and approximately $3 million of temporary social insurance contribution exemptions were partially offset by a higher mix of mid-priced products which have lower margin. These results exclude $1.1 million in pre-tax severance and restructuring costs. As a result of these factors, adjusted segment margin improved to 8% compared with 1.9% in the same quarter of 2019. Our corporate expenses of $10.9 million were higher than the same quarter of last year, primarily due to lower interest income. Please turn to Slide 8. Cash provided from operations of $330 million during the first nine months of 2020 was higher than $280 million in the same period of 2019. As a result of lower investments in working capital, which were partially offset by lower earnings compared with the prior year? Our liquidity and balance sheet remains strong. We had cash balances totaling $509 million and our net cash position was $395 million at the end of September. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 6.1% as measured by total debt to total capital. We had $500 million of undrawn borrowing capacity on our $500 million revolver. No shares were repurchased in the quarter and our share repurchase activity continues to be suspended. We repurchased approximately $1.3 million shares of common stock for a total of $57 million earlier this year. Please advance to Slide 9. We upgraded our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance this morning with a range of between $1.95 and $1.98 per share. The midpoint of this range represents an increase of 10% compared with our prior 2020 full year guidance. Our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance excludes $0.04 per share in severance and restructuring costs incurred in the second and third quarters. Our guidance assumes the conditions of our business environment and that of our suppliers and customers is similar for the remainder of the year to what we are experiencing today and does not deteriorate as a result of further restrictions or shutdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect our cash flow from operations in 2020 to be approximately $400 million compared with $456 million in 2019; primarily due to lower earnings. In 2020 capital spending plans are between $50 and $55 million; and our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $80 million in 2020. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $50 million in 2020, higher than 2019 primarily due to lower interest income on investments. We expect our interest expense will be $7.5 million in 2020, compared with $11 million in 2019 due to lower debt level. Our effective income tax is expected to be \u2013 our rate is expected to be between 23% and 23.5% in 2020. Our assumptions assume no additional share repurchase resulting in average diluted outstanding shares in 2020 of approximately $162.5 million. I'll now turn the call back to Kevin, who will summarize our guidance assumptions beginning on Slide 10. Kevin Wheeler : Thanks, Chuck. Our outlook for 2020 includes the following assumptions. We project U.S. residential water heater industry volumes will be up 4% in 2020; driven by a positive new home and new model construction environment. And our belief that the channel added inventory due to extended industry lead times. We believe some destocking will occur in the fourth quarter as our lead times have and continue to improve. We expect commercial industry water heater volumes will decline approximately 10% as the pandemic impacted businesses and temporary closed job sites in the first half of the year, delaying or deferring new construction and discretionary replacement installations. It is encouraging to see consumer demand for our China products slightly higher than last year over the last six months. We took additional charges in Q3 for further restructuring of the business. We believe these restructuring charges are behind this. We continue to target closure of 1,000 existing stores, while target yet opened 500 small store relationships in Tier 4 through 6 cities. Cost actions and restructuring activity are projected to result in approximately $30 million of savings in 2020 over 2019; $7 million of which will be realized in the fourth quarter. We expect the year-over-year declines in local currency sales of 18% and 19% and project mid-single digit growth in the fourth quarter as October sellout continues to be positive compared with last year. We are encouraged to see profitable results in the third quarter, but the heavy lifting of SG&A, costs reductions essentially complete. We expect our North American boiler sales will decline by mid-single digits this year. Commercial boilers represent 65% to 70% of our boiler sales and industry volumes are down 15% to 17% year-to-date and improved slightly in the third quarter from the second quarter. The market is competitive and we are getting our fair share of the available market. We project 22% to 24% sales growth in North America water treatment products, which includes incremental water right sales. We believe the mega trend of healthy and safe drinking water as well as reduction of single use plastic bottles are driving consumer demand for our point of views and point of entry water treatment systems. We ended 2019 with a $2.6 million loss in India and expect a similar loss in 2020 as a result of the pandemic. Please advance the Slide 11. We project revenue will decline by 6% to 7% in 2020 as strong organic North America water treatment sales and resilient North America residential water heater volumes are more than offset by weaker North America commercial water heater and boiler volumes and lower China sales largely due to the pandemic in the first half of the year. We expect North America segment margin to be between 23% and 23.5% and rest of world segment margins to be between negative 1% and negative 2%. Please turn to Slide 12. We believe that particularly in these uncertain times, A. O. Smith is a compelling investment for a number of reasons. We have leading share positions in our major product categories. We estimate replacement demand represents approximately 80% to 85% of us water heater and boiler volumes. We have a strong premium brand in China, a broad product offering and our key product categories, broad distribution and a reputation for quality and innovation in that region. Over time, we are well-positioned to maximize favorable demographics in both China and India to enhance your older value. We are proud of the progress and the opportunity we see in our North America water treatment platform. We have strong cash flow and balance sheet, supporting the ability to continue to invest for the long-term with investments in automation, innovation and new products, as well as acquisitions and return cash to shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks. And we are now available for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Matt Summerville from D.A. Davidson. The line is now open Matt Summerville : Good morning. Couple of questions. First, can you talk about what your normal North American water heater lead times look like? Where are they peaked, where are now and whether October results are consistent with your view that the channel is going to take inventory down in Q4? Kevin Wheeler : Our normal lead times are about 15 days and that's on residential, but quite be other commercial products as well, maybe a little less. They got as high as in 20, 25 days, a little bit higher than that may be at certain times. So we worked in down to what we had mentioned in our remarks to more normalized level, and we expect; a) we expect our customers to, because of our lead times coming down, they'll probably adjust some of their inventory down to the appropriate levels since they bought them up with some concerns, if there was any disruptions from our manufacturing facilities, Matt Summerville : And then it is a follow-up within China. Have you now seen sustained sort of month-to-month positivity in overall volumes? And can you talk about where your mix has been trending over the last several quarters with respect to mid-price point? Thank you. Chuck Lauber : Yes. Sure, Matt. This is Chuck. Yes. We have seen sustained year-over-year sales improvement in that low single digits. So I would say it's been pretty consistent throughout the quarter and through October where we've seen year-over-year consumer demand. So we've been pleased with kind of that, I'll call it stability of demand coming through. Operator : All right. Our next question will come from the line of Scott Graham from Rosenblatt Securities. The line is now open. Scott Graham : Yes. Hi. Good morning. Nice quarter guys. Kevin Wheeler : Thanks, Scott. Good morning. Chuck Lauber : Good morning. Scott Graham : So I understand now why your fourth quarter guidance is maybe a little bit held back, given some of these destocking. But I guess the other side of it is that the North American margin was quite strong. Now does that mean that the fourth quarter North American margin may be ex, retarded a little bit by some of the destocking? That's my first question. Chuck Lauber : Yes. Scott, you're right. The third quarter was very strong. So if I do take a step back and kind of think about when we had our last call, we had projected the North America residential industry to be flat. And when you kind of look at the August results of the industry, we're up almost 5%. And when we look at what we saw in September, we saw continued strength. So our full year called to be the industry of 4% does have that headwind in the fourth quarter. So that's largely the reason for the swing. So when Kevin talked about lead times we made up probably half what we were over by the end of September, and we've got a little bit more of the lead time that was made up in October, but lead times are pretty close to normalize. So that headwind we'll be in the fourth quarter and we think some of that's going to carry \u2013 we think some of the channel inventory will carry into next year, but we also think some will come out in the fourth. Scott Graham : Okay. So, essentially what I think I hear you say is now you're the industry leader, so you've got a better beat on this than anybody, but essentially what you're seeing is in the industry data that you think the market is maybe just a little bit ahead of, it got a little bit ahead of itself in the last month or so. Kevin Wheeler : Yes. I mean, in the industry data, I mean, what we're seeing in the industry is customers getting, when lead times is extended, it's fairly typical that customers will stock up and make sure they've got products \u2013 to make sure that they've got product on hand, particularly in the replacement market for anything that would come up. So they'll generally order stronger than they typically do to ramp up that inventory. Chuck Lauber : And Scott, I would tell you, just to give you an outlet we're seeing some of the orders start to be reduced in October. So, and again we don't have great visibility to all the inventories of our customers, but we do believe that there was some inventory build and that there'll be some new stocking in Q4. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc. The line is now open. Jeff Hammond : Hey, good morning guys. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning, Jeff. Chuck Lauber : Good morning. Jeff Hammond : Just on North America commercial, so how would you characterize demand versus how you were expecting it in the quarter? And then just talk about kind of order quoting activity, and I know there's a lot of concerns about non-res into 2021. Like how do you see that shaping up? Kevin Wheeler : This is Kevin. It actually shaped up about exactly how we thought it would be. The commercial market has had, with the closing of some jobs and reopening, and there's been a lot of volatility there. So the quarter was no different and we see Q4 being no different as well. So it came in is about what we thought. And as we start to look at our quoting activity, there are some softness out there, but there's still \u2013 there's still activity. And I think the big question is going to be is, and we'll have to see how Q4 plays out. The robustness of jobs being released in moving forward, due others get delayed or not, but, overall the market's down, it came in, but we thought it was going to be, and I think Q4 will be as similar view as we get to the end of the year. Jeff Hammond : Okay. And then China, I think you mentioned mix shift again here. When do you think that starts to normalize [indiscernible] we kind of stopped talking about, or do you see that continuing for a bit? Chuck Lauber : Yes. I mean, it's been continuing for awhile as consumer competence even before the pandemic was a bit lower. We didn't see as much trading up particularly on the water heating side of the business. We see a little resilience on trading up on the water treatment side of the business, but for the quarter that headwind on sales volume is maybe in that 5% range. So it's similar to what it was last quarter and until we see consumers trading up, we would expect that we would see a little bit of headwind on that mix where, at least throughout the fourth quarter. Kevin Wheeler : Just add a little bit more color to that as well is the markets, the premium markets are holding, but they're just a small piece of the pie. More importantly, that there's been no noticeable retaliation against any of the brands. So the market's still got to play itself out. Consumer competence is growing. We expect it to continue, but it may be some time before we start to see meaningful movement back up to the premium sector as it grows. And we were very pleased with and then it came out pretty much where we projected where with where China ended up the quarter. We've been working on that breakeven point. We were above the breakeven point. We had a solid mid-single digit quarter in China and kind of came out right where we planned. We mentioned some of the social exemption charges; there was about a $3 million help. My prepared comments on the social exemption think of that as social security type exemption, where we didn't need to pay into the government; some of those extra tax costs or social costs. That's a program, that's been extended through the year, so it's been extended through the end of the year. We'll not expect to repeat it next year. We would not expect it to be extended. It's about $3 million this quarter; it's about $1.5 million next quarter. But overall we're pleased without how the chatter results came in. And the stability, I guess, in what we'd say is consumer demand being positive year-over-year. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Nathan Jones from Stifel. The line is now open. Adam Farley : Yes. Good morning, this is Adam Farley on for Nathan. Chuck Lauber : Hey, Adam. Adam Farley : Yes. In water treatment, going along the lines of some of these positive COVID trends, including no home, home-improvement-home, home remodeling. Do you think this theme has legs in the water treatment business? Again, it was a really strong quarter. And then in that business, are you seeing any delays from occupancy in homes that could have actually dampened demand at all? Chuck Lauber : Well, there are a couple of questions there, right? I do think that there's still a tailwind to water treatment in the U.S. And that will continue, and for us, it go into the fourth quarter, but just to be transparent, we do have a tough comp in the quarter. We had a very large inventory build for one of our customers last year. But, if you look at how October's playing out, there's still a quite a bit of consumer demand there, and this translate into 2021, probably some of it. I \u2013 one of the great things about the water treatment business is every time we sell a product, we get to sell a consumable later. So that's going to have some legs on it as it goes forward. But I do think consumers are just more health conscious today. It's not just COVID and the safety aspect of it. I think they're more health conscious and quite frankly with sustainability, plastic bottles are just not probably a product of the future for a lot of people. So overall we've been really pleased with our business, our execution across all the channels. And so, and then you mentioned w where there's some access to houses and so forth that has been caused by the pandemic? And the answer is yes. But has worked and learn how to particularly our dealers, they've learned how to sell virtually to have social distancing when they're visiting a customer to install with a social distancing protocol. And quite frankly, our dealers are doing quite well and had a really nice quarter in Q3. And we saw a nice mix improvement from Q2 on the water treatment business because of the fact that point of entry products, which required generally professional installation was a little bit stronger and it had been dampened a bit in Q2 when we had less access. Adam Farley : That's really helpful. And then, turning to margins I think you guys called out lower raw material costs as a benefit, commodity prices generally are on the rise. Should we expect to see any headwinds margins in the short-term or can that be covered with price? Nice. Chuck Lauber : Yes, I mean, the North American margins were really strong for the quarter. Some of that to an earlier question was, when you, when you have that type of volume, go through the plant and the quarter, you get some real efficiencies on the leverage on fixed. We do see some \u2013 we do see some minor headwinds. If you recall, our steel which is our large largest costs we see visibility in that 90 days to 120 days, because that's where our pricing locks in. So while there's been some recent uptick in some of the spot pricing and steals, which we've seen in the last call it 60 days to 30 days. Our fourth quarter year-over-year is still favorable. It's a little less favorable than it was in Q3; but it'll still be a favorable year-over-year. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Saree Boroditsky from Jefferies. The line is now open. Saree Boroditsky : Thank you. Good morning. Chuck Lauber : Good morning. Saree Boroditsky : You had a really strong margin performance from rest of the world, but it looks like guidance assumes some set down in the fourth quarter. Could you just talk about what you think is a good starting point for us to think about the potential margins for 2021, any puts and takes there? Chuck Lauber : We feel, I mean, we've talked about in the fourth quarter, we would see China performing mid-single digits margin \u2013 operating margin. It's a little early for us to be thinking about 2021. We liked kind of the stability of what we've seen in Q3 and what we expect in Q4, and China being the largest part. We won't see the repeat of the social insurance exemption that we \u2013 that I mentioned earlier in that when you're thinking of SG&A, that's about $7 million of SG&A for the year. So that'll be a bit of a headwind. But we've got India who always has the fourth quarter is our largest quarter. India has been challenged a bit on COVID-19, so we're going to have to see how India plays out in the back half of the year. So it's a little early for us to talk about 2021, and we'll be ready to do that when we come out in January. Kevin Wheeler : Just another quick comment, the amount of uncertainty every quarter just changes. And so as we're heading into Q4, we have spikes across the U.S. Chuck just mentioned, India goes in and out of lockdown dependent on the certain regions. Europe, so we're going to manage through the uncertainty in each month that goes by and each time we get a better picture what the future looks like is helpful. So to talk about 2021 right now would probably be not probably in our best interests and probably would just be speculation. So we'll manage through Q4 and as we get on our call next a year in January, we'll give you our best guidance to what we feel the business is going. Saree Boroditsky : I appreciate that. Then the second question [indiscernible] energy platform talks about increasing appliance, energy efficiency. Could you just talk about what that would really mean for you guys and how it will be impacted by that? Kevin Wheeler : Well, let me take that and then maybe Chuck can jump in as well. There's a lot of discussion about electrification. We referred to it more to a decarbonization, greenhouse gases and as we look at it, we're in favor of reducing greenhouse gases. And \u2013 but at the same time, we are talking to the policy makers to make sure that there isn't a one size fits all type of solution. We really believe it's a combination of many, many different types of products and technologies. So as we go forward and you look at it from the water heater business, we have full lines of condensing product that lets you know leading boilers, leading water heaters, and those have a major impact into carbon reduction and so forth, going from a non-efficient to an efficient. We have a full line of electric water heaters, both standard and electric \u2013 standard electric, as well as heat pump. Heat pump is a terrific value proposition and could be part of the solution going forward. Then on the commercial side of the business, we have a full line of again, electric commercials, but also we recently introduced a full line of commercial heat pumps. So when you look at how the energy policy is going forward, we're fully aware with them before we engaged with policy makers, as well as the various agencies. We're positioned well and we continue to bring products to market that we think are going to be address this issue; and even to the point of utilities. Many of our products are going to be able to be connected. So if there's a grid solution, we're going to be part of that. So overall we're positioned well, how it moves forward. That's going to be something we'll have to keep monitoring, but the big key, I think for everybody on this call is we're involved, and we're helping to drive that as an industry leader and our products and our factories are prepared for any direction that it takes. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Bryan Blair from Oppenheimer. The line is now open. Bryan Blair : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Bryan Blair : Chuck, I think you previously stated North American water treatment margins were running high single digit range in the first half outlook for around 10% for the year. Is that outlook still valid or is strong growth riding, driving margin a little bit higher, just trying to gauge the jumping off point for 2021? Chuck Lauber : Yes. I would say it's still valid. I mean, I mentioned an earlier question that we saw strong mix for the quarter, typically has higher price, higher margin product and point of entry. And so for the quarter we were just above that 10%. So we're on track. We're on track. Bryan Blair : Okay. Very good. A higher level one. We know your team does a lot of work tracking and modeling the replacement cycle on the resi side. If you're willing to comment on this, how has the pandemic impacted your assumptions and how should we think about that base level of demand going into 2021 and then looking out to 2022? Chuck Lauber : Well, you're certainly right. We've done a lot of work on it and we've shared it in prior calls that we \u2013 that we just don't see a big drop off. We see a gradual decline over the years in that 1% or 2% range. Quite frankly we've been focused on the pandemic. So we really haven't dug into this last quarter and projected it up, something that we'll look at obviously as we go forward. But the initial assumptions and the work that we've done, we still think are valid as we go forward. And if this blip turns out to be a blip, my guess is we'll have that same position going forward. Bryan Blair : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Susan Maklari : Everyone. Chuck Lauber : Good morning. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Susan Maklari : My first question is, can you talk a little bit about pricing in North America? As we think about some of the inventory that has built over the quarter, and perhaps you're going to head into 2021 with a bit more inventory in the channel. What does that mean as the industry starts to think about pricing for next year? Kevin Wheeler : Yes, I mean, as the only public company, we're not \u2013 we don't comment on pricing, particularly go forward pricing. We do look at going into next year and with a projection that there will be some inventory in the channel, some will come out in Q4, but we think that there will be some left in the channel early next year. Chuck Lauber : Yes, I would just say on that and probably going to sound a bit like a broken record, but historically given time we've been able to address inflation and that's kind of where we stand with any of these types of cost questions and pricing questions. Susan Maklari : Okay. All right. Thank you. And then my second question is on China. You mentioned that you're in the process of opening those 500 stores in the Tier 4 to 6 cities. As we kind of look at some of the recent data, you could see that the online sales in China, in water heaters, both gas and electric have accelerated 20%, 30%, 40% in August and September, offline sales seem to be down 15%, 20% at the same time. Can you talk about how you're thinking about the dynamic that's going on there? How you're positioning yourself to capture that kind of growth that's coming through especially in the online channel? And maybe what's the opening of these stores kind of means within this framework? Kevin Wheeler : Well, let me take a shot at this. Just \u2013 there's two questions in there. One is online and then one is about the smaller Tier 4 to 6 Tier businesses. One, we are opened \u2013 actually we're opened a bit quicker than we thought and in long-term there's a good growth opportunity in those Tier 4 and 6 cities and having the right products and the right relationships. And we're working pretty diligently on that and I've been quite successful opening the stores. And we'll continue to do that as we go forward. If you look on the online side of it, we've enhanced our online e-commerce capabilities and some of the mid priced products we've added and some of the digitalization and digital marketing that we're in the process of executing or have executed. Our online is going to be certainly a growth engine in China for the next few years. And we're positioning ourselves in that category appropriately. Again, remember a lot of the online is in the very lower price range where we don't participate, but there is a segment that fits our mid price to a premium segment. And we're engaging in that. It's a number one priority for our business, and we're continuing to execute on our plans to capture our fair share of the online sector. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of [indiscernible]. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : So China appears to be continuing a year-over-year mixed shift towards mid-priced products. Can you tell us how far along are you in optimizing the cost structure of mid-price products to get it more in line with higher priced products from a margin percent perspective? Kevin Wheeler : Yes, I mean, we're still working on and how far along, it's going to take a while. I mean, our priority over the last 18 months is to make sure that we're reinserting products into that upper mid-price category and then we do the cost reduction. So, I would say, we're in the early stages of that. We're going to be working through that over the next year or a year and a half to get better at the \u2013 in the margin line. So it's going to take a bit of time. Chuck Lauber : Yes, I would just add the cost reduction in that activity is in our DNA across all of our businesses. So there's never a point where \u2013 our first goal is to get the mid price into the market and I think we've essentially done that and they've been accepted very well and doing well in the market and then \u2013 but every year we're looking at ways to drive productivity, drive material cost down, redesign products, and that's not only in China, but that's across all of our businesses and we'll continue to do that. We always believe there's cost reduction opportunities in all of our products throughout our processes and that includes China as well as the other parts of our business. So, again, cost reduction is just what we do on a regular basis. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. That's helpful. And with debt to capital ending the quarter at about 6.1%, so given the strong balance sheet, what are you seeing in terms of M&A opportunities in the water treatment space? And what would you need to see to start the share repurchase program? Chuck Lauber : Well, let me start with the share repurchase. I mean, we suspended the program in the first quarter. We're going to hold off into the rest of the year and come back and talk about at the beginning of the year. So with the disruption of COVID, we just felt it was the right thing to do. We typically size the repurchase to not grow cash, and we feel pretty comfortable with where we're going through the year here with our cash projection, but we just \u2013 we're going to hold off until first part of next year in our January timeframe and talk about that. On the M&A front, we're continuing to absolutely be active. We look at the targets that are out there, difficult time, the last couple of months in quarters to transact anything, but the M&A market is more active. It's certainly more active. There may be some opportunities coming out of this timeframe for some of the companies that are on our target list, but may be more interested in transactions, but we can continue to remain active. Kevin Wheeler : Yes, I think some of that \u2013 I 100% agree with Chuck just said, our targets and then our reach out programs, and of course opportunities come across our desk. But in reality, I think, more of the opportunities will come as we get through parts of this pandemic and get more stable, but again we're active and we have the cash to take advantage of any good opportunities that comes our way. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Damian Karas from UBS. The line is open. Damian Karas : Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning, Damian. Chuck Lauber : Good morning. Damian Karas : So we've already covered quite a bit of ground here. Appreciate all the insight you've been able to provide. Just wanted to touch back on the Rest of the World's margins. You addressed them already to some extent. It sounds like you're not quite ready to give an outlook for 2021. But once you factor in all the moving pieces like the restructuring benefits, some of those temporary SG&A and other costs that might be coming back and then product mix. I am just wondering how much volatility you'd kind of expect to see quarter in, quarter out with respect to the segment margin. Obviously, they kind of fell over the place the last couple of years. Do you think you might get tighter range from here? How are you thinking about that? Kevin Wheeler : Yes, I mean, we like what we saw in Q3 and we feel pretty comfortable about Q4. So that range has been we hope firmed up with the help of some year-over-year consumer demand beings more stable. Thinking about that range going forward, the only caveat I would say to that on a bit of a quarter-over-quarter is the first quarter is always very tough. You have the Chinese New Year and the festival and the shutdowns and that's just the quarter that when you're thinking about kind of sequentially, which quarter is the most challenged, it's Q1. But for the long-term and for kind of what we've seen today and what we see in the next couple of months is we feel like that stabilized a bit. We feel like we've got a decent floor to work from. To your point we've taken out a lot of costs on SG&A. And we're right on track for all our restructuring programs. Some of that may come back as we see growth. There's opportunities and some investments like deferred advertising and brand building that we could bring back into the business should we see some opportunities to do that as we go into next year. Damian Karas : Okay. So that makes sense. Thanks. And then I wanted to ask you about the North American water heaters market, obviously a lot of discussion around there on some new competition. I was wondering if you're seeing or hearing anything at this point related to the new market entrance and also wanted to ask you just in this recent surge in the industry shipments, I'm curious what kind of trends you might be seeing in tankless. Chuck Lauber : Okay. Let me start with tankless. Damian, I would say, tankless has been \u2013 last year it was up about 6%. Historically, it had been growing double digits. What we're seeing tankless this year is it's growing. It's also growing above 10% this year. So, tankless is growing about that double-digit range. New entrance, thinking about new entrance, that much has been not much activity. I guess, we haven't heard a great deal of different than what we had on the last call. There really hasn't been any new significant information that's been in the marketplace. It's been rather quiet. Kevin Wheeler : Yes. Again, I would tell you from just more of a macro level where \u2013 we take whole competitors seriously, and this has been a topic that we've discussed on a couple of calls and we always continue to monitor the market, but more importantly we take care of ourselves. And if you look at through this pandemic and you reach out to our customers and the service levels and what we've done demonstrates the ability that A. O. Smith has to be a long-term partner. And so, our focus certainly will watch our competitors, but our focus has always been on taking care of our customer. And nothing proves that than a \u2013 some type of crisis or a pandemic. And so that's our focus. And again, if anything, I would agree with Chuck on the competitive front. There's not been much with the new entrance. And if there is, we'll adjust it appropriately and comment if and when it happens. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research. The line is now open. David MacGregor : Good morning everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. David MacGregor : I wanted to ask you about \u2013 yes, good morning. I wanted to ask you about China, and certainly you guys have accomplished a lot there. There's been a lot of progress in terms of just getting the costs straightened around and inventory is down. But you're talking about mid single digit growth in the fourth quarter. And I guess I just wanted to understand the composition of that growth. Is it coming from waters treatment rather than from water heaters? I mean, you talked about the premium segments being stable. So I'm assuming that we're not seeing a lot of growth in the premium segment than it's \u2013 and while there's maybe some growth from the mid price point. My sense was that there's a little more of a struggle going on there. So help me to understand just the composition of that mid single digit growth. And what's the potential that maybe there's upside to that number, I guess. Kevin Wheeler : Yes, I mean, so the mid single digit growth is really a combination of consumer demand for our entire portfolio. So you're right. It's not all equal. And we are seeing a water heating side under some pressure for year-over-year demand. We are pleased with water treatment. For the quarter, water treatment performed very well in China on a per unit basis. So, actually, the biggest drivers in water treatment for the quarter in China were our commercial business, which we don't talk about a lot, but last year was about $20 million in sales. And the commercial business grew nicely quarter-over-quarter consumables that repeatable business of consumables that we have, which is approximately 15% of the total grew very, very nicely too. So, in total, our China water treatment business was up over 10% for the quarter. So you're right. We're looking pretty favorable at that segment of the business as we go through the fourth quarter. On the margins, the rest of the products we've got a range of products at a smaller level and some other products that are doing quite well. So, we would see consumer demand for our portfolio continuing in that year-over-year improvement. And then \u2013 and to your point, we're pleased with how water treatment performed for the quarter. David MacGregor : Great. Is there anything on the horizon in terms of innovation or some change in terms of market construct that would draw the Chinese consumer back to the premium price points that would create a growth story there again? Kevin Wheeler : There's always innovation in the background and that's across our three major product categories for sure and that's water heating and gas, water heating and electric and of course on water treatment. Nothing that I would tell you that we can announce today, but we always have \u2013 our hundreds of engineers working on what's new. It's a requirement. As a premium brand, we have to bring new innovative products out there. We have a portfolio of ideas. And we'll probably launch a few of them in the upcoming year like we always do. And as a consumer brand, it's important that we have some new products come to market as that match our premium brand and what they expect from our brand, which is innovation and quality. Chuck Lauber : Yes. I mean, the most recent product that we launched that comes to mind on the water treatment side is the hot water tap that has a filter built into it. So, it's a hot water tap that you'd have on your countertop. And it's got filtered and boiling if you'd like to have water at the same time. So that was probably \u2013 that's one of the more successful products that has some innovation in the products that we've launched recently. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Scott Graham from Rosenblatt Securities. The line is now open. Scott Graham : Yes. Hi. Good morning. I got cut off before. I want to ask a couple, but everyone asked some pretty good questions here. So I just do have a couple. Kevin Wheeler : Okay. Scott Graham : Could you talk a little bit about sort of how commercial trended. And maybe differentiate commercial water heaters versus boilers because those markets are so really different dynamics. But sort of how they trended during the quarter? Did they end up strongest year-over-year in September, was it more even if you could help us out on that. Kevin Wheeler : Yes, I would say Scott, it was \u2013 I mean, we're down for the quarter on boilers about 7.5%. I mean, it's pretty even when you go into October. I don't to say that we've seen much change. On commercial water heating, when we're looking water heating, when we're looking at order demand, I would say, October was very similar to what we saw in the third quarter, so not a substantial change. It's been pretty much the same as we go through that. I really - well, yes, it's been pretty much running the same through into October. Chuck Lauber : Scott, we've talked about a little bit on the call is you do have jobs opening and closing. Quite frankly, you still have trade issue out there with a shortage of the skilled labor. And so the market as we had mentioned, we see a similar Q4 and we'll have to keep our eyes on how we get into Q1, but again I'll be a little bit repetitive, we are seeing activity. It's a little bit slower than it has been, but there's still activity in the commercial market. Scott Graham : Understood. Thank you. I wanted to also maybe talk a little bit about sort of the guidance because I'm sitting here and listening to others, I'm just sort of playing around with the model and to get to your operating income \u2013 operating margin guidance for North America, it really kind of presupposes a pretty down hard fourth quarter margin in the territory of 200 basis points to 300 basis points, a) would you agree with that, b) what can you do about it? Kevin Wheeler : Yes, I mean, we were really strong in Q3. And then when you have that kind of volume that goes through the plants, our margins were really, really strong. So we're coming off of that. So it's about \u2013 it's in that range. And that maybe not quite as large as your projection is, but it's in that range of down. Strong Q3, so Q4 we're looking at a little bit of headwind on conversion costs compared to Q3. Operator : All right. Our last question will come from the line of Larry De Maria from William Blair. The line is now open. Larry De Maria : Hi. Thanks everybody. Two quick questions, first India. Obviously, there's an impact from COVID there and a setback. But what do we need to see for India to get back to breakeven, or even start turning a profit? I don't know if it volume growth into next year? Or is it \u2013 do we have to adjust the cost base? Just curious how you're thinking about getting that to breakeven given that's kind of obviously been a bit of disappointment? Kevin Wheeler : Yes, to think it's a breakeven and beyond, it is volume related as we scale up \u2013 water heating has been scaled pretty well, water treatment, we're still scaling. And I've mentioned this before, yes, some really nice momentum over the last couple of years taking out chunks of the losses $2 million and $3 million each year. And really had a nice path going forward to breakeven in 2020 and just unfortunately the pandemic have hit and it hit India hard and has continued to hit it. But if you look at it, being able to do some of the cost reductions that we've done this year, and if India can turnaround and having its economy moving in a positive direction and we can drive some volume the chances are we probably won't add in all the costs that we've taken out and we'll be able to do some leverage there, but when it's all said and done primarily it\u2019s volume. And we need to have the economy improve and we need to take share in some categories and you put the combination together, it leads to a breakeven, and then a move forward position for us. Larry De Maria : Are we 5% to 10% volume from that? Is that fair to say? Or is it a bigger number? Chuck Lauber : Yes. So last year, our volume in India was about just under $40 million, so about $39 million. This year our projection is we're going to be down 20% to 25% off of that number. So as we were coming into this year, we're expecting to be breakeven, and we expect the growth rate in India to be in that double-digit range. So, as Kevin said, when you kind of look at the cost balance and just a little bit more volume off of where we were last year, you get to that breakeven. So it's not a huge leap from last year, but we've got to build back up from where we are in the current environment. Larry De Maria : Okay. That's great color. And then last question obviously in restaurants, hospitality, hotels, et cetera, not surprisingly a headwind, just curious as the economy sort of started open up a bit in 3Q. Did you start to see any sequential increase in that sector for replacement? I'm just kind of trying to understand how sensitive that can be towards reopening or closing? Kevin Wheeler : I think reopening is key. I think you've hit on a major part of, particularly on the restaurants and the hotels. I think it's too early. We still see spikes across the country. We still have orders. I'll give you one here in Wisconsin with the mandate only 25% restaurants and tourist capacities. And so, I think, it's too early. But as you go forward, as that does open up, that plays well to us as those restaurants start getting people in, washing dishes and using the hot water as well as the hotels, but it's a bit early to make that statement. Larry De Maria : Okay. Thanks very much. Good luck. Operator : There are no further questions. Patricia Ackerman, please continue. Patricia Ackerman : Thank you all for joining us today. We plan to participate in two virtual conferences in the fourth quarter : Robert W. Baird on November 10th and Northcoast on November 16th. Enjoy your day. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Patricia Ackerman, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, CRS and Treasurer. You may begin again. Patricia Ackerman : Thank you, Julie and I apologize to everyone on this call this morning. We had telephone problems and so we will start over from the beginning so that you can hear all of our prepared remarks and then we will go into questions and answers. I believe you heard the introduction that I gave. So I will turn the call over directly to Kevin Wheeler. Kevin Wheeler : Okay. Again, thank you and our apologies for some technical difficulties here. This may be redundant, but we think it\u2019s important to start from the beginning. Before we begin discussing our results and outlook, I want to send my deepest gratitude to the thousands of A. O. Smith employees who have been working under less than ideal conditions and you continue to keep our operations running, offices open and customers in hot and treated water. To recap 2020, better than expected fourth quarter results drove our 2020 performance above our expectations. North America water treatment grew 14% organically driven by continuing consumer demand for products promoting a safe home. The direct-to-consumer channel with our Aquasana brand retail outlets with our A. O. Smith brand and the dealer channel all contributed to solid 2020 growth. We believe the industry shipments of U.S. residential water heaters, including tankless search to a record exceeding 10 million units or 8% growth over the prior year. This assessment is based on our strong December shipments. We believe the overall positive tone to new residential and safe at home remodel construction activity, including an increase in proactive replacement demand and channel inventory stocking related to extended industry lead times resulted in above trend growth in 2020. Due to construction project delays and postponements in North America as well as pandemic-related weakness in restaurant and hospitality, new construction and replacement demand, we saw commercial water heaters and boiler industry volumes decline by 8% to 10%. We maintained our market share in both of these categories. Progressive year-over-year improvement in consumer demand for our products in China continued in the fourth quarter as a result of higher volumes and diligent efforts by our team to reduce costs and reorganize high single-digit margins were achieved in the second half of the year. In North America, aside from the voluntary closure of our Mexican facility for several weeks in the second quarter, we remain operational throughout 2020 with no significant disruptions within our plans and our supply chain. Pandemic-related safety protocols remain in place in our facilities and offices. Due to strong residential water heater demand, coupled with self-quarantine related absenteeism, our lead times remain above normal. We continue to use temporary workers swing shifts and expedite logistics in some cases to take care of our customers. All these efforts result in inefficiencies and incremental costs. To align our business with current global market conditions, we reduced headcount and incurred other restructuring costs totaling approximately $6 million after-tax in 2020. The majority of these actions took place in China. We published our second corporate responsibility and sustainability report in January. I am very proud of our accomplishments since our first report, particularly in employee engagement, safety, resource reduction in our facilities and a product portfolio that boasts some of the most efficient products in their respective categories. We introduced our first ever public greenhouse gas emission goal. We strive to reduce GHG emissions by 10% by 2025. I will now turn the call over to Chuck who will provide more details on the full year and the fourth quarter beginning on Slide 5. Chuck Lauber : Thank you, Kevin. Full year sales of $2.9 billion declined 3% compared with 2019 largely due to significant weakness in the China business in the first half of 2020. As a result of lower sales adjusted earnings declined 3% to $351 million or $2.16 per share compared with $370 million or $2.22 per share in 2019. Please turn to Slide 6, sales in our North America segment at $2.1 billion increased 2% compared with 2019. Higher residential water heater volumes, growth in water treatment as well as full year of Water-Right sales were partially offset by lower U.S. commercial water heater volumes, lower boiler sales and a water heater sales mix composed of more electric models, which have a lower selling price. Rest of the world segment sales of $800 million declined 14% from 2019. Pandemic-related lockdowns and weak end market demand primarily in China in the first half of the year and a higher mix of mid-priced products resulted in lower sales. Currency translation of China sales favorably impacted sales by approximately $9 million. Indian sales were also negatively impacted by pandemic-related economic disruption and declined to $31 million compared with $39 million in 2019. On Slide 7, North America segment adjusted earnings of $506 million increased 4% compared to 2019. The increase in earnings was driven by favorable impact to earnings from higher residential water heater volumes, growth in water treatment sales, a full year of Water-Right sales and lower material costs. The impact to earnings from lower volumes of boilers and commercial water heaters and the mix SKU to electric water heaters partially offset these factors. Adjusted segment earnings exclude $2.7 million in pre-tax severance costs. As a result, adjusted operating margin of 23.9% is slightly higher than in 2019. Rest of the world adjusted segment earnings of $5 million declined significantly compared with 2019. In China, the unfavorable impact from lower sales and the higher mix of mid-priced products, which have lower margins than higher-priced products more than offset reductions in SG&A costs and temporary waivers for required social insurance contributions. As a result of these factors, adjusted segment operating margin of $0.6% declined from 4.3% in 2019. Our corporate expenses of $52 million were higher than in 2019 primarily driven by lower interest income. Turning to Slide 8, record fourth quarter sales of $835 million increased 11% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase in sales is largely due to higher residential water heater volumes in North America and higher sales in China. As a result of higher sales and cost reduction initiatives earlier this year, fourth quarter earnings of $120 million or $0.74 per share increased significantly compared with 2019. Please advance to Slide 9, record fourth quarter sales in North America segment of $561 million increased 7% compared with the same period in 2019, primarily driven by higher residential water heater volumes. Rest of the world fourth quarter segment sales of $279 million improved 19% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. Currency translation of China sales favorably impacted sales by approximately $14 million. Constant currency China sales improved 15% driven by mid single-digit growth in end-market demand led by water treatment, replacement water treatment filters and gas tankless water heaters, and a favorable mix between product categories compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. On Slide 10, record fourth quarter North America segment earnings of $138 million, increased 7% from the same period in 2019. The increase in earnings was primarily driven by higher residential water heater volumes in North America and lower steel costs. These factors were partially offset by logistic costs. As a result, fourth quarter segment margin of 24.6% was slightly higher than 24.5% in 2019. Rest of the world segment earnings of $31 million improved significantly from $1.5 million in the same quarter of 2019. In China, higher volumes, reductions in SG&A cost and lower material costs drove higher earnings. As a result of these factors, fourth quarter segment margin improved to 11.2% compared with 0.6% in 2019. Our corporate expenses of $16 million in the fourth quarter were higher than in the same period of 2019 primarily due to an increase in long-term incentives and lower interest income in the 2020 fourth quarter. Advancing to Slide 11, cash provided by operations of $562 million during 2020 was higher than 2019. Lower investments in working capital in 2020 were partially offset by lower earnings compared with the prior year. Our liquidity and balance sheet remains strong. Our cash balances totaled $690 million at the end of 2020 and our net cash position was $576 million. At the end of 2020, our leverage ratio was 6% as measured by total debt to total capital. We are in the process of refinancing our $500 million revolving credit facility, which expires at the end of the year. We currently have no borrowing on this facility. We expect to repurchase $400 million worth of shares in 2021 through a combination of 10b5-1 program and open market purchases. Recently, our Board increased the authorized shares on our share repurchase authority by 7 million shares. Turning to Slide 12, we introduced our 2021 EPS guidance this morning with the range of between $2.40 and $2.50 per share. The midpoint of our range represents an increase of 13% compared with our 2020 results. Our guidance assumed the conditions of our business environment and that of our suppliers and customers are similar in 2021 to what we have experienced in recent months and does not deteriorate as a result of further restrictions or potential shutdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect cash flow from operations in 2021 to be between $450 million and $475 million compared with $560 million in 2020 primarily due to higher earnings offset by higher investments and working capital than in prior year. In 2021, capital spending plans are between $85 million and $90 million and our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $80 million. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $51 million slightly lower than in 2020. Our effective tax rate is assumed to be between 22.5% and 23% in 2021. Average outstanding diluted shares of $160 million assumes $400 million worth of shares are repurchased in 2021. I will now turn the call back over to Kevin who will summarize our guidance assumptions beginning on Slide 13. Kevin? Kevin Wheeler : Thank you, Chuck. Our businesses and the countries in which we do business continue to navigate through pandemic-related challenges, particularly in supply chain and logistics. Our outlook for 2021 includes the following assumptions. We project the U.S. residential water heater industry volumes will be down 2% or 200,000 units in 2021. We are encouraged by the positive tone in the new construction market although we believe some destocking will occur during 2021 as we expect industry lead times to improve throughout the year. The timing of the destocking is difficult to predict, because we have two price increases announced one effective in February and a second one in April. Destocking activity could be delayed until midyear due to the pre-buy orders in advance of the price increases. Further note on the 2021 price increases. We have seen inflation across our supply chain, particularly steel and logistic costs. Steel has increased nearly 50% since we announced our February 1 water heater price increase of 5% to 9%. We announced the second price increase last week on water heaters effective April 1 also between 5% to 9% depending on the type of water heater. We expect commercial industry water heater volumes will further decline approximately 4% as pandemic impacted business delay or defer new construction and discretionary replacement installations. In China, it is encouraging to see consumer demand for our China products progressively improve in 2020 and into January of 2021. We accomplished much in China in 2020, which will allow us to profitably grow in 2021. Those accomplishments include closing 1,000 stores in Tier 1 and 2 cities, while efficiently expanding in Tier 4 through 6 cities, implementing programs to save $30 million in SG&A which will carry over into 2021. We have lapped the negative impact to earnings from mid-priced products. We expect positive mix in 2021 of new products. And we executed programs resulting in stronger and more nimble distributors. We expect year-over-year increases in local currency sales between 14% and 15%. We assume China currency rates remain at current levels, adding approximately $45 million and $3 million to sales and profits over the prior year respectively. We expect our North America boiler sales will increase by mid single-digits in 2021. Our expectations are based on several growth drivers. First, industry growth of 3% to 4%, we assume some pent-up demand after the industry decline in the low-teens levels in 2020. The CAGR for commercial condensing boilers, which is over 50% of the boiler revenue, was 5% to 6% prior to 2020. We believe replacing demand is still 85%. A potential government stimulus package targeting infrastructure investment may free up some jobs that were postponed or halted in 2020. The transition to higher energy efficient boilers will continue, particularly as commercial buildings improve your overall carbon footprint. In 2020, condensing boilers were 39% of the commercial boiler industry that represents our addressable market, which provides continued opportunity for our leading markets here, commercial condensing boilers. New product launches, including improvements to our flagship crest commercial condensing boiler with a market differentiating oxygen sensor, which continually measures and optimizes boiler performance and the introduction of a 1 million BTU light duty commercial Knight FTXL boiler. We project 13% to 14% sales growth in our North America water treatment products. We believe the mega trends of health and safe drinking water, as well as a reduction of single use plastic bottles will continue to drive consumer demand for our point of use and our point of entry water treatment systems. We believe margins in this business could grow by 100 to 200 basis points higher than the nearly 10% margin achieved in 2020. And in India, fourth quarter sales were similar to the prior year. We project 2021 full year sales to increase over 20% compared with 2020 and to incur a small loss of $1 million to $2 million. Advance to Slide 14, we project revenue will increase by approximately 10% in 2021 as strong North America water treatment in China sales enhanced by growth in boiler sales more than offset expected weaker North America water heater volumes. Our 10% growth rate projection includes approximately $45 million of benefit from China currency translation. We expect North America segment margins to be between 23% and 23.5% and rest of the world segment margins to be between 7% and 8%. To Slide 15 please. 2020 was a challenging year. We are pleased with our performance through the pandemic. Particularly in these uncertain times, we believe A. O. Smith is a compelling investment for numerous reasons. We have leading share positions in our major product categories. We estimate replacement demand represents approximately 80% to 85% of U.S. water heater and boiler volumes. We have a strong premium brand in China, a broad product offering in key product categories, broad distribution, a reputation for quality and innovation in that region. Over time, we are well positioned to maximize favorable demographics in both China and India to enhance shareholder value. We are very excited for the opportunity we see in our North America water treatment platform. We have strong cash flow and balance sheet supporting the ability to continue to invest for the long-term with investments in automation, innovation and new products as well as acquisitions and return cash to shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks. And we are now available for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Jeff Hammond : Hey, good morning. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning, Jeff. Chuck Lauber : Good morning. Jeff Hammond : So just on the China business, clearly have a really easy comp in the first quarter, just trying to get a sense of how you are thinking about seasonality, is it back to normal? And then just on the margin cadence in rest of world, you kind of were putting up high single-digits even above your guidance. So maybe just talk about margin cadence through the year for rest of world? Chuck Lauber : Yes, sure, I can do that. Yes, we were really pleased with the fourth quarter back to double-digits in Q4, had a really nice favorable category mix, had some decent online volume in China. So, we are pleased with the fourth quarter. When we look at 2021, I think we are back to a more normal cadence. Always, Q1 is a challenge for us. So, Q1 will be the lowest quarter. I would expect that we are going to progress progressively through the year like we have in the past maybe 2021 might be 45% of the revenue in the first half of the year 55% in the back. And our best quarter will be Q4 again in 2021. So probably starting out the year, you are right, last year is not a \u2013 it\u2019s pretty easy comp, right. So, we would expect revenues in the first quarter to potentially double last year\u2019s revenues, low single-digit margins and progress from there throughout the year. Jeff Hammond : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just on North America, I guess your unit volume expectation is down in both commercial and res, I think your guidance maybe implies mid single-digit growth. Is that largely a function of price or are you baking any kind of share gains or mix within North America? Thanks. Kevin Wheeler : What we are really baking in is that there will be some destocking into 2021. So, we just came up a record year for the industry. And as we look forward, where as we said in our comments, we are very excited about the new home construction market, we think we still think there is going to be quite a bit of proactive activity at the DIY level. But embedded in there is some inventory that as industry lead times kind of move back to normal we see that declining and bringing the industry down from this last year by about a couple of 100,000 units. Chuck Lauber : Yes, I mean, is that kind of the offset to that little bit of headwind on the destocking is, we do have boilers projected to be favorable next year. We have \u2013 in Kevin\u2019s comments earlier talked a little bit about some of the new products coming out, potential some help on infrastructure. We do see the industry with replacement being somewhat resilient maybe some of the work pushed back last year rolls into 2021 water treatment. We project kind of a back to back 13% to 14% increase in water treatment overtopping that in. And yes, we do expect price rolling into next year. So we have got our steel costs particularly leading our costs for 2021. And we have got the two price increases, one February 1, effective and one April 1 rolling into next year. Jeff Hammond : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Matt Summerville : Thanks. Good morning. With respect to China, can you talk about the outgrowth you achieved in the fourth quarter relative to the market? I think you said you were up kind of mid-teens constant currency, the market up mid single-digits may be parse out that gap to the upside in your business? Kevin Wheeler : Yes, I mean, there is a couple things. So if you look at kind of industry data and look at share and some of the other metrics out there, what they are not capturing is what\u2019s happening in our specialty stores. And we are really pleased with what kind of performance we had in our specialty stores in Q4. So that was strong. Consumer demand overall, we saw in the mid single-digits, strong mid single-digits, but the product category mix that we saw in Q4 was really helpful. So, if we had a higher product, you get higher sales cost on gas tankless, our water treatment products have higher sales price, decent commercial business in the quarter. So, the mix between categories was very helpful to our growth. So, that\u2019s probably the biggest pieces. I mean, we are really pleased about the fact that our mix. We have talked in the past about some headwind on mix and we really kind of lapped that as we said in our comments, where we really wouldn\u2019t expect a negative headwind on mix in China going forward. We would expect it to be neutral or slightly positive. So, we are kind of at a stabilized point we believe on the mid-priced products and positive to neutral going forward. Chuck Lauber : I would just add a couple of things on to that. We have done a lot of work on our mid-priced products and our cost structure and so forth. And quite frankly, we have some really terrific products that are going to be launching or have launched a high input in our electric water heater category. We\u2019re going to be the only brand out there with a category of grade one noise level on our tankless which is a huge factor for consumers in China. Noise is always an issue because it\u2019s inside their home. And our water treatment products have to do quite well and we have a number of new ones coming up that will continue to expand our higher flow rates and along with having \u2013 providing hot water. So great work on the mid-priced, but we haven\u2019t lost sight on our premium products. That\u2019s all three that I just mentioned are in the premium category. Matt Summerville : And then with respect to, for my follow-up, with respect to the price increases you\u2019re putting in place, Kevin, does that cover you guys relative to where spot prices are today or I mean, given \u2013 if you just look at steel prices have gone like parabolic I\u2019m sure you\u2019re well aware of that. So with this second increase you\u2019re putting in, are you effectively covered it today at today\u2019s spot prices or do you need to contemplate later in the year maybe a third increase? Thank you. Kevin Wheeler : Well, let me start and Chuck is going to give you some of the details. But as you know, we tend to trail cost, but we always take action and we have demonstrated that we can do that over time. Well, we are going to be trailing for a while and maybe Chuck can give us some comments on how we see the price increases working the way through the market. Chuck Lauber : Yes. I mean our outlook and our guidance assumes that steel pricing stays kind of that where it is for the index right now and carries throughout the end of the year. And then of course, we talked about our price increases. So when we look at next year, we would see that those price increases are probably going to lag a little bit and what we\u2019re going to see in the cost, we get a little bit of a runway of 90 to 120 days. But to your point, steel pricing has gone up so dramatically, so quickly that we\u2019re probably going to be chasing the margin a little bit as we go forward. Without commenting specifically on particular achievement of price, I would just say, historically, over time, we\u2019ve been able to switch to cover that. Matt Summerville : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Eitan Buchbinder with Citi. Eitan Buchbinder : Hi, good morning and thank you for taking my question. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Eitan Buchbinder : You mentioned stability in North America water heater manufacturing lead times. Can you talk about your visibility to the level of residential water heater customer inventory levels due to the impact of lead times and potential pre-buy ahead of price increases and how should we think about that affecting seasonality in \u201821? Chuck Lauber : Let me take that. I mean at the industry on residential is up about 8% over 2019. I think you really kind of have to think about or I think about the jumping off point in 2019, which is down about 2% from the trend line. So, I mean, the industry up in 2020 is really 6% to 8%. When we look at inventories, we think about the fact that it\u2019s probably half of that might be inventories that have built up. So if you\u2019re in that 3% to 4% of that increase is inventories in the channel, not all of that\u2019s going to come out of 2021. We don\u2019t think. So, if it\u2019s 4% and a portion of that comes out of 2021, we are maybe down to that 2% headwind that we see. Helped a little bit by what we think will be encouragement in the housing offset of that and we still see proactive demand on water heaters being pretty strong. So we kind of right at that 2%, when you think about kind of the cadence for the year, we don\u2019t believe the price increases that have been announced pulled much if any into sales into 2020. But the first quarter, effective February 1st and effective April 1st, we would expect some increased demand on the price increase driving some volume in the Q1. Eitan Buchbinder : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And in Q4 China saw healthy growth 15% constant currency. Can you give us an update about how the expected 500 store openings in Tier 4 to 6 cities are performing? And what are your expectations for store openings or closings in China during \u201821? Kevin Wheeler : Well, let me touch on that and then Chuck will give you some figures. One, when you start to look out in Tier 4 through 6 Tier cities, I want to caution and make sure that we described, these are small counters if you will. They are really not \u2013 the type of stores that you\u2019re talking about in city Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. So I just want to calibrate as we open up those stores there, they are really kind of counters with limited volume, but the ability to sell our product across those growing cities. From a standpoint, Chuck, our forecast is... Chuck Lauber : Yes. So the Tier 4 to Tier 6 cities and we\u2019re kind of parsing their stores a little different than what we have in the past. So we\u2019ve talked historically about 9,000 or 9,500 stores and we\u2019re pricing it really Tier 1 and Tier 2 and then back to a Kevin said Tier 4 through 6. In the Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, if you go back to \u201819 that have been a little over 7,000 stores in those categories and in the Tier 4 to 6 is around 2,000. So you kind of split it up into those two categories and you get to the 9,000 and 9,500 stores. On the Tier 1 to Tier 2 our focus is really efficiency, looking at store efficiencies, and we talked about closing 1,000 stores and we have. So we went from about 7,400 stores at the end of 2019 to at the end of this year about 6,400 stores. So we\u2019ve accomplished kind of where we are set out to do the closing of the 1,000 stores. When we look into next year, not much change. We probably have a little bit. We\u2019re continue to look at evaluate efficiencies, but we did not expect much change in the Tier 1 to Tier 2 cities. Tier 3, or I\u2019m sorry, Tier 4 through 6, as Kevin said, it\u2019s a different selling model and our expectations are different. And how we\u2019re really measuring that is less about how many counters or footprints we have and more about the volume of sales going through there. So that\u2019s what we will probably be talking about more going forward. We\u2019ve opened up more than that 500 stores that our target. And when I say opened up, we\u2019ve got relationships and counters and significantly more than the 500 stores and we\u2019re going to be just kind of looking at volumes through those stores going forward. Eitan Buchbinder : Thank you very much. I\u2019ll pass it along. Chuck Lauber : Thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from Damian Karas with UBS. Damian Karas : Hi, good morning, everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Chuck Lauber : Good morning. Damian Karas : Wanted to ask you a follow-up question on the China business and rest of world margin in particular, obviously, making some really nice progress there and you talked about some of the factors with mix staring to come back. Just wondering kind of thinking longer term where you are in the business? I mean, are there any structural reasons why you think you wouldn\u2019t be able to get back to kind of those low double-digit margins on a consistent basis or is that achievable over time and if so, kind of what they\u2019re going to take you to get there? Kevin Wheeler : Well, I would tell you, I believe and we have talked about getting back to those mid-to-low teen margins and certainly we think we can get there. Structural changes, no. If you look at our strategy, our strategy is going to stay consistent. We are a premium brand. We use innovation to drive products into the consumers\u2019 market. We invest in high service levels for a high quality company. That foundational part of our business is not going to change. In fact, it will continue to be enhanced. However, the market is changing. You have some online going, getting larger. You have some changes in the retail sector in Tier 1, Tier 2. And what we\u2019re going to do is we\u2019re going to remain nimble like we have, adjusting our model as far as store openings and how we go to market. You will see a big part of digital a big driver for us as we engage customers going forward. The day of having somebody in every store as a promoter we\u2019d be talked about are probably going to be limited. And we\u2019ll use digital more and will continue to expand into the other markets those 4 and 6 Tier cities, one day are going to be Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3 cities and we need to have a position there. So, overall, I mean, our strategy where we\u2019re at getting to those type of margins, we think are doable over time and we\u2019ve been taking the steps in 2020. We will continue to take those steps in 2021 and beyond. Chuck Lauber : Yes. I would just add that the volume really does matter. Q4 we had decent volume and we get that kind of volume. We\u2019ve got a double-digit margin in Q4. So over time, we would expect that we will continue to see consumer confidence driving demand and looking at kind of hopefully we get back to the point where we\u2019ve got more trading up to more high premium products, which by the way this year, we saw some positive trading up in water treatment and the water heating side was stable to up slightly. So, we\u2019re optimistic about getting back to double-digit margins. Probably, we are not \u2013 we don\u2019t have it in our outlook for next year, but we see that. Damian Karas : Okay, got it. Thanks. And then you did a nice job of kind of walking through your expectations for the U.S. residential market. I was wondering if you could perhaps give us a sense on how we should think about the cadence for the commercial market this year. I mean that down 4%, are you sort of expecting declines through the year or maybe growth returning at some point? How should we think about that? Kevin Wheeler : I think about the way we think about it is, we still need to see economy is opening up. We need restaurants, capacities and open up in hotels and travel. So we have a 4% decline built into our model. We hope as the vaccine comes out and heard immunity starts getting closer and closer, we see the restrictions in those type of restaurants and hotels to be less and less company start to open it up and traveling. So if anything, we seen more improvement maybe in the back half of the year than we do in the first half as we continue to work through the pandemic, and of course, the vaccines to being transmitted to the number of people that needs to be. Damian Karas : Okay. Thanks so much. Good luck with it. I will pass it along. Kevin Wheeler : Hey, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David MacGregor : Yes. Good morning, everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning, David. David MacGregor : Question on the \u2013 good morning, just a question on the inventories in North America and you\u2019ve provided quite a bit of color around that, so that\u2019s greatly appreciated, but what\u2019s the opportunity to sort of throttle up downstream kind of demand creation in 2021 as a way of kind of burn through that inventory surplus a little faster? Kevin Wheeler : Well, I would tell you that the way the inventories are going to be burned through faster is really just when the economy open up. And again I \u2013 we could see more improvement in the DIY side of the market where people were doing more to their homes as we saw in 2020. And of course, in new construction depending on labor in the market, there is a lot of things that can happen that can drive demand. One of the biggest challenge for the construction business has been labor. So those are two things. As things progress, and again, I keep going back, if the economy opens up and as \u2013 we even have sales people traveling for a year other than under emergency conditions where we\u2019re not spending time in the market as much as we like to, all that\u2019s going to matter for us to drive demand both from just the economic side, but also from us looking at gain some share. So it\u2019s \u2013 there is more action to have to happen, but they also have to be some economic in some opening up of the economy for us to move that forward and bring the inventories down. David MacGregor : Okay, understood. Okay, thanks for that. And then secondly, just on the boiler business. Can you walked through quite a bit of detail on why you\u2019re feeling confident in that mid-single-digit growth number for next year, so that as well as is it is appreciated, but I just wonder if you could talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing in the backlog for that business that may be giving you a confidence or is this more just kind of assembling all these drivers in a theoretical construct and this has got a lead to a better growth? Are you seeing hard evidence in terms of orders and backlog now that\u2019s giving you that confidence? Kevin Wheeler : Well, what I can tell you what we\u2019re seeing today, we didn\u2019t see the delay and postponement of our projects as we saw back in last year. That\u2019s number one. David MacGregor : Okay. Kevin Wheeler : The number two, the activity in the market is lower, but there is still activity going on there. And so again, as we go forward, it\u2019s not just about some of the projects being released and the economy growing. There is a component of new product launches that we have that are going to be important to our growth. So it\u2019s a combination of those. But I would tell you, I mean, we\u2019re excited about the cross boiler with the O2 sensing is an important part of what we\u2019re going to do. And we actually introduced several new products in 2020 that kind of got lost in the mix of the pandemic that I believe are going to help our business as we go forward. Chuck Lauber : Yes. I would say with regard to your specific question on backlog, our backlog is pretty similar to what it was at the end of last year before the pandemic. So backlog is pretty solid. David MacGregor : Okay. And is there anything incremental to the distribution story of boilers that would be helping you next year? Kevin Wheeler : Nothing specific. We have still strong distribution. Of course, we have our rep-network, but I would say nothing that would be material to talk about today. David MacGregor : Right, right. Okay. Thanks very much, gentlemen. Kevin Wheeler : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs. Susan Maklari : Thank you. Good morning. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Chuck Lauber : Good morning. Susan Maklari : My first question is on the water treatment side of things. You highlighted that you expect some continued really elevated sales there over the course of \u201821. Can you talk a little bit about the margins? I know that you\u2019ve made some progress there over the last couple of quarters, but how you\u2019re thinking about that on a go-forward basis and any kind of pressures or benefits that we should be aware of in that? Kevin Wheeler : No, we were pleased with the expansion of about 200 basis points of margin this year. So we\u2019re just under 10% in 2020. Going forward, with the help of leverage on some growth, so next year we kind of see the growth being 13% to 14% again and continued work on costs. We would expect margins to expand over the \u2013 actually over the next couple of years in that 100 to 200 basis points. So we do expect forward progress on that as we continue to grow the base and continue to look at cost out. Chuck Lauber : I would just add, Susan, volume matters there too. So as that business continues to grow, we get the leverage or facilities, the operating leverage within them, which will also help us to improve margins on a long-term basis. Susan Maklari : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then my second question is just you mentioned that you are restarting your share buyback program this year, I think you kind of earmarked $400 million or so for that. Any color in terms of the kind of cadence of that. How we should be expecting it to come through and then kind of any appetite at the higher or the lower end of that $400 million? Kevin Wheeler : No, I mean I would peg it at $400 million right now. I wouldn\u2019t really go higher or lower and we\u2019re probably looking at throughout the years what we\u2019re kind of thinking of this. So the cadence would be pretty evenly throughout the year. Operator : And your next question comes from Bryan Blair with Oppenheimer. Bryan Blair : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Hey, Brian. Good morning. Bryan Blair : Chuck, I apologize if you\u2019ve provided this detail. I have offered a lot. But if we keep other variables constant for the year, what\u2019s the margin impact of normalizing residential volumes in 2021? Just trying to parse that out that relative hit knowing there are some offsets elsewhere. Chuck Lauber : Yes. I mean there are so many. I mean, I \u2013 it\u2019s hard to say that it\u2019s going to be stable, right. There\u2019re so many moving parts. Our costs have gone up so dramatically in the last short period of time. And when you look at those costs going up, if you look at \u2013 you\u2019re right, there is a little bit of the detrimental margin impact when you\u2019ve got a couple of hundred thousand units coming out of the industry. So, yes, there is some headwind there, but there are so many moving parts. It\u2019s hard to say. I think we\u2019re going to \u2013 we\u2019re just going to \u2013 we\u2019re going to be chasing our cost a bit next year. As you said, the costs have gone up so dramatically that there\u2019s going to be at least in the first half of the year a little headwind on North American margins. Bryan Blair : Okay, understood and great to see the momentum in your North American water treatment business. How is your M&A pipeline looking particularly when it comes to targets to continue to scale that platform? Kevin Wheeler : I would tell you that as we always do, we try to be active and we have certainly targets that we continue to stay close to in contact with. The pandemic has made that a little bit more challenging, but we remain active in reaching out the appropriate people. And as this pandemic, I think there is going to be some opportunity, but we\u2019re as active as we have always been and looking for opportunities that make sense to our core business. Operator : And your next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Nathan Jones : Good morning, everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Hi, Nathan. Good morning. Nathan Jones : I just wanted to follow-up a little bit on the rest of world margins. Comment that you don\u2019t have double-digit margins built into the model for 2022. I know in conversations we\u2019ve had that you targeted getting the mid-priced tiered product margins in China up to the premium tier margins by the end of 2021 with volume returning pretty nicely in RW, why isn\u2019t that you could get to double-digit margins in 2022 and what are the top one or two things that would need to happen for you to achieve that double-digit margin in 2022? Chuck Lauber : Yes. The fourth quarter is always the strongest quarter in China. So if you kind of look at the fourth quarter, you take out currency, you multiply it by four. We\u2019re back to a $1 billion business in the year just doesn\u2019t play out that way. Q1 is always weaker and so Q1 is just is just going to be challenged on that. So if you look at kind of the quarters building through the year, we\u2019re just not quite there yet on the volumes and on the cost out. Now, the margins, you\u2019re absolutely right. Our goal is to get the contribution margins back up to a similar percentage to the premium side of the product. That\u2019s going to take a little time. It takes a couple of things. It takes cost out, which we\u2019re working on over time. We won\u2019t be in that position in 2021, but we are working on it. And it\u2019s going to take volume to help us kind of leverage that through the footprint in China. Nathan Jones : And just a question on 4Q \u201820 North America, you guys had anticipated some channel destocking in 4Q 2020. It doesn\u2019t look like that happened. Can you talk about what led to that happening? Was it just customers deferring destocking that because the new price increases were coming, fundamental demand picked up, sell through picked up, just any commentary you can provide on what changed between your assumptions when you were giving 4Q \u201820 guidance? Chuck Lauber : Yeas I\u2019m not sure I could describe it better than you just did. It is also done, when we were talking about destocking, we didn\u2019t have a price increase coming up and quite frankly demand stay there. And I think as we look back on it, our distributors probably want to be a bit heavy right now on their inventories just to make sure they can take care of their customer demand. So there is a few things that happened that you described them. We expect that sometime in 2021 probably in the latter half of the year you start to see what we had said in the prior quarter actually happen. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Graham of Rosenblatt Securities. Chuck Lauber : Good morning, Scott. Operator : Scott, your line is open. Chuck Lauber : Scott, are you there. Scott Graham : Hello. I\u2019m here. Can you hear me? Chuck Lauber : We can hear you now. Scott Graham : Okay. I don\u2019t know what happened there. Okay, well congrats on the quarter. Chuck Lauber : Thank you. Scott Graham : So, first question is on China. Could you just give us that percent of sales for the business which I know you load up everything in there with water treatment and everything, premium versus upper middle in the quarter? Chuck Lauber : Yes. It really hasn\u2019t changed much. It\u2019s pretty consistent with what we\u2019ve been talking about. So we still see the majority in the upper mid-priced part of the segment of the market and not a lot has change since prior quarters. Scott Graham : Got it. Thank you. And then on back to the North American business, I want to just try to square away some comments to understand on them. I think you said that last year residential was units industry were up about 8%, but you kind of call that a normalized 6% to 8% and that the inventory build was maybe half of that, but that not all of that will come out this year. So, it sounds to me like 2 minus, that\u2019s a 2% headwind, does that fair? Chuck Lauber : Yes. That\u2019s fair. I mean, we think we\u2019ll get a little bit of help on new construction potentially in that category too. So we \u2013 that\u2019s exactly where we\u2019re thinking about in our outlook. Scott Graham : But well I only repeat, just want to make sure I got it right, Chuck. So those are very, very clear comment, but I mean the full out question from that is, if I may is, if you\u2019re thinking that the industry is down too and it\u2019s essentially because of that reason. I guess I\u2019m just wondering why you wouldn\u2019t expect sort of let\u2019s call it normalized, why would you expect it to be on the flat? Residential conditions are quite strong this year. I know you answered David\u2019s question earlier about labor and what have you, I mean I think we try to get a contract or in your house, I know you have to pay currency, the defense kind of thing. I understand that. But is it a labor thing or are you just maybe being a bit conservative on that number? Kevin Wheeler : I guess I think of it, Scott, is we would continue to expect to see some pretty decent consumer demand next year and proactive demand to be only down 2%. So we mean this year being up 6% to 8%, next year being down to 2%. You still have that kind of baseline proactive replacement, strong residential replacement, some potential growth year-over-year, I think in our numbers. So we do still expect it to be consumer demand pretty fairly strong, relatively strong, similar to what we saw this year on an underlying proactive replacement. Chuck Lauber : Scott, I would also tell you we\u2019re coming off a record. Even what we\u2019re forecasting is going to be one of the strongest years in the past decade. So there is still a lot of optimism out there, but optimism out there, but we just believe there is some stock that\u2019s going to come out that\u2019s going to make a difference. Kevin Wheeler : Yes. I mean really the big variable on how we look at next year is that 2% destocking or 200,000 units destocking. Operator : Your next question comes from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies. Saree Boroditsky : Hi, good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. Chuck Lauber : Good morning. Saree Boroditsky : Could you talked through what you\u2019re seeing in tankless market in North America. And if you\u2019re seeing any other areas introduce legislation somewhere to California limiting gas, Houston residential homes and how could that impact tankless sales going forward? Kevin Wheeler : Well, tankless had a good year. We believe it\u2019s going to be up low double-digits. So it kind of in line with the tank and so forth. So, it\u2019s kind of what we expecting in the tankless market and so forth. Now as far as \u2013 we have our California, you talking about decarbonization and so forth and I\u2019m not going to talk specifically about tankless, I would just talk about our position with regards to that. When you look at it for us, it\u2019s important that we are part of the conversation. We believe that GHG emissions in residential and commercial buildings, we want to be part of reducing those. We\u2019re constantly talking to policymakers just to make sure that they\u2019re keeping in mind the technologies and there is no one size fit all. You hear like California that they want to just go completely electric. We don\u2019t think a one size policy fit all, is the right way to go. We think multiple paths are there. So that\u2019s going to navigate its way through and we\u2019re going to be part of the conversation to make sure that technologies are including, performance of the products included and cost to the consumers included. And from an A.O. Smith perspective, I think we are positioned well. We have a full line of residential electric and commercial products in the market today. We have a full line of heat comp residential and commercial, which are the highest efficient electric water heaters out on the market and never want to forget that we have leading positions in condensing products, gas condensing, which can make a big difference in lowering GHG emissions just by going from a standard to a high efficiency model. So wherever the market is going to go, we\u2019re in position. Again, I would tell you, we\u2019re part of the conversation, but we\u2019re also positioned well. So we can be nimble and where the market goes we have the products that can meet the demand for the consumer, and of course, the commercial market as well. Saree Boroditsky : Thanks for that color. Then on the commercial, you talked about some uncertainty around that business obviously forecasting it down for this year, but could you help us understand from historical perspective, have there been many times where demand has declined two years in a row and could this forecast prove conservative? Chuck Lauber : I don\u2019t have taken a look on whether \u2013 and the answer is no. I mean, there probably hasn\u2019t been down 2x year in a row. But I think that the pandemic and the impact to, I call it, restaurants, hotels, some of the higher end \u2013 the higher usage categories that we participate in, it\u2019s really spreading across 2 years, right. So it started Q2 and it\u2019s still going. So I think that down year-over-year is more related to pandemic than anything. And we may see in the Kevin\u2019s comments earlier about how that might play out. I think we\u2019re going to have to wait and see what the back half of the year shows and where we\u2019re at in the pandemic disruption. Operator : And your last question comes from Larry De Maria with William Blair. Larry De Maria : Hey, thanks. Chuck Lauber : Hey, Larry. Larry De Maria : Hey, guys. Nice job. I know you talked about there kind of almost a noise about the inventory destocking. But just to be clear and then the potential pre-buy, are we expecting sales to comp up first half, comp down second half or could we sort of get close to flat because of the price increases? Can you just kind of clarify that a little bit? Chuck Lauber : I guess it\u2019s kind of hard to parse it out that way. I\u2019ll say we expect unit volume to be up in Q1 and that\u2019s because we do have the two price increases out there and typically there is a pre-buy before that. And then historically, the back half of the year is stronger than the front half of the year. So, when you kind of look at it that way I think maybe that will help kind of frame the model. Larry De Maria : Okay. I guess perhaps and then maybe that\u2019s mostly obviously residential, but it plays into North America, commercial had some headwinds there obvious. Is there \u2013 how do you think about that market getting toward a bottom? Is that potentially bottoming on a \u2013 just because if nothing else easier comps later this year and start to think about we\u2019ve comping up off a low base or do we expect that to be down over year? Kevin Wheeler : I think it\u2019s going to come down to how the economy opens up. There\u2019s been a lot of positive feedback of some governors that had been shutting down economies in realizing now that they have to open them up. But again, it comes down to restaurants have to be open up. They have to be more than 25% capacity. Hotels have to have people who are traveling. So I do think the pandemic is going to be a factor in how the commercial market returns and we\u2019ll have to wait and see how that plays out throughout the year. Operator : And I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to the host. Patricia Ackerman : Thank you everyone for joining us today. We plan to participate in two virtual conferences in the first quarter, Citibank on February 18 and Robert W. Baird on February 23. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participation and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Ms. Patricia Ackerman. Please go ahead. Patricia Ackerman : Thank you, May. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the A.O. Smith first quarter results conference call. I am Pat Ackerman, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability and our Treasurer. Joining me today are Kevin Wheeler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin with Kevin's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include among others matters that we have described in this morning's press release. Also as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. I will now turn the call over to Kevin, who will begin our prepared remarks on Slide 3. Kevin Wheeler : Thank you, Pat. Our global A.O. Smith team delivered first quarter EPS of $0.60 on a 21% increase in sales, demonstrating solid execution, despite pandemic and weather-related challenges in our supply chain and operations, along with rapidly rising material costs. I greatly appreciate the diligence of our team to keep each other healthy and safe. Outside of India, where COVID-19 cases have recently surged, I am pleased that we have experienced steady improvement in this area since the beginning of the year. North America water treatment grew 12%, driven by continued consumer demand for home improvement products, which provides safe drinking water in the home. The direct-to-consumer channel with our Aquasana brand and the dealer channel contributed to solid growth to start 2021. Boiler sales grew 12%, as we have seen strong demand, particularly within commercial boilers, as a result of completed projects carried over from 2020, as well as a resilient replacement demand. Our volumes of US tank residential water heaters declined in the first quarter, due to weather disruptions at our facility, supply chain constraints, which limited production. If not for limited production based on our surge in customer orders in the quarter, our US residential shipments would have increased compared with 2020. Strong orders in the quarter were largely due to extended lead times, our second price increase, which was effective April 1, and announced third price increase effective in June. Due to continued pandemic-related disruptions in restaurant and hospitality new construction and replacement demand, our commercial water heater volumes declined in the first quarter, largely in line with our expectations coming into the year. In China, sales increased over 100% in local currency, driven by higher consumer demand and the easy comparison compared with the pandemic disrupted first quarter of 2020. I will now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on our first quarter beginning on Slide 4. Chuck Lauber : Thank you, Kevin. First quarter sales of $769 million increased 21%, compared with 2020, largely due to significantly higher China sales. As a result of higher sales, first quarter net earnings increased 89% to $98 million or $0.60 per share compared with $52 million or $0.32 per share in 2020. Please turn to slide 5. Sales in the North America segment of $553 million increased 4% compared with the first quarter of 2020. Higher commercial boiler service parts and tankless water heater sales in the US, improved water heater sales in Canada, a 12% price -- 12% growth in water treatment sales and inflation related price increases on water heaters in the US were partially offset by lower US residential and commercial water heater volumes. Rest of the World segment sales of $222 million increased over 100% from the first quarter of 2020 driven by stronger consumer demand in each of our major product categories in China. Pandemic-related lockdowns and weak end market demand in the first quarter of 2020 provided an easy comparison for the first quarter of 2021. Currency translation of China sales favorably impacted sales by approximately $14 million.  On slide 6, North America segment earnings of $130 million increased 3% compared with the first quarter of 2020. The impact to earnings from higher sales and inflation-related price increases on water heaters was partially offset by higher material costs and freight costs and lower water heater volumes in the US. Segment operating margin of 23.6% was slightly lower than the first quarter of 2020. Rest of the World segment earnings of $12 million increased significantly compared with the first quarter of 2020, which was negatively impacted by the pandemic. In China, higher volumes and lower selling and administrative costs contributed to higher segment earnings. As a result, segment operating margin of 5.3% improved significantly from negative 38.3% in the first quarter of 2020. Our corporate expenses of $15 million were similar to the first quarter of 2020. Our effective tax rate of 22.5% was 110 basis points lower than the prior year largely due to geographical differences in pre-tax income. Please turn to slide 7. Cash provided by operations of $104 million increase -- or during the first quarter was higher than the first quarter of 2020, primarily as a result of higher earnings in 2020 compared with the prior year. Our cash balances totaled $660 million at the end of the first quarter and our net cash position was $559 million. Our leverage ratio was 5% as measured by total debt to total capital at the end of the first quarter. We completed refinancing our $500 million revolver credit facility on April 1st of this year. We currently have no borrowings on this facility. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of common stock for a total of $67 million. Please turn to slide 8. We upgraded our 2021 EPS guidance this morning with a range of between $2.55 and $2.65 per share. The midpoint of our range represents an increase of 20% compared with the 2020 adjusted results. We expect cash flow from operations in 2021 to be between $475 million and $500 million compared with $560 million in 2020. We expect higher earnings in 2021 will be more than offset by higher investments in working capital than in our prior year. Our 2021 capital spending plans are between $85 million and $90 million and our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $80 million. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $52 million, which is similar to 2020. Our effective tax rate is assumed to be approximately 23% in 2021. Average outstanding diluted shares of 160 million assumes $400 million worth of shares are repurchased in 2021. I will now turn the call over to Kevin who will summarize our guidance assumptions beginning on slide nine. Kevin? Kevin Wheeler : Our businesses continue to navigate through supply chain and logistic challenges. The first quarter was particularly challenging for our North America water heater business. Severe weather impacted our Ashland City and Juarez facilities and resulted in a weak production at each plant in the quarter. Supply chain constraints limited our ability to make up the lost production within the quarter. As a result of a surge in orders approximately 30% higher than the first quarter last year, our lead-times have further extended. We are working with customers on managing orders along with our operations and supply chain teams working diligently to meet demand. However, we expect to be catching up throughout the second quarter and into the third quarter. Our outlook for 2021 includes the following assumptions. We have not changed our outlook for full year US residential heater industry volumes and continue to project a full year volume will be down 2% or 200,000 units in 2021, a small retracement from the record volume shipped in 2020. We expect commercial industry water heater volumes will decline approximately 4% as pandemic impacted business delay or defer new construction and discretionary replacement installation. We continue to experience inflation across our supply chain, particularly steel and logistics costs. Steel has increased 25% since we announced our April 1st water heater price increase. We announced a third price increase in late March on water heaters effective June 1 at a blended rate of 8.5%. In China, it is encouraging to see sales of our products continue to remain strong through April. Our strategy continues to expand distribution to Tier 4 through 6 cities is on track. We see improvement in consumer trends towards trading up for higher priced products across all product categories, driven by differentiated new products launched in the last 12 to 24 months. We expect year-over-year increase and local currency sales between 18% to 20% in China. We assume China currency rates will remain at current levels adding approximately $15 million and $3 million to sales and profits over the prior year respectively. We have nearly doubled our growth projections and our outlook for our North America boiler sales for mid-single-digit growth to approximately 10% growth based on a strong first quarter, strong backlog, and visibility into quoting activity. Our expectations are based on several growth drivers. We believe pent-up demand from the declines last year will drive growth. The transition to higher energy efficient boilers will continue particularly as commercial buildings improve their overall carbon footprint. In 2020, condensing boilers were 39% of the commercial boiler industry. That represents our addressable market, which provides continued opportunity for our leading market share commercial condensing boilers. New product launches including improvements to our flagship Crest commercial condensing boiler with a market differentiating oxygen sensor, which continuously measures and optimizes boiler performance, and introduction of a 1 million BTU light-duty commercial Knight FTXL. We continue to project 13% to 14% full year sales growth in our North America water treatment products, similar to that which we have seen in the first quarter. We believe the mega trends of healthy and safe drinking water, as well as a reduction of single-use plastic bottles will continue to drive consumer demand for our point-of-use and point of entry water treatment systems. We believe margins in this business could grow by 100 to 200 basis points higher than the nearly 10% margin achieved in 2020. In India, first quarter 2021 sales were nearly double the prior year. While India is challenged with recent COVID case resurgence, we project 2021 full year sales to increase over 20%, compared with 2020 to incur a smaller loss of $1 million to $2 million. Please turn to slide 10. We project revenue will increase between 14% to 15% in 2021, as strong North America water treatment, boiler and China sales, enhanced by pricing action, more than offset expected weaker North America water heater volumes. Our sales growth projections include approximately $15 million of benefit from China currency translation. We expect North America segment margin to be between 23% and 23.5% and Rest of World segment margins to be between 7% and 8%. I'm on slide 11. Our operations faced continued challenges in the first quarter. And while we expect continued headwinds in supply chain and logistics in the near term, I have confidence in our teams to continue to navigate through this environment. Along with the strength of our people, I believe A.O. Smith is a compelling investment for numerous reasons. We have leading share positions in our major product categories. We estimate replacement demand represents 80% to 85% of US water heater and boiler volumes. We have a strong brand, premium brand in China, a broad product offering in our key product categories, broad distribution and a reputation for quality and innovation in that region. Over time, we are well positioned to maximize favorable demographics in both China and India to enhance shareholder value. We are excited for the opportunity we see in our North America water treatment platform. We have strong cash flow and balance sheet, supporting the ability to continue to invest for the long term, with investments in automation, innovation and new products, as well as acquisitions and return cash to shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks and we are now available for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We have our first question from the line of Saree Boroditsky from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Saree Boroditsky : So you mentioned the surge in orders on the residential water heater side. Could you help quantify the impact of the weather and supply issue [changes] (ph) in the quarter? And do you expect those orders to come through in 2Q? And then just when you have a large backlog of orders, will those come in at the older prices? Thanks. Chuck Lauber : Yes. This is Chuck. Good morning. We did have some interruptions. We've got two plants that were down Ashland City and Morez were down due to weather for approximately a week each. So that it does a couple of things, one, is it raises the orders that come in from a perspective of it, it creates a bit of a surge. And when lead times extend a bit due to a temporary interruption, we see more orders, which extend the lead times. So that quantification we do expect to make that up in the second and third quarters. We would expect that we would get a little bit more normalization of production throughout the second and third quarter and those orders would come in. Now to quantify the surge in orders it's a bit difficult. There's a lot of noise in the marketplace from the interruption I just described, as well as three price increases at once. So not all at once, but February, April, and June and that just creates a bit of noise. So as far as the effectuation of the pricing on those, we work to manage the orders that come through on a more normalized basis. But the extended lead times do push that realization on price out slightly. So an April 1st price increase, for example, is going to be extended a bit. But when we look at all of our pricing, we would expect that the full impact would be implemented when we get into the third quarter. Saree Boroditsky : That's really helpful. And then you still expect to see a decline in commercial water heater volumes but there's been a more positive outlook for restaurants and travel. So could you just talk through how you're thinking about demand in that market? Chuck Lauber : I think it's still a little early. We would agree with you as COVID and vaccines become more prevalent and things start to open up that certainly is an opportunity going forward. It's probably a bit early here in April to change our outlook. We're still -- we still believe there's going to be a modest decline as we mentioned about 4%. But overall it's a possible upside, yes, but probably just a little too early to project that in late April. Operator : We have our next question from the line of Damian Karas from UBS. Your line is now open. Damian Karas : Hi, good morning everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Chuck Lauber : Good morning. Damian Karas : So I was just hoping you could maybe clarify a little bit on the residential water heaters outlook. I mean, so you're still expecting the market down 2% this year, but it sounds like you're incrementally positive on the demand environment and you noted that 30% surge in orders. So could you just help reconcile that disconnect? Do you think this demand is short-lived? And you're going to, therefore, see a fall-off in the back half of the year? Kevin Wheeler : Yeah. I think what Chuck outlined really well is that there's just a lot of noise in order entry now because of lead times, because again we're working on a third price increase. And so that just pulls orders forward. And so as we think about it, we'll work through those orders. There's certainly going to be some new construction activity, but just remember that we really come into play in completions, not starts. So right now we just think that the 200,000, retracement that we talked about is probably the best forecast we can have until we work through this backlog and get to the other side to really understand what was true demand versus just normal demand brought forward by pricing or extended lead time. So it's -- again you'll probably hear us say this a little bit, just a little too early to take these numbers considering there's so many variables, that we're going to have to work through. But we'll have a better clear picture probably end of second quarter, early third quarter. Chuck Lauber : Yeah. I'll just add one comment. And when you take a step back and you look at last year, the industry was the highest level it's been since 2006. There's a lot of noise we believe, because of the pandemic, because of some supply chain constraints pushing lead times out. And we do expect, as we kind of go through the year, and particularly when we get into the third and fourth quarter that, the industry may be behind us that a bit and that may drive down a little bit of the demand as we get into the back half of the year, as inventories get a little more comfortable. Damian Karas : Okay. That's helpful. And I guess, thinking about once we get into the third quarter and the fourth quarter, how best do we think about the actual financial impact of the 30% or so, year-to-date increases in price? I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but, it doesn't appear that your expectation is that, sales or revenues are going to go up by 30% in the back half. So what's -- how do we think about the translation of those announced price increases to the top line later this year? Chuck Lauber : Yeah. Well you're exactly right on kind of thinking about, when we look at the three price increases. And if you kind of look at what we've announced, we're in that 24% to 27% range. We think as far as you look at a blended by product category, when you look at the residential and commercial market. So they do come in, into really what's going to fall into what I would say, for sure, largest part of that would be expected to come in, in the fourth quarter. And we're going to see it feather in a bit in the third quarter. So you got to kind of think about the fact that it's not fully implemented probably or fully impacting us in Q3, it kind of feathers in, as we go throughout the year. Operator : Next is Jeffrey Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open. David Tarantino : Good morning. This is David Tarantino on for Jeff. Chuck Lauber : Good morning, David. Kevin Wheeler : Hi David. David Tarantino : So on price increases, was there any pre-buy ahead of price increases? And I know you're talking about destocking last quarter. So if any where would be the greatest period of destocking? Kevin Wheeler : Well, we actually believe there's been some destocking in the first quarter, just because of some of the constraints that we've had. But when you look at, any pre-buy we normally limit to a month of production. So there's always a pre-order, I would say that we're seeing. And that's part of our backlog. And our surge right now is that, you had April orders that were already put in by our customers in the first quarter. Then of course, you have June that just came up and people are getting in line and place the orders for that increase. So, there is always an order pull forward that we have to work through. And again, we'll work through that most of the second quarter and into the third quarter and hope to be -- have that part of it behind us, as we get through July and August. David Tarantino : Okay. And then, just as a follow-up. What -- have you seen or are you -- like are you seeing on pricing in China? Kevin Wheeler : Well, I'll tell you, just taking in general, we have some inflationary issues across the globe. And so -- and we don't get into all the specifics that we take pricing action. But we've taken pricing action in almost every one of our businesses, some are a bit different than others. China doesn't quite have the -- some of the inflationary pressures that we've seen here. India may be a bit different. Europe is a little bit different. But what we've done is, we've taken action to make sure that over time we're able to address these inflationary pressures that we're seeing today. And we believe we have a track record that's going to prove out that we can address these, given the appropriate amount of time. Chuck Lauber : And just to add on a comment on China and it's not directly related to pricing, but just mix. And we're pleased that we're kind of looking at it quarter-over-quarter where mix is neutral to positive. So not necessarily pricing, but our mix, we believe, has taken a point where, from here through the rest of the year we forecasted to be kind of a neutral positive, where we had some headwinds last year. Operator : Next is Matt Summerville from D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open. Matt Summerville : \u2026around this a little bit, but I was hoping for a bit more specificity in terms of how we should be thinking about the quarterly revenue and earnings cadence in North America with the moving pieces around the pre-buys, the destocking and the price increases satisfying these incoming orders you were referring to, where do you think the high watermark will be on a quarterly basis versus the low watermark? Kevin Wheeler : Yes. There's a lot of moving parts. You're exactly right. So let me just try to frame up high level how we think about it. And I've already kind of talked about when pricing would potentially be expected to come in. And when we look at our cost side, right? So if you think about our cost side and we've seen costs go up in multiple categories, freight, corrugated, our resins, our foam. There's a lot of categories that's going up. But when you think about our biggest category, which is steel, and we've talked a lot about steel pricing going up. It's coming in. We do have a benefit of a 90 to 120-day lag. So when we think about steel costs hitting us, progressively gets higher during the year. So year-over-year steel costs just -- we expect it to be on average up over 70%. But when you look at the quarter cadence, kind of back to your question, we get hit with the highest costs in the third and fourth quarter. So the most pressure on margins in North America will be in the back half of the year, as we feel the full impact of some of the higher price increases that we're seeing on cost side and see some of the pricing being more fully implemented in the fourth quarter. Matt Summerville : And then with respect to China, can you just talk about what your latest assessment is in terms of channel inventories? What your sell-in look like versus sell-through in the quarter? And which product lines you're seeing the most relative strengths currently? Thank you. Kevin Wheeler : Yes, I'll take the -- we're seeing -- well Q1 was a terrible comp, because it was just such a low point in time. But if you look at it going forward, sell-out has been robust. We're looking at a 6% to 7% sellout throughout the year. Very pleased that it's going across all of our core categories. So it's electric water heaters, gas tankless and water treatment. So that's moving in the right direction. And Chuck just mentioned, it's nice to see our mix leaning towards the premium sector. And we really saw that -- we always really had it on water treatment throughout the pandemic, but we really saw some nice movement up on our residential electric and gas tankless, I think, to some new products, particularly on the gas tankless which is a grade one product that has the lowest noise level, which is exceptionally important to the Chinese consumer. So overall the business is moving in the right direction. We think we're positioned very well over the next few quarters to move that business forward. From an inventory position, I'll let Chuck review that. Chuck Lauber : Yes, the channel inventories are in great shape. Lowest point in five years. Very refreshed, I'll say so that it's all within 90 days basically. So it's in great shape in China from a channel inventory perspective. Operator : Next is Eitan Buchbinder from Citi. Your line is now open. Eitan Buchbinder : Hi. Good morning. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Chuck Lauber : Good morning. Eitan Buchbinder : Rest of the World segment margin improved significantly from the COVID impact of Q1 last year and incrementals it seemed just about short of 50%. So do you anticipate maintaining this level of incrementals in Q2, which had a less drastic, but still steep sales decline in 2020? Chuck Lauber : Yes. This is Chuck. No, we don't see the same incremental levels going into the back half of the year -- or back three quarters of the year in Q2. In China, we're kind of looking at incrementals in that 40% range. And then as you think about, kind of, how the year plays out in China we've got a special item that we had last year, which was social insurance which helped us for about $12 million last year which we won't see this year. And that --the cadence of that by quarter we got the most benefit last year in Q2 and Q3. So Q1 was very small last year. So that's a bit of a headwind as we go through the rest of the year in China. So, I mean, we're pleased with where the first quarter came out in China just under 6%. That was a pretty solid quarter for what is always a challenging seasonal quarter for us with the festivals and the holiday. And the fourth quarter is always our strongest. So as we kind of look at China and Kevin mentioned it we would expect the back three quarters of the year to progressively improve. Overall, growth rate in that 6% to 7%. And then we get into the fourth quarter approaching double-digit operating margins in the fourth quarter similar to what we had last year. Eitan Buchbinder : That's very helpful color. And as a follow-up given your raised expectations for operating cash flow, continued strong balance sheet and expanded share repurchase authority, what would you need to see to expand 2020's repurchase beyond the current 400 million? And is there any potential for an uptick in the pace of inorganic growth? Chuck Lauber : Well, I'll address the $400 million. I think at this time we're going to keep it framed at $400 million. We, kind of, do that because we don't want to grow cash. And you're right we've had -- we're going to have a strong cash generation year this year too. We're going to keep looking to deploy capital. So we're very, very actively looking at where we can deploy our capital through acquisition. And so as we play out the year we're still focused on deploying the capital in that area and we're going to maintain our repurchase at this point at the $400 million. Kevin Wheeler : Yes. I would just add on to that. Again things can change over the next six months to nine months. We've talked about it. We've been very active in the M&A side. We think there's some opportunities out there. And we're staying close to those opportunities. And again, it always takes two to close the deal, but we would prefer to deploy our capital in the M&A side and invest back in ourselves. And at the end, we'll take a look at it as we get through the balance of this year and we'll make a determination how best to move forward with our capital allocation. Kevin Wheeler : Yes. I guess I'll add-on on the organic growth. I mean, we're pleased with the growth we're seeing in North America water treatment growing at 12% to 13% for the rest of the year, that's an area of growth we like the trends that we're seeing in China growing at that 6% to 7% for the back three quarters of the year. So, a couple of areas of growth that we're optimistic about. Chuck Lauber : Yes. I would just add on that. I mean, organic growth across our product our businesses right now looks pretty strong. For us to raise our Lochinvar business up to a 10% growth, we're seeing that part of the business, which is a bit surprising us really bounced back. And so if you look across all our businesses, the organic side of it looks pretty strong as we go out through the year. We always reserve the right because things can change in this chaotic environment we\u2019re in with COVID and so forth. But organically all our businesses are well positioned. Operator : Next is Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Susan Maklari : Good morning everybody. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Patricia Ackerman : Hi. Susan Maklari : My first question is you mentioned that you have seen some destocking in the first quarter. But I guess can you give us some more color on where you think inventories are in the channel? I know that you kind of -- you came into the fourth quarter with some excess inventory came into this year with it. Do you think that with the weather in Texas and everything that went on in the first quarter that that's basically being depleted? And do you think that this pull forward is in a sense them just trying to get back to normal, or are they looking to actually carry a bit more inventory maybe than they would have prior to the past year? Chuck Lauber : Yes. I mean, from our perspective, and some of the disruptions that Kevin talked about due to the weather, we do believe that we've seen some -- our customers' inventory is coming down, because we we're trying to get production out as best we can and satisfy customer needs, but there's been some stress in that area. So for the quarter, we do believe our customers' inventories have decreased when you look at where we started the year. We would expect that to normalize as we go forward for the remainder of the year and as we bring down lead times. So we kind of expect more normalization to inventory levels as we exit the year, and that kind of plays into the guidance of where we talked about our full year outlook for residential. Kevin Wheeler : Yes. And our teams are really focused on making sure that as we're going through these kind of challenging times when it comes to material shortages and so forth, that we're actually producing products for orders that customers actually need. And we're not just building inventory. So the positive side of this, I would like to leave with is that our customers do have stock they are taking care of their customers and we're working very closely to make sure that continues over the next quarter or so as we work through this backlog. Susan Maklari : Okay. That's helpful. And then on the commercial side, I know that you mentioned that you're clearly catching up on -- your customers are catching up on some of the delays and things that were postponed from last year. Are you also seeing that there's any level of increased new construction or projects that are really kind of starting to break ground that are coming through and kind of helping some of that backlog as well? Kevin Wheeler : We're seeing and we mentioned in the remarks, we are seeing quoting activity remained fairly good. And again, it's similar to last quarter, we commented that the projects aren't maybe as large, but they're still active. So the combination of kind of the pent-up demand that we're filing today and a nice backlog that we have and then this quoting activity which could come in at the end of this year, but it will probably carry over to 2022. So it's been a -- on the commercial side of the business, the higher end the kind of the boiler [Indiscernible] side, it's bounced back a bit more than we anticipated. Operator : Next is David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Your line is now open. David MacGregor : Yes. Good morning, everyone. And I guess, congratulations on some of the progress in the Rest of the World segment, China for certain. When we look back on the margins that you would generate in the Rest of the World business for a long, long time before things became problematic in China, it was kind of a 13% margin.  And I'm just wondering if we step back here for a second and talk longer-term, how you're thinking about the potential for margin generation in China? What -- did we go back to 13% numbers? I know there's been a transition to a higher concentration of medium price point versus premium price point. But I think you'd indicated on prior calls that you felt like the margins were relatively equivalent. And so I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of what's the potential on RoW margins, or is there upside based on various initiatives you've undertaken along the way, help us think longer-term about the potential there? Chuck Lauber : Yes. I mean, so we framed our Rest of the World margins this year in that 7% to 8%. And what we saw last year in the fourth quarter is we were at the double-digit margin percentage and we get a little bit of volume. And so right now, 10% is kind of where our target is in the upcoming time frame, not this year. But as we look at that, that's certainly doable in the current environment where we've got a heavier amount of mid-priced products than we historically have. We haven't seen the strength in the trading up on the high end of the market. Even though, Kevin had noted in his remarks that we've seen some positive trends in that area it's not at the same level as what we had in the past. And those margins while we on a percentage basis are similar they are lower than the high end of the market. So we do get some pressure on that. So when we think about kind of the transition that the business has taken a bit on store count efficiency, the SG&A initiatives that we've done. We have taken costs out of the business to grow a bit back into higher margins we need a little bit more volume. We'd also like to see some trading up outside of the categories and the water treatment has been a pretty good category for us, so we'd like to see more trading up. Housing coming back would help us to get some of the volume back up and just consumer confidence in the trading up. So we need a little bit of help in that category to get back to higher margins than what we're experiencing today, but those are some of the areas that we're watching very closely. David MacGregor : And if I could just clarify on that because I do have a second question, but it sounds like what I'm hearing you say is that it's dependent upon volume and mix up. And -- but just for the sake of sort of putting together some longer-term construct here, if you were to get the volume you needed if volume moved back up to a much higher level of operating rate and you were to get a little bit of strength on the premium side of this in both water heaters and water treatment, is there a structural reason why you can't get back to 13% something changed there, or based on some reasonable assumptions not getting ridiculous, but 15% is still an achievable goal? Chuck Lauber : No. There's not a structural change there. But to your comment, I'd say the largest driver of that is seeing the market move further into the trading up high end of the piece of the market than what it is today. But yes, structurally there's no reason that we can't get back there with some of the other factors volume higher end of the market trading up, along with some of the restructuring we've done. David MacGregor : Okay. My second question is with regard to tankless product in the United States. And can you just talk about category growth what you're seeing there and your share? And I guess, what would you need to see to commit more capital to that category in the North American market? Kevin Wheeler : Well, I mean, I would start out with the back half of the question. We're already investing capital. And it's part of our offering. I've mentioned many times, we're in the hot water business. And so we're fairly \u2013 what we're looking for is the best solution. And at times tankless is the best and other times the tank is. When you look at the business today, we talked a bit about Texas. So our tankless has been up a bit, and it's interesting because in Texas, it's a warmer climate and a lot of the tankless were installed outdoors. And that's fine we \u2013 because there's an electrical part [Indiscernible] freeze that prevent the unit from freezing. But we saw an uptick in Texas, because not only did we have cold weather, but we had no electricity as well. And so tankless for us was up in the quarter. And it was just driven by a one-time weather-related item that can happen. But overall, I mean, I don't want to leave - tankless is still part of our long-term strategy. It's part of our residential product offering. And just like any other products that we have heat pumps and regular electrics and so forth and so we're committed to it. And over time, we believe we'll continue to carve out the appropriate share in that product category. Operator : Next question is from Ryan Connors from Boenning & Scattergood. Your line is now open. Ryan Connors : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to talk about competitive dynamics a little bit. And obviously everyone's supply chain is unique and been a crazy year on the manufacturing front. And so sometimes these situations create the opportunity for some market share shifts, and we have seen that in some other industrial sectors. So, how do you think you're coping relative to your peers through all these supply chain issues? And are there opportunities to pick up market share outgrow the market given some of the things going on? Kevin Wheeler : Yeah. I would tell you from a \u2013 excluding the weather that, I mentioned that impacted our plans. I think we're coping very well with the supply chain and we're certainly getting our fair share of the raw materials and so forth. So overall, I think we're doing well. We have a terrific operations and supply chain group. And we have terrific suppliers that they're working through their own capacity constraints as they're ramping up or repairing some of the things that were impacted out of the Gulf region. So, I think we're doing well that's why as we get into Q2 and Q3, we get back to a normalized level. Our factories don't have a week out of production. So overall, and then, I would tell you from my perspective anytime you have any type of disruption, it's who executes the best. And there are some opportunities there. And those will have to play out over the next maybe Q1 and part of Q3. Ryan Connors : Okay. And then my other one just is on kind of tax policy and some of the changes being proposed. I know none of its concrete yet. But specifically, this proposal of kind of going after foreign corporate earnings, have you looked at that in any detail? And any idea or color on how that might or might not impact your Rest of World business in China in particular? Kevin Wheeler : Yes. I mean it's still being formed of course. But we have taken a high-level look at that. We don't believe that that's going to impact us in a significant way. Clearly, if the corporate tax rate goes up from 21% to 28% or somewhere in between, that has a much larger impact. Operator : Next is Nathan Jones from Stifel. Your line is now open. Nathan Jones : There's also proposed changes in here for increasing the capital gains tax. Are you seeing that potentially motivate some more sellers for properties that you might be interested in domestically? Kevin Wheeler : Well, when there's uncertainty in tax rate and capital gains, I imagine that does get some private owners to think a little bit about when the right timing might be to exit. So, the mosaic of what's happening in M&A is kind of made up of multiple things and that certainly could be a driver. Nathan Jones : Okay. And then, I just had one around pricing. If you need a replacement water heater or residential water heater you're going to buy one. And the new construction demand is obviously pretty strong here. So I think the unit demand is pretty good. You guys have been through these inflationary cycles before maybe not quite to this extent. Do you typically see customers trade down in price point to offset that inflation or does that not have an impact on the way customers are looking at what they're buying in terms of water heater? Kevin Wheeler : Yes. I will take that. The vast majority -- there's not a quite frankly a lot of trading up within the US residential water heater business. And so, normally speaking that's just the way it is. And so, we don't see much changes. The only thing I would tell you that you might see during this time is on our heat pumps or our high-end products, if those might be impacted a bit, but it's relatively small impact to us when we go through these, kind of inflationary times. Because quite frankly yield, as you just said, when you're out of hot water, you're going to replace it and availability is the number one driver for a consumer. Nathan Jones : Okay. Thanks for taking my question. Kevin Wheeler : Thank you. Operator : Next is Kevin Hocevar from Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. Kevin Hocevar : Hey. Good morning, everybody. A nice start to the year there. Kevin Wheeler : Thanks. Kevin Hocevar : In terms of coming back to price and the price cost relationship, it sounds like expectations are -- it will -- pricing will phase-in and by fourth quarter, it should be fully implemented. Do you think at that point you'll be fully offsetting the inflationary pressures with the pricing actions you've announced or might you need more in order to do that? Kevin Wheeler : Well, I mean we've announced three price increases. And each time we've announced the price increase, we've seen costs go up after that. So, we're -- it's hard to predict where costs will go. Our forecast for the year assumes the costs are kind of where they are right now, particularly on the steel side. So, we'll have to see how the year plays out. When we get to the fourth quarter, we think about kind of that price cost, I mean on our assumption and what we've announced and based on what our costs are projected out to be we get to the point where we're covering costs but we do expect some pressure on margin. Kevin Hocevar : Yes. Okay. And you guys have done a really good job managing SG&A here in the quarter and really for the last several quarters. And if I look back in recent history, it seems like the first quarter typically has the highest SG&A spend as a percent of sales for the year. So curious, if you expect that dynamic to remain here in 2021 where the first quarter is the highest SG&A as high a percent of sales, or would there be any reason that would be different this year? Chuck Lauber : I would not say that this year we would expect SG&A to be the highest percent of sales. I think as I was looking at it for the quarter, particularly in China, we had a pretty good SG&A quarter. We were watching our costs very closely in China with lower volume. Not a lot of travel in the first quarter this year compared to last year. We'll have to see how that plays out for the rest of the year. But again, I wouldn't say that the quarter is going to play out much different than the back three quarters from a percentage of sales. Operator : Next is Damian Karas from UBS. Your line is now open. Damian Karas : Hey guys. Just a couple of quick follow-ups here. Sorry, if I missed this, but did you mention how much tankless was up in the quarter? And I'm curious how many units you're expecting to push this year for tankless? Kevin Wheeler : No. We did not mention either one. So no, we haven't mentioned either one and that data doesn't get public. Actually tankless data doesn't get published at all. And just not -- we haven't really addressed that from that specific product categories. Chuck Lauber : Yeah. It was a strong quarter but we haven't quantified it. It was certainly up for us. Damian Karas : Okay. Fair enough. And then just wanted to ask you about buybacks. So obviously your guidance is a little bit better than when you -- where you came into the year with the potential for a little bit more improvement in resi water heaters as well depending on what happens. Just curious if there's any chance you might buy back more than the $400 million that you had -- you're currently saying for the year? Chuck Lauber : At this point, we're going to stay at the $400 million. I mean, we'll see how the year plays out. We really are focusing on not growing our cash position and reserving the opportunity to deploy that cash in other productive ways. So as we stand today, we're going to stay with that $400 million. Damian Karas : Okay. Great. Appreciate all the color. Chuck Lauber : All right. Thanks. Operator : No further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to Ms. Patricia Ackerman. Patricia Ackerman : Thank you all for joining us today. We plan to participate in seven virtual conferences in the second quarter. Oppenheimer on May 1st -- on May 4, Northcoast on May 11, Goldman on May 13, William Blair on June 1, KeyBanc on June 2, UBS on June 9 and Stifel on June 10. Have a great day. Bye-bye. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

After the speaker\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ms. Patricia Ackerman. Thank you. Please go ahead, ma'am. Pat Ackerman : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the A. O. Smith second quarter results conference call. I am Pat Ackerman, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability and Treasurer. Joining me today are Kevin Wheeler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin with Kevin's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include among others matters that we have described in this morning's press release. Also, as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. I will now turn the call over to Kevin, who will begin our prepared remarks on slide 3. Kevin Wheeler : Thank you, Pat, and good morning, everybody. Our global A. O. Smith team delivered second quarter EPS of $0.73 on a 30% increase in sales, demonstrating solid execution and operational agility despite supply chain and logistic challenges along with rapidly rising material costs. I am thankful for my fellow A. O. Smith employees, who tirelessly navigated through the pandemic, followed by weather-related production disruptions and continue to navigate supply chain constraints. I appreciate the creativity and the collaboration of our team to find solutions to keep our customers supply with water heating and water treatment products. Boiler sales grew 35%, driven by strong demand as a result of completed projects carried over from 2020, as well as an active education end market. For reference, our boiler sales were down 15% in the second quarter of 2020, which was negatively impacted by the pandemic. North America water treatment grew 17%, driven by continued consumer demand for home improvement products, which provide safe drinking water in the home. Our water quality dealers performed particularly well in the quarter and online promotional shopping days also boosted sales. Consistent with our strategy to build out distribution for North America water treatment, we acquired Master Water Conditioning Corporation. The acquisition supplements our presence in the Northeast, and we are excited to add expertise in local water condition and solutions in this region to our family. Our North America water treatment sales, including this acquisition are expected to be over $200 million in 2021. Our volumes of US tank residential water heaters increased in the second quarter. We believe the strong demand is a continued result of extended lead times caused by production constraints due to strain in the supply chain, buying in advance of price increases and incremental new home construction. After our weather-related disruptions in production, which we talked about on our first quarter call, we have seen month-over-month sequential improvement and certain of our suppliers recently noted they see moderation of demand and supply imbalances. But we remain vigilant, as the imbalances are spotty and we expect supply chain challenges to be with us through the remainder of the year. In response to continued material and logistic cost increases, we recently announced a fourth price increase of between 10% and 12%, effective August 1. In China, sales increased over 26% in local currency driven by growth in each of our major product categories, including electric and gas tankless water heaters and water treatment products, including commercial and replacement filters. I will now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on the second quarter, beginning on slide 4. Chuck Lauber : Thank you, Kevin. Record second quarter sales of $860 million increased 30% compared with 2020, which was negatively impacted by the pandemic. Second quarter net earnings increased 74% to $118 million or $0.73 per share compared with $68 million or $0.42 per share in 2020. Please turn to slide 5. Sales in the North America segment of $604 million increased 26% compared with the second quarter of 2020 driven by higher volumes of water heaters, boilers and water treatment products and inflation-related price increases. Rest of the World segment sales of $263 million increased 39% from the second quarter of 2020. Growth in each of our major product categories in China contributed to local currency growth of 26% in the quarter. Currency translation of China sales favorably impacted sales by approximately $20 million. India sales more than doubled in the second quarter despite the recent surge in cases of the virus in that region. North America segment earnings of $142 million increased 34% compared with the second quarter of 2020. The impact to earnings from higher volumes and inflation-related price increases was partially offset by higher material and freight costs. As a result of these factors, segment operating margin of 23.5% improved compared with the second quarter of 2020 segment margin of 21.9%. Rest of the World segment earnings of $22 million increased significantly compared with the loss of $5.8 million in the second quarter of 2020, which was negatively impacted by shutdowns and reduced consumer spending resulting from the pandemic. In China, higher volumes and lower selling and administrative costs were partially offset by the absence of social insurance waivers, which were received in 2020. As a result, segment operating margin of 8.5% improved from a negative 3% in the second quarter of 2020. Our corporate expenses of $12 million were higher than last year largely due to management incentives. Our effective tax rate of 21.9% was essentially the same as last year. Please turn to slide 7. Cash provided by operations of $196 million during the first half was higher than during the first half of 2020. Higher earnings in 2021 compared with the prior year were partially offset by a larger investment in working capital during the first half of 2021, compared with the same period in 2020. Our cash balances totaled $582 million at the end of June and our net cash position was $476 million. Our leverage ratio was 5.5% as measured by total debt to total capital at the end of June. Through June 30, we repurchased approximately three million shares of common stock for a total of $198 million. Please turn to slide 8. We upgraded our 2021 EPS guidance this morning with a range of between $2.70 and $2.76 per share. The midpoint of our range represents an increase of 5% compared with our prior quarter full year guidance. We expect cash flow from operations in 2021 to be between $500 million and $525 million compared with $560 million in 2020. We expect higher earnings in 2021 will be more than offset by higher investments in working capital than in the prior year. Our 2021 capital spending plans are between $85 million and $90 million and our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $80 million. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $50 million similar to 2020. Our effective tax rate is assumed to be approximately 23% in 2021. Average outstanding diluted shares of 160 million assumed $400 million worth of shares are repurchased in 2021. I will now turn the call over to Kevin, who will summarize our guidance assumptions beginning on slide 9. Kevin? Kevin Wheeler : Our businesses continue to navigate through supply chain and logistic challenges. That being said, we raised our 2021 top line growth expectation, and now project an increase of between 17% and 18% driven by strong demand and price increases implemented in response to rising material and transportation costs. Our revenue outlook for 2021 includes the following assumptions. With seven months of visibility, we've upgraded our US residential water heater industry volume forecast to increase approximately 3% compared with last year. We expect continued resilient replacement demand and growth in new home construction. With our fourth price increase in the market and continued consumer demand, we no longer believe there will be channel inventory destocking in the back half of the year. We expect commercial industry water heater volumes will increase approximately 2%, as pandemic-impacted businesses reopen and new production and replacement installations come back online. We believe the demand we saw in the last few months was partially driven by a pre-buy activity in advance of the price increases. In China, it is encouraging to see sales of our products continue to remain strong. Our strategy to continue to expand distribution to Tier 4 through 6 cities is on track. We see improvement in consumer trends, towards trading up for higher-priced products across all of our product categories driven by differentiated new products launched in the last 12 months to 24 months. We expect year-over-year increases in local currency sales between 20% and 22% in China. We assume China currency rates will remain at current levels adding approximately $51 million and $4 million to sales and profits over the prior year respectively. Boiler sales grew 24% in the first half of 2021. The comparison will be tougher in the back half of the year, and we expect boiler sales will grow by low double digits for the full year compared with last year. We project 13% to 14% full year sales growth in North America water treatment. We believe the megatrends of healthy and safe drinking water as well as reduction of single-use plastic bottles will continue to drive consumer demand for our point-of-use and point-of-entry water treatment systems. We project margins in this business to grow by 100 basis points above the nearly 10% achieved in 2020. We continue to experience inflation across our supply channel, particularly steel and logistic costs. Steel has increased 23% since our third water heater price increase became effective on June 1. We announced a fourth price increase in late June on water heaters effective August 1st at the rate between 10% and 12%. We expect North America segment margin to be between 23.75% and 23%. And Rest of World segment margins to be approximately 8%. Our procurement and operation team faced continued challenges in the second quarter. And while we expect continued headwinds in supply chain and logistics throughout the remainder of the year, these challenges are moderating, and I have confidence in our team to continue to navigate through this difficult environment. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bryan Blair with Oppenheimer. Bryan Blair : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning, Bryan. Bryan Blair : The momentum in your boiler sales is very encouraging. You called out strong trends in the education vertical. I was wondering, if there's any concern about the sustainability of project activity there. Counter our read on the incremental funding that's coming through. Just looking at the 12% growth in Q1 mid-30s lift Q2, the full year guide implies quite a bit of moderation in the back half? Kevin Wheeler : Well, I think, we had a very strong first half of the year. And again, as we mentioned the back half is a bit tougher comp, there's always challenges with COVID-19 and the variance out there, and of course, labor and so forth. But overall again, job activity has remained healthy. Recent non-residential ABI data was positive in June up I think 57% from 50%. And our July had \u2013 we had a solid July. We don't see really anything becoming an issue. But again, in this environment, there's all those things that could pop up and be a bit spotty for us. Chuck Lauber : Yeah. I mean, I guess the only other thing I would add is that, it was an easy comp in Q2 last year and we did do a residential early buy program that we pushed back because of the pandemic last year into Q3 that got pulled into Q2, which is normal. That's the normal cadence of when we do that. And that helped a little bit on the volume. Bryan Blair : Yeah. I appreciate the color there. And to clarify, does the outlook for 13%, 14% North American water treatment growth include Master Water contribution? Chuck Lauber : No, it's organic growth of 13% to 14%. We framed kind of the North America water treatment at around $200 million, I think before we were talking about approaching $200 million. So with the acquisition at the half year, it gets just over $200 million. Bryan Blair : Excellent. Anything you can offer on margin contribution from that business and even more importantly, additional color on what the asset adds to technology, footprint channel presence? You mentioned expanding into the Northeast, which is important. But any other color you can offer on strategic impact would be great. Kevin Wheeler : Yes, I'll take the strategic impact. This is part of our strategy to improve our footprint across North America and build up that distribution. The water quality dealer is a bit different than say our wholesale business that buys truckloads of 200 water heaters that are \u2013 on a regular basis. Water quality dealers will buy pallets for and get couple of palletable product. It's really important that we have these distribution points and this is a start with Master Water, so that we can improve our service levels, delivering 24 hours of smaller clients and do them in an effective and productive way. So this is an important first step in kind of building out that framework that we need to be successful in the water quality side of our business. Bryan Blair : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities. Scott Graham : Hey, good morning all. Nice quarter [ph]. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Scott Graham : So I have a couple of questions. Hopefully, you can answer them all. I know of each of the price increases. Would you say that you're trending toward the middle, higher end of the ranges that you've given in the past? Chuck Lauber : I guess, Scott, we just kind of look at the four together. And when we accumulate the four and get to the fourth quarter, the fourth one will be effective. We'll start seeing that in the fourth quarter. We're at about a 40% increase \u2013 price increase on the water heating side. Scott Graham : Okay. Thank you. And then are we looking at similar type of price increases for boilers? Kevin Wheeler : Not similar. Boilers are for the most part \u2013 a lot of our projects are quoted. And we are taking steps to adjust our quotes to adjust for the cost. So we have taken steps but it's not as formal as our residential that of commercial business. But we are taking steps and quite frankly we're taking steps across globally of all of our businesses to adjust for the inflationary cost that we've been impacted by and continue to be impacted by. Chuck Lauber : Yes. I mean let me just add a little color to the water heating side because that 40% is specific to water heating. And as you know steel is the major part of water heating cost for us. There's other costs including freight and filament and so forth but steel is the largest part. So when we kind of look at the cadence of the cost through the year into the fourth quarter, we're going to be \u2013 and we have good visibility into the fourth quarter because as you know we've got 90 to 100-day visibility forward on what we're going to be paying for steel. Our cost Q4, year-over-year is going to be 2.5 to three times higher on just steel alone. So I just want to kind of frame that. The other businesses outside of water heating certainly have seen some cost increases and we've got price increases at various points but certainly the water heater side bears the brunt of that steel increase. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eitan Buchbinder with Citi. Eitan Buchbinder : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Eitan Buchbinder : So Q1 had weather issues in Ashland and Ju\u00e1rez on top of supply chain constraints, which limited North America water heater production and supply chain constraints lingering into Q2. How much of production levels improved? And can you quantify the percent utilization within North America water heater production capacity during the quarter? Kevin Wheeler : No not specific. I would tell you that we had month-on-month improvement. And again we have terrific suppliers that are also working very hard to raise their capacity. And the important note is we believe that's going to carry on into Q3 and the Q4. So we certainly have plenty of demand. Our orders are mirroring the industry. It's just a matter of us being able to work those overtime hours and Saturdays. And we've been a bit constrained with some of the supply chain issues that we talked about. And of course, there's port issues there's trucking issues that we're working through. But the takeaway is that sequential improvement and that should carryover into the back half of the year. Eitan Buchbinder : Thank you. That's helpful. In 2020 the cadence of social insurance was heavy in Q2 and Q3, my understanding is that Q4 is normally the highest margin quarter for the Rest of World segment. And last year it was 11.2% margin with minimal impact from social insurance. What are the potential factors that could keep margin down year-over-year? Chuck Lauber : Yeah. This is Chuck. I mean, it's really mostly volume. We really had a strong Q4 last year. And that volume really matters, on the incremental base of the business. It really drops nicely to the bottom-line. So last year, we had a very strong fourth quarter. And we called it out on our call last year. And it could have been some pent-up demand from the pandemic, not exactly sure all the drivers, but that's probably the major difference. There was some social insurance last year. And I want to say that, it's small. Like you said it's probably $12 million for the year and the bulk of that fell into Q2 and Q3. And we'll see a similar headwind in Q3 that we saw in Q2. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Damian Karas with UBS. Damian Karas : Hi. Good morning everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Chuck Lauber : Good morning. Pat Ackerman : Hi. Damian Karas : So a pretty notable change in your view on the water heater shipments from down 2% now up 3% for the year. I was just wondering if you could elaborate on your earlier comments about the inventory destocking, you're not expecting that anymore and really just elaborate on what's changed since last quarter? Kevin Wheeler : Well, I'll start with that. And Chuck can jump in. We don't move our forecast very often as we see some clear line of sight. What's really changed is, one, we didn't plan on four price increases this year and that makes a big difference in, pre-buys and buy ahead. And quite frankly, the market's been -- continues to be stronger than we anticipated. And new home construction continues to do very well. So as we were putting this all together and coming to the second half of the year those are -- there's been multiple changes that have changed our opinion for this year to move it up that 3%. Chuck Lauber : Yeah. We don't expect inventories to come down, based on the order rates that we've seen. When we looked at the full year outlook for the industry, I mean last year it was basically a record year on residential water heaters. And to be 3% up over a record year is pretty meaningful. But when we kind of look at the first half of the year, and then look at the second half of the year historically, those volume percentages kind of break down 52% in the first half of the year 48% in the back half of the year. So last year it was exactly opposite. It was 48%, because of all the headwinds that the industry had in production in Q2 but it was 48% front half and 52% back half. And when we looked at the full year we went back to kind of the normal cadence too. So we looked at that and said let's go back to that 52-48, thinking about what kind of demand we're seeing. And again, with four price increases it's a little bit difficult to read out the total demand but being -- and decided to go up 3% with the assumption inventories would not decrease. Damian Karas : Okay, great. That makes sense. And then, I was curious, if you've seen any market share jostling going on just as a result of the current environment with the supply chain issues, and some of the capacity constraints you, and the other competitors of yours have had to deal with? Maybe you could just talk about kind of at -- through your channels and at the regional level if there's what's happening with market share? Kevin Wheeler : Well, you're right market share is a bit messy right now, because of different price increases in the supply chain. I would tell you right now A.O. Smith is lagging a bit not because we don't have the orders in-house and not because our customers -- we have a solid customer base with no change there. It's really been just more of various constraints on what we can produce out of our factories. And of course as we mentioned in the first quarter the Gulf freeze did not help. But when it's all said and done with no major changes in customers, and we'll get our fair share of orders that overtime this is probably all going to work itself out. But right now A.O. Smith is lagging a bit. And we anticipate that will be minimized by the time we get through the rest of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Matt Summerville : Thanks. A couple of questions. First on China, I was hoping you could comment on what sell-in versus sell-through looks like? And how you're feeling about your inventory position there? Chuck Lauber : Sure, sure. We feel very, very good about our inventory position there. We felt good about it a year ago and it significantly improved. It's at its lowest point in five years. And I would say that it's probably it's as fresh as it's been. So we're in a great inventory position in the channel in China. Let me help frame the sales growth for the quarter. So we're up 26% in organic local currency. But if you take a look at that, last year we did have some headwind on channel inventories coming down. When we look at sellout and demand for this quarter, we're probably up about mid-single digits. We're right in that range. And it's across our whole portfolio of products. So we're pleased with the 26% growth. You got to recall last year; China came out of the pandemic earlier than North America. It got gutted too and it came out of it a little sooner, but that was a quarter that was building from April May and June. So mid-single digits up for the quarter and we kind of -- when we think about the rest of the year we're looking at something roughly in that same range through the back half of the year. Matt Summerville : And then just sticking with China. Can you speak to -- I'm thinking about the pricing spectrum right and how things trended a few years ago, kind of, up in that high end then things trended more into the mid-price point range. Where are you relative to the historical peak? And maybe the recent trough there with respect to your product set and realization there? Chuck Lauber : Let me just frame it quarter-over-quarter comparison, because it's very similar to where we've been in the last couple of quarters. I would say what we've seen is a little bit of improvement in the higher end price on the gas tankless. And on electric heating and water treatment, it's roughly the same. So it hasn't changed a great deal. We see some indications of the higher-end premium part of the market growing, but we have not seen a great deal of change, pleased though that we've seen a little bit of movement on the gas tankless side. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies. Saree Boroditsky : Good morning. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Saree Boroditsky : You originally talked about some inventory coming out of the channel this year. Now with residential heaters expect to be up 3% you're no longer talking about that. So just how are you thinking about ending inventory for the industry? And then how does that set up for demand in 2022? Kevin Wheeler : You're talking North America? Saree Boroditsky : Yeah North America. Kevin Wheeler : North America residential? Well, again, we'll have to see how things play out. There's still five months left in the year. And so we've reached it as we've talked about. And we'll have to get a better view as the next few months depending on how we're producing, how people are consuming, how the economy is doing. It's hard to look into 2022 when we're in July right now. So we'll look at it closer. We'll talk more as we get closer to the end of the year. But right now as we said demand is up and there's a lot of good momentum in new construction. And so that plays well for the balance of the year. Saree Boroditsky : Got it. And so with higher North America volumes you, obviously, implemented a number of price increases, the margin expectations are a little bit lower. So how are you thinking about matching price cost in the second half of the year? And then how are you thinking about margin improvement in 2022 just as some of these costs hopefully become less of a headwind? Chuck Lauber : Yeah. I mean we -- since our first price increase was announced in November last year, we have just seen costs continue to rise. Every price increase that we have launched into the marketplace has been consistently followed by higher steel costs and higher costs. So as we go into the back half of this year and get to the fourth quarter where our fourth price increase starts coming into the market, and we start seeing it we're basically matching costs. So we're not covering our margin in the fourth quarter. That's a bit of the headwind that we see in the back half. It's too early for us to be kind of speculating I think on 2022 on what we're going to see on cost. Certainly, we've not seen these types of cost increases in the market. But it's hard to speculate how long they'll be there whether they'll come back out. Obviously, there's a lot of discussion on transitory inflation, but we're not yet ready to kind of predict when we're going to see any relief. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David MacGregor : In your prepared remarks you talked about water treatment and seeing more promotional days. And so I wonder if we could just circle back to that for a moment and just talk about the extent to which you're seeing maybe a little more in the way of expectations from some of your channel partners with respect to your level of promotional channel support? Kevin Wheeler : No. I would tell you our \u2013 the promotional channel days that we talked about were pretty much normal. And there wasn't an increase in it, but it's pretty effective. Water treatment -- our close rates have been high as people continue to look at water treatment as a health issue for their family. But I don't want to mislead. Those were normal days that just performed at a higher level for us. And I think it comes down to the whole megatrend that we're seeing with water quality and the safety part that continues and it continued into the second quarter. Chuck Lauber : I mean water treatment has performed well. I mean it's 17% increase quarter-over-quarter. But I just want to remind us that last year it grew by 19%. So as a part of our business last year that actually grew in 2020 in Q2 and grew again this year. So pretty resilient still performing well. David MacGregor : And how much just were on water treatment? How much of that growth would be attributed to expanded distribution as opposed to just greater pull? Kevin Wheeler : That's one I probably can't give you any specific. If you break down our business it has to do with we have direct-to-consumer with of course that's just an ongoing business. We have a marketplace. We've done a fairly nice job expanding our dealer network. I can't give you specifics, but that area and we called it out in our remarks has grown substantially and doing a really nice job. It has a nice backlog. But I can't give you specifics about really the number of new dealers, but going in the right direction and performing very, very well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Nathan Jones : Good morning, everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning, Nathan. Chuck Lauber : Good morning. Nathan Jones : I wanted to follow-up on the channel inventory to beat a dead horse here. You guys had expected a destock in the second half. You're now not expecting a destock in the second half. Can you talk about the inputs that go into that in terms of are you expecting higher demand, customers ordering ahead of price increases and because of supply chain challenges? And do you think the channel inventories end the year at an appropriate level or under or overstocked? Chuck Lauber : Yes. I think you framed the pieces for us a bit. I mean there is higher demand on the price increase for sure that always is there. We manage that working with our customers. The constraints we see on supply chain I think encourage people to make sure they have product on hand. This will be -- our projection on 3% up will be another record year back-to-back. Where we end up on the channel inventory I think is a little hard to say. And I think it will play out a bit on what happens in new construction and what we see as far as the supply chain getting a little more normal. Nathan Jones : Fair enough. And then just a follow-up on India. You've said it doubled year-over-year. Obviously, India has had its issues with COVID. Can you just give us a number relative to where it was in 2019? Chuck Lauber : In 2019, I mean it's \u2013 gosh, I don't have that in front of us right now. I'd say I'm pretty confident it's higher than 2019. But I do want to frame it a bit because typically 35% to 40% of our sales are in Q4. But we're really pleased with how the team has performed for the quarter in a really tough environment. Kevin Wheeler : Yes, I would just want to add on to it. I mean, India was savaged by COVID. And our team did what they needed to do to protect our employees, but more importantly really developed a strong relationship on the online segment of the business which helped drive some of the sales we're talking about. Even in the pandemic we introduced new products both in water treatment and in water heating that have done exceptionally well. So we're calling it out because quite frankly it's a phenomenal job by a team that really had severe headwinds throughout the second quarter and throughout the first part of the year. And we're looking for the back half to get a bit better. And again as Chuck said that's where we get about 50% of our sales over the last four months. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Susan Maklari : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning, Susan. Susan Maklari : My first question is around the boiler business. You guided -- or you held your guide of a low double-digit increase this year. And yet you said you saw the sales up about 35% in the quarter. Can you just talk to how you're thinking about the back half of this year some of the orders that are coming through and how we should be thinking about that deceleration on a relative basis that you're expecting in there? Kevin Wheeler : Again, as we've talked about the back half is a more difficult comp. And as we look forward, we talked about bringing forward the early buy which was a record early buy for us from the third quarter. So there's a few items that are a headwind as we get into the second half of the year. So that's the primary reason behind it. Order bookings are good. Still seems to be pretty healthy with regards to our quoting activity. But when we put the numbers together and Chuck will maybe elaborate on them a bit more that's how we feel it's going to play out in the second half of the year. Chuck Lauber : Yes. The only thing I would add is I'm trying to think about kind of the benchmark for 2019. And I believe when you kind of look at 2019 we're up high single digits compared to 2019 which is confirming that number just to help kind of frame where we are because 2020 had quite a bit of disruption in Q2. There's a lot of jobs that were closed and a lot of production that was disrupted. So I'm trying to help with the 2019 framing and that's roughly -- it's up about 6% in 2019. Susan Maklari : Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And I guess building on that too can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the commercial water heater side? That had obviously been a bit weaker compared to boilers. Any updates on how that's trending? Obviously the comps are a bit easier in the back half how should we be thinking about it? Kevin Wheeler : Well commercial water heater it's nice when you reopen the economy. And we're seeing -- I think we've talked about this in the past. We do have some IoT on our water heaters and we can see how it's being used and so forth. It's not a broad view but it's a snapshot. And we're just seeing activity grow. We're seeing restaurants open up. We're seeing people invest back in their business. So overall it's nice to see the economy or the commercial side of the business starting to reopen and get back to -- we're not there yet but back to kind of a normal replacement cycle and maintenance cycle. So that's where we raised our guidance up by a couple of points. And it's based on those early trends continuing into the back half of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities. Scott Graham : Yes, hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my call up here. Follow-up here had gotten cut off in the middle of my next question for you. But I maybe just wanted to go back to the pricing guys. And I have tracked with August four price increases this year. I don't quite recall the amount of the one from last year in November. Can you remind me of that one? Chuck Lauber : I think it was approaching 10%. When you get all three together we've been kind of accumulating them as we go along. Pat will take a quick look here. But the first one was roughly that amount I believe. Kevin Wheeler : Yes, Scott I'd tell you that's a long time ago. Well if you look back at it because we've been chasing these costs for a while. Scott Graham : Okay. And so the other question I had was Kevin around your comments with the supply chain. And I know that water heater volumes were up. But I'm assuming they were up sort of double digit. And the reason, I'm asking that is that the first two months of the quarter trade data is sort of up and over 20%. Now that's only the first two months, but it would just seem like that should be a -- did you keep pace with the industry in the second quarter I guess would be the simplest question? Kevin Wheeler : No. As I mentioned we lagged a bit in the industry. And you look at the industry it's up through May 11% 12% total. Again quite a bit of that has been driven by price increases and those type of activities along with the new construction and so forth. So we have been lagging. And again, it's our order entry is right in line with the industry. However some of the constraints that we talked about has caused a few issues for us. But again I look at this we have great operating people. And in the back half of the year we'll have to work through that. But I wanted to make sure you understand where we were and where we're going. And we don't see fundamentally anything changing with regards to our customers our market share as we finally get through this \u2013 these difficult times and finish up 2021. Chuck Lauber : And Scott just to follow up that first price increase was up to 9%. So pretty close to that 10 that I mentioned but up to nine is what we went out with. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Kevin Hocevar with Northcoast. Kevin Hocevar : Hey, good morning everybody. Wondering if \u2013 to that point on the supply chain issues expectation of 3% volume growth for the year, do you think with all the actions you're taking it sounds like things are getting better. Do you think you'll be able to grow in line with the industry and maybe make up for that in the back half of the year, or does that perhaps defer some shipments for you guys to 2022? Kevin Wheeler : Yes. I would tell you our expectation is to certainly keep up with the industry and to close that gap by year-end. Again the orders are there. It's just a matter \u2013 and our customers are. Just a matter of \u2013 working like I said go back to working those nine hours, working that occasional Saturdays to close that gap. And that's going to be all predicated on our supply chain, which again -- and I've talked to many of our key suppliers. They're all getting better at it. They're all coming online a bit more. And we're anticipating that's going to carry over to the back half of the year and we'll be able to ramp up production at a much higher rate than we had in the first half. Kevin Hocevar : Okay. Great. And then on the water heater side so if you -- if I back into the numbers it seems like water heater sales probably grew 25% 26% in that -- in the second quarter. So wondering if you can just -- is that -- I don't think you historically give price volume or anything but is that mostly price or fairly split between price volume? And I think you guys made a comment that 40% pricing will be kind of once everything is going to affect in the fourth quarter that will be what pricing is. So, does that mean we should be thinking water heater sales up 40% in the fourth quarter plus or minus whatever our volume expectation is? Chuck Lauber : Yes. Well let me just go back to kind of the price volume portion of Q2. And we typically don't but I think it's very helpful in the environment that again that we give a little more data. So in Q2 when we kind of look at the amount that we were up in North America, I'll frame this North America. 40% of that roughly was price and the rest was basically volume. So the bulk of it was volume but there was a percentage of about 40% of that increase that was price. On the fourth quarter -- could you frame that again on the fourth quarter question please? Kevin Hocevar : I think you mentioned that -- just for modeling purposes as we -- I think you had mentioned that when all four price increases are in effect it would be 40% cumulative. So does that mean that that water heater portion of North America sales should be up 40% in the fourth quarter once all those are implemented plus or minus whatever we think volume and mix does. Chuck Lauber : Yes that's roughly right. I mean the fourth price increase comes into the fourth quarter and it's early on in the fourth quarter but that's a good way to look at it. Kevin Wheeler : Yes I would say that plus or minus though there's going to be some drag probably with that pricing in the fourth quarter. Kevin Hocevar : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Ms. Patricia Ackerman. Pat Ackerman : Thank you for joining us today. We plan to participate in two virtual conferences in the third quarter, Jefferies on August 3 next week and D.A. Davidson on September 22. Have a great day.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Patricia Ackerman. Thank you, and please go ahead. Patricia Ackerman : Thank you, Angeline. Good morning, and welcome to the A. O. Smith third quarter conference call. I'm Pat Ackerman, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability and Treasurer. Joining me today are Kevin Wheeler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer. A friendly reminder that some of our comments and answers during this conference call will be forward-looking statements that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include matters that we have described in this morning's press release, among others. [Operator Instructions] We will be using slides as we move through today's call. You can access them on our website at investor.aosmith.com. I will now turn the call over to Kevin to begin our prepared remarks. Please turn to the next slide. Kevin Wheeler : Thank you, Pat, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'd like to start today's call with a quick snapshot of A. O. Smith. I'm on Slide 4. We're a global leader in applying innovation and energy-efficient solutions to water heating and treating products that we manufacture and market worldwide with annual sales of approximately $3 billion. In market-leading brands, our products including water heaters, boilers and water treatment systems manufactured in 22 facilities across the globe. North America is our largest and most profitable market, followed by China, which accounts for 25% of sales. Turning to Slide 5 and our quarterly results. We are pleased with our performance in the third quarter. Our team delivered a record-setting quarter in a turbulent macro environment. Demand for water heaters in North America remains very strong. Our Rest of World segment performed well in the quarter led by China, delivering operating margins of approximately 10%. Costs continue to increase sequentially, and in response, we have taken appropriate pricing actions. We continue to successfully navigate the supply chain and transportation issues facing most companies and have improved our delivery performance since the first quarter. We acquired Giant the water heater manufacturer in Canada, growing our market share in North America and welcoming a talented group of employees to the A.O. Smith family. And finally, based on our strong performance and continued demand, we're raising our full year outlook for sales and earnings. Please turn to Slide 6. Our global A.O. Smith team delivered record third quarter EPS of $0.82, a 26% increase that was driven in part by a record 20% increase in sales compared with the third quarter of 2020. Demand for our products is robust, particularly in North America, resulting in record quarterly sales and operating earnings. We achieved this strong performance as a result of continued solid execution, despite the challenging environment of component shortages, logistical bottlenecks and materials and transportation cost inflation. I want to take this opportunity to thank my fellow A.O. Smith employees for their dedication and ingenuity as we work to overcome these challenges to meet strong market demand and deliver for our customers. North America water heater sales grew 24%, benefiting from both pricing actions and strong demand. Commercial unit industry demand increased by more than 10% due to resumption of new construction and replacement in the hospitality end market. Residential water heater unit demand also increased in the quarter. In addition, sequential improvements to our product delivery performance enabled us to improve our share position, which was temporarily lag in our expectations earlier this year. Our North America boiler sales grew 7%, driven by new construction and replacement demand as well as new products. We ended September with a record backlog, largely composed of commercial condensing boilers and October continues to generate strong order rates for these market-leading energy-efficient boilers. We believe green building incentives and favorable return on investment outcomes contributed to strong demand for our condensing boilers. As natural gas prices increase, the return on investment for highly efficient products becomes more compelling, and we are well positioned to capture share. North America water treatment sales grew 8% in the third quarter. Our water quality dealers performed particularly well. We believe our dealers have been outperforming the market and gaining market share. In China, sales increased 12% in local currency. Each of our major product categories grew year-over-year, including electric and gas tankless water heaters and residential and commercial water treatment products, along with replacement filters. We estimate that replacement demand for our water heaters in China is about 50% of our units sold. Our newer categories, including A.O. Smith branded commercial water treatment as well as Range Hoods and Cook Tops continue to gain traction. As a result, we project that combined sales of these products will top $50 million this year. Please turn to Slide 7 and an overview of our recent acquisition. We are very pleased to welcome the team from Giant Factories to A. O. Smith. Giant is a Canada-based manufacturer of residential and commercial water heaters with a strong position in residential electric water heaters, a trailing 12-month sales of approximately USD 105 million. Giant fits squarely in our core North America water heater business and is consistent with our strategy to grow through acquisition and further penetrate existing markets. The transaction met several of our acquisition criteria, including expanding our presence and growing our core water heater business in the stable Canada market, leveraging our existing presence in Canada; adding to our sustainability efforts, given most of Giant water heaters are fueled by renewable energy sources; and the expectation that it will be accretive to EPS in 2022 with an ROIC in excess of our cost of the capital in 2023, ahead of our 3-year goal for acquisitions. We are excited to welcome our colleagues from Giant to the A. O. Smith team and look forward to continued excellent customer experience that they have come -- become known for. I'm now on Slide 8. Before I conclude, I'd like to highlight some of our ongoing ESG and sustainability efforts. In China, we have reduced energy use in both our non-production activities and our production facilities. As outlined in our 2020 Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Report, we were honored to be awarded the rating of \"Model Enterprise\" in 2020 by the Nanjing Economic and Technological Development Zone as an environmental protection pace setter. This distinction recognizes the depth of our environmental focus and operational processes to measure and reduce our environmental impact since 2016. As an industry leader, committed to innovation and investment in more environmentally sustainable and efficient technologies to heat and treat water, we published a white paper and analytical tool in September to help Federal, State and Local policymakers navigate the complexities of building decarbonization policies currently being designed and implemented around the country as part of a broader economy-wide effort to meet U.S. greenhouse gas reduction goals. An executive summary of the white paper is available in the Sustainability section of our website. I will now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on our third quarter. Charles Lauber : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 9. We delivered record third quarter sales of $915 million, up 20% year-over-year, driven by continued strong demand and inflation-related pricing actions. These higher volumes led to third quarter net earnings of $132 million or $0.82 per share, which is a 25% increase compared with net earnings of $105 million or $0.65 per share in 2020. Please turn to Slide 10. Sales in the North America segment rose to $658 million, a 21% increase compared to the third quarter of 2020. Pricing actions largely on water heaters represented approximately 80% of the increase. Higher volumes in water heaters and boilers were driven by strong replacement and new construction demand. The higher volumes of water treatment products added to segment growth also. North America segment earnings of $152 million increased 14% compared with the third quarter of 2020. The earnings benefit of inflation-related price increases and higher volumes was offset somewhat by higher material and freight costs. Pricing actions led rapidly rising steel costs, which resulted in a lower segment operating margin of 23.1% compared with the third quarter of 2020 segment market. Moving to Slide 11. Rest of the World segment sales of $263 million increased 19% year-over-year, approximately 60% of which was due to volume increases. Currency translation of China sales favorably impacted sales by approximately $14 million. Growth in each of our product categories in China contributed to local currency growth of 12% in the quarter, impacted largely by channel inventory changes, which remained at levels similar to the beginning of the year. Our products with higher selling prices, particularly our super-quiet gas tankless water heaters and water treatment products that deliver hot and ambient filtered water, contributed to sales gains. India sales grew 38% in the quarter as the economy begin to regain its footing after the COVID-19 delta variant wave subsided in that region. Rest of the World earnings of $27 million increased 60% from the third quarter of 2020. In China, higher volumes were partially offset by employee incentive costs and higher advertising as well as an absence of social insurance waivers, which were received in 2020. Segment operating margin improved to 10% compared with the third quarter of 2020, primarily as a result of improved operating leverage from higher volumes. Please turn to Slide 12. We generated strong free cash flow of $332 million during the first 9 months, 13% higher than during the same period in 2020, partially impacted by a larger investment in working capital to support demand levels. Free cash flow conversion was 95%, slightly below our historical performance of a 100%. Our cash balance totaled $685 million at the end of September, and our net cash position was $579 million. Our leverage ratio was 5.3% as measured by total debt to total capital at the end of September. Our free cash flow and solid balance sheet enables us to focus on capital allocation priorities and return cash to shareholders. Earlier this month, our Board approved an 8% increase in our quarterly dividend, which is now $0.28 per share. This marks the 30th consecutive year of dividend increases and is consistent with our capital deployment strategy to return value to shareholders through sustained and increasing dividend. Year-to-date through September 30, we repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares of common stock for a total of $212 million and have the ability to repurchase 5.4 million shares more on our current authorization. We took a pause in our measured stock repurchase pace in the third quarter as we enter the blackout period due to the acquisition of Giant. We plan to resume our repurchase program in early November, targeting $400 million for a total share repurchase in 2021. Let's now turn to Slide 13. In addition to returning capital to shareholders, we continue to target strategic acquisitions with a focus on water heating and water treating assets that we believe can return our cost of capital in 3 years. Giant is a great example. The purchase price of USD 192 million represents a multiple of approximately 9.5x projected 2023 adjusted EBITDA, and the acquisition returns our cost of capital in the second full year, this is inclusive of the present value of an expected tax benefit of approximately $6.5 million that will be realized by treating the transaction as a purchase of assets for tax purposes and projected operating synergies of approximately $5 million achieved over a 2-year period. We expect no impact to fourth quarter EPS due to customary purchase accounting adjustments and one-time transaction expenses. Purchase accounting headwinds are expected to run into the first quarter of 2022, as a result of Giant's conservative practice of carrying high levels of inventory, which are valued as of the acquisition date by marking the value to market. Giant's practice of carrying safety stock has served them well, especially during the current challenges within the supply chain and rapidly rising costs. We continue to finalize our purchase accounting and currently project the acquisition will add between $0.06 to $0.08 per share in 2022. Please turn to Slide 14, at our updated full year 2021 outlook. We are now projecting full year sales to increase between 20% and 21% year-over-year. Based on this updated forecast and improved profitability, we are increasing our EPS range to between $2.86 and $2.90 per share. The mid-point of that range represents an increase of 5% compared with our previous guidance. We expect cash flow from operations for the year to be between $550 million and $575 million compared with $560 million in 2020. For the year, CapEx should be between $70 million and $75 million, and we expect to generate strong free cash flow of approximately $490 million with an over 100% conversion rate. We continue to experience inflation across our supply chain, particularly steel and logistics. Steel indices have increased 100% since the beginning of the year. We announced a fifth price increase on water heaters to be effective November 15 at a rate of up to 8.5%. These 2021 price increases are projected to have a cumulative effect on water heating prices of approximately 50% when fully effective in late December of this year. Based on that, we are raising the lower end of our North America segment margin guidance to between 22.75% and 23% and an improvement from our previous outlook. And Rest of the World segment margins to be approximately 8%, which is unchanged. Our updated outlook is based on key assumptions, including I've announced inflation-related price increases compounding to approximately 50% for water heaters as we exit 2021. Mid- to high single-digit inflation-related price increases in the remainder of our global portfolio. Strong demand in backlog in North America for all of our water heating product categories, driven by growth and replacement demand and new construction spending, along with the price increase announcements in our water heater and boiler end markets. No material changes -- and no material changes in the current macro environment. As for other housekeeping assumptions, corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $50 million, similar to 2020. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately 22%. Important to note, our effective tax rate of 20.9% in the third quarter was lower than the prior year as it was favorably impacted by approximately $4 million or $0.03 per share, relating to amending previously filed tax return along with the change in our geographic earnings mix. Finally, we expect to end the year at outstanding diluted shares of 161 million. I will now turn the call back to Kevin, who will provide more color on our top line growth outlook for 2021, which is on Slide 15. Kevin? Kevin Wheeler : Our revenue outlook for 2021 includes the following assumptions : we increased our U.S. residential tank water heater industry volume forecast and project unit volumes to grow 6% from last year; we expect continued strength in replacement demand, partially driven by an increase in proactive replacement along with growth in new home construction; we see improvement in the growth trend and increased our commercial industry water heater volume projections to approximately 10% growth this year as pandemic-impacted businesses has continued to reopen and new construction and replacement installations come back online. China performance has shown consistency in the past 4 quarters. We are on track with our strategy to continue to expand distribution to smaller Tier 4, 5 and 6 cities in China. Consumer trends show increased demand for higher-priced products across all our categories, driven by differentiated new products that we have launched in the last 12 to 24 months. We expect year-over-year increase in local currency sale between 20% and 22% in China. We assume China currency rates will remain at current levels, adding approximately $54 million and $4 million to sales and profits over the prior year, respectively. After currency impact, the majority of the projected sales growth is driven by a reduction in channel inventory levels in 2020. Power shortages in China have been sporadic. To date, we have had minimal disruptions to our operations, our managing through shortages by reducing energy use and nonproduction-related activities and supplementing power with generators on an as-need basis. Boilers sales grew 17% this year through September 2021. We are encouraged by the stability of our record backlog and expect 13% growth in boilers for the full year. We project 12% growth in full year sales for our North America water treatment products. This is slightly lower than our July outlook of 13.5% due to deceleration of growth in online and retail sales. However, we believe sales growth for our point to use and point of entry water treatment systems will continue to be driven by consumer demand for safe drinking water and reduce single-use plastic bottles. We estimate 2021 market growth of around 7%. Please turn to Slide 16. Thanks to the tremendous effort by our procurement and operation teams, our supply chain is stabilizing. Our manufacturing lead times remained consistent since mid-year. Through our focus and determination, we believe we will close out the year on a high note and continue strong into 2022. We remain confident in our ability to capitalize on opportunities as we continue to execute our strategy. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville of D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open. Matt Summerville : Thanks. A couple of questions. Just given everything going on with the multitude or multiple, I should say, price increases that have been put in place this year and the one upcoming. What's your impression as to the picture around channel inventories here in the U.S. in the water heater business in light of that? And similarly, it looked like China inventory levels may be on the rise again. So maybe just a little bit of context on that as well. Kevin Wheeler : Okay. The first question with regards to our channel inventory, say, in North America. Our [indiscernible] says that they're a bit low and that our customers are lower than where they want to be based on the demand that we're seeing in the market. As regard to China, I'll have Chuck comment on that. Charles Lauber : Hey, good morning, Matt. So the China inventory levels are really in a good spot. Their commentary around inventory levels are really a reflection of what happened in 2020. And what happened in 2020 is, we really got ourselves in the channel and our customers in a much better positioned for inventories. So they're reduced to a low level at the end of last year. They remain at a very good level throughout this year so we're pleased kind of where we're at with channel inventories. All our commentary was really looking at some of the growth over the last year was, we took care of those issues last year or at least the channel cleaned itself up last year. Matt Summerville : Got it. And then just as my follow-up, with respect to China and the 20% to 22% constant currency growth you're looking for there, can you delineate where you see water heaters versus water treatment around that number? And then how we should be thinking about the long-term trajectory going forward in China as we remove some of the lumpiness we've had in the last couple of years? Thank you. Charles Lauber :  Yes. I mean we've seen some headwinds on consumer demand on the water heating side. We're very pleased with how the water treatment side has grown. For the quarter, water treatment was up approximately 20%. When we look at water treatment, we're including our commercial business, which Kevin mentioned earlier. We're including our consumables in our residential business. And our outlook for the year for water treatment in China is around $300 million -- just over $300 million. So that's a 20% roughly growth over last year. So we're really pleased with how water treatment is doing in China. Kevin mentioned the Range Hood of commercial water heating, which is a component of water treatment. There's a bit of headwind on the water heating side. We saw it in the market demand. We think we're doing a little bit better than the market in consumer demand. We've got some new products in the marketplace. I mentioned the gas tankless super-quiet, and we're expecting for the full year to be up in that 12% in organic growth. Kevin Wheeler : And just a little bit more color on that. We'll continue to introduce our [indiscernible] products in the wall-hung electric side of the business with added features for the consumer. And Chuck just mentioned is super-quiet, but we also just introduced a super-quiet with a water softening -- integrated water softener, which is a very high-end product that not only provides the hot water, but also the soft water to premium consumers. So we're pleased with where we're at in the market. Chuck mentioned, we're outperforming it, but we're more pleased that we're -- in the innovation side, where we're introducing new and innovative products that the Chinese consumers are willing to pay a premium for. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Hammond : Hey, good morning. Kevin Wheeler : Hey, Jeff, good morning. Jeffrey Hammond : So just on -- the price increases have been coming kind of fast and furious. Just trying to get a sense of how much you think price is going to be within your 4Q implied guide? And then just based on the announcements, what you think that the carryover pricing is going to be in '22? Kevin Wheeler : Yes. So the way we look at it is our last price increase effective November 15 is probably not really going to impact the fourth quarter. Probably, would be coming in effect end of December as we roll into 2021 (sic) [ 2022 ]. So of that cumulative of 50%, you kind of got to back off that last price increase. As we roll it into next year, we're going to kind of reserve kind of what is going to carry over until we get a little closer to next year, a little bit of ground to cover in the fourth quarter. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay. And then just on, I guess, historically, you kind of keep price in wholesale and material price formulas in the DIY side. But just given the magnitude of the increases here should commodities ultimately roll over steel 30%, 40%, how do you think the same or differently about giving back price? Thanks. Kevin Wheeler : Yes. I would tell you, we haven't seen the costs roll over the other way yet. So as we enter -- our goal is always to remain competitive in the market and with our customers. That's our commitment along with our value of our products and sales organization and technology. So as if or when cost start to moderate or move in a less upward direction, we'll have to evaluate it at that time. But again, I go back to -- A. O. Smith will remain competitive in all its channels and provide the value that we have over the past several decades. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran of Baird. Your line is now open. Michael Halloran : Thank you, good morning, everyone. So first, let's start on North America here. I've see, the demand trends have been really good on the water heating side of the business. Maybe could you help with 2 things. One, kind of parse out how you think the trajectory plays out here? Obviously, the growth has been above normal trend line for a little bit now. How do you feel about the dynamics moving forward just from a volume perspective on the residential side? And on the commercial side, how are you feeling about the recovery cadence as we sit here? Kevin Wheeler : Well, our residential business, as we get into the fourth quarter, the market has been up about 8%. We forecasted about 6%. So it was a very strong fourth quarter of last year. If you look at our commercial business, it continues to exceed our expectations. Again, as the economy continues to open up, which is providing more and more opportunity, there's been some pent-up demand over the last year. And now as this opportunity opens up, again, we're well positioned. We're a leader in the commercial category. So we look at commercial being in a good position in Q4. Residential may be tailing off a little bit. And then as we enter 2022, we'll have to reserve that judgment until we get a few more months underneath our belt and some more visibility into the market. Michael Halloran : Sounds good. And then a follow-up on China. Could you just remind us what your expectations are for a percent of profitability for China cumulatively? But maybe more importantly, give some context on how you think the demand cadence plays out here? Obviously, good 3Q performance from a volume side, guidance implies some slower trends in the fourth quarter, but I think you feel pretty good about where your share is in the fourth quarter and the inventory levels. So maybe you could just help with those factors as we move into the fourth quarter here. Kevin Wheeler : Yes, sure, Mike. So in China, we're kind of looking at the fourth quarter sequentially to be up from the third quarter. Fourth quarter is typically our strongest quarter. So we do expect it to tick up a bit, but not as strong as last year. Last year, we kind of view as there was some pent-up demand, some really strong online sales and a rather strong quarter for year-over-year comps. So probably less than last year. So we're kind of seeing it as somewhere in between. So we expect it to tick up from Q3, not quite as strong as last year. We're pleased with our share. I think we've said in the past, it's difficult to measure, but we're very pleased with our specialty stores and our distributors' performance in the marketplace, which is really hard to capture on an industry-wide basis. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Q - Damian Karas of UBS. Your line is now open. Damian Karas : Hi, good morning, everyone. My first question is on your guidance and in particular, just looking at margins. It seems to suggest a notable step down in the fourth quarter. Would you maybe be able to talk about the moving pieces there for the 2 segment margins? I mean from a price cost standpoint, it looks like you actually had price to offset the cost inflation in the third quarter and things came in a little bit better than, I think, most had anticipated. So could you just talk about the margin cadence here in the fourth quarter going forward? A - Kevin Wheeler Sure. Sure. So I mentioned a little earlier, our price increase effective November 15 really won't help us in the fourth quarter. We would expect that to start coming into the financials at the end of the year, beginning of next year. But what we're seeing is, the impact of the significantly higher steel costs that's been ramping up through the year. So when we look at our steel costs for Q4, sequentially, it will be up from Q3, will also be -- steel costs are about 2.5 to 3x more than what we were paying last year at that point in time in the fourth quarter. So it's a pretty significant ramp. So what we're seeing on the margin, I guess, headwind in Q4 in North America is just those costs hitting us faster than some of the price increases become effective. Damian Karas : Got it. And my second question is on the China business. Could you maybe comment on what your current strategy is there with respect to store build-outs and your marketing spend? I'd be curious to hear how you're thinking about all that with everything going on in the property development space. Kevin Wheeler : Well, let me just talk about China from a strategic standpoint. I mean that's a 20-plus year investment for us, and we're building a strong brand, strong distribution, a terrific record for innovation. That strategy remains intact, and we'll continue to execute on that. As we mentioned in the past, we're continuing to invest in lower-tier cities. On the store fronts, we're continuing to monitor the productivity of our Tier 1, Tier 2 stores. We think we're there. We've adjusted maybe 100 to 150 and exited this last year. And then we're really building out our Tier 4 through 6 Tier cities. This year, we're up about 3,000 stores and want to qualify that a bit. It's not the same type of store as you would see in Tier 1, Tier 2, but they're mainly counters. But having 3,000 counters in a area that has grown and expanding is proving to be a very beneficial for our top line and long-term success in China. So it's overall, the commitment in China hasn't changed. Our investment in our brand continues, and we will continue to focus on innovation, our investment in R&D, again, continues to move forward. So again, some minor adjustments, moving into some other tier cities, making some adjustments in our current portfolio of stores. All on track. All we've been doing for the last 12 to 18 months. So strategically, we're still heading down the same path we have. I do want to come back to property development. And just to remind everybody, we really have no direct exposure in that particular segment. We could hit some, I would say, short-term headwinds as they work through some restructuring there, but also approximately 18 million new homes are required in China every year. That's quite an opportunity for us still regardless of what's happening in the property development market. So still a lot of opportunity in China regardless of some of the restructuring they'll have to do in their property sector. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones of Stifel. Your line is now open. Nathan Jones : Good morning, everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning, Nathan. Nathan Jones : I appreciate the revenue and operating income walks out of this quarter. You guys have talked about in total once we get to the November price increase -- having increased prices on water heater by 50%. Third quarter there has 17-point price for the entire North American segment. Can you maybe give us some more color on what the average price increase across the entire portfolio for North America is versus just the heater price increases? Kevin Wheeler : No. We're -- it's a tough number to kind of parse out. I'll just kind of -- we usually talk about the announced price increases, which on the residential and commercial water heating space. Most of our other categories of businesses outside of the water heating space or in the single to mid -- to mid upper single-digit range. So they're much smaller than the water heating side. Nathan Jones : That makes sense. I think earlier in the year due to some of the productivity challenges, the taxes rates [indiscernible] and things like that happened. You were behind on customer deliveries. Have you caught up to those now? Or are still in the process of catching up? Kevin Wheeler : I would tell you that -- good memory, by the way, because Q1 was a very difficult time for us with some of the weather conditions and freezes that impacted our production. And we talked about that in Q2 that we were lagging. And so -- but that we felt as we entered into the back half of 2021, we will recover. What I'll tell you, as we entered into Q3 and exited our market share -- residential share was right on track with what we normally are in Q3 of last year. We look for that to carry over into Q4 and improving into the 2022 year. So yes, we've caught up to our share position in Q3. We still have backlogs and so forth we have to work through. We still have supply chain challenges that we'll navigate on a daily basis, but overall, I like where we're at as we exited Q3 with regards to production in our backlog. And we look for further improvement as we get into the back half of Q4. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors of Boenning Scattergood. Your line is now open. Ryan Connors : Great, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to talk about another side of the inflation story, which is labor costs. Obviously, there's been lots of news flow around unions and strikes, and you're not a union shop, per se, but your people read the papers and their living costs are going up, too. So can you just talk about that dynamic and that news flow? And how that's impacting your labor costs, your discussions and your internally around employee comp as it relates to the inflation situation? And what kind of impact that could or could not have as we get into '22 on margins? Kevin Wheeler : Right. Let me start by sort of -- let's just talk with labor shortages out there. And all businesses are experiencing that, and we're no exception to it, but I'll tell you, it doesn't compare to the supply chain. So we're still working through that. One thing that we always find out during crisis times that a company-wise we have a great culture in our company. We have long-term employees, and they make a difference during these difficult times. So our people are stepping up doing the right things. There is some spotty, I would say, labor inflation out there, but we're addressing it on a case-by-case basis. We've taken some steps on programs to have signing boards and so forth to get factory workers in select factories, but it's not across the board. And quite frankly, it's primarily in the U.S. So right now, I think we're in pretty good shape. We'll be evaluating it on an ongoing basis. And again, we're in great position from our factory production standpoint to enter Q4 and continue to improve our delivery for our customers. And we'll deal with the inflationary pressures as we see them like we had in prior years. Ryan Connors : Okay. And then my follow-up to that would be applying the same question to your channel partners. I mean is there any cases where some of your distributors and wholesalers and so forth, are having their own kind of labor issues and that's causing a roll-up effect for you? Or do your partners have it under control pretty well? Kevin Wheeler : I would tell you, we're not -- don't have definitive information on that. I would tell you from the feedback we're getting, everybody in the U.S. has some type of labor challenges. It's not impacting us as we ship them and their products and to their distribution centers. And of course, out there, as you've seen lead times on various labor and installations have gone out, but nothing that would be specific to our industry or our customers. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Susan Maklari : Thank you, good morning. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Susan Maklari : My first question is around mix shift. As you think about the 50% cumulative price increase on tank and that kind of narrows that range between tank and say, tankless or some other alternatives. Are you seeing that volumes are increasingly shifting that way? Or anything around the demand shifts as we think about pricing relative to the value? Kevin Wheeler : I would tell you, we -- as you know, we compete in all segments. So we're -- we supply hot water. And so as -- if you look at our tank product has moved up, and -- but we haven't seen really any shift. If you look across our product categories, whether they are gas, electric tank or tankless or even in our commercial side of the business and heat pumps, not a big mix shift right now at all. I think people are -- they look at water heaters as a pretty good value. It's a product that -- a residential product that lasts 15 years. That's used every day, multiple times a day. So as of right now, we've seen no real mix shift towards anything. No mix shift that would be related to any of the pricing that we've implemented throughout the last year or so. Susan Maklari : Okay. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, as you think about '22, are there -- is there anything in terms of the competition? Or how you think about some of the dynamics around price and perhaps, the inventories are normalizing there that could have some impacts as we think about new entrance perhaps or competition? Kevin Wheeler : Yes. I mean we're not quite ready to talk about '22. We're going to defer that until we get to our January call. I would say, from a competition perspective, we don't necessarily see any significant shifts. And the demand part is really hard to read out with the price increases, and it's just a little difficult for us to take a look at a view into 2022 yet. Charles Lauber : Yes. I would just maybe comment. We look at our competition on a pretty regular basis, and we gather market intelligent. But our primary focus is on our customer and taking care of our customers, growing their business, using our leading product lines of residential and commercial water heaters, our relationships with the engineering spec community. So while we pay attention to competition, we really focus on ourselves to make sure we're providing the value add to grow our customers profitable. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Your line is now open. David MacGregor : Hey, good morning, everyone. Congratulations on a great quarter. Strong results. Kevin Wheeler : Thank you. David MacGregor : You talked about the -- just how strong commercial is right now. So I wonder if maybe my first question, we could drill-in a little further on that. And just if there's any way to just talk about -- you mentioned the 50% cumulative pricing benefit in residential. What would be the comparable figure for the commercial business and pricing there? And I guess if there's any way to maybe elaborate a little on supply channel constraints, and how they might be different in terms of how the impact on the business versus what you're seeing in the residential product? But just talk a little bit about that commercial business would be helpful. Thanks. Kevin Wheeler : Yes. I mean the announced price increases that we mentioned on water heating product, the residential and commercial, I would -- they're roughly similar on that announced cumulative price increase. Not the same in the boiler mix, but on the water heating piece that we publicly announced it's in that range. Could you remind me on the second part of the question? David MacGregor : Well, just if there's any way to just help pricing at the boiler level would work that would be helpful as well. But I was really just trying to get you to talk a little more about the supply channel constraints that you might be facing there, and how that might be different from what you're seeing in the residential business? Kevin Wheeler : Yes. If we go back to maybe the supply chain, we're having similar challenges as any other company, and that's constantly changing. But what I'll tell you is what we're doing, and I think that's more important. We're certainly working closely with our suppliers. We're upping our safety stocks when we can, ready new suppliers, certifying alternatives, prepayment to ensure that we have a supply chain. So we're doing all the things we can with regards to making sure we have a consistent supply chain. So to answer to question directly, our view today, we don't see any major disruptions whether it's on a residential front or on our commercial part of the business or on our boilers. It will continue to move forward as we've had, and we'll continue to work with our suppliers to ensure that we can deliver our customers in any timely fashion. David MacGregor : Yes, I mean that's truly exceptional. Good for you. My second question was really on the water treatment business. I know in the past, you've targeted 100 basis points a year margin progression. So obviously, this is a very extraordinary year, but what are your expectations for 2021? And any early thoughts on 2022 in terms of water treatment profitability? That would be appreciated. Kevin Wheeler : Yes. So I mean, on 2021 -- and you're right, we've got same cost headwinds in that part of the business as we have everywhere else. We have taken some pricing actions, but to your point, the margin expansion of 100 basis points, we're going to be struggling to do that this year. We're right around 10%, though. So we're pleased with that performance on operating margin for this year. So we're continuing to set ourselves up in a good position for next year. We're working on all the same growth programs that we have in the past. We're looking for growth through all the channels, continue to look at cost reductions. And as we gain more base in that business, we're looking to leverage off of that base and continue to grow that expansion. So we haven't changed our outlook on year-over-year expansion of that, get a little bit of a headwind as we exit 2021, hopefully, in a better position for '22. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Sara (sic) [ Saree ] Boroditsky of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Saree Boroditsky : Thanks for feeding me. So you talked about not having direct exposure to the property developed market in China, which I understand, but I think this would impact kind of consumer sentiment. Could you just provide more color what you saw from an underlying demand perspective through the quarter? And did you see any weakness later in the quarter given some of the headwinds? Kevin Wheeler : Well, I think we mentioned, the sale of the quarter was down. Certainly, that has to do with some consumer sentiment. So again, when we look at this as more of a temporary headwind, short-term. We'll see how the property market kind of works its way out of where it's at today, and how the Chinese government gets involved. But I guess I'll comment that even within this, a consumer sentiment that's down a little bit, we have seen our consumers still pay up for premium products. And in the quarter, we had all 3 of our product -- core product categories have a spike trade up, and that's on water heaters, both tankless and electric as well as water treatment. So my view is, there is still opportunity regardless of how the market is performing at a point in time. But there is clearly a short-term headwind that we'll have to work through, and hopefully, the products that we have and how we bring new innovations to market will help us overcome most of those. Saree Boroditsky : Great. Thank you. And then just given the strong sales growth you saw in India, maybe just talk about the margin profile on that business today? And how are you expecting it to trend overtime? Kevin Wheeler : Let me touch -- we were very pleased, considering India went through a wicked COVID second wave. And to come out of it in Q3, 38% sales growth, our team outperformed the market 2x on both of our products -- key product categories. Again, our new products continue to gain momentum, and we continue to expand our market. And we're pleased with our margin expansion. We, through this difficult time this year, have really improved our bottom line, cut our losses significantly. We'll talk more about those as we exit the year, but our margin profile has improved. And with volume -- again, this is a smaller business for us, volume does make a big difference as we have some nice operating leverage as we grow the business. So where we're at today and we're in our busiest part of the season right now, which is about 1/3 of our business in the next 3 months, we're executing well there. So very, very pleased with where we're at, very pleased where we think we're going to end up in -- at the end of the year, and we'll carry get forward as well. So and it's making improvements, we just need a little help from the economy and maybe less COVID issues in that particular country. Operator : There are no further questions at this time and turning the call back to Patricia. Patricia Ackerman : Thank you all for joining us today. Let me conclude by reminding you that our global A. O. Smith team delivered record sales and earnings in the third quarter of 2021. We remain optimistic about results in the quarters to come based on robust demand for our products as well as strong execution of our strategy, despite an environment challenged by component shortages, logistical bottlenecks and inflation in both materials and transportation costs. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the quarters to come. Also, please mark your calendars to join our presentations at 2 virtual conferences next month : Robert W. Baird on November 9 and UBS on November 17. In the meantime, enjoy the rest of your day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Patricia Ackerman. Please go ahead. Patricia Ackerman : Thank you, Shannon. Good morning and welcome to the A.O. Smith fourth quarter and full year 2021 conference call. I'm Pat Ackerman, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability. Joining me today are Kevin Wheeler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer; and Helen Gurholt, Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis. A friendly reminder that some of our comments and answers during this conference call will be forward-looking statements that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include matters that we have described in this morning's press release among others. Also as a curtsy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. We will be using slides as we move through today's call. You can access them on our website at investor.aosmith.com. I will now turn the call over to Kevin to begin our prepared remarks. Please turn to Slide 4. Kevin Wheeler : Thank you, Pat and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'm on Slide 4 and our full year results. Our team delivered record-setting sales and EPS performance despite a turbulent macro environment. Demand for our products in North America was strong and unprecedented inflation-related pricing actions drove sales 19% higher over 2020. The Rest of the World segment performed well in 2021. China improved it's operating margins to over 9%. We successfully navigated supply chain and transportation challenges and improved our delivery performance since the first quarter. We acquired Giant, a water heater manufacturer in Canada, expanding our market share in North America and welcoming a talented group of employees to the A. O. Smith family. With our dividend and share repurchases, we returned $537 million of capital to our shareholders. Please turn to Slide 5. Our global A. O. Smith team delivered record 2021 EPS of $3.02, a 42% increase that was driven in part by a record 22% increase in sales compared with 2020. Demand for our products was robust across geographies. We achieved this strong performance as a result of continued outstanding operational and sales execution from our team despite the challenging environment of component shortages, logistical bottlenecks and material and transportation cost inflation. I want to take the opportunity to thank my follow, A. O. Smith's employees for their ongoing dedication and creativity as we work to overcome these challenges to meet strong market demand and deliver for our valued customers. North America water heater sales grew 21% in 2021 due to pricing actions implemented in response to rising material and logistic costs and strong demand for our products. Commercial industry demand increased approximately 11% due to the resumption of new construction and replacements in the hospitality market segment. Resident industry demand increased by approximately 8% in 2021 due to strength in new construction and strong replacement demand. Our North America boiler sales grew 13%, driven by new construction and replacement demand as well as the launch of new products. We ended 2021 with a record backlog, largely composed of commercial condensing boilers and January continues to generate strong order rates for these market-leading energy-efficient boilers providing confidence in our outlook for the coming year. Our strategy to focus on innovation and decarbonization contributed to strong demand for our high-efficiency condensing boilers. North America water treatment sales grew 14% in 2021 as we continue to pursue additional market share in this attractive fragmented market with a total addressable market value that we estimate to be $2.6 billion. Our strategy to pursue this market with an omnichannel approach has worked to grow our share through innovation, product development and acquisition opportunities. We believe our independent water quality dealers have been outperforming the market and gaining market share. In China, full year sales increased 24% in local currency compared to 2020 which was significantly impacted by the pandemic. Each of our major product categories grew year-over-year, including electric, gas tankless water heaters and residential and commercial water treatment products along with replacement filters. Our water treatment business comprised of residential, commercial and filter replacement consumables and now represents approximately 30% of our overall business with repeatable consumable filter sales, representing over 20% of overall water treatment sales. I'm now on Slide 6. We know the efficient operation of water heaters and boilers to make a significant impact on mitigating climate change we are committed to doing our part. Reduction in energy use and greenhouse gas emissions are often top priorities for both consumers and contractors. As a result, adoption of sustainable building guidelines, such as lead and well-building certifications, continue to increase. I'd like to highlight some of our products that contribute to sustainable building practices and decarbonization efforts. Heat pump technology is a key consideration for many customers looking for a smart solution in both commercial and residential projects. A heat pump water heater harnesses the heat and the ambient air and transfers it to the water in the tank. We believe we are one of the technology and market share heat pump water heater leaders in North America and are well positioned to help our customers reduce their carbon footprints through innovative products. Adopting commercial and residential ENERGY STAR certified products can contribute to lowering greenhouse gas emissions and reducing negative environmental impact. A. O. Smith is proud to manufacture more than 1,000 models of ENERGY STAR certified products many of which are eligible for incentives via national eco rebates programs. The launch of our newest CREST commercial boiler with Hellcat combustion smart technology is a significant achievement for us as it enhances the energy efficiency of our existing highly efficient CREST condensing boiler. CREST boilers with Hellcat technology reduce start-up, maintenance and operating costs for our customers. I'll now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on the full year and fourth quarter performance. Charles Lauber : Thank you, Kevin and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 7. Full year sales in North America segment rose to $2.5 billion, a 19% increase compared with 2020. Pricing actions largely on water heaters, represented approximately 70% of the increase. Higher volumes of water heaters and boilers were driven by strong replacement and new construction demand and higher volumes of water treatment products added to segment sales growth. Giant, acquired on October 19, 2021, added $23 million to North America sales. North America segment earnings of $591 million increased 17% compared with 2020. The earnings benefit of inflation-related price increases and higher volumes was somewhat offset by higher material and freight costs. Segment operating margin of 23.4% was a modest decline compared with the 2020 segment margin despite significant cost headwinds. Moving on to Slide 8. Rest of the World segment sales of $1 billion increased 30% year-over-year with approximately 60% of that increase attributed to higher volumes. Our sales increase was positively impacted by lower channel inventory reductions in 2021 as compared to 2020. Channel inventory levels at the end 2021 were at the lowest level in five years. Currency translation of China sales favorably impacted sales by approximately $58 million. Growth in each of our major product categories in China contributed to local currency growth of 24% in 2021. New product introductions in the premium segment of the market, particularly our slim line electric wall hung water heaters and water treatment products that deliver hot and ambient filtered water contributed to sales gains. India sales grew 31% in 2021 compared to 2020. We remain committed to India as a long-term growth opportunity given it's attractive growth characteristics and changes in demographics. Rest of the World segment earnings of $91 million increased significantly over breakeven results in 2020 which were adversely impacted by the pandemic. In China, the benefits from higher volumes and favorable mix were partially offset by employee incentives and higher advertising as well as the absence of social insurance waivers that were received in 2020. Segment operating margin improved to 8.8% compared to 2020, primarily as a result of improved operating leverage from higher volumes. Please turn to Slide 9. Turning to the quarter, fourth quarter performance, we delivered record sales of $996 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, up 19% year-over-year, driven by inflation-related pricing actions primarily in North America. Earnings in the fourth quarter were $0.87 per share which is an 18% increase compared with earnings of $0.74 per share in the fourth quarter of 2020. Please turn to Slide 10. Fourth quarter sales in North America segment rose to $715 million, a 27% increase compared against the strong comp in the fourth quarter of 2020. Pricing actions largely on water heaters and sales from Giant represented almost all of the increase. While volumes were strong relative to historical fourth quarter volumes, our 2020 fourth quarter was exceptionally strong, creating a difficult comp. North America segment earnings of $167 million increased 21% compared with 2020. The earnings benefit of inflation-related price increases was somewhat offset by higher material and freight costs and lower volumes. Pricing actions trailed rapidly rising steel costs which resulted in a lower segment operating margin of 23.3% compared with the 2020 segment margin of 24.6%. Moving to Slide 11. Fourth quarter Rest of the World segment sales of $288 million increased 3% year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable mix in China as consumers purchased our new higher-priced products with more features and benefits which was offset by lower China volumes compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 which benefited from pent-up demand in China's economy emerging from the pandemic. Currency translation of China sales favorably impacted sales by approximately $9 million. Rest of the World segment earnings of $31 million were in line with Q4 2020 segment earnings and China favorable mix offset lower volumes. Segment operating margin was 10.6% compared to 11.2% in the fourth quarter of 2020, primarily due to lower volumes. Please turn to Slide 12. We generated strong free cash flow of $566 million during 2021, higher than 2020 due to higher earnings that were partially offset by a larger investment in working capital to support demand levels. Free cash flow conversion was 116%. Our cash balances totaled $631 million at the end of December and our net cash position was $435 million. Our leverage ratio was 9.7% as measured by total debt to total capital. Our strong free cash flow and solid balance sheet enables us to focus on capital allocation priorities and returning cash to shareholders. Earlier this month, our Board approved our next quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share which represents our 82nd consecutive year of dividend payments. We repurchased approximately 5.1 million shares of common stock in 2021 for a total of $367 million. Let's now turn to Slide 13. In addition to returning capital to shareholders, we continue to see opportunities for organic growth, innovation and new product development across all of our product lines and geographies. We continue to target strategic acquisitions with a focus on water heating and water treating assets that meet our financial metrics of accretive to earnings in the first year and return our cost of capital in three years. Please turn to Slide 14 and our 2020 earnings guidance and outlook. Adjusted EPS is introduced as a result of our termination of our defined benefit pension plan. The termination follows a strategy and measured glide path to derisk our fully funded exposure to pension liabilities. The plan which was previously sunset for benefits earned on December 31, 2014, represents over 95% of the company's pension liability. The terminated plans pension liability is expected to be annuitized in 2022. The pension plan settlement which we expect will occur during the fourth quarter, will accelerate the recognition of a projected $445 million of noncash pretax pension expenses or an EPS impact of $1.73. In addition, in order to protect our pension plans funded status during 2021, we transitioned our pension plan assets to lower risk investments. The impact of this transition will result in a lower rate of return on pension investments and accordingly, higher pension expenses in 2020 compared to previous years. In order to provide transparency to the operating results of our business, in 2022, we will provide non-GAAP measures, adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted segment earnings that exclude the impact of noncash pension income and expenses. Reconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of the presentation and also on our website. We are pleased to introduce our 2022 outlook with an expected EPS range of $1.56 and $1.76 per share and our adjusted EPS range of $3.35 and $3.55 per share. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS range represents an increase of 17% compared with 2021. Our outlook is based on a number of key assumptions, including that the Omicron COVID-19 variant which is currently surging and impacting our production due to labor constraints. We currently have approximately 7% of our North America workforce out due to COVID-19 surge. Our outlook assumes that the variance subsides in the first quarter and we return to the productivity levels that we operated at during the majority of 2021. Steel indices began to stabilize at the end of 2021 and we started to see the full benefit of our five announced 2021 price increases which had a cumulative effect on water heating prices of approximately 50%. Our guidance assumes that steel prices in 2022 on an annual basis will approximate steel market pricing at the end of 2021. We continue to see increases in non-steel materials and transportation costs. Multiple 2021 price increases compounding to approximately 50% for water heaters as we exit 2021. We assume that approximately 45% of the cumulative announced price increase was realized in 2021 and the remainder will be realized in 2022. Previously announced mid- to high single-digit inflation-related price increases in the remainder of our global portfolio, continued strength in demand and backlog in North America for all of our water heating product categories, driven by growth in replacement demand and new construction spending. While supply chain challenges have moderated as we move into 2022, we remain in close contact with our suppliers and logistics providers to troubleshoot, manage and resolve bottlenecks. As the environment remains unpredictable, particularly with the current surge and the Omicron variant of COVID-19. The integration of Giant which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2021 is on track and customer employee feedback is positive. We project the acquisition to achieve annual synergies of approximately $5 million over a two-year period. Giant added $0.01 to EPS in 2021 net of customary purchase accounting adjustments and onetime transaction expenses. We reaffirm from our third quarter call that the acquisition is projected to add between $0.06 and $0.08 to EPS in 2022. As for other housekeeping assumptions, we expect to generate strong free cash flow of between $500 million and $525 million. For the year, CapEx is projected to be between $75 million and $80 million. Corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $55 million. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be between 23.5% to 24%. And we expect to repurchase approximately $400 million of shares of our stock, resulting in outstanding diluted shares of $157 million at the end of 2022. Based on these assumptions, the midpoint of our adjusted EPS range represents an increase of 17% compared to 2021. I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin, who will provide a little bit more color on our key markets and top line growth assumption outlook and segment expectations for 2022, while staying on Slide 14. Kevin? Kevin Wheeler : Thank you, Chuck. As Chuck noted, our outlook assumes the current surge of the Omicron variant subsides during the first quarter, it does not significantly impact productivity or significantly impact the end markets that we serve. With the assumption as a backdrop to 2022, we project revenue growth for 2022 of 16% to 18% which includes the following assumptions : After approximately 8% growth in each of the last two years which is well above the historical average growth rate, we estimate U.S. residential water industry unit volumes will be down approximately 2% from last year as industry demand normalizes. We believe that commercial water heating industry volumes to be flat to slightly down as new construction and replacement installations level off. Our China business performance was strong and stable in 2021. We expect China sales to grow approximately 5% in local currency in 2022 driven by demand of our residential and commercial water treatment products, including our replacement filters as well as range hoods and cooktops. We expect that sales of our residential water heaters in China will be flat to slightly down compared to 2021. We expect our North America boiler sales will increase approximately 10% in 2022. Our expectations are based on several growth drivers; an industry growth of 3% to 4%, we believe replacement demand is 85%. The transition to higher energy-efficient boilers will continue, particularly as commercial buildings improve their overall carbon footprint. In 2021, condensing boilers were approximately 30% to 35% of the commercial boiler industry that represents our addressable market. We believe the potential for the condensing boiler market is to represent 60% to 65% of the total market over time which provides continued opportunity for our leading market share commercial condensing boilers. And new product launches, including a full year of our improved flagship CREST commercial condensing boiler with Hellcat technology and the introduction of one million BTU light-duty condensing commercial Knight FTXL. We project 13% to 14% growth in sales for North America water treatment. We believe the megatrends of healthy and safe drinking water as well as reduction of single-use plastic bottles will continue to drive consumer demand for our point-of-use and point-of-entry water treatment systems. We expect margins to improve by approximately 100 basis points in 2022 compared to last year. Based on these factors, along with the full impact of our 2021 price increases, we expect our North America segment margin to be between 22.25% and 22.75%, excluding pension expenses and Rest of World segment margins to be approximately 10% or 100 basis points higher than 2021. Slide 15, please. As we begin 2022, I'm focusing on key strategic priorities to advance our position as a leader in heating and treating water around the world. First, innovate and expand our decarb portfolio, including heat pumps for space and water heating; expand our global water treatment capabilities by investing in technologies, people and distribution; deploy capital effectively by investing in ourselves, acquisitions and returning capital to shareholders. Thanks for the tremendous effort by our procurement and operation teams and their commitment to operational excellence which is part of our DNA, as nearly a 150-year-old technology leader in innovative manufacturer, our supply chain is stabilizing and our manufacturing lead times remain consistent. Through our focus and determination to serve our customers, we closed out the year on a high note and remain strong entering 2022. Our strong brands across the portfolio, combined with harnessing of technology to drive innovation and new product development will enhance our market leadership. We are confident in our ability to capitalize on opportunities as we continue to execute our strategy. And finally, I have a bitter sweet announcement. Pat Ackerman shared her plans to retire from her position as Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Treasurer and Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability, effective March 31, 2022. In addition to her many responsibilities, Pat has been a key contact for new and existing investors since 2008, coordinating communication and effectively delivering our message to our investor base. We thank Pat for dedication to A.O. Smith, her leadership and her steadfast commitment to the values and principles of our organization. Pat's many contributions and impact will be long lasting. Please join me and Chuck and the rest of the A. O. Smith family in wishing Pat, the very best in her well-earned retirement. Patricia Ackerman : Thank you, Kevin, for your kind words. I am fortunate to have spent my entire 39-year career at a terrific company in A.O. Smith and working alongside great people like many of you on this call today. I'm enthusiastic about retirement and one of the key reasons why is my Investor Relations successor, Helen Gurholt. With over two decades of progressively increasing finance experience at A.O. Smith, Helen most recently was Vice President and Controller and led our SEC reporting. You will find Helen to be knowledgeable and personable and I know you will enjoy working with Helen as much as I have. With that, we conclude our prepared remarks and we are now available for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Matt Summerville : Thanks and Congrats, Pat. Patricia Ackerman : Thanks, Matt. Matt Summerville : Couple of questions. How should we be thinking about North America in particular, kind of the quarterly revenue and earnings cadence given what's a pretty significant number of moving pieces, how you have incremental price rolling through, how you're thinking about volume across the different product lines? How should we be thinking about that for 2022? Charles Lauber : Matt, this is Chuck. So as we kind of look at 2022, overall, the cadence -- when we look at the first quarter, it's going to probably be the most challenging from a margin and perhaps the volume quarter. As you know, China is always weakest in the first quarter with the festival, gains momentum for the second and third quarter and then the fourth quarter is the strongest. You should think of it very similar to that way. Less moving parts in China perhaps because price and costs have not been that much of a move. Back to your North America focus though. North America, a little lighter on the volume in Q1. There are some disruptions. Omicron has, as I mentioned, a bit of our labor force out. And we're going to -- if you look at steel, steel costs mentioned that we're going to still see in the first quarter, we're going to have our highest steel costs that we've experienced as steel has been rising. We, as you know, have a lag when we see this deal. So our Q3 to Q4 steel cost is going to be rising maybe 15% to 20% compared to Q4. So Q1 will certainly be challenged on the margin in North America a bit, though we do have our price increase offsetting that. So we have pricing coming in, got a little bit higher steel. And so Q1 is our most challenged on the margin side. Two through three as you roll out the rest of -- and four to the rest of the year in North America, we do expect steel to moderate just a bit. You've seen the index come down. And so we expect margins to be a little bit stronger in the back three quarters in North America with the price increase in full for all -- really all of the year. So that's basically the roll forward, kind of how to look at 2022 from North America perspective. And we've got -- pricing, I mentioned is about 45%, we believe, on the water heating side effective that we've already seen. And so we've got 55% of that rolling in for 2022. Hope that provides a little better color on how it rolls out. Matt Summerville : Yes, it does. And just as a follow-up, you mentioned that inventory levels in China stand at the lowest level you've seen in five years. I guess, do you feel or do you expect to see inventory start to bleed higher? Or is A.O. Smith's objective going forward to really drive that number as low as possible so as to not have a repeat of some of the challenges you had in recent years? Charles Lauber : Yes. Our goal is to always keep it at the leanest level that's appropriate to serve our customers in China. It's had a low water mark. We wouldn't expect it to go lower than that at the end of 2021. So as we've said before, we keep a close watch on it. It's at a level where we feel is about as low as it's going to go to make sure we're serving our customers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Graham with Loop Capital Markets. Your line is open. Scott Graham : Yes, hi, good morning. And hearty, congratulations to you, Pat; you've been phenomenal in your job. Patricia Ackerman : Thanks, Scott. Scott Graham : I have a couple of questions for you all. I guess the first one is on the North American business. It looked like the first two months of industry shipments in resi water heaters were up and your chart shows volumes down in North America for the quarter. Could you maybe give us a little more color on that? Kevin Wheeler : This is Kevin, Scott. I mean, as we discussed on our Q3 call, we had a challenging Q1 and we had been making progress through Q2 and Q3 and we fully expected that to carry over into Q4. It lagged a little bit. And so that's what you're seeing. That is not indicative of order rates. That's not indicative of customers. But it did lag a little bit. We expect to pick that up as we get into 2022. And I guess the comment I would make is our customer bases are solid. We've had no issues, no losses. And I believe based on customer feedback, we really serviced our customers well throughout this pandemic and make sure they have the right products they needed. And what we did at the end of this year as the -- our supply chain started to stabilize and so forth. We had some allocations out there for the -- for most of the year and we took those allocations off in December. So that's going to help drive maybe some additional orders as we get into Q1 but bottom line, I think we're in good shape. And as the industry normalizes and gets out of this turbulent sector, I think everything will move back to a much more of a normal cadence and a normal share output for us. Scott Graham : Okay. Two other questions really. I know you have to start the year carefully with some of your estimates and certainly, that seems to have read through to a couple of the line items. I guess I'm thinking that when you say commercial flat to slightly down, I guess I'm kind of wondering where you're coming from on that one because the -- we're still -- I guess Omicron now key part of that but it just -- it feels like we're going to have a full year of reopenings, possibly even incremental reopenings versus '21. Just sort of wondering why you would think that, that would be a flat market for you. Kevin Wheeler : Well, I'll touch on that and then maybe have Chuck jump in as well. When you look at -- we had a lot of reopenings in 2021. We had a very strong market. And as we go forward, it's a forecast. We believe that things will be a bit more normalized. Probably some of the proactive replacements won't be there. And so as we look out, a very strong 2021, we think that's just going to peel back in 2022. But again, flat coming off a very strong year, Scott, is pretty positive. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Susan Maklari : Thank you. Good morning, everyone and Pat, I'd like to add my congratulations as well to you. Patricia Ackerman : Thanks, Sue. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Susan Maklari : Good morning. My first question is you mentioned that you have taken a lot of your customers off of allocation in North America in December. Can you just give us some color on where you think channel inventories sit? And how do you expect that your order rates could trend as those allocations have been removed? Kevin Wheeler : Let me touch on that one as well. One, we're very specific on our order -- on our inventories in China because we have really terrific visibility there. North America, it's more of a -- we don't have the same visibility but based on the input that we have from our customers and so forth that the inventories are basically in line. There's probably some gaps here and there. For the most part, I think the allocation just frees up maybe some orders. I'm not going to put a number on it, quite frankly. But I do think we have limited some of our customers and try to be predictable for them, getting the right products to them, making sure that their deliveries were on time. So again, I think it's a positive thing for our organization as we enter into 2022, removing the allocation and kind of getting back to business as normal. And so that's kind of where we're at. No specific number, I think I would want to add to that. Susan Maklari : Got you. Okay, that's helpful. And then, as we do think about steel perhaps moderating or sort of coming off of this peak as we move through the year, how should we expect price will sort of trend with that? Do you think that as the volumes come off on the residential side potentially you'll have to give back any of this price? Or do you expect that it will be fairly sticky? Kevin Wheeler : Yes. It's -- we've never had these sort of price increases like we've seen in the last couple -- in this last year, of course. So it's a little bit difficult to predict. We can kind of look at historically what's happened. Historically, we've generally been able to hold share in margin and we react to the cost changes as necessary. So a bit hard to see how it plays out. We've got non-steel cost in logistics and freight that even as steel costs have come down since our last call, we've only seen pressure and increase on all other non-steel costs. We really have seen those surge a bit in the last quarter. So those somewhat offset some of the relief perhaps that might be happening a bit of moderation on the steel side. Operator : Our next question comes from Damian Karas with UBS. Your line is open. Damian Karas : Hey, good morning, everyone. Congrats on the year. And Pat, best of luck in your retirement. Patricia Ackerman : Thanks, Damian. Damian Karas : So I wanted to ask you about some of your comments on China. So you're expecting 5% sales growth there but you mentioned water heater volumes flat to slightly down. Could you just talk about little bit about your key assumptions driving your forecast there? Charles Lauber : Sure, sure. Yes, I mean, water heater volumes in China have been flat to down. When we look at the full year demand and I'll just kind of talk about what the overall 2021 consumer demand as best we measure through our channel, it probably was up 1% to 2% the demand itself. So underlying demand when we get to the 5%, you can kind of think of it as 1% to 2%. There's a bit of pricing in China. We haven't nearly seen the cost pressures as we've seen in North America but that's perhaps another percent. And then when we think about kind of the new products, we've got some new products we've introduced. We've got the products I mentioned earlier in the statement on electric that are doing well and the gas products that are doing well, range hoods, cooktops, commercial water treatment and water treatment overall, we feel pretty positive about which kind of fills that gap to get you to that 5%. Year-over-year currencies, we expect to be roughly flat, equal year-over-year. So that's kind of the bridge to kind of get up to that 5%. Damian Karas : Okay, great. That's helpful. And then on water heaters, specifically in China, maybe you could just help us understand a little kind of where mix is today compared to the pre-2019 peak levels, if you will. Obviously, kind of you mixed down after that. But maybe any color around kind of the mid- to premium price mix today relative to the past would be helpful. Charles Lauber : Yes. We're -- so we're not at the peak where we were in mix in the peak years before 2019. Premium segment of the market was higher percentage of the segment of the market as we measure it at that time but we are coming out of the trough. So we've got a year-over-year improvement in mix planned in 2022. Q4 was positive on mix. And the introduction of a couple of the new products we've just put out there help our mix because they're in the premium segment. So we're not at the peak. We're certainly not at the trough. We feel really good about the momentum coming out of it and positive about the new products coming into the market. Kevin Wheeler : Yes. I would just add, I mean it's new products across our electric line, our gas tankless line, our water treatment that has done substantially well and continues to grow. And so -- and then the kind of what I would call the newer segments. Our commercial water treatment continues to do well and close over to $40-plus million. And then Chuck mentioned range hoods and cooktops which are gaining momentum. So overall, there's still going to be a COVID issue that we'll have to work through there and some spotty shutdowns that happened. And that may deal us a setback. There's still some derisking. But you put it all together, we came out of fourth quarter pretty well. We have some really good products on the premium side that are just getting into the market fully. So we feel real good about the mix and where it's going and hope to get back to those '19 levels soon. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Your line is open. Nathan Jones : Good morning, everyone. My congratulations to Pat and welcome to this part of the team to Helen. I did want to follow up on steel prices. I know you guys are talking about steel indices flattening out. But I think you have more exposure to coil steel prices which have actually come down pretty substantially. Is that a potential significant tailwind from margins as we get into maybe the second half of the year once you've run through the higher-cost steel and the inventory? And how is that balancing off against the inflation that you're continuing to see in other inputs? Charles Lauber : Yes. I mean our input on steel is about 70% cold rolled, 30% hot rolled. So those are -- those are the indices we're really tracking. And there, we've seen some moderation. We haven't seen it come down a great deal but we've seen some moderation. Year-over-year, our steel is going to be up 50% in 2022 on average compared to 2021. So we still have that steel pressure there. Right now, I mean, it's early in the year, right? So we're looking at the increase of non-steel cost components, logistics. We really haven't seen any relief on that. If we just kind of look through the rest of the year, our best projection would be if there is some moderation in steel on the index that we have seen a bit that the offset is largely in the non-steel components. And so we're not in our outlook calling for any -- we're calling in our outlook when we look at it, that Q1 is probably the most challenged and then it really -- the margins sort of flatten out after that -- after we get over that kind of one quarter where steel is the highest. Nathan Jones : I guess my follow-up then around the margin guidance for North America which is down a little bit from 2021. I think given you were chasing costs up last year, you had some disruption in your manufacturing processes early in the year last year. I might have expected a little margin expansion in 2022. Can you maybe just discuss the puts and takes that are going into seeing margins a little bit lower in North America in '22? Charles Lauber : Sure, sure. So they are lower in our guidance and what -- let me just do a little reconciliation because if you exclude -- and I mentioned the noncash pension adjustment, that's about $10 million that you'll see in our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. That will affect the margins a bit. And if you look at the Giant acquisition which is performing great as we expected, performing well but it doesn't have quite the same margin as the rest of the North America business. Reconciling for those two really get us back to adjusted margins that are flat compared to 2021. So 2022, North America is roughly flat compared to 2021. And that's with continued growth in North America water treatment and some of those other businesses that we're looking to expand our margin year-over-year. So the kind of expectation it may gone up, we're really looking at flat and some of those other non-steel costs that we're seeing are really filling that gap. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird. Your line is open. Mike Halloran : Good morning, everyone. And congrats, Pat. It's been an enjoyable -- what decade plus, I guess but I've really enjoyed the relationship. So, thank you. Patricia Ackerman : Thanks, Mike. Mike Halloran : So maybe a similar line of question on China, Chuck, maybe just could you give the bridge on the China margins and obviously, 10% is a nice increase here but what are the puts and takes going from this year's to next year's margin levels? Charles Lauber : Yes, I can do that. I mean it's really -- it's up about 100 basis points. So we're kind of -- we're looking to expand from 9% to 10%, mostly on volume, mostly on volume and mix. We got the products that we mentioned earlier and that they came into play in volume and mix. So we overcame a bit in 2021 to 2020. I mentioned the social insurance. That's about $12 million for the year. So we like the progress that we made in '21 to get us to 9%. And then it's really volume and mix and leverage on the top line that gets us to 10%. Mike Halloran : That makes sense. And then shifting to North America. When you think about the tank, tankless heat pump dynamic in the water heater side, the residential water heater side, any movement as you think about it through this year? And how you're thinking about -- through last year, excuse me, how you're thinking about it this year. Any real change in the momentum that you've been seeing in any of those business lines relative to each other? Kevin Wheeler : I would say on the residential side, probably not any tank momentum. Heat pumps have been growing year-over-year, becoming more popular. Obviously, there's more incentives out there and that's moving in the right direction. So we're in a good position there. And I would say, maybe on the commercial side, we're starting to see a bit more commercial heat pump up there. But let's step back, we still have a great decarbing footprint called condensing water heaters and condensing boilers. And that's also trending well because there's so many applications that you really need the output and the heat of a gas-fired product and being able to provide condensing boilers and condensing commercial water heaters, also priced opportunities. So commercial, I think you're going to continue to see just high efficiency growing and on both gas and on the kind of the heat pump side. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeff Hammond : Hey, good morning, everyone. Best of luck, Pat. Patricia Ackerman : Thanks, Jeff. Jeff Hammond : So, just first on supply chain. You mentioned a couple of times stabilization, moderation in the headwinds. Can you just speak specifically to what you see as getting better here near term? Kevin Wheeler : Just overall, you can't make any of our products without every component. And so it's -- and when I say that I'm smiling here. But overall, as you start to become a bit more predictable, as our suppliers become a bit more predictable. And so that's what's been -- and then just some of the volumes coming up. We came out of a big freeze that impacted farm and oil-based products. And then steel was running behind but we're starting to see all these key components moving in the right direction. And so that's the stabilization. We're still very tactical, tracking orders and making sure we're looking for alternatives but we've been doing that for a year and it's worked out pretty well for our team. So overall, that's what stabilization looks like. That's why we were able to remove the allocation from our supply chain. And then, I'm going to tell you we're going to have pockets of disruption occasionally here and there. We'll have to keep working through that. But that's where it's at. It's getting incrementally better. It's getting incrementally more predictable. Our suppliers, just like us, are stepping up their game in production and deliveries. But it's incremental. And we feel as we enter 2022, we're in better shape in 2021, albeit we'll have to see how the Omicron surge impacts that. But as of right now, there hasn't been a large issue for us. Jeff Hammond : Okay. And then just back on this kind of steel and pricing dynamic. It seems like cold rolled which I think is your biggest input, is down like 15% off of year-end pricing. And just if that sticks, when do you start to see, one, the benefit of that? And just remind us how the material price formulas work with the DIY customers where some of that pricing -- when that some of that pricing might roll off? Charles Lauber : So the decrease we've seen so far that it still has come down. We probably -- we will not see that until we get it probably into the middle of the second quarter. So that's from a cost perspective. And then who knows where it will go from there, right? So it's gone down a bit. I'm not sure our assumption is that it kind of stays at that level through the rest of the year. We've got -- we have certain customers that have pricing formula that represents maybe 25% of our water heater volume. And so the cadence on that follows similarly to kind of when you see steel indexes move. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is open. David MacGregor : Yes, good morning, everyone. And Pat, thanks for all the help along the way. It's been great working with you. I wish you all the best in your retirement. Patricia Ackerman : Thanks, David. David MacGregor : I guess I just wanted to build on a couple of other questions that have been asked at this point. And maybe for starters, go back to the discussion around China and mix and you talked about the fact that you're seeing a stronger mix with the premium product. Clearly, that's a reflection of new product that you've introduced out there. But are you seeing a similar trend across the broader market? In other words, is the Chinese consumer mixing up again? Or is this really AOS specific? Kevin Wheeler : Yes. Based on the data that we've seen and again, I am going to relate it to more of the appliance side of the business. We see almost every category on a year-on-year basis, mixing up. So that's a positive trend that says a lot maybe consumer confidence and so forth in China. But yes, we are seeing it. It's not just in our categories but others that we don't participate in. Charles Lauber : Yes. It's not back to the peak but it's a couple of quarters now where I think we can start calling it a trend because we've seen an uptick. David MacGregor : Yes, that's encouraging. And just on China, can you update us in terms of how you're approaching distribution and the growth of distribution in terms of 2022, what should we expect there in terms of new doors? Charles Lauber : Yes. So we really are focusing on two pieces really. When you think about kind of the Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, we are -- we're really looking at store efficiencies there. So we're continuing to be focused on store efficiencies. We're probably going to take out a bit more stores in 2022. We're at that pace. We've been on that pace for a number of years now. We're probably in the 200 to 300 store taking out in 2022 compared to where we're ending the year in 2021, just not quite 6,000 outlets. On the other side, we're really looking to grow geography in the Tier 3 to Tier 6 cities. So think of that as low-cost counters. We're just -- we're not having a promoter. It's very opportunistic. And those footprints, that's growing in the neighborhood of maybe 500 but don't do the math equal to the Tier 1 and Tier 2 but it's certainly opportunistic and it's where we're really looking to continue to expand. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning, everyone. Best of luck, Pat. Patricia Ackerman : Thanks, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Can you talk a little bit more about the competitive environment you're seeing in North America? You have a very strong positioning in the core water heater market here but you've also been aggressively raising price and you do have some competition ramping up their own capacity now. So how sticky can your pricing be as inflation starts to normalize a bit? And should we be at all worried about competitors ramping up their own capacity? Kevin Wheeler : Well, I worry every day. So -- and I'm not being flip but I mean if you look at our business, we've been competing for seven years in this industry. We continue to get up every day and focus on A. O. Smith and A. O. Smith's customers and our brands. And so there are clearly some competitors coming into the market. We're going to continue to focus on what we do best and that's bringing innovative products to market, high service levels and making sure that we grow profitable with our customers. And I'll go back to the recent statements that we just really talked about is we had no customer loss. I really believe that we really -- we've taken care of our customers in a professional way and manage their expectations. And again, I always go back to this industry isn't about residential, gas and electric, isn't about just standard commercial. It's about bringing a portfolio of products to our customers. And not only residential and commercial but the high technology, newer products like heat pumps and condensing products that we continue to bring to market, perfect example is healthcare technology on our CREST boiler. All those things matter and we package that up together. We believe when we compete in the market, we have a value proposition that meets our customers' expectations and helps them grow their business. Charles Lauber : And the only additional comment I'll make to that is and we called it out in our slides is that our R&D spend is over $90 million. And that's on water heating, water treating and we're really focused on those markets and as Kevin said, being the leader in the product technology. Andy Kaplowitz : And maybe for my follow-up. North American boiler sales, you talked about up 10% in '22 after a good year in '21. So maybe you can talk a little bit more about the sustainability of the growth trends that are helping you in that business. I think historically, it's been more of a mid-single-digit grower. And do you think you'll see any direct impacts from the infrastructure bill? And if so, when could they begin to occur? Kevin Wheeler : Well, I can tell you, we've seen certain segments. We talked about the educational segment. Last quarter, that's been certainly been helping us in providing an opportunity. We're seeing more government institutional segments start to grow. So we are seeing some of that maybe that stimulus or that we're talking about in the marketplace. That's what's led to our record backlog that we have today. And that's going to stay with us, I think, at least through 2022. I mean we're looking at a 10% growth rate. And so overall, there are some stimulus out there. There's also just some pent-up demand that may go back to the pandemic that we're filling that gap as well. And again, the replacement market is 85%. So you're going to have that natural replacement market continue. So overall, the boiler market looks strong. Orders are still good. Quoting activity is still good. So overall, entering 2022 in a really good position in the boilers segment. Charles Lauber : Yes. I mean the thing I'll add on to that is I mean that 10% growth, there was some pricing that we did do on the boiler side of the business also. So there's a bit of carryover pricing that helps us a little bit but we still see growth in the boiler market. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Blair with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Bryan Blair : Good morning, everyone. Pat, thank you very much for your help over the years. It's been a pleasure working with you. Patricia Ackerman : Thanks, Bryan. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Bryan Blair : I apologize if I missed this. Did you cite run rate North American water treatment margins or the expected margin step-up as that business continues to scale double digits in '22? Charles Lauber : Yes. We haven't, I don't think but margins are around 11%. They were approaching 11% in 2021. So we're pleased with the progress that we made, leverage and volume, the acquisitions to continue to move forward on that and we're expecting about 100 basis points expansion in 2022. Bryan Blair : Okay, appreciate that. And circling back to commercial boilers. Any feedback you can offer on the reception and acceptance of your Hellcat technology since that's been out there and how that factors into the backlog build that you've had and how we should think about the -- I guess the cadence of first versus second half growth netting to that 10% range that you've guided given your backlog position bidding activity, et cetera? Kevin Wheeler : Well, the Hellcat technology has been accepted and received very well by our contractor mechanical base. And so -- but that was at the later part of the year. So we really look forward into 2022 of having a full year with this new technology. And just to go back to it, I think we stated in our remarks but it's not only higher efficiency but start-up that could take two to three hours, it takes 20 minutes sometimes now. Maintenance, it helps us get through the maintenance and it adjusts, so you don't have to go out there and do manual adjustments and the overall cost. So we're excited about it. It's a first to market, a first mover. It's truly technology different than what's in the market today. We've built it on a terrific product like the CREST. And we just see that continuing to grow and gain momentum, particularly in the specified side of the business. Charles Lauber : Yes, not specific to growth but the cadence of the boiler business is typically, Q3 and Q4 are the strongest quarters and we still expect that in '22. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry De Maria with William Blair. Your line is open. Larry De Maria : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Larry De Maria : And certainly, best of luck to Pat. Patricia Ackerman : Thank you. Larry De Maria : Yes, I hope everyone gets a nice time for a field trip [ph]. So, I was kind of curious, I know you touched on this but as it related to China with inventory of five-year low, I believe you said but only looking up 5% for the market. I mean I know you're confident enough but can you delineate between consumer demand and channel fill? And are we holding the channel back at all from refilling? Just seems like there might be some potential upside there. Charles Lauber : Good question. We don't believe we're holding the channel back. I mean I will say we had a strong order rate at the end of December that we certainly did get out in January. But we're not -- it may go up a bit. We don't expect it to go lower. So as we kind of think about 2022, channel inventories do get a bit lumpy but they've been really honed down to a pretty lean level. And if anything, we expect it to slightly go up but we're going to keep that in a close watch. Larry De Maria : Okay. And then you guys also mentioned the impact of Omicron, I think, in the fourth quarter into the first quarter. If you could just kind of clarify that is it mostly in North America, is it little bit in China also? And how meaningful is that impact? Kevin Wheeler : Yes, it's primary. It's almost exclusively in North America, particularly with the number of people that we have out. So China, again, very little but again, it's spotty, it depends on the region. India is the same way but really, the Omicron surge has really impacted our North America businesses. And we're working through it. It hasn't peaked yet but we hope that we'll start to see it peaking, it will come down and we'll get through it in the first quarter and kind of put this phase of COVID in the rearview mirror. Operator : Thank you. And I'm currently showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Helen Gurholt for closing remarks. Helen Gurholt : Thank you for joining us today. Let me conclude by reminding you that our global A. O. Smith team delivered strong sales and earnings despite many challenges in 2021. We are optimistic about our results in future periods based on a durable strategy, robust demand for our products as well as strong execution of our strategy despite an environment challenged by component shortages, logistical bottlenecks, inflation in both materials and transportation costs and pandemic-related challenges. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the quarters to come. In addition, please mark your calendars to join our presentations at three conferences next month; RW Baird on February 22, Citi on February 23 and Barclays on February 24. Thank you and have a great rest of your day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Helen Gurholt. Ma'am, please go ahead. Helen Gurholt : Thank you, Catherine. Good morning and welcome to the A.O. Smith first quarter conference call. I'm Helen Gurholt, Vice President, Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis.  Joining me today are Kevin Wheeler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer. In order to provide improved transparency to our operating results, we provide non-GAAP measures. Free cash flow is defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures.  We will be using slides as we move through today's call. You can access them on our website at investor.aosmith.com. I will now turn the call over to Kevin to begin our prepared remarks. Please turn to the next slide. Kevin Wheeler : Thank you, Helen and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'm on Slide Four and our first quarter results. Our team performed extremely well throughout the quarter, despite a turbulent macro environment and delivered strong sales and EPS performance. First quarter sales improved 27% year-over-year driven by our 2021 inflation related price increases and acquisition of giant factories like late year in international volume growth. Excluding acquisitions, first quarter sale grew 23%. Our Rest of World segment performance was strong with margins improvement over 440 basis point year-over-year, driven by China improving its operating margins to over 11%. We delivered strong results despite supply chain challenges and component shortages throughout the quarter. Weather challenges and Omicron related labor constraints impacted our North American production in the first half of the quarter. However shipments improved sequentially in the second half of February and in March. Especially our residential water heater production, where we saw supply chain improvement and as a result, improved our lead times to customers. The acquisition of Giant added $32 million to the quarter sales and $0.02 to EPS. We are pleased with the performance of the team and the integration is on track. Please turn to Slide Five. Our global A.O. Smith team delivered first quarter 2022 adjusted EPS of $0.77 a 31% increase that was driven in part by a 27% increase in sales compared with the first quarter of 2021. Our strong first quarter performance resulted from our team's outstanding operational and sales execution despite the challenging environment of component shortages, continued materials and transportation cost inflation, weather impacts and surges in COVID 19. I continue to take pride in how my fellow A.O. Smith employees are working together to overcome these challenges to meet market demand and deliver for our value customers. Excluded the impact of Giant, North America, water heater sales grew 28% in the first quarter of 2022, due to pricing actions implemented in '21, in response to rising material and logistic costs. Our full year outlook of the residential water heater industry remains unchanged as demand continues to track to our expectations. Our full year outlook for the commercial water heater industry is to be flat to slightly down. The commercial industry started the year weaker than expected, primarily due to a regulatory change that temporarily impacted orders of large electric commercial products greater than 55 gallon. Our first quarter commercial sales were also impacted by component shortages for certain gas products. We have seen demand for our large electric product improving since early in the quarter, and we expect component availability to improve in the second quarter. Our North America boiler sales grew 24% in the quarter, primarily driven by price increases to offset higher material and transportation costs and demand for our energy efficient products. We ended the quarter with a record backlog, largely composed of commercial condensing boilers and April continues to generate strong order rates for these market-leading energy efficient boilers, providing confidence in our outlook for the year. Our strategy to focus on innovation and decarbonization contributed to strong demand for our high efficiency condensing boilers. North America water treatment sales grew 17% in the first quarter, as we continue to pursue additional market share in this attractive market, with a total addressable market value that we estimate to be $2.6 billion. Taking an omnichannel approach, our strategy is to grow our market share through innovation, product development and acquisition opportunities. Our independent water quality dealers continue to play an important role in our growth by outperforming the market and gaining market share. In China, sales increased 12% in local currency compared to the first quarter of 2021, primarily viewed a favorable mix as our new product offerings continue to be well received as well as higher sales of commercial water treatment products and replacement filters. During the first quarter, we proactively worked with our distributed to ship product into the market in advance of potential COVID 19 disruptions, which most recently is impacting transportation in certain regions. While our customers have ample inventory in place, our tracking of consumer demand in April across our portfolio and geographies is indicating a year-over-year reduction of 35% to 40%. Our outlook assumes the COVID 19 related shutdowns in China subside during the second quarter of 2022. Despite the economic headwinds to our business in China, I'm very pleased with the quarterly performance of our China team who taking great steps to right size the business, manage discretionary spend while investing in new product development. On Slide 6please, elect to two of our products in China that demonstrate a continued focus on innovation and product development. At the right top awards ceremony in Tianjin China, AO Smith earned two of the coveted high end appliance awards for the quiet, fresh range hood and soft water heating hot water boiler. Under the guidance of China household electric appliances association, our products were among hundreds of products evaluated for the awards every year, with a focus on advanced technology, industrial design, market influence, energy conservation, environmental protection and user experience. We take great pride in this recognition as yet another example, how our products set us apart as innovative leader in the market. I'll now turn the call over to Chuck who will buy more details on our first quarter performance. Charles Lauber : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 7, first quarter sales in North America segment rose to $730 million, a 32% increase compared to 2021. Pricing actions largely on water heaters represented approximately 89% of the increase. Sales in the quarter also benefited from higher volumes of boilers and water treatment products. However, the sales increases were partially offset by lower volumes of commercial water heaters. Giant acquired on October 19, 2021 added a $32 million to North America sales. North America adjusted segment earnings of $154 million increased 21% compared with the same period of 2021. The earnings benefit of inflation related increases was partially offset by higher material and freight cost and lower commercial volumes. Adjusted segment operating margin of 21.1% declined compared with 2021. Margin performance sequentially improved each month through the quarter as COVID 19 related absenteeism and supply chain constraints eased through the quarter. North America operating margins exited the quarter at the top end of our full year margin outlook for North America. Moving slide eight, rest of the world segment sales of $256 million increased 15% year-over-year. Favorable mix from new product introductions in the premium segment of the market, particularly our slim line electric wall hung water heaters and water treatment products that deliver hot and ambient filtered water as well as higher sales of commercial water treatment products and water treatment filters contributed to sales gains. As Kevin noted, sales in the first quarter were positively impacted by proactive measures to distribute product into the market in advance of potential COVID 19 disruptions in China. India continues to perform well and sales grew 36% in the first quarter compared to 2021. We view India as a long term growth opportunity given its attractive growth characteristics and changes in demographics. Rest of the world segment earnings of $25 million increased significantly over segment earnings in the first quarter of 2021. In China, the benefits from favorable events, higher volumes and lower advertising and selling expenses drove rest of the world segment margin to 9.7%. Free cash flow of $4 million during the first quarter decreased from the first quarter of 2021 due to higher 2022 earnings that were more than offset by higher incentive payments due to record 2021 sales and earnings and higher cash outlays for higher levels of safety stock on higher cost inventory. Historically, we generate the majority of our cash in the second half of the year. Our cash balance totaled $579 million at the end of March and our net cash position was $284 million. Our leverage ratio was 14% as measured by total debt to total capital. Our strong and annual free cash flow and solid balance sheet enable us to focus on capital allocation priorities and return cash to shareholders. Earlier this month, our board approved our next quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share, which represents our 82nd consecutive year of dividend payments. We repurchased 1.5 million shares of common stock in the first quarter for a total of $108 million. Let's now turn to Slide 10. In addition to returning capital to shareholders, we see opportunities for organic growth, innovation and new product development across all of our product lines and geographies. We continue to target strategic acquisitions with a focus on water heating and water treating assets that meet our financial metrics of accretive earnings in the first year and return our cost to capital in three years. We have a proven track record of developing innovative new technologies and making prudent and focused acquisitions to drive shareholder value. Please turn to Slide 11 and our 2022 full year earnings guidance and outlook. We reaffirm our 2022 outlook with an expected EPS range of $1.56 to $1.76 per share and our adjusted EPS range of $3.35 to $3.55 per share. Our outlook is based on a number of key assumptions, which include no further significant surges of COVID cases in the US and that COVID related shutdowns in China subside during the second quarter of 2022 and do not significantly impact our operations, our employees, customers or suppliers. Steel indices began to stabilize at the end of 2021 and steel fell briefly early in the first quarter of 2022. However, due to the international uncertainty on commodities availability and prices, in part due to the conflict in Ukraine, steel market prices have risen again in recent weeks. Our guidance assumes that steel pricing in 2022 on an annual basis will approximate steel market pricing as mid-April -- as of mid-April. We continue to see increases in non-materials -- non-steel materials and transportation costs. Supply chain challenges persisted in the first quarter. We remain in close contact with suppliers and logistic providers to troubleshoot, manage and resolve bottlenecks, but the environment remains unpredictable. Our outlook assumes we continue to see the benefit from multiple 2021 price increases compounding to approximately 50% for water heaters and continued resiliency and demand in North America for our water heating product categories, driven by replacement demand and new construction spending. As for other housekeeping assumptions, we expect to generate free cash flow of between $500 million and $525 million. For the year, CapEx should be between $75 million and $80 million, corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $55 million. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be between 23.5% to 24%, and we expect to repurchase approximately $400 million worth of shares of our stock resulting in outstanding diluted shares of $156 million at the end of 2022. Based on these assumptions, the midpoint of our adjusted EPS range represents an increase of 17% compared with 2021. I will now turn the call back over to Kevin who will provide more color on our key markets and top line growth outlook and segment expectations for 2022, all while staying on Slide 11, Kevin? Kevin Wheeler : All right. Thank you, Chuck. We project revenue growth for 2022 of 14% to 16%, which is lower than our outlook in January as a result of volume headwinds in China and a slower starts of commercial water heating. Our sales assumptions include approximately 8% growth in each of the last two years, which well above the historical average growth rate, we estimate US residential water heater industry unit volumes will be down approximately 2% from last year as industry demand normalizes. While the commercial water heater industry demand has started the year slower than expected, our guidance assumes improvement in the remainder of the year as we project the commercial industry volumes will be flat to slightly down compared to last year. We have reduced our sales growth protection in China from 5% growth in local currency to be flat compared to last year, as a result of economic headwinds, we are experiencing from COVID related restrictions. We have increased our North America boiler sales growth projection from 10% to 18% to 20% sales growth, driven by increased pricing in response to higher input costs. Our outlook for North America water treatment sales growth of 13% to 14% for 2022 has not changed. Based on these factors, along with the full impact of our 2021 price increases, we expect our North America segment margin to be between 22.5% and 23% and rest of world segment margins to be approximately 9.5% or 10% or 50 to 100 basis points higher in 2021. Please turn to Slide 12, 2022 continues to present challenges for our global teams and we are meeting them head on. We believe AO Smith is a compelling investment for numerous reasons. We have leading share position in our major product categories. We estimate replacement demand represents approximately 80% to 85% of US water heater and boiler volumes. We have a strong premium brand in China, a broad product offering in key product categories, extensive distribution, and a reputation for quality and innovation. In that region. We have rationalized the cost structure of our China business, streamlined our stores in tier one and tier two cities and strengthened and extended our product offering in both the premium and upper mid-price sectors of the markets we serve. We are well positioned to maximize favorable demographics in China to enhance shareholder value. We continue to be very excited for the opportunity we've see in our North America water treatment business, We have strong cash flow and balance sheet supporting our ability to continue to invest for the long term and automation, innovation and new products, as well as acquisitions and return cash to shareholders. We remain focused on serving on our customers and continuing to meet their needs. Our strong brands across the portfolio, combined with investing in technology to drive innovation and new product development will further enhance our market leadership. We are confident in our ability to capitalize on opportunities as we continue to execute our strategy. With that, we conclude our prepared remarks and we are now available for your questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] And we have our first question from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. You may ask your question. Matt Summerville : First, maybe could you guys comment on what you think the market actually did from a volume standpoint in the US for resi and commercial water heaters in Q1 and how you feel you performed relative to the market given that you guys experienced some COVID absenteeism, etcetera, and I would assume your competitors did as well, but if you could comment on that, that would be helpful and then I have a follow up. Kevin Wheeler : Yeah, Matt, this is Kevin. I'll comment on that. We believe the market is going to be coming in on the residential side around that 2% range plus 2%. Commercial will be down I'm thinking somewhere in the 20% range and there's some reasons for that, that we outlined with regards to a regulatory change. So that's how the market we see coming in the first quarter in the US. How we did, we certainly got our fair share of both those markets. We performed again, we started out the year again with lot of COVID and weather. So as we outlined in our remarks the first month and a half were pretty tough. We had a really strong finish, particularly our residential teams did very well in the back half, particularly in March. So we feel we did well. Maybe a bit better than the market, but overall we certainly got our fair share, both the residential and the commercial business, Matt Summerville : And then just a follow up on China. I think you mentioned sales tracking down 30%, 35% thus far in April. Is your guidance assuming and well, I guess what assumption do you think is most appropriate for us to be thinking about in Q2? Have you seen that 30% to 35% start to improve or is it getting worse? I guess I'm trying to think about how to frame up China, for the second quarter specifically to get to the full year kind of flat. Charles Lauber : Okay. Yeah. Hey Matt, it's Chuck. Yeah, China. So that 35% to 40% down in China, consumer demand, just to kind of frame that, that's April, that's what we're seeing in April, which is sequentially worse than what we saw in the first quarter. The way we think about it is and by the way that sector of what we're measuring here is consumers. So that's about 75% of our business. The commercial side does not fall into that metric. It's more the consumer spend that we're referencing there. Haven't really seen a change to that as we kind of look through the month of April, it's been fairly steady at that rate. In the first quarter, it was down in about to 10% range. So sequentially, it was worse. The way we think about it some pretty heavy lockdowns right now in April. So our assumption or our guidance is that that does subside as we go through the year. That does improve as we get, towards the end of the second quarter and sequentially, maybe the third quarter looks something like the first quarter, as far as consumer demand and then kind of get, gets more back to normal in the fourth quarter. So Q2 will certainly be the lowest quarter of the year for us when you think sequentially and Q4 once again normally is should be the best quarter of the year in China. Matt Summerville : Got it. Thank you guys. Operator : And we have our next question from Scott Graham of Loop Capital Markets. You may ask your question. Scott Graham : Hey good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I can understand some of the puts and takes here on your Slide 11 and essentially if we were to take out the adjustment for the pension, your guidance is just -- it's necessary just a little bit lower, that's just the math. And like, if you had to kind of say, what are the larger swing factors in that? Would you essentially say, China and slower starts of the year in North America? Or how would you frame that for us? Kevin Wheeler : Yeah, Scott, I'd say our guidance, our outlook on the adjusted EPS has not changed. So we're kind of staying tracked right on that. Kind of the puts and takes on that is, certainly we're seeing the headwind in China. So we've got China where we were saying 5% up in local currency being roughly flat and China for the first quarter starts out pretty strong. So first quarter as we mentioned, we were proactively put product into the channel. So that is expected to stay in the channel for the majority of the year, just as kind of protection, make sure product is out there if there were any transportation interruptions. Also discretionary spending in China ran pretty well. They're able to flex a bit better and be a little bit more nimble on spending since the taking some cost out and restructured the business. So we expect that positive SG&A spending to be a lever we can pull going forward. So volume -- on the volume side, it's really largely China offset by a bit of spend that China can do. In North America, when we look at North America, we improved our margins 25 basis points on North America. The way we're thinking about that is we're coming out of the quarter at about that run rate in March when residential production kind of hits a better pace when we've got components we can perform pretty well. So the puts and takes are, we got China, a little bit of headwind on sales. We got a little bit better margin in North America. Our backlog is still strong on the boiler side. Kevin mentioned kind of the boiler condensing product that's out there, larger product, good margin product. We've got a little bit of ground to make on commercial water heating so that should help our mix a bit. So as you kind of go throughout the year, we would expect that to be a bit of a bit of a help compared to Q1. And we talk a lot of -- we've talked a lot in the past and we've noted in our comments, the water heater pricing, but if you take outside of water heaters in North America and think about kind of the pricing on other product categories, we've got to announce price increases, and I'll just make the range 2% to 12% out there that becomes effective as we go through the year that helps a bit on the margin side as we go kind of the back half the quarter. We still see commodity costs high. We got a little relief on steel, but commodity costs made that up and increased. So our outlook, we really hasn't changed much on costs. We expected that to go up in our January outlook and it has so we're still seeing pressure on the cost side. Scott Graham : I got it. And Chuck, my apologies, I am now looking at the quarter ago presentation and that pension adjustment is in there. So guidance doesn\u2019t change. You get it. And thank you for that comprehensive response. That was awesome. Let me ask you a little bit about the supply chain and I know that you're always kind of loathe to comment on price cost, but your wording in North America suggests that you were kind of price cost positive here. And so if you can confirm that grade, and then secondly, you said the supply chain constraints are getting easier in North America. Can, you explain that a little bit? Kevin Wheeler : Let's talk about the supply chain first it's -- as we frame it, it's stable, it has improved. We saw our residential components and so forth improve in the quarter, but and we also see some improvement coming in, in the second quarter, on our commercial, on particular components. So, but overall it's been stable. It does improve, particularly on the material side. Components are still a bit unpredictable. So it's getting better, but, we still wake up every day and still at times we'll have issues that we have to work through, but again, our teams are working very closely with our suppliers. In fact, I think we know our suppliers better than we ever have now in the last couple years. So it is moving forward. We're going to have these sporadic issues we have to deal with. But I think that the key takeaway here is we just don't see any major disruptions and before there's even a follow up question, just want to talk about Ukraine. We have no direct suppliers out of there and we're seeing maybe some transportation issues, a small amount in Europe that we have to deal with. China, I think it's still a little early. We stay very close to China. Of course we have a decent supply that based there, particularly on some of our components, but nothing in the early term here that we see any issues with and may maybe some, some medium bricks down the road, but again, no major disruptions in our supply chain that we can forecast at this time. So getting better and all factories are running well. And that's in China as well, just to follow up on that. And we'll continue to work on some of our backlogs. We have large backlogs and boilers. We have large backlog in commercial water heating. We anticipate that second quarter, we'll be able to make a dent in both of those, and they are certainly upsides for us as we go through the year, as Chuck mentioned Scott Graham : Again, thank you very much for your comprehensive answers. Both of you I'll get back in the queue. Operator : And speakers we have our next question from Susan Maklari of Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Susan Maklari : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Susan Maklari : I guess just staying on commercial for a bit, can you talk a little bit more about the regulatory changes that came through, and I know that you mentioned that you do expect that, that'll incrementally sort of catch up as we move through the next couple quarters. Can you just give some details on the relative changes that you're making there and how to think about some of those details? Kevin Wheeler : Yeah. Thank you for asking that question. I really think you need some explanation. The regulatory change we're talking about was on the greater 55 gallon electric and without getting into the details the change raise the KW Wattage and requires a different skew. What happened though, our industry really did anticipate that going into effect. We were anticipating the old regulatory to be carried over and extended into the first part of this year. It wasn't. From our point of view, it caught the industry a bit flat footed, not so much on the manufacturing side because we were all prepared. But I think from just understanding the regulatory change on the distribution side. So if you look at it, we had to get out there and kind of update our customers of what the new SKUs would be and so forth. So we saw January very slow. Where we were working through the regulatory change being implemented in getting to our customers. We saw February improve and then when I can just speak from our point of view, March our run rate on greater than 55 gallon commercial which basically our run rate from prior year. So we look at this as kind of a temporary kind of a gap if you will, that will close itself and more normalize as we get through the year. So it was just a situation where the industry had to kind of recover, but the fundamentals of the category, the fundamentals of the business are still there. That's why we're looking in the balance a year for that to stabilize and normalize. So that's a quick snapshot of what happened in that regulatory environment. Susan Maklari : Yeah, no, that's very helpful. I appreciate all that color. And then I guess on the residential side with the water heaters, appreciating that this is a bit further removed from you, but any commentary on inventories in the channel and just where those kind of sit given all the moving parts that the industry and yourselves obviously faced in the first quarter? Kevin Wheeler : We don't have great view into the inventories and the channel. So what I'm going to tell you is anecdotal industry experience that type of thing. On the commercial side, we believe the inventory is still a bit light in the channel. And that's indicated by our backlogs and just the activity that we're seeing there. So inventory commercially a bit light. We hope to make that up as we improve our production in the upcoming months and quarters. And I'll just probably add on residential. We probably think is about where it needs to be. It may be even a bit heavy because I think people are hedging themselves. Customers are hedging themselves in case any further disruption. So that's our view. Again, residential probably where it needs to be little heavy commercials, still some room. We take care of some production needs and get some products back and do our customers inventories. Susan Maklari : Okay, great. Thank you. And good luck with everything. Operator : And our next question from Nathan Jones of Stifel. You may ask your question. Nathan Jones : Good morning, everyone Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Nathan Jones : I'll just -- I'll start off following up on the residential inventory there. Noted that it's might be a bit heavy with safety stock. I think that's going to be one of the questions as we, not just for your business, but for a lot of businesses as we go forward, is, are customers holding safety stock and are they going to continue to hold that safety stock more permanently or will it normalize you as customers have more confidence in their supply chains, just interested to hear your opinion on that and what you're thinking about the potential inventory levels more, been a long time at your customers. Kevin Wheeler : Well, as I mentioned, what I would agree with what you just said, quite frankly, I think as lead types come down and things normalize now, when that is, I'm not going to predict, but right now, yeah, there could be some but again, lead times are going to have to come down. First things are got to be a lot more stable. I don't think it's heavy stock out there, safety stock that we think, but it is a bit higher than maybe normal. But my view, I probably most distributors from my talk to will probably be a bit conservative in making sure they're going to lean in on having product and inventory to service their customers considering the last, year or so that what they've gone through, what we've gone through. So that's our view. Again, we can't predict what's going to happen six, 12 months from now, but that's where we're at today. Nathan Jones : Thanks for that. Maybe I could just ask, where are your lead times today? Where were they last year or late 2020 when they were at their highest and what were they normally before COVID? Kevin Wheeler : Are you talking north America or US right now? Yeah. Nathan Jones : Yeah. North America residential water heaters primarily. Kevin Wheeler : Lead times today are about 20 days that are our goal and what historically we've targeted is 15 days and you look out back in the tougher times there are probably 2X or more, and we've just been able to bring those down ramp up production again, as materials and components were became more available. On the commercial side and we target really the same type of lead times. Right now our commercial lead times are elevated at least 2X to 3X. Nathan Jones : That's a great call for me. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Operator : And our next question from Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup. You may ask your question. Andy Kaplowitz : Maybe just talk a little bit more on China. Can you give us an update into inventories in the channel? I know you said you put product in the channel. So, how are you thinking about the channel itself given it was sort of coming off five year lows and maybe a little more color around your ability to drive self-help in China with new products, growing into those tier three to tier six cities. I think you mentioned SG&A cost out, how much could all that other stuff sort of help you as you go through this uncertain period? Kevin Wheeler : Yeah, so a channel inventory in China. So most of the sales increase for the quarter was putting channel into the inventory or putting inventory into the channel. The level at the end of Q1 is about a month and a half. That's not really outta line compared to it was certainly higher than your end, which was at kind of a five-year low. Felt it was prudent to do that. Make sure we had channel inventory available in case there was transportation interruption. So the way we're thinking about that in our outlook for the year is that, most of that inventory will stay in the channel. We're not really bringing it back down kind of the low level it was is we exited 2021. So we expected to stay there just due to the uncertainty in COVID potential interruption, even though our outlook projects it'll subside a bit as we go through the rest of the year. Kind of the levers and SG&A and the amount in the first quarter of SG&A discretionary spend that was mitigated, I guess, is in that $3 million to $4 million. So we've taken out a large number of stores in tier one and tier two over a 1,000 last year and that reduces the cost, makes those store more efficient gives us a little more flexibility on how we spend SG&A. So those are kind of the inventory levels the SG&A side, The progress on tier three through six cities, tier four through six cities is on track. We continue to the very low cost model, continue to have, think of those again, more counter space, then they are storefronts in the tier one and tier two cities. But largely on track, continue to add to those cities. Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciate the color. And then maybe just a little more color to the strength you're seeing in terms of your North American boiler business. Obviously you increased guidance there, but how much of the improved outlook is your customers really focusing on these commercial condensing boilers, given their energy efficiency focus in a higher natural gas price environment and could you see further inflation as gas prices stay high, Kevin Wheeler : Well, again, this will be anecdotal again. We don't have any great data there, but it just would be natural as energy costs have gone up and a movement for decarbonization and reducing your footprint that plays really well into our condensing boilers. So we feel there has to be some impact to that. Certainly the return on investment now on our condensing boilers today versus they were just months ago or significantly better. So it's playing a role and I think we see that because of just the order rate that we have on our condensing boilers coming in. Our backlog has been high continues to be high, we're shipping, doing quite well, that's why we raised the guidance. Activity in the institutional side activity in the hospitality side, even still activity in the education side is good and our quoting continues to be good. So overall, I think there's one, the market is maybe making up for lost time in the last couple years of COVID. But I do think there is a swing towards condensing high inefficient products for again, paybacks, but just is much for decarbonization, Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciate the color. Operator : And speakers our next question from the Damian Karas of UBS. You may ask your question. Damian Karas : Hi, good morning, everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Morning, morning Damian Karas : Wanted to ask you about pricing, based on guidance, it doesn't seem like you've taken any further price actions since 2021. But you did mention some of the ongoing freight and other supply chain issues. So just wondering if there's, anything else that you have executed or anything on the pricing front that is being planned at the moment? Kevin Wheeler : Yeah, let me kind of frame our outlook on pricing or the way we were thinking about it. Back in January, we projected that kind of our other material costs would continue to go up and they have. So, our assumptions going out in January were that they would, and we really have seen that play out on the other material costs. So when we speak of that, that's kind of baked in already, and it hasn't changed our outlook much, although we continue to see the pressure on the other material cost freights and logistics. And the second part of that again, I'm sorry, is that, does that answer your question or was there a second piece? Damian Karas : Yeah, basically just was trying to get a sense if there's any pricing\u2026 Kevin Wheeler : Oh yeah, yeah. We did have other pricing. So, when you just kind of park water heaters for a second and look at the rest of our businesses in North America. So water treatment, boilers, we've got range of price increases on different products and it's pretty broad range, but in that 2% to 12% price increases that we've announced beyond 2021 that are just coming into effect and will be effective in the back half of the year and it was needed for those other material costs going up. So some of those pricings actions we'll see as we go through the rest of the year. Damian Karas : Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then, could you maybe just elaborate on the weather impacts that you spoke of maybe quantify that, and I don't know, it just seems like these adverse weather events are a normal part of the business, thinking about the various floods and tornadoes, other things that have happened over the last few years, but maybe you could just speak to what you experienced. Kevin Wheeler : Yeah. I'll touch on that. Wasn't any pleasant tornadoes, but it really comes down to the cold weather, snow, freezing rain and it just impacted our plants and particularly Tennessee and again, if you look at it, you take a couple, three or four days off because of that, that it says has a productivity issue for us the one forward. So that's part of it. We had that happen in Q1 of 2021. It just seemed to spill over into 2022. We managed through that and really, I would tell you the quarter, the real impact we had from a plant standpoint was we had COVID and we mentioned that in our January call, we had absenteeism in our factories about 7% in COVID and that again is significant amount of people that we had to overcome and then again, as we got through January, people started to recover, get back to work after, through February, we got back on track. So weather it's part of it, but I would tell you COVID was probably the bigger part. Damian Karas : Understood. Thanks for the color. Best of luck. Kevin Wheeler : Thank you. Operator : And our next question from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. You may ask your question. David MacGregor : Yes. Good morning, everyone. I guess I just want to go back and maybe try and create a little more clarity around the pricing. You had talked about 50% price increase in 2021. Can you just remind us what the carryover price is? I realized there's been some additional pricing initiatives in 2022, but just how much of that 2021 50% carried over into 2022. Kevin Wheeler : Yeah. It's roughly half on the water heating side. David MacGregor : Okay. You get the benefit of that just to be, I'm sorry, go ahead. Kevin Wheeler : Yeah, I guess it's 50 50, David MacGregor : Right. And you get the benefit of that, just to be clear, you get the benefit of that from the beginning of the calendar year through the year. Kevin Wheeler : It's largely in the beginning of the calendar year. Yeah. It was -- the last one was announced effective November 15, 2021. So with lead times, it may be a little spill over into January for the most part, it's running pretty much effective. David MacGregor : Okay, good. Thank you for that. And then just on the North American operating margins, the 21/1, how much of the 200 basis point decline was due to the lower commercial volumes? Charles Lauber : About for Q1 it's about 50 basis points. So, we kind of look at Q1 50 basis points on commercial water heating. It's about 50 basis points on Giant, as we recall in the past Giants, largely residential product and so that's a little bit lower margin. So when you add that brought down a bit. David MacGregor : There's a hundred basis points between the two. Thank you very much. Great. Thank you. Operator : [Operator instructions] And we have our next question from Jeff Hammond of Keybanc. You may ask your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hey guys, this is Mitch [ph] for Jeff. I was just -- I was just wondering if you could walk us through your current expectations of margin cadence through the year, given all the moving pieces and if you still have your expectation of one quarter being the trough for margins in 2022. Thanks. Kevin Wheeler : Well, 2022, and this is split it, rest of the world separately from North America and kind of mentioned earlier, China, Q2 is going to be we believe in our outlook, the toughest quarter because of kind of where we're starting out in April. So I would say kind of cadence would be China would be a bit challenge in Q2 kind of start to normalize in or really largely normalize in Q3 and then Q4 be the best quarter. North America, if you think about kind of North America, we've got steel in the first quarter, just to remind everybody steel is, was highest in the first quarter that we see throughout the outlook. So a bit of the margin pressure on that 21.1% in North America is little higher steel. That kind of rolls off slightly as we go into the next quarters but as I was mentioning, other commodity costs and other costs sort of fill that gap but margins for the back half of the year, sequentially, Q3 and Q4 are a little bit stronger and that's typically where we have kind of the strength in our boiler business. The back half of the year, we kind of see the cadence of the year playing out fairly normal for the boiler side of the business being kind of Q3, Q4 being a little stronger than the first half. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just on supply chain, I was wondering if you could give us some color on, you areas where you're seeing supply chain get better, and if there's any differences commercial versus residential and NA versus the rest of the world? Thanks. Kevin Wheeler : Yeah, right now we see our supply chain on the residential side improving and that's really on the material side of it and commercially, we expect Q2 to improve. We do have some really nice line of sight right now into some of the components that have been -- are causing us some production issues. And they look like to be that they'll be resolved, least in Q2 as we go forward. So, overall again, I step back on our supply chain, it is unpredictable, but our teams managed it really well and reaching out to the organizations and the companies that deliver to us and then even our suppliers stepping up and doing the things they have. So we're getting better because our suppliers are getting better. Again, we'll work through some of the Ukraine issues and so forth that we talked about. But overall, I don't see supply chain being an issue for our business as we go forward particularly the second quarter on just by kind of the view that I've had from our procurement and supply chain group. We've managed through most of those challenges and again, anything's unpredictable what we can you change, but we feel pretty good at where we're at. We don't see any of the supply chain issues disrupting our production or causing any issues throughout the year. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. Thanks for taking the questions. Operator : And speakers, there are no more questions on queue. You may proceed. Helen Gurholt : Thank you, Catherine and thank you all for joining us today. Let me conclude by reminding you that our global A.O. Smith team delivered strong sales and earnings in the first quarter despite many challenges. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the quarters to come. In addition, please mark your calendars to join our presentations at six conferences in the second quarter, Oppenheimer on May 4, Goldman Sachs on May 10, Keybanc on June 1, Loop Capital on June 2, William Blair on June 7 and UBS on June 8. Thank you and enjoy the rest of your day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Helen Gurholt. Ma'am, please go ahead. Helen Gurholt : Good morning and welcome to the A.O. Smith second quarter conference call. I'm Helen Gurholt, Vice President, Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis. Joining me today are Kevin Wheeler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer. In order to provide improved transparency in the operating results for our business, we provided non-GAAP measures. Free cash flow is defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures. Adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted segment earnings and adjusted corporate expenses exclude the impact on non-operating, non-cash pension income and expenses. Reconciliation from GAAP measures to non-GAAP are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and on our website. A friendly reminder that some of our comments and answers during this conference call will be forward-looking statements that are subject to risk that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include matters that we described in this morning's press release, among others. Also as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow up for return. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. We will be using slides as we move through today's call. You can access them on our website@investor.aosmith.com. I will now turn the call over to Kevin to begin our prepared remarks. Please turn to the next slide. Kevin Wheeler : Thank you. Helen. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'm on slide 4 and our second quarter results. Our team performed well throughout the quarter despite an uncertain macro environment to deliver strong sales and EPS performance. Second quarter sales improved 12% year-over-year driven by our 2021 equation related pricing actions. The acquisition of Giant Factories late last year as well as Water Treatment Boiler and Commercial Water Heater volume growth in North America. Our Rest of World segment performance decreased 30% year-over-year, driven by COVID-19 related lockdowns in China. However, we experienced sequential sales improvement in China through the quarter as restrictions began to ease. The acquisition of Giant Factories added $31 million to quarterly sales and $0.01 to EPS. We are pleased with the performance of the team and our integration is on track. We saw quarter-over-quarter improvement in our supply chain in the second quarter was led to higher boiler and commercial water heater volumes. Please turn to slide 5. Our global A. O. Smith team delivered second quarter of 2022 adjusted EPS of $0.82, a 14% increase that was driven in part by 12% increase in sales, compared with the second quarter of 2021. Our strong second quarter performance resulted from our team's outstanding execution. Despite the backdrop of an uncertain macro environment, COVID-19 related lockdowns in China and softness in the residential water heater industry. I am proud of how my A. O. Smith colleagues work together to overcome many challenges to deliver value to our customers across the globe. Excluding the impact of Giant, North America Water Heater sales grew 19% in the second quarter of 2022 due to pricing actions implemented in 2021, and response to rising material and logistics. Lower sales of residential water heaters partially offset sales growth in the quarter. The residential industry saw record orders in the second quarter of 2021, creating a difficult comparison for 2022. With that said, we saw order rate softness as we exited the second quarter and into July as customers\u2019 right size their inventories. We saw quarter-over-quarter improvement in our commercial gas water heater shipments, as supply chain constraints eased in the second quarter, as well as our sales of commercial electric water heaters greater than 55 gallons as order rates normalized after the regulatory change impacted orders at the beginning of the year. Our North America Boiler sales grew 27% in the quarter driven by pricing increases to offset higher material and transportation costs and strong demand. We again ended the quarter with a significant backlog largely composed of commercial condensing boilers. And we continue to see stable order rates for these market leading energy efficient products. Our strategy to focus on innovation and decarbonization contributed to strong demand for our high efficiency condensing boilers. North American Water Treatment sales grew 19% in the second quarter as our independent water quality dealers continue to outperform the market and gain share. We also benefited from strong demand in the wholesale channel. In China, sales decreased 40% in local currency, compared to the second quarter of 2021, primarily due to the expected impacts of COVID-19 related lockdown. Our sales improved sequentially through the quarter as lockdowns lessen and consumer demand improved. The steps that our China team have undertaken to right size the business and manage discretionary spend paid dividends this quarter, as China held its operating margins flat to last year despite lower sales in the quarter. The first half of July, we saw consumer demand down approximately 5% to 10% Compared to last year, a sequential improvement from second quarter consumer demand levels. Please turn to slide 6. As I mentioned on our January call, one of our key strategic priorities in 2022 is to expand our water treatment business through innovation, new product development and strategic acquisitions. In May, we launched our redesigned Aquasana Clean Water machine. The first power countertop water filter to combine a sleek compact no install design with four different methods of advanced filtration technology. The new clean water machine is tested and certified to NSF standards for the removal of up to 99.9% of 77 contaminants including lead, the forever chemicals, such as PFAS and many more. Aquasana is patented Claryum filtration ensures industry leading contaminant removal while we retaining the beneficial and naturally occurring minerals in water such as calcium, magnesium, and potassium for optimal hydration. In addition, we welcome Atlantic Filter Corporation to the A. O. Smith family last month. Atlantic Filter is the fifth acquisition we've made in the North America water treatment market since 2016. With a strong presence in Southern Florida, Atlantic Filter will expand our capabilities in this key area of the market. I'll now turn the call over to Chuck who will provide more details on our second quarter performance. Chuck Lauber : Thank you, Kevin and good morning everyone. I'm on slide 7, second quarter sales in the North America segment rose to $744 million, a 23% increase compared with 2021. Pricing actions largely on water heaters represented approximately 89% of the increase. Sales in the quarter also benefited from higher volumes of water treatment products, boilers and commercial water heaters. That more than offset -- that was more than offset by lower volumes of residential water heaters. Giant acquired in October 2021, added $31 million to North America sales. North America\u2019s adjusted segment earnings of $163 million increased 17% compared with the same period in 2021. The earnings benefit of inflation related price increases was partially offset by higher material and freight cost and lower residential water heater volumes. Adjusted segment operating margin of 21.8% decline compared with the 2021 primarily due to higher material and logistic costs, plants in production and efficiencies and the inclusion of Giant which has lower margins than our legacy water heater business. Moving to slide 8, rest of the world segment sales of $230 million decreased 13% year-over-year, lower sales volumes primarily driven by consumer demand headwinds in China related to COVID-19 related restrictions. Currency translation of China's sales unfavorably impacted sales by approximately $5 million. Sales in India grew 79% in the second quarter of 2022 on strong demand compared to last year, which was negatively impacted by the pandemic. We view India as a long-term growth opportunity given its attractive growth characteristics and changes in demographics. Rest of the World segment earnings of $18 million decreased 18% compared to segment earnings in the second quarter of 2021. In China, the impact of lower volumes was partially offset by lower selling, advertising and engineering expenses. Rest of the World segment margin was 7.9%, down 60 basis points from the same period last year. Free cash flow of $24 million during the first half of 2022 decreased from the first half of 2021 due to higher 2022 earnings that were more than offset by lower customer deposits in China, higher incentive payments due to record 2021 sales and earnings and greater cash outlays for increased levels of safety stock and higher costs inventory. Historically, we generate the majority of our cash in the second half of the year. Our cash balance totaled $459 million at the end of June and our net cash position was $161 million. Our leverage ratio was 14% as measured by total debt to total capital. Our strong annual free cash flow and solid balance sheet allow us to continue to focus on capital allocation priorities and returning cash to shareholders. Earlier this month, our Board approved our next quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share. We repurchased 2.9 million shares of common stock in the first half of 2022 for a total of $190 million. So I'll turn to slide 10. In addition to returning capital to shareholders, we see opportunities for organic growth, innovation, and new product development across all of our product lines and geographies. The strength of our balance sheet allows us to pursue strategic acquisitions even in the event of an economic downturn. We remain focused on identifying water heating and water treating assets that meet our financial metrics, such as the recent acquisitions of Atlantic Filter and Giant Factories. Additionally, the strength of our balance sheet allows us to maintain a strong track record of delivering returns to shareholders. This has been done through both our dividends that we have increased for 30 consecutive years, as well as share repurchases that have totaling more than $550 million since 2021. Please turn to slide 11, and our 2022 full year earnings guidance and outlook. We reaffirm our 2022 outlook with an expected EPS range of $1.56 to $1.76 per share, and our adjusted EPS range of $3.35 to $3.55 per share. Our outlook is based on a number of key assumptions, including no further significant surges of COVID-19 cases in the US, and that COVID-19 related restrictions in China remain approximately at the level they are today and do not significantly impact our operations or our employees, customers or suppliers. Steel indices began to stabilize at the end of 2021 and have moderated towards the end of the second quarter. Our guidance assumes that the average steel price in the second half of 2022 will approximate the average steel prices in the second half of 2021. We continue to see elevated materials and transportation costs. We saw improvement in our supply chain in the second quarter, however, challenges still persist. We remain in close contact with suppliers and logistic providers to troubleshoot, manage and resolve bottlenecks. But the environment remains unpredictable. We continue to see the benefit from multiple 2021 price increases compounded to approximately 50% for water heaters. We expect to generate free cash flow of approximately $450 million to $500 million. The range assumes that our inventories returned to year end 2021 levels. For the year CaPex is expected to be approximately $80 million. Corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $55 million. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be between 23.5% to 24%. And we expect to repurchase approximately $400 million of shares of our stock resulting in outstanding diluted shares of 156 million at the end of 2022. Based on these assumptions, the midpoint of our adjusted EPS range remains an increase of 17% compared to 2021. I'll now turn the call back to Kevin who will provide more color on our key markets and our top line growth outlook and segment expectations for 2022, all those things on slide 11. Kevin? Kevin Wheeler : Thank you, Chuck. We project revenue growth for 2022 of 12% to 14%, which is lower than our outlook in April as a result of softening demand in residential and commercial water heating. Our sales assumptions include after approximately 8% growth in each of the last two years, which is well above the historical average growth rate. We estimate US residential water heater industry unit volumes will be down approximately 4% to 6% from last year as industry demand normalizes. We project that commercial gas water heater industry shipments will be flat to slightly down for the year. However, we revised our full year outlook for the commercial water heater industry to be down 7% to 9% primarily due to weakness in the large electric grid greater than 55 gallons. The commercial industry started the year weaker than expected primarily due to a regulatory change that temporarily impacted orders in that product category. COVID-19 related restrictions paid out as we expected in the quarter. Therefore, we maintain our sales projection in China to be flat in local currency compared to last year. As a result of the economic headwinds we are experiencing from COVID related restrictions. Due our strong backlog and stable order rates, we have increased our full year boiler sales growth projection from 18% to 20% to 25% sales growth, driven by increased pricing in response to higher input costs and higher demand for our energy efficient products. We project North America Water Treatment sales growth, inclusive of acquisitions to be approximately 50% in 2022 due to strong water quality dealer performance. Based on these factors, along with the full impact of our 2021 price increases, we expect our North America segment margin to be between 22.5% and 23%. And Rest of World segment margin is to be approximately 9.5% to 10% or 50 or 100 basis points higher than 2021. Please turn to slide 12. \u201922 continues to present challenges that our global teams are meeting head on. We are 148 year old company that has continued to grow and innovate through all economic cycles. We believe A. O. Smith is a compelling investment because of our stable replacement business. Combined with exciting growth opportunities in North America Water Treatment business, as well as in China and India. We have premium brands and leading share positions in our major product categories. We estimate replacement demand represents 80% to 85% of US water heater and boiler volumes. The strength of our balance sheet and free cash flow generation support our ability to continue investing for the long term and automation, innovation, new products and acquisitions, as well as returning cash to shareholders, even in times of economic uncertainty. As we have demonstrated throughout our long history, we're able to be successful in all economic cycles. We are focused on meeting the needs of our customers. Our portfolio of strong brands, combined with the investing in technology to drive innovation and new product development, further enhance our market leadership. I'm confident our ability to navigate the complex macro environment and capitalize on opportunities while continuing to execute our strategic objectives. With that we include our prepared remarks and we are now available for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Baird. Mike Halloran : Hey, good morning, everyone. Couple questions here. First, on the China side, the margins and I think the demand proven relatively resilient, versus the magnitude of the lockdowns, maybe just a little under the hood, how you think about the inventory levels there? How that track through the quarter, how you position in the back half of the year? And then just to comment on the capacity side, and the resiliency, the incremental space? Chuck Lauber : Sure. Good morning, Mike. This is Chuck. Yes, we're really pleased now China perform for the quarter. We, on our last call talked a little bit about consumer demand being down 35% to 40%, in April, and as you recall that was really the hardest and the severe lockdowns in Shanghai and Beijing. But what we saw in consumer demand for the course of the quarter was consumer demand and it was down about 20%. First quarter was down around 10%. So second quarter average are down around 20%. And as we came out of the second quarter, and what we're seeing in July is we're down about 5% to 10%. So the consumer demand went through pretty well to kind of back to the first quarter. So we're -- then our assumption and guidance is that it stays at that level, kind of for the rest of the year. Inventories, they're flat to down a little bit in the channel, from the first quarter to the second quarter. So they are in a really good position. There's about three to four weeks in the inventory -- in the channel. And that's pretty normal for us, it's at a decently low point. And I'd say we're pleased with 9% in operating margins for the quarter on that lower volume. Some of that was helped by discretionary spending, as we mentioned, that's probably $3 million or so of help on discretionary spending. I'm talking about promotions, advertising, and very little travel for the quarter, as you can imagine in the lockdown situation. And we would expect through the second quarter or third quarters, similar ability to kind of demonstrate this controlling discretionary spending, probably back to spending in the fourth quarter. As that's our largest typical quarter in China. And probably, our projection is to turn that back on. And we would hope for a strong fourth quarter similar to last year. Mike Halloran : Great, super helpful. And then Kevin, I think you were talking about the last couple years being awfully strong in the North America, residential water heater side. And it makes a lot of sense that the volume side is down for this year against your comparison. What's the house view on what that run rates going to look like from an industry perspective? We're running high 9 million-ish kind of units right now. Do you guys have a sense from an industry perspective on where that settles in from a downside? And what that might look like? Kevin Wheeler : Well, I think, as we talked about where we're forecasting the 4% to 6% downturn, and we truly believe, and we saw quite a bit of that in June, where we saw many of our customers can bring in inventories down. And, again, as we go forward, this year we look at it's starting to normalize beginning into August, September and the rest of the year. Where it goes forward, I think it's going to depend upon some new construction, but it's slowed down, but we think is going to come back. And but it is going to normalize somewhere down towards the lower level of that 9 million I think over time. It's just a matter of working through kind of some of the inventories and some of the economic disruptions that we're going through today. But still, you look at it still going to be 80%, 85% replacement emergency is going to be very resilient. And there's always going to be potential upside on the new construction if we can kind of get through this supply chain interest rate issue that we're kind of navigating through today as a country. Chuck Lauber : Yes, just a little more color on the tough comp, right. So that Q2 shipments last year were and I think Kevin mentioned on the call record, but that's inclusive of 2006. So really strong 2021 Q2. Operator : And our next question comes line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Nathan Jones : Good morning, everyone. Maybe just following up on Mike's question on the resi heated business in North America and related to the channel inventories, and you talked about customers taking their inventory down. Do you think that inventory is corrected? How long do you think it takes to correct? Kevin Wheeler : Well, I think it's in the correction right now. Certainly, we believe there was a big correction in June. We're seeing some of it in July. And you step back right now you look at overall in the industry, production has improved, lead times are down. So it's becoming a much more predictable environment. And so with that, I think all of our customers are going to reevaluate. I still think it'll take part of July and maybe a little bit of August, and then kind of normalize as we go through the balance of the year. Chuck Lauber : Yes, just quantifying the lead times too because we came into the year at 25 day lead times, and we're pretty much on the residential side back to normal 15 day lead time. So kind of progression through the quarter, we went from 25 to 20, in Q1, and then at the end of Q2, two were at 15 day range. So those normalizations have happened in the first half of the year. Nathan Jones : Make sense. People would need less inventory under those circumstances. I guess my follow up question is going to be around steel prices and how that could impact the pricing on your products overall. Prices on water heaters are up a lot. They needed to be because steel was up a lot. Cold rolls and hot roll that down probably about 50% from peak prices now. Can you talk about your expectations for how price goes from here, obviously, it'll go on a lag that should be accretive to margins, just any comments you can have on how you're expecting that to go. If steel prices kind of stable from where they are now. Chuck Lauber : Yes, I mean just a little background color on this steel pricing, because, yes, you're right, your reference of kind of the peak to where they've gone is a pretty big Delta on steel pricing, but kind of the mechanics of what we see. And what we see in cost is not necessarily the peak, it's kind of a weekly average, monthly average, quarterly average that we see 90 to 100 days later. So we're never really at the peak, we're probably never really at the trough. So those are a bit muted from kind of the highlights top and bottom end. And then we see that 90 to 120 day lag. So Q1, we had our highest cost, some of the improvement we saw in Q2 was the result of this little improved steel cost, steel pricing. And we do expect that to, as you noted, we've seen indexes come down, we pretty much know what steel will be for Q3 and we projected in Q4 it will be down a bit too, so we do expect to see some benefit on the steel pricing. It's a little muted from those peaks and troughs, and comes a little delayed. And as far as pricing, we always consider the competitive nature in the marketplace and kind of look at abate in some pressure, not just for steel for other costs. And I'll just say kind of the other cost we're experiencing have been pretty resilient, pretty stable, that are still out there, including freight, logistics and delay. Operator : And our next question comes from a line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Andy Kaplowitz : Quite significantly, from flat down to down 7% and 9%. I think you said last quarter that you are seeing your order volume improvised. Kevin Wheeler : Hey, Andrew. Andy Kaplowitz : Yes. Can you hear me, okay? Kevin Wheeler : No. You were you were muted for a while. So could you start over, please? Andy Kaplowitz : Yes, I have no problem. Kevin Wheeler : Sorry about that. Andy Kaplowitz : Yes, no problem. So you change your outlook for commercial water heater volumes. You are down 7% to 9%, as you said and I think you said last quarter that you were seeing your order volume stabilize after the early regulatory change. So can you give us more color into why the changing guidance? Are you seeing more of a significant change in customer demand there? Or is it just a slow start to the year. Maybe destock there, anymore color will be helpful. Kevin Wheeler : Yes, I'll take that. As we mentioned, we still think commercial gas is going to be flat to slightly down. So that's moving along. But the regulatory change that we experienced in the first quarter, we're seeing our orders normalize. But as we go forward, we believe of the 7% and 9% that we have forecasted being down almost 90% positive, it's going to be in that light service, commercial electric, we just don't see the industry rebounding from a slow start in a quarter. So that's the backdrop of why we're going down, the rest of the commercial businesses quite strong and doing well. And maybe just kind of a reference point that the light service goes into homes and really kind of small businesses. And when you look at our commercial overall business, there's about a 4x or 5x to our commercial overall business, excluding the light service when it comes to price. So it's on the lower end of our pricing curve, but it does drive volume. And we just see now with better visibility, that we need to bring the industry down from a unit standpoint, but feel pretty good about our commercial gas and condensing gas and where that's going. Andy Kaplowitz : Got it. That's helpful. And then Kevin or Chuck, maybe just I want to understand the puts and takes, overall, you maintain your EPS guidance, but you did lower your revenue forecast a little bit, maintain margins in North America, China looks pretty good versus expectations. So what are the puts and takes here? Is it -- what's the positives that you're seeing? Is it price versus cost that is the major offset to the lower volumes, any help there? Chuck Lauber : Yes, I'll start out and Kevin may add on a little bit after that, but I mean, the puts and takes. It\u2019s price versus costa and it's what we are seeing a bit of softening on the steel pricing. So we're getting a little bit of help there. But it's not just the water heating side, it's also pricing that we're going to have implemented in the fourth quarter on both the boiler side of the business and water treatment side of the business. So we've got some second quarter announced price increases that are in the market that should help us a bit in the back half with the margins. Also we had a bit of destabilization during the quarter of water rates on the residential side. And we expect that the plants probably will run a little bit smoother during the back half of the year, during the quarter, our water rates on the residential side, and we expect that the plants probably will run a little bit smoother during the back half of the year. So we would expect a little bit of help there. And then there's a bit of mix opportunity, right, so residential is down in the quarter and residential, we see for the year down 4% to 6%. But as Kevin mentioned, we still feel good about commercial, particularly gas commercial product being strong for the back half of the year. And then boilers and our backlog for boilers is still pretty resilient. And we expect and it's typical that the boilers are strongest in our boiler business is strongest volume in the third quarter. So we would help on the -- we expect help on the mix side also. Kevin Wheeler : Yes, the only thing I might add is even though China has gone through some COVID related lockdowns. We've seen our new products do well. We've seen trade up continue to grow. It's growing for the last couple of years. So we have some positive mix issues here. It's not only in North America, but also we see that also in China. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Matt Summerville : Thanks. A couple questions. First on China. If you gave this I apologize. But what is your best estimate on the revenue impact you experienced in the second quarter from the lockdowns? And wherein did you see any sort of difference in out the door demand for water heaters versus water treatment in China? And then I have a follow up. Chuck Lauber : Yes, I mean, it's hard to call out exactly what's COVID and what's the overall economy in China. So it's really hard to parse that but clearly, we were impacted negatively by COVID. And consumer demand out the door was down about 20%. So that was kind of out the door demand. I would say just kind of within our product categories, certainly the residential products were challenged most so I would say, electric water heaters and water treatment were probably the most challenge during the quarter, commercial water heating, commercial water treatment, the commercial side that's not sold through retail, kind of offset some of that 20% down which viewed as the number for overall sales volume. Matt Summerville : Got it and then just with respect to the boiler backlog, can you guys maybe put a finer point on that? How does that compare to prior peaks prior cycles? And can you maybe talk about the magnitude of pricing you're looking for in boilers in treatment to what you just mentioned, a couple of moments ago in the back half. Thank you. Kevin Wheeler : Yes, I'll take the magnitude and maybe Chuck, you can jump in on any of the pricing side of it. Certainly, we haven't seen this type of backlog, we're in the three to four month range, to be honest with you. And it's mainly commercial. So what's important to know here in our backlog is we actually have shift days for the vast majority of all our orders in house. So there may be a put and take that we see where a job gets pulled in, maybe gets kicked out a little bit. But overall, we see nothing that would cause a material change, the backlog is the -- market remains very active, the jobs continue to move forward. Again, labor gets in the way a little bit. But overall, we have a lot of comfort in our backlog and primarily that it's mostly commercial condensing products, which are the heart of our business. Chuck Lauber : And on the pricing side, and on the water treatment side, going forward, in both for the boiler side and water treatment side, kind of expect to see it come in end of third quarter and in the fourth quarter, but water treatment kind of mid-single digits to 10% price increases depending on product category, similar for the boiler products in that 8% to 12% depending upon product category. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David MacGregor : Good morning. I wanted to just explore further around the residential water heater business. And maybe some of the weaknesses you've seen there and I kind of think about that market is maybe at the risk of oversimplifying this a little bit as the consisting of three buckets. You've got the construction, the replacement demand, and then of course, just changes in the channel inventory. It sounds like the channel inventory is fairly transitory. And you expect that, as you pointed out by August, you can see that kind of normalizing. New construction, I guess watch completions. And I'll give us a good sense of water heater consumption there. But let me just speak to replacement demand and what you're seeing there, and maybe not to be overly skeptical here. But to the extent you think you may have lost some share in replacement demand this quarter, what gives you confidence that your share position remains strong? Thank you. Kevin Wheeler : Yes, okay. When we talked about replacement demand, there's two components of it, you have kind of the proactive replacement, and then you have the emergency replacement. The proactive side, which is renovation, probably driven by kind of remote work had been pretty strong, we saw that, it's coming down a little bit, we test that every quarter and have a good read on that. As far as the overall emergency replacement that will always remain resilient. I mean, people just don't go without hot water for any length of time. So yes, the residential visit has those components. Again, I just want to remind people that 50% of our business is that new construction. So even if it drops a little bit, it's pretty nominal for us. And but it's nice upside and as we go forward. But that's how it plays out. And we feel pretty comfortable with our 4% to 6%. And again, as I mentioned the, I think a lot of the channel inventory adjustments would come out in June and July and a little bit of August. From a shared perspective, we have really good data on that. We talked about this last year and into the quarter that we were a little bit behind. We really expected, I expected that it would normalize as production came up and lead times came down. And that's actually playing out really well on the residential side. I will tell you, we're slightly up moving towards our normal historic market shares. And I'll just throw in commercial, we're already back to our normal rates. David MacGregor : Good to hear. Thank you for that. And just as a follow up, I guess everyone's concerned right now about the slowing macro. And so I'm thinking about sort of where the strength lies in your businesses, it seems to be in the boiler businesses, it has always been sort of one of the stronger elements in the model. How cyclical is that business? How should we be thinking about kind of if 2023 is a soft year and we see pervasive weakness across the market? How stable should that business be? Chuck Lauber : Yes, it's historic, well, we expect it to be pretty stable. I mean, the replacement component of that business is very similar to the water heater side, and that 80% to 85%. So the replacement piece continues to be resilient. Usually the commercial side would typically lag the residential side, you've got projects in progress, and you\u2019ve got quoting that's happening in advance. And so it's a little more stable and longer. And I, the last recession, on the boiler side, which was 2006 - 2007, the boiler business was impacted, but not as much as the rest of the business, particularly because of some of the underlying growth drivers that you have on the replacement, and high efficiency, most of our products just as reminders, high efficient, energy efficient product that pretty resilient in downturns because of the energy efficiency nature that continues to want to drive a replacement. David MacGregor : So just to be clear, when you say it's resilient in terms of the cyclicality, are you talking about units? Are you talking about profitability? Chuck Lauber : Both, they're very similar. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Jeff Hammond : Hey, good morning. Just wanted to ask a similar question on, I guess Dave did on the water treatment business. It's a newer platform and just trying to it seems to be something maybe a little more discretionary than a water heater replacement. So just how you think that business would perform in a recession scenario? Kevin Wheeler : Yes, I guess the first point of some of our water treatment is it's a much affordable much more affordable product. So this is our first time going through some type of cycle here. Certainly, it will be some discretion there with people, but the way we look at it is the penetration, the awareness is going to continue to go up. And there's a consumable part that we had that it's continued to grow. It's about 50% of our business today. So we -- it's not as, maybe not as resilient as water heaters. It's not a must have. But it's got some built-in components that help offset some of the downturns, but just people becoming more aware of having healthy and clean water. So we think it's going to perform fairly well to any type of economic cycle. Jeff Hammond : Okay, and then seems like the new entrants in the water heater space kind of finally got the plant open. And I'm just wondering if you're seeing them in the marketplace at all. And if you think there's any pricing disruption around that particularly as input costs rollover, thanks. Kevin Wheeler : Yes, I'll quickly touch base on that. Nothing new from our perspective, yes, their plant is open, but their market activity from our perspective, and what we're getting feedback hasn't changed. In fact, if anything, they're moving away from our customers, our retailers and wholesalers and trying to maybe look at more builders and that type of thing. So can\u2019t anticipate what the future is going to be with them? But right now it's kind of the not a big change from what we saw other than they, they're manufacturing a few products in their US plant. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham of Loop Capital Markets. Scott Graham : Hi, good morning. To an earlier question, Kevin, I was very interested in your view on the residential water heater market, kind of going from the 99 level, I think you said to the lower nines. I'm curious if you can add maybe a little more color from your perspective as the market leader. How much of that do you think is destock? Kevin Wheeler : Again, that's going to be very speculative. The reason I feel confident in the water heater market is I'd still go back to and again, I'm not sure when it's going to normalize. But new construction, there's still a deficit out there. And that's going to continue to grow and move forward. So that's what gives me confidence in the market, a stable replacement side of it. And, yes, again, and quite frankly, as things get a little tougher people do more renovation. But I think it's, if you look at our history the growth rate in the residential water heater market, it's been at that couple percent range. And I think as I go forward, I just think it's going to adjust down, we were in a very hyper inflated market have a lot of money out there, and everybody benefited from it. But I think over time, that's going to just normalize to kind of a run rate that we've seen in the past. The great news of it, though, there's more water heaters out there today, and that's going to go out 10-14 years, that's going to play really well for the industry and for our company. So that's kind of the high level, it's really hard to get into much more detail than that, Scott. Scott Graham : It's fine. And that was helpful. Thanks. So in China, can you give us the sales split for the quarter in, I know you combine both water heaters and treatment, upper middle price point versus premium? Chuck Lauber : Sure. I mean, premium I'll just, premium side of the market is so about, the low end is about 40% premium on the electric water heater side, the high end is nearing 50% premium on the water and the gas and the gas tankless and then water treatments kind of in between. So not a great deal of change of little uptick on the electric side, we introduced a couple new products, a good dual tank, slimline product on the electric that we're hoping to get some traction on, which bumped that up a bit. Scott Graham : Okay, so you are seeing that number continued to incrementally progress. Chuck Lauber : Well, quarter-over-quarter for electric it was up and we think it's -- it is due to some new products. Hard to say there a lot of movement. But when we track the upper part of the market and what the industry is telling us from a third party, still positive movement, so still an uptick from the last quarter. Not a large uptick but only positive. Kevin Wheeler : Yes, Scott, I echo that, we talked about it, it is about a couple of years now. And so a lot of our premium products have feature of benefits that still consumers in China are willing to pay for. So we're very pleased with our new products. And we're really pleased to see the upper end continue to move in that kind of northeast direction. Scott Graham : Got it, thank you. And just a follow up then on the share repurchases. I know you're kind of still locked in at that $400 million. I'm just sort of wondering what the market weaker resi conditions, obviously sliding yet you're still having some fairly stable sales based on the replacement nature of them, including in China, good cash flow. What's holding you back from going higher on the share repurchases this year? Chuck Lauber : Yes, I mean, we did have enough $400 million I think last year were 380-ish or something like that and change. So we're still a little bit of an uptick to historically. I think as we go into this cycle, and we'll have to see how it plays out. But there could be some real opportunities on the M&A side, we want to make sure we're in a position to be able to capitalize on those opportunities. So that's one way to get it. The other is see we're projecting to be at that $400 million now, we don't have intentions to increase it on this call. But we'll continue to watch it as we have and see what the economy does and what our price does so. Scott Graham : Yes, Chuck, I guess on that, I guess my whole thinking, of course, is that it's not just about the cash flow, but it's also about the balance sheet. You guys have been running in that cash position for like a decade. And just seems like you have a lot of dry powder there and can still increase the share repurchasing. Is that -- are you looking at a couple of large sized acquisitions? Is that kind of part of the equation? Kevin Wheeler : Yes, I'll jump in here is that's almost a possibility. And so the way we looked at as we go into the year, and things have changed as this year started kind of evolved to where we're at today. The $400 million is pretty much a locked in number for us. Each year, we evaluate where we like to go. So we'll take another look as Chuck said in 2023 but we do think there's some opportunity as we get into the back half of this year with a number of our M&A targets and things are changing and we want to be prepared and have the balance sheet to take action if those opportunities come our way. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Damian Karas with UBS. Damian Karas : Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for all the detailed color around the market outlook. I have a follow up question on margin, I was wondering if you could maybe just help us think about the bridge when you factor in some of the volume deleveraging for the lower steel and input costs. Is there a good way to think about the detrimental margin versus the price cost benefit? And I guess just any perspective, you might be able to provide on additional margin, you could capture later this year, and next year, if sort of steel costs basically hold stable from here. Chuck Lauber : Yes, this is Chuck. I won't go beyond this year. But when you think about kind of the detrimental margins, and we're really just talking about residential water heater detrimental margin, and then what Kevin mentioned, the light commercial, so you probably think of that in the 35%, detrimental margin range. Steel cost, we've kind of got those visibility, and we have visibility into those costs through the third quarter for sure. And we're starting to see visibility into second. So we feel pretty good about that. So that's probably the next largest driver. And then the stabilization of order rates, as we expect we had a little bit of a disruption in the end of June, and in July here on residential order rates, we would expect plants to perform a little bit better during the back half of the year, and the commercial mix is also favorable. So we expect some help on commercial mix. And if you kind of think about the cadence for the back half of the year we're going to, our guidance is 22.5 to 23, right. And we're kind of tracking below that right now. So we do expect a decent uptick in Q3. And then incrementally Q4 as some of those price increases, I mentioned that water treatment and lock-in and boilers come in. And as we see probably our most favorable steel, for sure, in the fourth quarter. So that's how we kind of think about that margin expansion. Damian Karas : Okay, that's helpful. I want to ask you about your heat pump product. We're seeing heat pumps gain traction in the broader HVAC market kind of on the air side, that's really picking up. I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing, I guess in theory, the economics have probably gotten a little bit worse just because of the steel inflation if you compare that product to the tankless but maybe any ideas, maybe any thoughts on just how that is progressing? And do you think that the market is -- that product could take off on its own? Or are you going to ultimately need some government stimulus? Kevin Wheeler : Well, let me separate that to a residential heat pump versus a commercial heat pump, because I think they're both different markets. The residential heat pump is still an upsell product, it's one of the best value propositions we have in our company. But it's a 3x or 4x regular electric water heater, and there's some installation challenges. There are quite a bit of subsidies out there, whether it be up to state city, which is helping, and that's going to continue to grow. I mean, there's no doubt that it'll grow. It'll grow at a moderate pace, I believe, unless it's regulated in, but it's going to continue to grow. And it's going to be a long-term product for our company in our industry. But it's still a relatively small part of our overall volume. Commercial heat pump is even there's a lot of activity out there. But that's trailing the residential side, just because it does have some size to the installation. And it requires a tank. There's a number of things that have to go along with it, and it's better for new construction than it is for retrofit. But we see that growing we see activity in it. We obviously have products that we participate in, but I think both of those categories are going to grow at a percentage rate pretty high but as an overall volume still going to be more of an upsell product unless there's some regulatory changes that come. Operator : I'm showing no further questions. And I would like to hand the conference back over to Helen Gurholt for any further remarks. Helen Gurholt : Thank you for joining us today.

After the speaker presentation there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that this conference may be recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Helen Gurholt. Please go ahead. Helen Gurholt : Thank you, Josh. Good morning, and welcome to the A.O. Smith third quarter conference call. I'm Helen Gurholt, Vice President, Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis. Joining me today are Kevin Wheeler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer. In order to provide improved transparency into our operating results of our business, we provided non-GAAP measures. Free cash flow is defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures. Adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted segment earnings and adjusted corporate expenses exclude the impact of nonoperating, noncash pension income and expenses as well as legal judgment income and terminated acquisition-related expenses. Reconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and on our website. A friendly reminder that some of our comments and answers during this conference call will be forward-looking statements that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include matters that we described in this morning's press release among others. Also, as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up per chart. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. We will be using slides as we move through today's call. You can access them on our website at investor.aosmith.com. I will now turn the call over to Kevin to begin our prepared remarks. Please turn to the next slide. Kevin Wheeler : Thank you, Helen, and good morning. I'm on Slide 4 in our third quarter results. As we announced on October 13, we saw our customers reduce their North America residential water heater inventory levels, particularly in the wholesale distribution channel. This inventory destock activity was larger than we expected going into the third quarter. Based on market data, we believe this destock was industry-wide. As a result of the destock, our third quarter sales decreased 4% year-over-year due to lower residential water heater volumes, which more than offset our 2021 inflation-related pricing actions, incremental sales from our acquisition of Giant Industries late last year as well as commercial water heater and boiler growth in North America. Our Rest of World segment sales decreased 13% year-over-year as COVID-related lockdown headwinds persisted in China. Despite lower volumes, our China business achieved margin growth of 40 basis points in the quarter. The acquisition of Giant Factories added $25 million in quarterly sales and $0.01 to EPS. We are pleased with the performance of the team and our integration is on track. We saw quarter-over-quarter improvement in our supply chain, which led to higher commercial water heater and boiler volumes. Please turn to Slide 5. Our Global A. O. Smith team delivered third quarter 2022 adjusted EPS of $0.69, a 15% decrease that was driven in part by a 4% decrease in sales compared to the third quarter of 2021 as well as higher costs associated with production inefficiency and higher cost materials. I commend the global A.O. Smith team for meeting the many challenges we faced in the third quarter, and taking the necessary steps to rightsize our production and meet current demands to improve efficiencies going forward. Excluding the impact of Giant, North America water heater sales decreased 9% in the third quarter of 2022. Due to greater-than-expected residential water heater destocking activity that more than offset pricing actions implemented in 2021, in response to rising material and logistic costs. The residential industry experienced greater than average growth in 2020 and in 2021. We began to see softness in our orders towards the end of the second quarter and into the third quarter. As our customers begin to destock their inventories in response to our lead times returning to pre-pandemic levels. However, this destocking activity was prolonged and deeper than we originally expected. We have seen an increase in our orders in October. And while we expect higher residential water heater volumes in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, we do not expect volumes to be as robust as the fourth quarter of 2021. We again saw quarter-over-quarter improvements in our commercial gas water heater shipments as supply change constraints continue to ease in the third quarter. Our North America boiler sales grew 27% in the quarter, mainly driven by previously announced price increases to offset higher material and transportation costs and higher volumes. We continue to see improvement in our supply chain in the third quarter, which allowed us to reduce lead times and begin to reduce our backlog. Our strategy to focus on innovation and decarbonization contributed to strong demand for our high-efficiency condensing boilers. North America water treatment sales grew over 4% in the third quarter, primarily due to pricing actions taken to offset higher input costs. Our water team business was also impacted in the quarter by customer destocking and the professional channels. In line with expectations, sales in China decreased 10% in local currency, compared to the third quarter of 2021, primarily due to the continued impact of COVID-19-related lockdowns. Our team in China continue to effectively manage discretionary spend in the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we forecast that consumer demand will be down approximately 15% compared to last year. Please turn to Slide 6. As I mentioned on our January call, one of our key strategic priorities in 2022 is to innovate and expand our decarb portfolio, including heat pump technology. In the third quarter, we launched our best-in-class Voltex AL residential heat pump water heater. The Voltex AL has industry-leading energy efficiency and provides peace of mind with new integrated leak protection technology. The Voltex AL also has 0 clearance design and versatile top inside water connections to ease installation for contractors. We believe the new Voltex AL is a market-leading product that puts us in a strong position to capitalize on the decarbonization and electrification megatrends. I'll now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on our third quarter performance. Chuck Lauber : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 7. Third quarter sales in the North America segment were $653 million, a 1% decrease compared with 2021. Pricing actions largely on water heaters were more than offset by lower volumes of residential water heaters. Sales in the quarter also benefited from higher volumes of commercial water heaters and boilers. Giant acquired in October 2021, added $25 million to North America sales. North America adjusted segment earnings of $133 million decreased 11% compared with the same period of 2021. The earnings benefit of inflation-related price increases was more than offset by lower residential water heater volumes and related production inefficiencies as well as higher material and freight costs. Adjusted segment operating margin of 20. 4% declined compared with 2021 operating margin, primarily due to the headwinds I mentioned and acquisition of Giant, which has lower margins than our overall legacy water heater business. Adjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin excluded a pretax gain of $11.5 million due to a judgment obtained against a competitor related to the infringement of one of our patents and pretax nonoperating pension expenses of $2.6 million. Moving to Slide 8. Rest of the World segment sales of $230 million decreased 13% year-over-year. Lower sales volumes were primarily driven by consumer demand headwinds in China related to COVID-19-related restrictions. Currency translation unfavorably impacted segment sales by approximately $16 million, $12 million of which impacted China sales. Sales in India grew 16% in local currency in the third quarter of 2022 on strong demand for our water heating and water treating products. We view India as a long-term growth opportunity given its attractive growth characteristics and changes in demographics. Rest of the World segment earnings of $22 million decreased 19% compared to segment earnings in the third quarter of 2021. In China, the impact of lower volumes was partially offset by lower selling and advertising expenses. Rest of the World segment margin of 9.5% was down 70 basis points from the same period last year primarily due to the negative effects of foreign currency translation as well as higher advertising expenses to promote new products in India, partially offset by improvement in China operating margin. Cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $215 million and $164 million, respectively, during the first 9 months of 2022 decreased compared to the first 9 months of 2021 due to lower customer deposits in China, higher incentive accruals from 2021 due to record sales and earnings and greater cash outlays in 2022 for -- and greater cash outlays in 2022 for increased levels of safety stock on higher cost inventory that more than offset lower accounts receivable balances. Cash flow from operations and free cash flow reported today are each $34 million higher than the preliminary cash flows reported on October 13. As a result of separately reporting the impact of foreign currency exchange impacts on working capital. Our cash balance totaled $417 million at the end of September, and our net cash position was $129 million. Our leverage ratio was 14% as measured by total debt to total capital. Our strong annual free cash flow and solid balance sheet allow us to continue to focus on capital allocation priorities and return cash to shareholders. Earlier this month, our Board approved a 7% increase in our quarterly dividend rate to $0.30 per share. We repurchased 4.5 million shares of common stock in the first 9 months of 2022 for a total of $282 million. Let's now turn to Slide 10. In addition to returning capital to shareholders, we see opportunities for organic growth, innovation and new product development across all of our product lines and geographies. The strength of our balance sheet allows us to pursue strategic acquisitions even in times of economic uncertainty. As a result of our activities to identify water heating and water treating assets that meet our financial metrics, we recognized corporate expenses of $4.3 million related to costs associated with the terminated acquisition. These costs were excluded from adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share. The strength of our balance sheet allows us to maintain our strong track record of delivering returns to shareholders. This has been done through both our dividend that we have increased for 30 consecutive years as well as share repurchases that have totaled $650 million since the beginning of 2021. Please turn to Slide 11 and our 2022 full year earnings guidance and outlook. We maintain our 2022 outlook that we updated in conjunction with our October 13 press release with an expected earnings per share range of $1.29 to $1.39 per share our adjusted earnings per share range of $3. 05 to $3.15 per share. Our outlook is based on a number of key assumptions, including, no further significant surges of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. and that COVID-19-related restrictions in China remain approximately at the levels that they are today, and do not significantly impact our operations, our employees, customers or suppliers. Steel indices began to stabilize at the end of 2021 and have moderated through the current year. Our guidance assumes that average steel prices in the fourth quarter will be approximately 15% lower than the third quarter of this year. We continue to see elevated non-steel materials and transportation costs. We saw continued improvement in our supply chain in the quarter. However, challenges still persist. We remain in close contact with our suppliers and logistics providers to troubleshoot, manage and resolve bottlenecks, but the environment remains unpredictable. We continue to see the benefit from multiple 2021 price increases, compounding to approximately 50% for water heaters. We expect to generate free cash flow of approximately $400 million to $425 million. For the year, CapEx is expected to be approximately $70 million to $75 million. Adjusted corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $55 million. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be between 23.5% to 24%. And we expect to repurchase $400 million worth of shares of our common stock, resulting in outstanding average diluted shares of $156 million for 2022. Based on these assumptions, the midpoint of our adjusted EPS range represents an increase of 5% compared to 2021. I'll now turn the call over -- back over to Kevin, who will provide more color on our key metrics and top line growth outlook and segment expectations for 2022, staying on Slide 11.  Kevin? Kevin Wheeler : Okay. Thank you, Chuck. We project revenue growth for 2022 of 5% to 7%, which is lower than our outlook in July as a result of softer-than-expected demand in residential water heating. Our sales assumptions include, after approximately 8% growth in each of the last two years, which is well above the historical average growth rate, we estimate U.S. residential water heater industry unit volumes will be down approximately 12% to 13% on last year as customers rightsize their inventories and industry demand normalizes. We continue to project that commercial gas water heater industry shipments will be flat to slightly down for the year. However, we revised our full year outlook for the commercial water heater industry to be down approximately 15%, primarily due to continued weakness in the electric product greater than 55 gallons. COVID-19-related restrictions in China played out as we expected in the quarter, and we expect continued headwinds for the remainder of the year. Therefore, we project our sales in China to be flat to slightly down in local currency compared to last year as a result of the economic headwinds we are experiencing from COVID-related restrictions. Due to our strong backlog and stable order rates, we maintain our full year boiler sales growth projection of 25%, driven by increased pricing in response to higher input costs, prior demand for our energy-efficient products. We project North America water treatment sales growth, inclusive of acquisitions to be approximately 10% in 2022 as we continue to execute our water treatment business strategy. Based on these factors, along with the full impact of our 2021 price increases, we expect North America segment margin to be approximately 21.5%, and Rest of World segment margins to be approximately 10%. Please turn to Slide 12. The residential water heater industry adjustment that we experienced in the third quarter was disruptive. We have taken action to rightsize our production and we project lower steel costs, which we expect to lead to sequential improvement in profitability in the fourth quarter. Our company has a long history of provability to navigate and innovate to all economic cycles. We believe A. O. Smith is a compelling investment with our premium brands and leading share positions in our major product categories, combined with exciting growth opportunities in North America water treatment business as well as in China and India. We estimate replacement demand represents approximately 80% to 85% of U.S. water heater and boiler volumes. Our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation allow us to continue investing for the long term in ourselves, and through acquisitions. We are focused on meeting the needs of our customers. Our portfolio of strong brands, combined with investing in technology to drive innovation and new product development, further enhance our market leadership. I'm confident in our ability to effectively manage the complex macro environment and capitalize on opportunities while continuing to execute our strategic objectives. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we are now available for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Your may proceed. Matt Summerville : A couple of questions. When do you guys expect price capture to peak for A.O. Smith in North America? And to that point, have you seen any impact as of yet from price paid associated with steel indices retreating off highs? Chuck Lauber : Yes. I mean let me address that. So for the quarter, you can see what we've presented on our walk forward that our pricing so far, which, just as a reminder, is fully in at the beginning of January. We're anniversarying our last price announcement coming up here in November. So pricing has been into the market for a while. In the quarter, you can see we're covering costs, well covering costs plus our margin. We have seen steel costs moderate a bit. Over time, we typically see some fade on pricing as costs moderate. I want to just kind of remind everybody, though, that it's not just steel costs that we have as part of our pricing portfolio, it's also material cost. We've seen a broader basket of costs go up over time. And those costs have been pretty resilient. So with the lower volumes as we came into the third quarter, we're carrying a little extra inventory. We're a little bit more on safety stock than typical. Some of that is at a bit higher cost, including higher steel costs as we're working through buying still a little bit in advance of some of the volumes. And so we'll see an improvement in the fourth quarter. We expect on margin. Part of that is related to the price cost relationship. And as we exit the year, we expect to be working through the inventory as we exit the year, but we probably still have a little bit of carryover inventory going into next year. Matt Summerville : And then maybe I was wondering if you guys could talk a little bit about the M&A transaction you were maybe looking at and ended up walking away from maybe a little bit of detail around the nature of the size and maybe ultimately, why that transaction was not consummated? Chuck Lauber : Yes. We're bound by an NDA to not get into any details on that transaction. I would say, from a process perspective, it followed our normal diligence process. We look at from a diligence perspective, strategic fit. We look at kind of the financial metrics -- And due to the nature of the amount that we got to -- we got pretty far along in the process, but we're really not able to get into any details around that specific transaction. Kevin Wheeler : Yes, probably may just make a couple more comments. I mean, we've talked about our M&A activity being pretty robust in the pipeline being fairly strong. Again, we always start with our core water treatment, water heaters and boilers, we also have some adjacencies that we believe are meaningful to our business that we could leverage our markets and channels and customers and so forth. So that activity still remains. But I guess the big takeaway, I would say, is we went through that process, we're talking about, but we remain financially disciplined and it's something we've always said that we were going to continue to do as a company through our M& A process. Operator : Our next question comes from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed. Susan Maklari : I just wanted to follow up on the pricing commentary. Can you just talk a little bit about how we should think about the cadence of some of the price cost flowing through, just given all the different moving parts that you are seeing in there? And can you talk a little bit about the longer-term stability of some of the pricing? And how we should be thinking about that coming through the business over time? Chuck Lauber : Yes. I mean, the cadence is as we kind of look at the price/ cost relationship, we entered the first quarter with our highest cost and pricing was not quite fully in the market. We kind of roll through the year, and I would say the relationship becomes a little better each quarter though we're pressured on non-steel cost as we went into the second and third quarter. We see some relief on steel as we go third to fourth quarter. And so we do expect better margins in the fourth quarter on that cost price relationship. And as we exit the year, we're going to have to see where all the other material costs head into next year. But as we exit the year, we feel pretty good about our price cost relationship and margins. Susan Maklari : And then following up, can you talk a little bit about the deceleration in water treatment there? You talked about destocking that's going on in the quarter. Can you give just some more color on where those inventories are? And how you're thinking about that going forward? Kevin Wheeler : Yes, I would say if you look at our water treatment business has been growing -- it was the first to grow through the pandemic and has done quite well over the last couple of years. I think it's grown somewhere in the neighborhood of 40-plus percent. And the comment we made regarding some professional destocking, that really comes out of our wholesale channel and our professional dealer channel. And I would remind everybody on the call that our professional dealers have had 10 consecutive quarters of growth, really strong growth. And it faced similar but not as abrupt as our water heating, some inventory build, and we're starting to see some of that bleed off in the third quarter. And we expect to see a little bit more as we exit the fourth quarter as well. But overall, business on the wholesale quarter quality dealer side is doing well. Our direct-to-consumer is doing well, retail. And we have a couple of pockets or export in private label that are behind. But this is probably just an adjustment as we get back to some normal levels of cadence in our water treatment business. But overall, the business is doing well and has introduced some new products, we'll continue to do that as we go forward, and we still see double-digit growth in the near to midterm. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Michael Halloran with Baird. You may proceed. Michael Halloran : So on the resi side of things, North America water heaters, just thoughts on how long you think the destocking takes? Do you think it's mostly run its course here? And any thoughts for where you think the industry volumes kind of settle in that on a unit volume basis? Kevin Wheeler : Yes, sure. Mike, let me just touch on that. One, we talked about it in our prepared remarks that it was deeper than we thought as we go forward. I mean we saw June, July and August some pretty good corrections. But as you step back and you look at it, there I think the key driver has been our lead times have come back to pre-pandemic levels, where we can be counted on for on-time deliveries. There's some pressure on our wholesalers, particularly on inventory, the cost of inventory and probably wanting to exit maybe this year a bit conservative. But overall, I look at it, our orders have rebounded in October to a reasonable level. And it appears that we've just normalized back to an appropriate level. And that destock was really necessary as we kind of adjust to what is more of a normal level of orders and of sales. And then you step back and you look at our three segments, the replacement side of the business is resilient, continues to do that. Renovation and proactive replacement still elevated, but probably going to come down. And we've seen a bit of a slowness in the new construction residential part of the business, but that's probably just an adjustment to interest rates, but nothing like we saw back in '08 and '09, those type of levels. So I look at this, I think we're in a reset right now. We probably have had all the destocking or most of in Q3, a little bit maybe left in Q4, and we should exit the year at the right levels as a water heater industry. Chuck Lauber : Yes. Just a couple of metrics around that, Mike, let me just add to that. I mean we've got the industry kind of going up a bit, 6% to 7% in Q4 compared to Q3. As Kevin said, we've seen orders rebound a bit. So we've got a little bit uptick in the industry. Then if you look at that fourth quarter, we're down -- the industry will be down probably 20% from last year, which was an all-time high from when we've been tracking it. But if you go back to fourth quarters, and I'll say the five years pre-pandemic, so '19 back, it's only a couple of percent down from those years. So it really feels as when we exit the year we're getting more into a normal range for the full year industry numbers. Michael Halloran : And then on the China side of things. Maybe talk to the resilience of the performance there. Obviously, the margin levels are coming in kind of quite nicely sequentially relative to what is a tough demand environment. But feels like you guys are holding in really well on that side. So maybe talk to the inventory levels, what the channel partners are saying and how you think the share in your relative share is progressing in the market? It seems like it's doing pretty well right now. Chuck Lauber : Yes. I'll start with share. We feel that we're already in where we've been. We haven't gained or lost. We're kind of still in that same leadership position and in the mix. We are pleased with the quarter. We were down about 10%, right in line with what we expected. Very pleased with managing SG&A. So yes, being down that 10% in local currency and still being at about a 10% operating margin, real pleased with that at that level. The team is managing that well. So very steady performance as we kind of walk forward into the fourth quarter. We've got the fourth quarter up about 20% compared to third quarter, but that's down a bit to last year because last year, if you recall, we had a really robust fourth quarter. A little bit of currency headwind will hit us, but that's just going to happen. And then SG&A, we're going to be spending more SG&A in the fourth quarter. So even though volumes go up, we're going to have a little improvement on the downside. But we really do want to lean into some advertising and selling as we exit the year. So we feel pretty good about the cadence of the business and how our channel inventories are right in line. If you recall, we added to inventory in the first quarter because of some concerns around pandemic and restrictions. That number hasn't changed. It's been steady through the year. We expect to exit the year steady. And that's in that 4 to 6 weeks' time frame. Kevin Wheeler : Mike, I'll maybe just add a couple of more things which help us on the margin. We're -- our new products have done quite well even in this difficult environment. We've introduced products in our core categories and in the premium sector. So in what's been very positive is that premium sector continues to grow. Now albeit it's smaller just because of it being down a little bit. But our premium customers can navigate through these difficult challenges better than some. And I'm really happy about our store productivity. We've taken a lot of actions there over the last couple of years, and that's holding up well, which is really relevant to how our spend is being executed. So overall, the business in the environment that it's in today, each part of it is doing as well as you can expect it. And we'll continue to manage it, and we expect to do that through the fourth quarter, and we'll see what 2023 has some store for us. Operator : Our next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel. You may proceed. Nathan Jones : Starting with residential water heater volumes. You guys have been pretty consistent over the years talking about that residential water heater volumes being a 1.5% to 2% volume growth market, '20 was up 21 was up 8%, and you're looking at down 12% or 13% this year, which would probably get you back pretty close to that trend line. Do we have to pay back some of the demand pull forward? New construction is probably lower in '23 than '22. Wondering if like '23 baseline expectations for volume might be flat to down 5%? Or does your experience so you ought to be better or worse than that? Kevin Wheeler : Well, I will tell you that let me start -- we haven't really calculated that. But as far as being able to have to pay some of that back. This kind of goes back to the '08, '09 when there was a deep drop and everybody thought that was a clip. We did a lot of work on that. And so -- this is an 8% grade over the last couple of years. That's about over , I think, in units. But again, as you look at it, it's going to be over 120 million to 125 million houses out there. We estimate that each house has 1.2 to believe it or not out there. So it's a base of 150 million. So we really don't see these type of one-offs having a longer-term payback effect just regard from replacement and the type of work that would be done on renovation. We talked a little bit about housing. We'll let that play out a little bit, it's probably going to be a little bit down. But the overall increase, I think, is going to feather out over the next 5 to 25 years, which is the length of life of our water heaters. So really no meaningful downturn that we could see anywhere in the near term or even in the long term. Nathan Jones : Would flat to down a little bit, be a reasonable expectation for volumes next year? Kevin Wheeler : We'll see how we exit Q4, and we'll let you know in January. Nathan Jones : I wanted to follow up with my question on the commercial business. You've obviously had very strong demand there, but you've talked about lead times coming down and being able to clear some of the backlog. Does that present a potential issue where you might see some destocking in the commercial channels ahead, similar to what you've seen in residential in the back half of this year? Kevin Wheeler : This is Kevin again. I would tell you, I -- yes and no, but it's -- I'm going to break that up a little bit. On the gas side of the business, commercial gas, high efficiency is doing well we talked to that being flat to down, and that's tracking really well. And our backlogs are clearing up. And all the feedback we have is our customers are not overstock when it comes to commercial gas water heaters. The negative part about the commercial industry this year is really all in that greater than 55-gallon electric. And that's a semi-commercial water heater, if you will, because it also goes into large residential and smaller commercial. And so if you look at what's been happening, all the decline this year is on that greater than 55 gallons, just virtually almost all of it. And then if you go back to 2021, almost all of the increase was the greater than 55-gallon electric. So it appears to me that the industry -- again, you're going to hear us say normalize probably more than once. But it appears that the overall commercial industry is normalizing to a more of a traditional level. So I don't think you'll see the destocking that we have. I think it's already occurring with the greater than 55-gallon and it will be at the appropriate levels as we exit Q4 of 2022. Operator : Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. You may proceed. David MacGregor : Sorry about that. Technologically challenged. Good morning to everyone. Sorry about that. I wanted to just go back to the topic of pricing, if I could. And you talked about the impact on your anniversary and your 5 increases in 2021 at the end of this year. And so I'm thinking about 2023, and I realize you'll have more to say on that in January. But just as you -- from a planning standpoint, think forward, it would appear that we're heading into a stagflationary environment here. And I'm just wondering how you think about your opportunity to take further price actions in a softening demand environment? Chuck Lauber : Yes. I mean we're not going to comment on forward pricing at all, just due to the competitive nature of this environment. David MacGregor : Is it possible to just address the question sort of theoretically in terms of pricing power or your ability or how confident you are in your ability to do something rather than specifics? Kevin Wheeler : Yes. I would go back to how we've addressed this in the past. Historically, when we need to take pricing action we've been able to do that given the appropriate amount of time to manage through that. And historically, we've been able to be successful at it. So if that was to occur, I think you just go back to the various times that we've taken those actions. And historically, I think it's appropriate that when needed, we have a track record of being able to execute. David MacGregor : And you talked about steel prices coming back, but could you talk about non-steel cost inflation and where you think that level may be? Chuck Lauber : Yes. I mean, if you kind of walk the year forward, we had in our outlook projections of non-steel cost going up throughout the year and that completely realized that. So the non-steel cost of foam, packaging, transportation and freight being a very large one, all sort of materialize and we really haven't seen relief on those. As we go forward, we would hope and expect that we would see relief on those. But right now, it's pretty resilient. David MacGregor : My second question, it really gets back to capital allocation. And just wondering, you've articulated a fairly definitive sort of set of priorities around capital allocation. I'm just wondering how those priorities may change in a recessionary environment? And to what extent maybe share repurchases become an increasing sort of priority for use of cash under those conditions? Chuck Lauber : Yes. I mean we've been pretty strong in our share repurchases over the past couple of years and $650 million [Audio Gap] or kind of 2021 through 9 months in 2022. Priorities prioritization will not change. We're going to invest in ourselves. We're going to make sure we protect our dividends and continue the increasing dividend rate. Acquisitions will remain a priority, and then we'll look at repurchase kind of as the final opportunity there. We do think we're entering into an environment as we go forward, we're in a great position with our strong balance sheet to be able to look at acquisitions. So we feel -- we certainly feel that we're in a good position for acquisitions going forward. But I'd say from our priorities, probably haven't really changed. They've been pretty much on track. Operator : Our next question comes from Damian Karas with UBS. You may proceed. Damian Karas : I was wondering if you could maybe elaborate on how much cost actions you've taken in response to the softening of volumes in the North American residential market? And are those rightsizing and cost actions you've taken more structural in nature or somewhat more temporary? Chuck Lauber : Yes. Let me try to explain kind of the cost actions. I mean the actions are really, I would say, rebalancing and aligning our manufacturing facilities to line up with -- what we see now is lower volumes. When we were going through the quarter, we expected volumes to come back quite candidly in the fourth quarter and as we exited the third quarter, which, as we mentioned, did not come back. So there was a bit of hiring churn to make sure we can meet demand. We're always going to make sure we're in a position from a labor perspective and component perspective to meet demand. So there was a bit of churn there. And as we exited the quarter, I'd say the rebalancing on the labor side, where we expect less churn in labor. We're in a good position. First half of the year, if you look back on demand, getting products out the door was a bit of a challenge. We're in a better position on preventative maintenance. All the components that make the plants run more smoothly. We're just set up a lot better going into the fourth quarter. And I mean to quantify that, I mean, probably think about operating. I mean, certainly, you've got the volume piece, which clearly drops to the bottom line and a margin perspective. But just from an efficiency perspective, we think of it in terms of incrementally the fourth quarter from a plant efficiency being in that $5 million range better for the quarter. Damian Karas : And then just a follow-up on some of the pricing questions. I appreciate your comments on right, the track record you have with respect to pricing power and past inflationary and then subsequently raw materials deflationary cycles. I'm just curious, though, if you're getting any customer pushback on price, just given the magnitude of the 50% price increases and that sort of being unprecedented, is kind of the customer conversation, any difference in some of these past cycles? Kevin Wheeler : I would tell you, right now, probably not much different. I always follow back on when it comes to pricing and doing business with our customers globally, quite frankly. Our job is to make sure that we keep that competitive. So that's our number one driver in the market, making sure the pricing that we have and the programs that we have allow our customers to grow and compete. So those conversations probably -- they haven't changed quite frankly, because -- and Chuck mentioned it a few times now, still used to be the major component we always talked about because it moved a lot -- the rest of the business kind of stayed relatively stable, that's really good. So there's still price pressures out there. There's still cost pressures out there. And it's not just for A.O. Smith, it goes down to our distributors as well who ship products to customers and, of course, buy other materials. So there's not a great deal of change in our conversations, which I think it's a good thing for the industry, and we'll continue to stay close to our customers and make sure that they stay competitive. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. You may proceed. Andrew Kaplowitz : So your boiler business and specifically commercial condensing boilers seems to be quite resilient. Maybe you could talk about the backlog you have there and what kind of visibility you have moving forward? And obviously, you've -- you'll have more difficult comparisons going into '23 in that segment, but it seems like energy efficiency is really driving that demand. Kevin Wheeler : Yes, I would tell you that the boiler market, the commercial market, particularly around -- that part of the business has been still quite active. We're still seeing strong demand out of hospitality, institutional and that continues. So -- and a big indicating is quoting and quoting still remains active throughout it. And more importantly, our industry just doesn't have the inventory in it yet. It's still a bit light. So overall, the business is great. We had two record months in Q3. We're -- our supply chain was improving and allowed us to produce and ship at record levels. And at the end, order rates have remained solid. So the industry is resilient, but it tends to be 12 to 18 months behind residential anyway, historically. But overall, we're doing well. Our backlog is still elevated, 2 times to 3 times where it's been in the past. But we're starting to work that down, which is good and our production is starting to increase. So overall, the business has been great. We feel really good about Q4. And quite frankly, it's been much more resilient than we anticipated at the start of the year. Andrew Kaplowitz : If I could ask you a question on your residential water heater business in maybe a slightly different way. You said that you've got the industry up 6% to 7% in Q4 versus Q3. You mentioned volumes have been recovering in October. But we keep seeing sort of increasing pressure on the consumer mortgage rates are going up. So how much visibility do you have just into the quarter itself? Do you have -- you've said in the past, you can see inventories that are a little harder to see inventories in the channel. So what kind of visibility do you have into sort of the near term? Kevin Wheeler : It really depends on the channel and where in the country. But let's talk to U.S. because I think that's where you're going. We have reasonable visibility into our retail segment, and we have -- I would say, moderate visibility on the wholesale side of the business. It's still a pretty fragmented market with -- you have national players, you have regional players, but you have a lot of local companies as well. So visibility, we don't have a great view to this. We do talk to the customers and so forth. But overall, I go back to the 80%, 85% replacement, that model hasn't changed. Destocking was an issue, but the replacement business is still there. It will continue to be there. People are still going to proactively replace water heaters and so forth. So business is what we thought. We're glad to see October's orders improve, which gives us a high confidence that the destocking has mostly been done. And that's how we kind of frame the fourth quarter. I think it was really important, Chuck mentioned that the fourth quarter is going to be down because it's just coming off a very difficult comp. But through the first month, we think we're starting to get back to that normalization that we talked about. Chuck Lauber : And just a commentary on how we think about housing. So you're correct. I mean there's mortgage rate increases. There's some pressure on housing and new construction. But for us, it's really completions, and we -- there's a bit of a lag when people start the construction process and then put in the war heater and finish out the construction process. So some of the some of the lag should help us carry through the year on housing. And we're going to really look at that number as we enter '23 on the housing side. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. You may proceed. Jeffrey Hammond : Last one covered here. I just want to hit on kind of what feedback you're getting or how you're thinking about kind of this IRA impact around heat pump water heaters. And just you mentioned kind of the new product introduction, just maybe level set us on how you think about market share in that space relative to kind of your traditional water heater market share? Kevin Wheeler : I'll touch on the IRA. I still think it's there's no downside to the IRA for us. It really comes down to what gets finalized and what it's going to help us with regards to maybe some incentives to move to higher efficiency products and so forth. On the heat pump side of the business, it's -- we're doing well on the heat pump side. Our growth rate is mid-double digits, okay? And it continues to grow, but it's coming off a relatively small base. And so the way to think about it is heat pump probably is 2% of the market, but it's going to grow and it's going to continue to grow. That's why we invested in the [indiscernible] that we just talked about. But it's still relatively small. It's going to need some incentives to drive that and some regulatory action. But I don't see any downside to the IRA. I see us in a really good position going forward. And -- so overall, long term, I think heat pumps going to be a primary product for us, but it's going to take some time because they're costly and -- and there -- when you do a replacement from an emergency side of the business is a little bit difficult to do a change from a regular water heater to a heat pump. But on the renovation side, the proactive side, there is a much better chance. So long term, heat pump is going to be one of our leading technologies at A. O. Smith. Operator : I would now like to turn the call back over to Helen Gurholt for any further remarks. Helen Gurholt : Thank you, Josh, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Let me conclude by reminding you that our global A. O. Smith team delivered solid execution in the third quarter despite many challenges. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the quarters to come. In addition, please mark your calendars to join our presentations at two conferences in the fourth quarter, Baird on November 8 and Oppenheimer on December 14. Thank you, and have a great day.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. And I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ms. Helen Gurholt. Ms. Gurholt, please go ahead. Helen Gurholt : Good morning, and welcome to the A.O. Smith fourth quarter and full-year conference call. I'm Helen Gurholt, Vice President, Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis. Joining me today are Kevin Wheeler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer. In order to provide improved transparency into the operating results of our business, we provided non-GAAP measures. Free cash flow is defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures. Adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted segment earnings, and adjusted corporate expenses exclude the impact of non-operating, non-cash pension income and expenses, as well as legal judgment income and terminated acquisition-related expenses. Reconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and on our Web site. A friendly reminder that some of our comments and answers during this conference call will be forward-looking statements that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include matters that we described in this morning's press release, among others. Also, as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. We will be using slides as we move through today's call. You can access them on our Web site at investor.aosmith.com. I will now turn the call over to Kevin to begin our prepared remarks. Please turn to the next slide. Kevin Wheeler : Thank you, Helen, and good morning everyone. I'm on slide four and our full-year results. Our team delivered record-setting sales and year-over-year improvement in earnings on an adjusted basis despite lingering supply chain headwinds, inflation, and a significant U.S. wholesale residential channel inventory destocking activity that took place in the third quarter, and began to normalize in the fourth quarter. Residential industry volumes increased 15% in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Despite the destocking activity, North America sales were up 11% compared to 2021 primarily due to inflationary pricing and strong demand for our commercial and residential boilers and water treatment products. Our Rest of World segment delivered consistent performance in 2022 despite headwinds in the economy and currency exchange. Segment operating margins improved 120 basis points driven by our China team improving their full-year operating margins to almost 11%. In India, our sales grew 28% in local currency in 2022, and continued to be profitable. As expected, we settled the majority of our pension liabilities in December of 2022, which resulted in a non-cash pre-tax expense of $417 million or $1.60 of EPS. This expense is excluded from adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS. With our divided and share repurchases, we returned $581 million of capital to shareholders. Please turn to slide five. Our Global A. O. Smith team delivered record sales of $3.8 billion in 2022, and adjusted EPS of $3.14, a 6% increase over 2021. We achieved this strong performance as a result of effective execution from our team. North America water heater sales grew 10%, in 2022, due to 2021 pricing actions implemented in response to rising material and logistic costs, and acquisition-related revenue that was partially offset by lower residential volumes. After two years of greater-than-average growth, residential unit industry demand decreased approximately 12% compared to 2021 primarily due to a wholesale channel inventory destocking that occurred during the second and third quarters. The order reduction we experienced from our customer was driven in part by our improved performance in delivering residential product and reducing our lead times. Commercial industry units decreased approximately 17% year-over-year. A large portion of the decrease was due to a continued weakness in electric products greater than 55 gallon, which was impacted by a regulatory change at the beginning of 2022. We don't expect that product category to rebound to pre-2022 levels. Despite the 2022 contraction in both the residential and commercial industries, we are pleased with our market share strength in both residential and commercial water heaters. Our North America boiler sales grew 28% driven by higher volumes and previously announced price increases to offset higher costs. Our supply chain improvement efforts allowed us to reduce our record backlog in the second-half of 2022. Our focus on innovation, efficiency in decarbonization contributed strong demand for our high-efficiency condensing boilers, particularly our Hellcat CREST boilers with O2 sensing technology. North America water treatment sales grew 10% in 2022 due to pricing actions and higher volumes, particularly in our dealer and specialty wholesale channel. Our strategy is to pursue this market with an omni-channel approach as we work to grow our share through product development and acquisition opportunities. We view our independent water quality dealers have been outperforming the market and gaining market share. In China, full-year sales decreased 5% in local currency compared to 2021 due to impacts from COVID-19-related disruptions. Our core water heating products performed well in a down market. Our water treatment business, comprised of residential, commercial, and filter replacement consumables grew nearly 4% in local currency, and now represents almost 40% of our overall business, with repeatable consumable filter sales representing over 25% of overall water treatment sales. For the year, operating margins in China were 10.7%. As a result of actions taken over the past several years to right-size the business and manage discretionary spending, China has achieved operating margins above 9% in each of the past seven quarters. I'm now on slide six. We released our third ESG report in December. We have made significant strides in our commitment to ESG, including progress towards our GHG emission reduction goal of 10% by 2025, preventing almost 500,000 metric tons of carbon emissions in 2021 through sales of our highly efficient water heaters and boilers, and WAVE verification, a process developed by The Water Council, as an initial step in creating a strategy to improve our water stewardship performance. ESG concepts are embedded within the foundation of our 149-year history. The ESG report demonstrates our commitment to our values of being a good citizen, a good place to work, emphasizing innovation, and preserving our good name, and achieving profitable growth. I will now turn the call over to Chuck who will provide more details on our full-year and fourth quarter performance. Chuck Lauber : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. I'm on slide seven. Full-year sales in North America segment rose to $2.8 billion, an 11% increase compared with 2021. Pricing actions, largely on water heaters, were partially offset by lower volumes of residential water heaters. Higher volumes of boilers and water treatment products also added to segment sales growth. Giant acquired in October, 2021, added incremental sales of $94 million. North America segment adjusted earnings, of $611 million, increased 5% compared with 2021. The earnings benefit of inflation-related price increases and higher volumes of boilers and water treatment products was partially offset by higher material and freight costs and lower residential water heater volumes. Adjusted operating margin of 21.7%, a decline of 120 basis points year-over-year, was driven by inflationary headwinds and volume-related production inefficiencies. We exited 2022 with our highest quarterly adjusted operating margins of the year at 23.3%. Moving to slide eight, Rest of the World segment sales, of $966 million, decreased 7% year-over-year and 2% in constant currency basis. Currency translation unfavorably impacted segment sales by approximately $49 million, $36 million of which impacted China sales. Our sales decrease was primarily driven by lower sales in China as consumer demand was negatively impacted by COVID-19-related restrictions. India sales grew 28% in local currency in 2022, compared to 2021, as we continued to outperform the market. Rest of the World segment earnings, of $96 million, increased 5% compared to segment earnings in 2021. In China, the impact from lower volumes was more than offset by lower selling, advertising, and incentive expenses. Segment operating margin improved to 10%, an increase of 120 basis points compared to 2021, primarily as a result of improved management of discretionary spending in China. Please turn to slide nine. Turning to fourth quarter performance, we delivered sales of $936 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, down 6% year-over-year, driven by lower residential water heater volumes in North America and lower consumer demand in China that more than offset inflation-related pricing actions. Adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter were $0.86 per share, compared to adjusted earnings of $0.85 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021. Please turn to slide 10. Fourth quarter sales in North America segment were $692 million, a 3% decrease compared to record sales in the fourth quarter of 2021. We saw quarter-over-quarter improvement of residential water heater demand; however, water heater volumes were still below the record industry levels in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our fourth quarter sales benefited from pricing actions and stronger boiler sales growth of 36% driven by backlog reduction. North America segment adjusted earnings, of $161 million, decreased slightly compared with 2021. The earnings benefit of inflation-related price increases, higher boiler volumes, and lower steel costs was offset by lower residential water heater volumes. And improved price-cost relationship resulted in higher adjusted segment operating margin of 23.3% compared with the 2021 adjusted segment margin of 23%. Moving to slide 11, fourth quarter, rest of the world segment sale of $250 million decreased 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by the impacts of unfavorable currency translation and lower consumer demand in China due to COVID-19 related restrictions. Currency translation unfavorably impacted China sales by approximately $24 million. In local currency, China sales decreased approximately 7% year-over-year. India sales grew 16% in local currency in 2022 compared to 2021. Rest of the world segment earnings was $32 million, was slightly higher than Q4 2021 segment earnings. In China, lower incentives and selling expenses offset lower volumes and currency translation headwinds resulting in segment operating margin of 12.7%, a significant improvement over segment operating margin of 10.6% in the fourth quarter of 2021. Please turn to slide 12. We generated free cash flow of $321 million during 2022; lower than in 2021 as higher adjusted earnings were offset by lower customer deposits in China, higher 2021 incentive payments made in 2022. And working capital cash outlays primarily related to higher inventory that more than offset the lower accounts receivable balances. Our cash balance totaled $482 million at the end of December. And our net cash position was $137 million. Our leverage ratio was 16.5% as measured by total debt to total to capital. Now turning to slide 13, in addition to returning capital to shareholders, we continue to see opportunities for organic growth, innovation, and new product development across all of our product line geographies. We continue to target strategic acquisitions that meet our financial metrics that are accretive to earnings, in the first year, return across the capital in three years. The strength of our balance sheet allows us to pursue a strategic acquisition even in times of economic uncertainty. Earlier this month, our Board approved their next quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share. We have increased our dividend for 30 consecutive years. We repurchased approximately 6.6 million shares of common stock in 2022 for a total of $404 million. The strength of our balance sheet also allows us to maintain our strong track record of delivering returns to shareholders. Over the past two years, we have returned $1 billion to shareholders through our dividend share repurchases. Please turn to slide 14, and our 2023 earnings guidance and outlook. As previously discussed, we terminated our defined benefit pension plan at the end of 2021. The termination followed the strategy and measured glide path to derisk our fully funded exposure to pension liability. The plan which was previously sunset for benefits earned in December 31, 2014 represented over 95% of the company's pension plan liability. The terminated plan's pension liability was annuitized in 2022. The pension settlement, which we completed in the fourth quarter, accelerated the recognition of $417 million of non-cash pre-tax pension expenses. Tax benefits associated with the pension settlement were $168 million. And include amounts recorded at historical tax rates, and results in an after tax EPS impact of $1.60. We are pleased to introduce our 2023 outlook with an expected EPS range of $3.15 and $3.45 per share. The midpoint of our EPS range represents an increase of 5% compared with 2022 adjusted EPS. Our outlook is based on a number of key assumptions including our guidance assumes that steel prices in 2023 on an annual basis will improve approximately 40% to 45% compared to 2022 including a sequential improvement of approximately 20% to 25% from the fourth quarter of 2022 to the first quarter of 2023. We have seen a flattening of the steel index. And therefore, our outlook does not project a further meaningful sequential reduction in steel costs through 2023. Regarding other costs outside of steel, we have generally seen flattening in cost at elevated levels. While we do expect a shift in buying power to move from neutral towards a buyers market as we progress through the year, our outlook does not assume significant improvement in non-steel material costs in 2023. We saw continued improvement in our supply chain in the second half of 2022. While challenges still persist, disruptions are limited. We remain in close contact with our suppliers and logistics providers to manage and resolve supply chain issues as they arise. We expect to generate strong free cash flows between $550 million and $600 million. For the year, CapEx should be between $70 million and $75 million. Corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $55 million. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately 24%. And we expect to repurchase approximately $200 million of our shares of stock resulting in outstanding diluted shares of 150 million at the end of 2023. I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin who will provide more color on our key markets and top line growth outlook and segment expectations for 2023 staying on slide 14. Kevin? Kevin Wheeler : Thank you, Chuck. We project 2023 sales to be approximately flat to 2022 at the midpoint with a range of plus or minus 3%, which includes the following assumptions. We'll be the majority of our customers exited 2022 with near normal inventory levels. While we believe that new home construction remains a deficit, we expect it will be a headwind in 2023. Therefore we project that 2023 residential industry unit volumes will be down approximately 2% to 5% compared to last year. We project commercial water heater industry volumes to be flat to slightly up as supply chain constraints ease the market correction related to the regulatory change in commercial electric water heaters greater than 55 gallons is largely behind us. In China, while we expect there could be COVID-19 related surges, related to Chinese New Year travel, we see the recent lifting of the Zero COVID Policy as a positive step to improve the economic environment. We believe they will take time the economy in China to improve and then weaken consumer confidence and a challenged real estate and housing market, we project that our sales in China will go 3% to 5% of local currency in 2023. Our guidance assumes volumes in China improved sequentially throughout the year. Our forecast assumes that the currency translation impact on sales will be similar to 2022. We expect our North America boiler sales will increase approximately 10% to 12% in 2023. Our expectations are driven by an industry growth of 3% to 4%. The transition to higher energy efficient boilers will continue particularly as commercial buildings improve their overall carbon footprint. A year after launch, our CREST commercial condensing boiler with Hellcat Technology is quickly becoming the industry standard. We expect to see continued benefits from pricing actions implemented in 2022. Our boiler backlogs are at normal levels as we entered 2023. We project approximately 5% to 7% growth in sales of North America water treatment products, which is lower than our growth expectation of 10% per year, largely as a result of a reduced backlog as we exited 2022. We will have pricing benefits and the mega trends of healthy and safe drinking water, as well as reduction of single use plastic bottles will continue to drive consumer demand for our products. Based on these factors, we expect our North America's second largest will be approximately 23% and Rest of World segment margins to be approximately 10%. Please turn to slide 15. We remain focused on our key strategic priorities to advance our position as a leader in heating and treating water around the world. Those priorities are, expand and enhance our high efficiency product portfolio, including heat pumps for space and water heating, expand our global water treatment capabilities by investing in technologies, people and distribution, deploy capital effectively by investing in ourselves, acquisitions, and returning capital to shareholders. As we enter 2023, there are economic uncertainties ahead of us. However, there are positives. We believe the 2022 inventory adjustments in the wholesale residential market are behind us. We expect more normalized unit volumes in 2023. Our fourth quarter 2022 North America adjusted operating margin, of 23.3%, improved over previous quarters as we exit the year with a favorable price-cost relationship and our plants are running more efficiently after the third quarter volume adjustments. In China, the lifting of Zero-COVID policy is a positive step to an improved economic environment. In 2023, we expect a strong rebound in free cash flow as China emerges from COVID-19-related disruptions and a dedicated focus on inventory reduction across our North American operations. We remain focused on servicing our customers. Our strong brands across the portfolio, combined with technology-driven innovation and new product development will enhance our market leadership. We are confident in our ability to capitalize on opportunities as we continue to execute our strategy. With that, we conclude our prepared remarks. And we're now available for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Saree Boroditsky of Jefferies LLC. Your line is open. Saree Boroditsky : Good morning. So, just touching on the outlook for residential water heaters to be down to 2% to 5% this year, can you talk about how much of that is related to new home [source] [Ph] replacement, how are you seeing in -- about proactive replacement this year? And then impact as we start to lap the housing downturn? Chuck Lauber : Thanks. Good morning, Saree. This is Chuck. So, as we're looking at next year, I mean we're coming off a year where we're down about 12% on the residential market with the inventory correction. Housing, we expect a headwind in housing of maybe 15% to 20%. Just -- we've got an 80% to 85% replacement market, so housing is in that 15% to 20% range, which will be a headwind. And that's kind of how you get down to the 2% down. Where we're looking at for proactive replacement, it's pretty strong on proactive replacement going into next year. We saw that tick up, historically proactive replacement as we measure it through a third-party survey, runs 20% to 25%. During the past couple years it's been in that 30% to 35%. And our last survey still has it above 30%. So, we're still projecting, going into next year, a fairly strong proactive replacement portion of the replacement market. Saree Boroditsky : Great. And then, I guess, I know you guys don't like to talk pricing a lot, but just on the residential water heater pricing in the retail channel, do you expect to see prices decline for the indexed contracts? And if so, how do you just think about the balance in pricing in retail versus the wholesale channel? Kevin Wheeler : Well, hi. This is Kevin. When you look at both those channels, one, they're -- they are two different business models, but they compete for a lot of the same customers. And traditionally, you're going to have some conflicts between the channels of a periodic -- it's kind of regional. But as we look at it and as we -- as value at our pricing structure to both channels, we feel that they're going to be competitive. Historically, at how we manager our pricing, hasn't changed. So, again, we look at that both channels will be in the market competing at an equal level. So, that's kind of where we're at right now, and we'll see how things play out the rest of the year. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Michael Halloran of Baird. Your line is open. Hello, Mr. Halloran, if your line is mute, please unmute your line. Michael Halloran : I was muted; apologies. I gave this really enthusiastic hello too, so I was bummed I didn't hear from anybody. Chuck Lauber : Well, hello. Michael Halloran : Yes. Thanks, everyone. Appreciate the time. So, first, on the guide and how you're thinking about sequential, couple things. First, is the embedded assumption, relatively normal seasonal patterns as you work through the year? And then secondarily, when we think about kind of 1H load for second-half load, obviously the year-over-year comps get a lot easier in the back-half of the year. So, maybe talk about how you think growth cadences as we look through the year? Chuck Lauber : Sure, Mike. We have it laid out in our outlook to be pretty much back to normal. When you look at the residential volumes, it's usually 52%-48%; front-half of the year, 52%, back-half of the year, 48%. And we believe it's going to get back to that normal cadence. Boilers, typically strongest in third quarter, so we have it laid out a bit like that, similar to prior cadence. China, we've got China starting out a bit slow with the COVID disruptions. As you know, the first quarter is always a challenge with the Chinese festival for volumes. And we just got -- we got China a little bit lighter in the first quarter, but improving as we go through the year. And normal cadence again on China as fourth, the strongest, we would expect improvement on the COVID situation about fourth quarter, back to our normal routine of that being a strong retail quarter for us. Michael Halloran : And might as well stay on China, then maybe just talk about how things are tracking from a competitive dynamic, share component to it, the market share component to it, but also how the high end of the market is performing versus the rest of the market? Feels like things are stable, but any commentary on the competitive landscape would be appreciated? Kevin Wheeler : Yes, Mike, hi, it's Kevin here. Share is always a difficult when we talked about how the omni-channel hedges go in together, we don't have great visibility to all the different channels. But what I would tell you, that we believe we're happy with our sales, we're happy with our average pricing. We believe we're getting our fair share of the market and continue to get that introducing new products, as we always do, and bringing products to the market that consumers are willing to pay for. When it comes to the high end of the market, it continues to have that sleeve that makes sense, and it keeps ticking up a little bit. But again, it's still on a smaller base. We hope as we get through the Zero-COVID lifting and the consumer activity grows in the market, that will improve. Consumers, right now in China, are -- so, our record is -- are saving the highest rate that they have ever. So, we look at there could be some pent up demand as we go forward. And again, just looking at China in general, there is some discussions about some consumer stimulus by the government; nothing specific today. Thanks for helping out some of the housing sectors to build up some of their inventory. So, that there's a lot of positives, but again I think it will take some time as the consumer recovers from three years of, basically, inactivity and lockdown, and starts to get more comfortable. And that's why, as Chuck pointed out, we're looking at sequential improvement through the year, but there's more positives than we've seen in a long time in our China market. Chuck Lauber : And just to add to that, I -- we said it in our prepared remarks, we're really pleased with the consistency, as you noted, Mike, of our performance quarter-over-quarter, that the discipline towards managing our discretionary spend where our outlook for '23 has us back in a growth mode on constant currency. So, we're pleased to be -- kind of hopefully turning a corner, growing in that 3% to 5% in local currency. Michael Halloran : Great, really -- Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeff Hammond : Hey, good morning, everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Hammond : Yes, so I just want to come back on price. I think your comment, Kevin, was both channels are going to be competitive. But formulaically, I think you go negative on price with your material price formulas on the DIY side. So, I'm wondering if your comment implies that there's some pricing pressure on the wholesale side or do we stick more there? And if we do, what the upside is to maybe North America margins given the fall-off in steel? Thanks. Kevin Wheeler : Well, steel has stabilized now for a while. So, and through the process it -- there's also been many non-steel related cost that as Chuck had mentioned in our remarks as stabilized. But, they haven't come down. So, we have made the appropriate adjustments there in both channels. And as we continue to reiterate, we are going to keep the channels competitive. Again, historically as I look back over the last year, we are managing our business as we have in the past. And we are a similar view as we go forward. So, our goal is to remain competitive in both channels. We do a lot of business with customers in both channels and that's our commitment. And again, we look at more of stabilization as we go forward since it looks like materials and steel have kind of plateaued and kind of stabilized. So, don't see a competitive issue between the channels or as we go forward into 2023. There is always some historic price paid. But, it's nothing different than we have seen in the past. Jeff Hammond : Yes. I mean I understand that the steel stabilization. But, I think you mentioned 40% to 45% kind of decline. And I guess relative to past cycles that's a much bigger kind of increase and then decrease. So, I am just wondering if the behaviors are any different. Kevin Wheeler : Yes. I mean that's decline, I think I'll just going comment that if you would have stayed at that the peak, we would have probably been really challenged on the margin profile in North America. But what happened is we kind of grew into a little better margin profile as steel retreated a bit. And, we come out of the fourth quarter and steel does take another tick down maybe 20% to 25% in Q1. And then kind of flattens out. So, we had quite a bit of headwind in '22 on North American margin because of some of the higher steel cost earlier in the year. Jeff Hammond : Okay. And then, just one last one, I think the last couple of years you signed up for $400 million buyback. I think you are stepping it down to $200 million. And just anything that informs the kind of the lower buyback versus the past couple of years? Kevin Wheeler : Yes. I mean where we are looking at is and we committed to $200 million as a buyback. And we are a little bit shy of our cash conversion target of 100% cash conversion in 2022, did that consciously, built inventories, worked our backlogs down. Pleased with that, now we will be working on reducing inventories in the next year. But as we entered 2023, we paid $200 million as the target that we are committed to. We are going to looking at kind of how '23 rolls out from really an acquisition perspective as we go through the year. We may revisit that as we go through the year. And as we work down inventories and see our cash potentially grow a bit. But, we are going to revisit it as we go through the year with the opportunities we think still to be out there on M&A. Jeff Hammond : Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Matt Summerville of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Will Jellison : Hi, good morning. This is Will Jellison on Matt Summerville. I wanted to ask both questions today about capital allocation priorities. And starting off with organic growth, I was wondering if you can provide any more insight into what sorts of capital expenditure projects and investments you are considering making in 2023? And how those support the business and its growth moving forward? Kevin Wheeler : Yes. On the organic growth I mean just a couple of comments around that. So, we always invest in innovation, product development. From a capital perspective, some of those support new product developments. I would say when you get into the developments of the heat pumps, some of the other growth categories where we might have to support that. Chuck Lauber : And when we break down the capital, we look at it from a growth perspective maintenance as well, we will be at some pretty large facilities that we have to invest back in. And there is also a pretty large cost reduction component as we invest in automation, new technologies, and so forth and efficiencies in our factory. So, those are three buckets that I would say that there is no specific major expense outside our normal. But, there is a consistent spend in all three categories under company. Will Jellison : Understood, okay. And then pivoting to capital allocation conversation to acquisitions, can you speak to actionability of the pipeline? What kind of things you are observing in the market for potential targets out there? And what's your overall thought is for how many of those could be acted upon in 2023. Kevin Wheeler : Let's just talk about the environment, which is a bit -- is a bit strange right now, what the, some of the potential higher interest rates to talk of Recession and so forth. And what I can tell you that multiples haven't really changed, maybe ticked down a little bit, but there's a lot of wait and see approach out there with I would say, targets. So, we're continuing to stay close to our potential targets and stay active in the pipeline. And we look at this as an opportunity as you get an uncertain times with our balance sheet. These are nice opportunities, but again, needs to play out a bit, we need to get through some of the uncertainty. But we feel good about our pipeline, we feel good about the companies that are in it. And we're going to continue to work on driving some of those closures. As far as actionability, it always depends on the person saying yes, as we go forward, and -- we'll keep working through there, but we've made small acquisitions each still last few years. Hopefully, we'll be able to bring a couple of those across the finish line in 2023. Operator : Thank you. And one moment please for our next question. And our next question will come from Susan Maklari of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Charles Perron : Hey, good morning, everyone. This is Charles Perron in for Susan this morning. Thanks for taking my question. Kevin Wheeler : Yes, good morning. Charles says, thank you. Can you help us out there? Charles Perron : Yes, I guess my first question, I would like to go back to the North America margin outlook for 2023. And it's going to help us walk through the trajectory of the margin throughout the year, obviously, we're going to have water heater volumes, probably deleveraging in the first half. And then coming back, obviously, gradually throughout the year, but also, if you think about the price cost, you mentioned that nonsterile category should improve through 2023. So, is it fair to expect maybe a gradual ramp in the margins throughout the year? Kevin Wheeler : Yes, first to comment on Q4, we're really pleased where we came up in Q4 in North American margins is 23.3. And I do want to kind of call out the fact that we did have some pretty strong boiler volumes in that quarter. So, that's, that's coming off, we're pleased where we're coming off, but we got some help on some higher margin boiler, commercial boiler, product sales that helped us come out of that. So, the gains for the year on the margins is, it possibly expands a little bit, but we've got our outlook fairly even through the year, the way the balancing kind of occurs. And I talked a little bit earlier on the cadence that it' s 52 :48 for residential, a little lighter, we have boilers that are usually strongest in the third quarter. So, it's fairly smooth for the year we don't have non-steel costs in our assumption and outlook, coming down a great deal at the back half of the year, potential opportunity as we look at it, but we just, we see some opportunities, but we haven't got much of that opportunity baked into our outlook. Charles Perron : Got you. That's a good color there. And then my follow-up on the boiler sales guidance for '23, a 10% to 12% sales growth, that's impressive considering the significant growth you've seen in '22. Can you expand maybe on the drivers of the growth there or volumes versus price? And may be the initiative, supporting industry volume growth, considering the weakening that we've seen in the commercial or non-residential indicators over the span of the last few months? Kevin Wheeler : Yes, I mean, we did had some great growth in 2022, on the boiler side, and again particularly in the fourth quarter was helped by drawing down our backlogs which we exited the year pretty normal, in that 10% to 12% growth that we see for next year, at 50% to 60% of that is price. So, carry over prices is a little over half of that 10% to 12%. The rest of the growth is on, it's on volume. Chuck Lauber : Yes, I would just maybe add on to that. We came up some strong growth again, a lot of that had to do with bringing the backlog down, but our orders remain pretty stable, quoting activity in the market is still strong, institutional education, so we feel there's still a positive momentum in the Boiler segment in 2023. And so far as we've seen orders come in over the last month, that's indicating that that's where we should be again being stable. And what's really great is now our lead times are back to normal, we're able to get product out the door in a timely fashion. So, overall we still feel really good about the boiler market. And the whole commercial side of the business tends to lag residential. So, 2023 still seems like could be a solid year for our boilers business. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Your line is open. David MacGregor : Yes, good morning everyone. My first question is just with respect to the supply chain and looking back on 2022, is there any way to estimate what supply chain disruptions cost you in 2022 in terms of revenue and EBIT? And does it become an incremental positive in '23? I mean, you mentioned the boiler backlogs got normalized, but I'm just wondering if there's any kind of a throw forward benefit into 2023 from that normalization. Chuck Lauber : From a volume perspective, I would say no, we had some, starts and stops when you have some interruptions, particularly the front half of the year. But we've made all that up, we're back to normal these times on the residential side, we're back to a fairly normal backlog on boiler side and backlog is pretty normal on the North American Water Treatment side, too. So, don't think on a volume side, from a cost perspective a little bit harder to quantify some of those disruptions we saw in the fourth quarter an improvement in our plants operating efficiencies, and that's a result of less disruption in volume that we saw in Q3 and a bit on just more normal cadence to operating volumes. Kevin Wheeler : Yes, I'll just add on to that. All of our plans throughout the year, really, supply chain did improved throughout the year, and we only had sporadic outages that really didn't impact our productivity all that much. The only exception was in China towards the fourth quarter, but overall supply chain is really kind of very much stabilized. And we're chasing one and two items now, not the entire portfolio. David MacGregor : Okay. And just with respect to the '22 impact, there isn't a way to sort of come up with some kind of an estimate on what it might have cost in terms of revenues, realize you're saying the 2023 impact is going to be de minimis, but the 2022 any? Kevin Wheeler : I can tell you about 2022 is Q3 was a tough quarter for us on residential water heater side, just because of the drastic drop in volume. But overall, we were building up those efficiencies. I don't see them being exceptionally different in 2023. Chuck Lauber : Supply chain in us catching up on backlog carrying a little more inventory, it actually helped volumes a little bit on the boiler and water treatment side in 2022 because we couldn't work our backlog down with better supply chain. David MacGregor : Okay, that's interesting. My second question is on China, and obviously a good quarter with Rest of the World margins at 12.7%. With China local currency sales down 4%, too, which is good, obviously a lot of work being done on managing costs. Can you just talk about the margin opportunity in China over maybe the next 12, 18, 24 months? And what specific drivers would be and I'm guessing with progress in India, and maybe some of these other smaller lines within ROW, it looks like you're now back to the kind of that 12 and you're approaching anyway, the 12 to high 13s range that you last achieved in 2013, 2018, is there further upside or changes in price point mix and regional market mix and level of competition just created structural limitations that are going to hold you to those levels again? Chuck Lauber : Well, I'll tell you that a lot of variables right there. But I will tell you that from our perspective, thank you for the question by the way, just kidding with you. I will tell you, the number one is going to be volume. As we start to lift out of that Zero COVID. And the consumer activity increases and durable goods become more important as they get through all the restaurants and entertainment they're going to do in the first quarter now that they're out about. It's going to be volume related. And we've been volume challenged now for three years there. And we're positioned really well from a structural standpoint. But volume is new products, but it will come down to that consumer getting back in the market and feeling comfortable to start investing back in their homes and buying new home. So, from my perspective, it's one variable is going to be really volume, the rest of the business is really positioned well. Operator : Thank you. And one moment please for our next question. And our next question will come from Lawrence De Maria of William Blair. Your line is open. Lawrence De Maria : Hey, thanks. Good morning, everybody. Just to follow-up in North American margin outlook, could you maybe distill it down into, what's driving it for '23, is essentially the positive carryover price and benefits of the exiting lower steel costs. Anything else in there, maybe mix and then related to that, how would you frame the downside risks to margins in '23 North America based on potential for a price concessions and is there much pushback yet? Thanks. Kevin Wheeler : Well, so our outlook -- and you'll notice we didn't provide a range in North America margins for next year, we've had 23%, just as kind of a midpoint as a point estimate. We feel pretty comfortable to managing to that 23%, carryover pricing, there'll be some but not a great deal of carryover pricing in the water heater side next year, we've got our material costs holding fairly and resilient going into next year. Conversion costs, we expect the plants to operate a little more smoothly, but just embedded in that our higher operating costs overall. So, the biggest puts and takes are we expect, we expect to continue to have a reasonable relationship on the price cost relationship for North America water heaters, we have had some carryover pricing in other parts of our business, like boilers and water treatment in North America. Lawrence De Maria : Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then if I could just add one more then, the 5% to 7% water treatment growth, what's really underpinning that, it sounded like in your prepared comments, it's mostly price. But given the weakness in residential markets, just kind of curious how to build up their works? Kevin Wheeler : You are correct. It is mostly price going into next year. Again a bit like the boiler side of the business, we brought our backlogs down, we saw a bit of inventory adjustment in the channel on the water treatment side of the business in 2022. So, next year, I mean, we certainly, we have confidence in the underlying trends in North America water treatment, but most of the volume next year is driven by price. And we could potentially see some pressure on consumer spending as we head into 2023. Lawrence De Maria : Okay, thank you, and good luck. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Your line is open, excuse me. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good morning, everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Andrew Kaplowitz : Can you give a little more color into how you're thinking about the commercial water heater market in '23? I know you mentioned flattop and regulatory overhang, mostly behind you in electric commercial water heaters, maybe sort of what's going on electric versus gas, what's your channel partners are telling you I think you answered about the commercial markets overall, hanging in there, but any more color would be helpful. Kevin Wheeler : Again, we have a flat to slightly up or, we still have a lead times that are a little bit more extended than we'd like. So, we normally like to be around 15 days, we're around 25. We believe that the gas market and it's just, there're some inventory deficits out there, there's still some upside on some replacement. So, we look at the market is just artificially, 17% was just artificial, because of the greater the 55 gallon. But underneath that, the market was down mid-single-digits. And that was with a supply chain issue and components and it's going to normalize and we see it being slightly positive as we go through the year, particularly on the gas side of the commercial business. Andrew Kaplowitz : Helpful. And then I know you introduced the Voltex heat pump in Q3, can you talk about your early penetration into the market with that particular heat pump and I know heat pump is still a small part of your business, but how might they become a factor later in '23 and '24 as IRA implications also impact the business? Kevin Wheeler : Yes, again, you're looking at it is, as I talked about, one of our priorities is certainly on the heat pump side of the business is both residential and commercial. And you are right, residential heat pumps represent about 2% of the entire market today. It's got a really nice growth rate of 35% to 40%. And that's a positive trend, but it's going to take some time to move forward. There's some upfront costs to this that are expensive. There's some parts of the installation that are a little more difficult than the normal replacement but if you look out forward, a heat pump will become a bigger part of our commercial and residential portfolio. So that that's going to move forward, again, it's not going to go at the pace where it takes over the market next year or two, but long-term it's one of the best value propositions. It's got a great decarbonization message. It's been promoted by a number of states. And of course, when you look at the Inflation Reduction Act that's still working its way out, but there'll be a component there that will hopefully help and provide some stimulus as well. So, overall, and then I would tell you, our Voltex has been out a few months. It's done quite well, but it's a little early, we just feel real good about the UF of greater than four and the different features and benefits that it brings to the market to zero clearance. It's a terrific product that can go into just about any application that it needs to. And so far it's been received really well. But again, heat pumps in the early stages, but it will continue to grow at a greater accelerated rate year-over-year. Operator : Thank you. This will end the Q&A portion of the conference. I would now like to turn the conference back to Ms. Helen Gurholt for closing remarks. Helen Gurholt : Thank you everyone for joining us today. Let me conclude by reminding you that our Global A. O.

Also, as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. We will be using slides as we move through today\u2019s call. You can access them on our website at investor.aosmith.com. I will now turn the call over to Kevin to begin our prepared remarks. Please turn to the next slide. Kevin Wheeler : Thank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. I am on slide four and we will review a few highlights of our first quarter results. Our team delivered record first quarter adjusted EPS of $0.94, driven by strong performance in North America with sales up 3% due to higher commercial and residential water heater volumes. In addition, we saw margin expansion across our water heating, boiler and water treatment product categories due to a more favorable price/cost relationship. Our Rest of World segment delivered consistent performance in the first quarter, despite headwinds in the economy and currency exchange in China. In India, our sales grew 28% in local currency in the first quarter due to strong demand for our water heating and water treatment products. Please turn to slide five. North America water heater sales grew 3% in the first quarter of 2023 as we believe we outperformed the market and experienced resilient demand for our commercial and residential water heater products. Sales of commercial electric products were strong in the quarter as demand returned to pre-2022 levels. Last year, commercial industry shipments were negatively impacted by our regulatory change for commercial electric products greater than 55 gallons. Our North America order sales grew 2%, driven by previously announced price increases to offset higher costs. Residential boiler volumes decreased year-over-year, primarily driven by elevated channel inventory levels coming off a particularly strong fourth quarter of 2022. We believe inventory levels have normalized by the end of the quarter. Demand for our commercial high efficiency condensing boilers particularly our Hellcat CREST boilers with O2 sensing technology remains strong. North America water treatment sales were flat in the first quarter of 2023 compared to a tough comp in 2022 as higher direct-to-consumer and e-commerce sales were offset by lower sales in our dealer and specialty wholesale channels. Sales in the first quarter of 2022 benefited from strong shipments as supply chain constraints improve and we work down our order backlog. We believe the majority of our dealers and wholesale customers exited the first quarter with normal inventory levels. In China, first quarter sales decreased 10% local currency compared to the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to weakened consumer demand. We have seen sequential improvement through April and expect that improvement to continue through the year. We believe it will take time for the Chinese economy and consumer confidence to improve. We saw favorable price mix in the quarter, particularly in our water treatment as we recently introduced our large flow products that have been well received by the market. I am now on slide six. A. O. Smith has recently been named in 2023 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Sustained Excellence winner by the EPA and the U.S. Department of Energy. The ENERGY STAR award is given to companies that have made a long-term commitment to energy management through their products or services. This is the fifth consecutive ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year award A.O. Smith has received and the third time being named a Sustained Excellence partner. These awards are a direct result of our strategic objective to expand and enhance our high-efficiency product portfolio including heat pumps, as evidenced by the recent launch of our Voltex AL Heat Pump Water Heater. We are committed to continued development of sustainable water heating and water treaty technology. I will now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on our first quarter performance. Chuck Lauber : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I am on slide seven. Record first quarter sales in the North America segment rose to $753 million, a 3% increase compared with the same period last year. The increase is primarily driven by higher commercial and residential water heater volumes, partially offset by pricing. North America segment earnings of $188.6 million increased 22% compared with the first quarter of 2022. Operating margin of 25.1% improved 400 basis points from the segment adjusted operating margin in the first quarter of last year. The higher segment earnings and operating margin are primarily due to higher volumes of commercial and residential water heaters and lower steel costs. Moving to slide eight. Rest of the World segment sales of $219.1 million decreased 14% year-over-year and 8% on a constant currency basis. Currency translation unfavorably impacted segment sales by approximately $17 million. Our sales decrease was primarily driven by lower sales in China as consumer demand was negatively impacted by COVID-19-related headwinds. We saw month-over-month improvement in consumer demand during the quarter. India sales grew 28% in local currency in the first quarter compared to 2022 as our new products have been well received by the market. Rest of the World adjusted segment earnings of $17.8 million decreased 28% compared to segment earnings in 2022. Segment adjusted operating margin was 8.1%, a decrease of 160 basis points compared to the first quarter of last year, primarily as a result of lower volumes in China, partially offset by lower selling costs. Please turn to slide nine. We generated free cash flow of $109 million in the first three months of 2023, higher than the same period in 2022, due to higher earnings and lower working capital outlays primarily related to lower inventory levels and a lower 2022 incentive payments paid in 2023. Our cash balance totaled $496 million at the end of March, our net cash position was $155 million. Our leverage ratio was 16% as measured by total debt to total capital. Our strong annual free cash flow and solid balance sheet enable us to focus on capital allocation priorities and return cash to shareholders. Earlier this month, our Board approved our next quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share. which represents our 83rd consecutive year of dividend payments. We repurchased approximately 821,000 shares of common stock in the first quarter of 2023 for a total of $53 million. We expect to repurchase $300 million of our shares in 2023, $100 million increase from previous guidance. Let\u2019s now turn to slide 10. In addition to returning capital to shareholders, we continue to see opportunities for organic growth driven by innovation and new product development across all of our product categories and geographies. The strength of our balance sheet allows us to pursue strategic acquisitions even in times of economic uncertainty. During the quarter, we committed to selling our business in Turkey and recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $15.6 million, primarily in anticipation of the liquidation of the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment. The business model in Turkey is more project-based than our core consumer and commercial water treatment business and no longer fits our current strategy. Please turn to slide 11 and our revised 2023 guidance and outlook. We have increased our 2023 outlook with an expected adjusted EPS range of $3.30 per share and $3.50 per share. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS range represents an increase of 8% compared with 2022 adjusted EPS. Our outlook is based on a number of key assumptions, including we assume a relatively stable supply chain. While challenges persist, disruptions are limited. We remain in close contact with our suppliers and logistics providers to manage and resolve supply chain issues as they arise. We have increased our North American margin guidance from approximately 23% to a range of between 23% and 23.5%. Based on a full year outlook on volumes and price cost relationship, we have recently seen a meaningful rise in steel index pricing, which will translate into higher input costs and relative to the first quarter, put pressure on North American margins in the back half of the year. We forecast that our steel cost in the second half of the year will be approximately 20% higher than the first half of the year. Our guidance assumes that other costs outside of steel remain relatively flat to our previous guidance, with favorable adjustments in our transportation cost outlook offset by moderately higher costs outside of transportation. We expect to generate free cash flow of between $575 million and $625 million. For the year, CapEx should be between $70 million and $75 million. Corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $55 million. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately 24%. And as I noted earlier, we expect to repurchase approximately $300 million of shares of our stock, resulting in average outstanding diluted shares of $150 million at the end of 2023. The I will now turn the call back to Kevin, who will provide more color on our key markets and topline growth outlook and segment expectations for 2023, staying on slide 11. Kevin? Kevin Wheeler : Thank you, Chuck. We revised our 2023 sales projection to be approximately flat to 2022 at the midpoint, with a range of plus or minus 2%, which includes the following assumptions. Residential water heater demand was resilient in the first quarter, and therefore, we are raising our projection for the 2023 residential water heater industry volumes to be approximately flat to last year. We continue to monitor proactive replacement and new housing completions. Demand for commercial electric water heaters greater than 55 gallons was strong in the first quarter and orders remained strong in April. We have raised our guidance for commercial water heater industry volumes to increase mid-single digits compared to 2022. Our China business performed as expected in the first quarter. We believe it will take time for consumer confidence to strengthen and for the economy to improve in China. We reaffirm our guidance that our sales in China will grow 3% to 5% in local currency in 2023. Our guidance assumes volumes in China improved throughout the year. Our forecast assumes the Chinese currency will devalue approximately 2% in 2023 compared to 2022. We are adjusting our outlook for our boiler business. We believe channel inventory levels of residential boilers are more elevated coming into 2023 than what we assumed in our prior guidance. While commercial growth aligns with our previous guidance, the amount of inventory in the residential boiler market resulted in sluggish residential boiler sales in the first quarter and guides us to an annual growth outlook of mid-single digits. Demand for our energy-efficient custom commercial condensing boilers was steady in the first quarter and job quoting remains active, particularly in the key institutional vertical. Our outlook for the North America water treatment sales growth of 5% to 7% for 2023 has not changed. Based on these factors, we expect our North America segment margin to be between 23% and 23.5% and Rest of World segment margins to be approximately 10%. Please turn to slide 12. We are very pleased with our performance early in 2023. Demand for commercial electric water heaters rebounded to pre-2022 levels. We saw resilient demand for our residential water heaters. Our first quarter 2023 North America operating margin of 25.1% will drive significant full year margin improvement even as steel costs rise. In China, we saw sequential monthly improvement in our sales through April and we expect that to continue through the year. We are pleased with our free cash flow through March and we expect a strong rebound in free cash flow for the full year as China emerges from COVID-19-related disruptions, our dedicated focus on inventory reduction across our North America operations. Our focus remains on meeting the needs of our customers, as well as executing our key strategic objectives to advance our position as a leader in heating and treating water globally. Our strong brands across the portfolio, combined with technology-driven innovation and new product development will enhance our market leadership. And with our strong balance sheet, we are confident in our ability to capitalize on opportunities as we continue to execute our strategy. With that, we conclude our prepared remarks and we are now available for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Halloran of Baird. Michael Halloran : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning, Mike. Chuck Lauber : Good morning. Michael Halloran : Hey. Can you walk through what you are seeing on the water heater volume side, North America, obviously, a lot of variability here? You had destock period through last year, you look at December, January, February volumes are at least with the HRI says. Those are tracking above $9 million annualized at this point units seems a little hot maybe relative to what the run rate we have been talking about previously looked like. So maybe help understand what you think is going on underneath the hood, are there some element of restocking, do you expect some variability on those demand trends and how do you think about that working through the year? Kevin Wheeler : Yeah, Mike. Hi. It\u2019s Kevin. Listen, I am going to put it in four buckets for you. First, our emergency replacement demand is always going to be there. The one coal shallow rule always applies and that will continue. What we have seen though is the proactive replacement continues to be above our normal levels. We just got some updated on that just recently. So that\u2019s above average, so providing some additional volume. New construction completions were strong in Q1. So that also gave us a bump. And you mentioned about customers, we believe some, not all, a few customers, may be cut their inventories a little bit too low and there was some replenishment going on with some of our customers. So you put those four together, that kind of drives our Q1 and then our forward-looking guidance of getting back to flat to last year. We do expect Q1 to be down. We expect it to be down probably double digits. It\u2019s probably going to be in that low to single -- low single-digit category. Just remember that Q1 was a very strong quarter. It was the strongest quarter that we had and particularly March was the strongest month. So, but overall, pleased with the volume, pleased with the industry and look for kind of a flat 2023. Michael Halloran : Thanks for that. And then maybe also on the North American margins and how to think about modeling for the remainder of the year, 23%, 23.5% implies decent drawdown as we work through the year. Is that all back half weighted and is 2Q more comparable to 1Q and are there offsets to that decline as you think 1H to 2H that you are envisioning, whether incremental pricing or something else that might help that profile? Chuck Lauber : Yeah. I mean we see steel costs, my kind of two sides. The lowest in the first half of the year and they are going to be about 20% higher in the back half of the year. So while we started the year, which we are very pleased with our first quarter North America margins and our price cost relationship, steel by itself is going to be kind of a weight on the back half of the year. So we will see margins lower in the back half and then for the year 23%, the 23.5% operating margins. We kind of -- we see volumes splitting the year and kind of the typical cadence is stronger in the first half and a little weaker in the back half, 52% maybe it\u2019s typical in the front half and 48% in the back. We are a little stronger on our outlook here based on the strong Q1. We are probably more in the 53%, 47%. As you are aware, we have got a little bit easier comps in the second quarter and third quarter based on kind of the destocking last year. Material costs, we see relatively flat. So kind of the puts and takes on margins would be strong first half, give back a bit in the second half and end up in that 23% to 23.5%. Michael Halloran : Yeah. It\u2019s still good range. Thanks, Chuck. Really appreciate it. Thanks, Kevin. Operator : Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Saree Boroditsky of Jefferies. Please standby? Saree Boroditsky : The margin commentary, you talked about this being driven by higher steel costs in the back half. But within your guidance, are you baking in additional automatic retail pricing for this, so would that offset that. Chuck Lauber : We haven\u2019t changed any -- Saree, good morning. This is Chuck. We haven\u2019t changed any of our pricing policy. So we do have some formula pricing that\u2019s out there and that will flow kind of on the same leg as we have talked about before as steel costs go up and down. So we haven\u2019t changed any of that and along with kind of the steel price going up, some of that natural pricing through formulas will follow, either up or down as it moves as it has historically. Kevin Wheeler : Yeah. I would say when you look at our pricing, it\u2019s about where we expected it, and Chuck just mentioned, we haven\u2019t changed the way that our process works within our company. And I go back to, we will continue to monitor it as we always do and fall back to we have a pretty good track record of adjusting necessary. Saree Boroditsky : But within your current guidance, do you bake in any additional price increases or do you stay at current levels? Chuck Lauber : Yeah. We are not going to comment on future price increases. Just the commentary on its pricing in total and just to remind -- maybe remind everybody that, our last announced price increase was this November 2021. So we have kind of got a comp where full year 2022 pricing is in place. And so that just kind of wanted to remind everybody that it\u2019s out there for the full year last year and it\u2019s been -- we have anniversaried that price increase last fall. That was our final announced price increase. Saree Boroditsky : Okay. So just to be clear, I know we are not commenting on additional price increases going forward. So we can assume that additional price increases are not baked into guidance at this point, is that fair? Kevin Wheeler : We just don\u2019t comment on pricing forward looking. Saree Boroditsky : I have to try. And then just one last question, you mentioned China improving sequentially through the month. How did this trend in April and how are you thinking about the cadence of growth through the year? Thank you. Kevin Wheeler : Yeah. I -- we talked about it in our prepared remarks, China really kind of played out to what we thought. We did see, January result was a very tough month with Chinese New Year and so forth and particularly coming off of COVID and opening up, but we saw a month-over-month improvement. April is playing out really well. We are seeing our sellout improve over March. So the way we view it, we should see month-over-month, quarter-over-quarter, and remember that the fourth quarter is our strongest month there. So, but it\u2019s probably not the way we thought and as things settle in and consumers get a bit more comfortable, we are comfortable with our guidance of growth at 3% to 5% local currency. Chuck Lauber : Being down in the first quarter, but we do expect quarter-over-quarter we would be up each of the quarters going forward. Operator : Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Susan Maklari : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Susan Maklari : My first question is around -- as you think about steel moving higher and the potential for some pricing to come through. Do you think there was any pull forward that is happening in the market today or in the first quarter as some of your customers perhaps try to position themselves? Kevin Wheeler : I guess we can expect a little bit, but as I outlined recently of how the quarter played out in the buckets that we saw, I really don\u2019t feel talking with our businesses that there was much pull forward. I think it was people, one, taking care of their customers, number two, maybe balance out their inventory that was a bit light with some from our customers. But, overall, I don\u2019t think there was any pull forward with regards to steel. Susan Maklari : Okay. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then can you give a bit more color on what you are seeing on the commercial side? There\u2019s obviously been some cross currents there as you think about the underlying market. I know you mentioned that you expect your -- the volumes to be up mid-single digits there so, but -- for the industry, how are you -- what are you seeing on the ground there, any more color you can give? Kevin Wheeler : Yeah. I would tell you, it\u2019s -- one, the overall commercial market was up, but it was really driven by the commercial electric and the greater than 55-gallon. That really -- we thought that would not bounce back to pre-22 levels, and quite frankly, it did. So that\u2019s driving much of the growth. But we are also seeing growth see low-single digits in the gas side of the business. So commercial held up well and that\u2019s what gives us the comfort to move it up to that mid-single-digit growth rate. Operator : One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville of D.A. Davidson & Co. Your line is now open. Matt Summerville : Thanks. A couple of questions. Can you talk about the context of your M&A pipeline and actionability therein and what the step-up in repurchase activity maybe says or maybe doesn\u2019t say about the outlook for A.O. Smith with respect to M&A specifically? And then I have a follow-up. Kevin Wheeler : Yeah. Terrific. I will take the M&A. I will let Chuck comment on the repurchase. They are really not connected with regards to why we move them up. M&A pipeline continues to be, I\u2019d say, active particularly on the water treatment side of the business, but in other areas. So that hasn\u2019t changed and we continue to stay in close contact with our targets and looking for the right opportunities. So that\u2019s moving much like we thought it would be and we hope we will be able to deploy some capital in the near-term. Chuck Lauber : Yeah. With respect to the repurchase moving up $100 million, when we gave our outlook in January, we talked about our $200 million buyback outlook and we also talked about $400 million being authorized by the Board and we would kind of watch that through the year. Based upon our strong cash operations in Q1 and outlook for the year, we went ahead and moved that up to $300 million. So we felt very comfortable with that. Matt Summerville : Got it. And then maybe with respect to China, can you talk about more recent market share trends in both water heaters and water treatment. What you are seeing from a mix perspective and then how you would characterize inventory levels? Thank you. Kevin Wheeler : Okay. When we look at China, overall, we have talked about this, there\u2019s not a great market share outlet for us to -- we have to put pieces together. But when we look at our retail business, we look at our specialty store business, and overall, we are very comfortable that we are still one of the leaders in the market and we are getting our fair share of the business. Chuck Lauber : Yeah. The channel inventory is -- it\u2019s in a normal range kind of in that four weeks to six weeks. Kevin Wheeler : And coming back, just about the mix, the mix is holding pretty well. Our premium mix in all of our categories still continues to be moving up slightly in most of the categories. We talked a bit about our water treatment and how we introduced a new high flow product, which is in the premium sector. So it\u2019s been interesting to watch with the premium side of the mix and our premium customers continue to buy our products and we see that continuing through the rest of the year. Operator : One moment for our next question, please. Our next question comes from the line of Damian Karas of UBS. Your line is now open. Damian Karas : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Congrats on the quarter. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Chuck Lauber : Good morning. Damian Karas : So I wanted to ask you about your comments on channel inventories with North America pretty much being at normal levels exiting the quarter. You are already there for water heaters heading into 1Q, but it sounds like maybe boiler and water treatment caught you a bit by surprise, with respect to the inventory levels out there. Could you just maybe help us understand a little bit better on what you are seeing or hearing that gives you confidence that some of this more recent destocking is in fact flushed out? Kevin Wheeler : Well, let me start with that and Chuck can jump in. Boilers, I would say, a bit of a surprise. We kind of missed. We had such a strong fourth quarter and so that was a bit of a surprise what we had to sell through. The water treatment, I would say now, we knew there was still some inventory in the channel, particularly with our dealers and our specialty wholesalers and that works itself out. But the way I look at it right now, all of our channels, I think, inventories are right where they really need to be, quite frankly. And the only area that may have a little bit of a gap and will take care of that hopefully in Q2 would be on our commercial side of the business. But, overall, other than the boilers, I think we saw our inventories where we thought they should be with our customers. Damian Karas : Okay. Great. And I wanted to ask you about heat pumps, which is a topical subject matter at the moment, and I know, Kevin, you mentioned in the past, you are not expecting heat pumps to take over the water heater market anytime soon. There\u2019s still some cost and installation challenges. But I will say, I have seen quite a bit of incentives out there related to IRA rebates on heat pump water heaters. So I am curious if you started seeing any notable pickup in activity or maybe any changes in customer buying decisions as a result? Kevin Wheeler : I am not sure I would qualify it as any major changes. Rebates have been out there. They have been state. They have been local. Certainly, there\u2019s the federal side of this now. So what I would tell you that, heat pump continues to grow. It\u2019s coming off a very small base as we talked, is less than 2% of the overall water heater sold. But it\u2019s growing at that double digits pretty regularly each quarter. The future, it\u2019s going to continue to grow. It\u2019s a very good high-efficiency green product that I think has a place long term and so -- but it\u2019s going to continue to grow at a modest pace. Even with the incentives, we are probably going to need regulatory to really drive a fast increase in volume. But you can expect it to grow month-over-month, quarter-over-quarter for the foreseeable future. We are very high in heat pumps, both on the residential side and on the commercial side of the business. They are expensive. They do take a little bit to install. But from a consumer, from a commercial standpoint, they provide really good payback and a really good value proposition long term with the consumer or the business owner. Operator : Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Your line is now open. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Helen Gurholt : Good morning. Chuck Lauber : Good morning. Andrew Kaplowitz : Could you talk about margin performance in Rest of the World? I know you didn\u2019t change the margin guide in the segment for the year. But was a little low in Q1, was that just sort of a weaker start to the year in China as you talked about already. I think you had mentioned that you were going to spend more money on marketing, advertising, did you do that in Q1? Chuck Lauber : Yeah. That\u2019s -- the Q1 is -- I mean it aligns with our expectations. It\u2019s a little lower than last year. I would say last year was a bit oversized and you kind of look at history in our Q1. Q1 in China is always a bit of a challenge. We really cut back on spending last year in Q1 to help that margin. But it was -- the margin in Rest of the World was aligned with our expectations this year. We will, though, I mean, we are calling out to be, I think, 11% operating margin in China, roughly for the year and we expect the year-over-year growth in next quarters and we do expect to spend more on SG&A to drive some of that growth. So that\u2019s why we are not expanding that a great deal, but we are really pleased that we are kind of back to a growth mode once we get out of Q1. Andrew Kaplowitz : Very helpful. And then, Kevin and Chuck, as REITs have continued to come up and given the volatility around the banks in March, doesn\u2019t seem like you saw any hiccups, but did you -- when you are talking to your customers or channel partners, did you see anything that sort of worries you there, either in sort of core residential or commercial markets? Kevin Wheeler : I would say that this is anecdotal, okay? But it\u2019s -- there\u2019s always concerns right now with rates moving up and what that\u2019s going to mean for the economy, particularly in the back half. So everybody has it online, but they are not changing behavior. They are watching inventories closely, but customer demand still seems to be moving along both residentially and commercially. But there\u2019s this hint of a backdrop that the interest rates could cause some potential issues as we get into the back half of the year. We will have to see how that plays out. That\u2019s more conversation than actually what\u2019s happening on the ground today. Operator : Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Your line is now open. Jeff Hammond : Hey. Good morning. Kevin Wheeler : Hey, Jeff. Helen Gurholt : Good morning. Chuck Lauber : Good morning. Jeff Hammond : So I think you called out lower price in the first quarter and I just want to understand maybe the magnitude, one, is this all kind of material price formulas or is there something more broad? Chuck Lauber : Yeah. We are not really going to carve out the details around that. I will say, though, I mean, we are up on organic growth for the quarter. So the commercial growth -- residential growth outweighed the price. So we are pleased kind of with our margin expansion in Q1 knowing that we are going to see some pressure on steel in the back half of the year. Kevin Wheeler : Yeah. Jeff, I would just tell you a comment just a while back. really on the pricing side, it played out as we expected, quite frankly, and so maybe even a little bit better. But it played out well and we will continue to just continue to evaluate and make sure that our customers are competitive. I have always said that over and over in both channels and commercially. We are pleased with the quarter and we are pleased with the trend that we have today. Jeff Hammond : Okay. And then I think there was an earlier question about the cadence of North America margins. Is it simply 2Q looks like 1Q and then we get a step down to kind of fall within the guidance? Chuck Lauber : Yeah. It\u2019s roughly that. It\u2019s the real -- we really see some of those costs on the steel side that go up 20% in the back half of the year, weighing in on Q3 and Q4, early evening on the quarter, at least when we look at it today. Operator : One moment for our next question, please. Our next question comes from the line of David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Your line is now open. David MacGregor : Yes. Good morning, everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. David MacGregor : I wonder if we could just go back to China. Yeah. Good morning. I wonder if I could just go back to China and ask you to just talk about that 3% to 5% guidance for 2023. Can you sort of separate out price versus volume and help us just understand what\u2019s happening trend-wise there? And then also on China, if you could just talk about the extent to which you are expanding your distribution at this point and what that might represent in 2023? And then I have a follow-up question. Chuck Lauber : Yeah. It\u2019s mostly volume in China. There\u2019s a bit of price, but not nearly what we have seen in other parts of our businesses. So that 3% to 5% is based on what we believe with the opening in China and the COVID policies that we will see a step up. We are comfortable kind of with the order rates that came in April. We feel good about that. So it\u2019s largely volume. Distribution wise in China, we reduced some stores during the COVID period 2020 through 2021, but really distribution points are relatively stable. Not a lot of change on the distribution points, but we are comfortable with the outlets we have. David MacGregor : Okay. And then just if I could just expand on China for a second. I do have a follow-up question, but just to build a little further on the China question. as you look for that volume recovery, is it mostly in your median price point as opposed to your higher price point product. You mentioned earlier premium was doing well. So I just wanted to get some clarity on that. Kevin Wheeler : No. I would say that we are going to see it kind of a normal pattern coming out, maybe even leaning towards the premium a bit, because we do have some new products that have come out and we will introduce additional products through the year. So I would say that our purchasing or the consumer purchasing behavior of A.O. Smith products will be very similar to what we have seen in the past and hopefully maybe a bit of a step up on the premium side as these new products enter the market. Chuck Lauber : Yeah. We have seen our mix move to positive based on the premium products introduced in the last, call it, 12 months. So that mix on new products is helping a bit on the growth. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of David MacGregor of Longbow Research. One moment please. David MacGregor : Hi, there, again. Operator : David, your line is live. Chuck Lauber : Hey, David. Kevin Wheeler : Hey, David. You are pretty tough on the [Inaudible], so. Chuck Lauber : Welcome back. Kevin Wheeler : Welcome back. Thanks. Thanks again back in the queue. David MacGregor : Yes. Thank you all again. So I wanted to just ask about water treatment and just there\u2019s kind of -- this is kind of a long conversation we have been having over the last few years about profitability within water treatment and just wanted to get a sense of how you are thinking about the margin outlook in water treatment this year and just what the factors might be behind your thinking around that? Chuck Lauber : Yeah. So, for the quarter, I mean, water treatment is around 10% operating margin and as you know, we were at 10% and working our way up and our goal is still to expand those margins 100 basis points a year. We are a little behind the curve on that and trying to play a little bit of catch-up because of some of the cost price relationships there, which put a little pressure on operating margin. For the year, we are kind of looking at 11% operating margin. So we are looking to be a little bit better as we go through the year. But, yeah, we have a little catch-up to do on some cost increases. David MacGregor : Is it mix and new products that drive that improvement, are you just getting a little more progress around productivity and just what are the drivers behind that gradual improvement? Kevin Wheeler : Yeah. I think it\u2019s a combination of what you just mentioned. There will be some productivity. There will be some mix, because we are going to introduce some new products, particularly in our retail segment. So it will be a combination of productivity, mix and a few other things in that 100 basis point increase. David MacGregor : And then you mentioned in your M&A comment that water treatment, the opportunity looks perhaps a little more imminent? Kevin Wheeler : Yeah. I just look at water treatment, and again, I didn\u2019t say imminent, okay? I want to make sure that we are clear on that. But when you look at water treatment, it\u2019s a very fragmented market. A lot of smaller acquisitions, we think we are going to be part of the roll-up and so that area is always a bit more active than maybe some of our core products. But there\u2019s always opportunity there. We have to find the right fit, not only for us, but also for the people that would want to sell to us. But I think water treatment is going to be a primary focus and probably will have the most opportunity over the next few years for us. Not to say there\u2019s not others, but that\u2019s why it kind of singled out water treatment. Operator : At this time, I would like to turn it back to Helen Gurholt for any closing remarks. Helen Gurholt : Thank you everyone for joining us today. Let me conclude by reminding you that our global A.O. Smith team delivered strong first quarter performance and record first quarter EPS. We look forward to updating you on our progress in quarters to come. In addition, please mark your calendars to join our presentation at three conferences this quarter, Oppenheimer on May 9th, KeyBanc on May 31st, and William Blair on June 6th. Thank you and enjoy the rest of your day. Operator : Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. Without further ado, I'll hand the conference over to your first speaker, Helen Gurholt. Helen, please go ahead. Helen Gurholt : Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the A.O. Smith Second Quarter Conference Call. I'm Helen Gurholt, Vice President, Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis. Joining me today are Kevin Wheeler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer. In order to provide improved transparency into the operating results of our business, we provide non-GAAP measures. Free cash flow is defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures, adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted segment earnings and adjusted corporate expenses exclude the impact of impairment charges nonoperating noncash pension income and expenses as well as legal judgment income and terminated acquisition-related expenses. We also provide total segment earnings. Reconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and on our website. A friendly reminder that some of our comments and answers during this conference call will be forward-looking statements that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include matters that we described in this morning's press release, among others. Also, as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. We will be using slides as we move through today's call. You can access them on our website at investors.aosmith.com. I will now turn the call over to Kevin to begin our prepared remarks. Please turn to the next slide. Kevin Wheeler : Thank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 4, and we'll review a few highlights of our second quarter results. Our team delivered record adjusted EPS of $1.01 in the second quarter, driven by strong performance in our operating segment. We saw margin expansion in our North America segment, primarily due to a more favorable price cost relationship as well as robust demand for our commercial and residential water heaters. Our Rest of World segment delivered improved performance in the second quarter even as headwinds in the economy and currency exchange continue in China. Both China and India delivered sales growth of 15% local currency in the second quarter. Please turn to Slide 5. North America water heater sales decreased 2% in the second quarter of 2023 as higher volumes are offset by lower pricing. We saw continued resilience in residential water heater demand and year-over-year improvement in our commercial water heater business. Our North America boiler sales declined 13% in the second quarter compared to a tough comp last year as lower volumes more than offset the benefits from pricing. Channel inventory levels of residential and light commercial boilers remain elevated in the quarter as a warmer-than-normal winter resulted in lower industry demand. We believe channel inventory levels are approaching normal levels at the end of the quarter. Demand for our custom commercial high-efficiency condensing boilers, particularly our Hellcat Crest boilers with O2 sensing technology were steady in the quarter and continues to gain traction in the market. North America water treatment sales were down 2% in the second quarter of 2023 compared to another tough comp in 2022 as pricing and strong e-commerce sales were offset by lower sales in our specialty wholesale and dealer channels. Sales in the first half of 2022 benefited from strong shipments as supply chain constraints improved, and we worked out our order backlog. I'm particularly pleased with the margin improvement we have seen this quarter in our North America water treatment business. In China, second quarter sales increased 15% in local currency compared to the second quarter of 2022 which was negatively impacted by COVID-19-related shutdowns. Demand continued to improve for our products, particularly for residential and commercial water treatment products. Sales of water treatment consumables were particularly strong in the quarter. We also saw a favorable mix in our water treatment and electric water heater product categories this quarter as recently launched products continue to be well received by the market. I'm now on Slide 6. According to our recent national consumer survey, nearly 9 out of 10 Americans have concerns about microplastics in their drinking water. Reducing plastic pollution has long been a priority for our North America water treatment business. Our North America water treatment products filter enough water to potentially eliminate over 1 billion single-use plastic bottles per year. I am pleased to announce that all of our countertop and undersink water filters are now independently certified to remove up to 99.6% of microplastics in addition to over 70 other contaminants, including PFAS and pesticides. We remain committed to leading the charge in identifying and becoming certified to remove harmful contaminants as they emerge. I'll now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on our second quarter performance. Charles Lauber : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 7. Second quarter sales in the North America segment were $722 million, up 3% decline from the same period last year. The decrease is primarily driven by higher commercial and residential water heater volumes that were more than offset by lower boiler sales and pricing. Lower volumes contributed to approximately 1/2 of the organic growth decline. North America adjusted segment earnings of $194 million increased 19% compared with the second quarter of 2022. Adjusted operating margin of 26.9% improved 510 basis points from the segment adjusted operating margin in the second quarter of last year. The higher segment earnings and operating margin were primarily due to lower steel costs and higher volumes of commercial and residential water heaters partially offset by lower boiler volumes. Moving to Slide 8. Rest of World segment sales of $244 million increased 6% year-over-year and 12% on a constant currency basis. Currency translation unfavorably impacted segment sales by approximately $14 million. Our sales increase was primarily driven by higher consumer demand and favorable mix in China, particularly for residential and commercial water treatment products. India sales grew 15% in local currency in the second quarter compared to last year. Rest of World segment earnings of $28 million increased 56% compared to segment earnings in 2022. Segment operating margin was 11.6%, and an increase of 370 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year, primarily as a result of higher volumes of water treatment products and positive mix. Please turn to Slide 9. We generated free cash flow of $236 million in the first half of 2023, higher than the first half of 2022 due to higher earnings and lower working capital cash outlays primarily related to lower inventory levels and lower 2022 incentive payments paid in 2023. Our cash balance totaled $410 million at the end of June, and our net cash position was $204 million. Our leverage ratio was 9.8% as measured by total debt to total capital. Our strong annual free cash flow and solid balance sheet enable us to focus on capital allocation priorities and return of cash to shareholders. Earlier this month, our Board approved our next quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share. We repurchased approximately 1,075,000 shares of common stock in the first half of 2023 for a total of $70 million. We are committed to repurchasing $300 million of our shares for the full year of 2023. Let's now turn to Slide 10. In addition to returning capital to shareholders, we continue to see opportunities for organic growth driven by innovation and new product development across all of our product lines and geographies. We believe that our technology leadership and culture of innovation puts us in a strong position to capitalize on the mega trends of decarbonization and sustainability. The strength of our balance sheet also allowed us to pursue strategic acquisitions as we grow organically. Please turn to Slide 11 in our revised 2023 earnings guidance and outlook. We've increased our 2023 outlook with an expected adjusted EPS range of $3.45 and $3.60 per share. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS range represents an increase of 12% compared with 2022 adjusted EPS. Our outlook is based on a number of key assumptions, including our outlook assumes a relatively stable supply chain with limited disruption. We remain in close contact with our suppliers and logistics providers to manage and resolve supply chain issues as they arise. We have increased our North America full year margin guidance to a range of between 24% and 24.25% based on our full year outlook on volumes and price cost relationship. We will have higher steel costs in the back half of the year, which will put some pressure on North America margin. We forecast that steel costs in the second half of the year will be approximately 20% higher than the first half of the year. Our guidance assumes that other costs outside of steel remain at current levels. Our Rest of the World margin guidance of approximately 10% remains unchanged. We expect to generate free cash flow of between $550 million and $600 million. For the year, CapEx should be between $70 million and $75 million. Corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $55 million. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately 24%. And we expect to repurchase approximately $300 million of shares of our stock, resulting in an average outstanding diluted shares of $151 million at the end of 2023. We I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin, who will provide more color on our key markets and top line growth outlook for 2023, all staying on Slide 11. Kevin? Kevin Wheeler : Thank you, Chuck. We revised our 2023 sales projection to be a range of flat to up 2% compared to 2022, which includes the following assumptions. Residential water heater demand was resilient in the first half of the year. Therefore, we project 2023 residential water heater industry volumes to be flat to up 2% compared to last year. We continue to monitor proactive replacement and new housing completions, both of which remain strong. Demand for commercial electric water heaters greater than 55 gallons was strong in the first half of the year, which leads us to raise our guidance for commercial water heater industry volumes to increase mid-teens compared to 2022. We maintain our guidance that our sales in China will grow 3% to 5% in local currency in 2023. We believe it will take time for consumer confidence to strengthen and for the economy to improve in China. Our forecast assumes that the Chinese currency will devalue approximately 5% in 2023 compared to 2022. We have decreased our outlook for our boiler business from being up mid-single digits to being down high single digits compared to last year. Last year, our boiler business grew 28% compared to 2021 partially driven by our backlog reduction during the year. We believe channel inventory levels of residential and light commercial boilers were elevated coming into 2023. The mild winter and warm spring resulted in lower demand coming out of the heating season, which slowed channel inventory reduction efforts.  Orders for our energy-efficient custom commercial condensing boilers remain steady. Our outlook for North America water treatment sales growth of 5% to 7% for 2023 has not changed. We project that our sales in India will grow 15% compared to last year. Please turn to Slide 12. We are very pleased with our performance in the first half of 2023. Demand for our commercial water heaters was strong. We saw resilient demand for our residential water heaters as new housing completion and proactive replacement remain robust. Our second quarter '23 -- 2023 North America adjusted operating margin of 26.9% was driven by improved price cost relationship and will lead to a full year margin improvement even as our steel costs rise in the second half of the year. Our China business performed well in a weak economy in the second quarter with sales growth of 15% and operating margins of over 12%. Market-leading products such as our high flow and hot water purifiers as well as dual tank electric water heaters led to a positive mix in the quarter. India continues to outperform the industry as our innovative new products drive market share gains. As a final note, the U.S. Department of Energy has recently issued its proposal to raise the minimum energy efficiency standards for residential water heaters that is targeted to be affected in 2029. As we review the DOE's proposal, we continue to dialogue with the DOE and other industry participants to offer guidance from our unique market leadership perspective to ensure the final proposal considers all factors that may impact consumers, including affordability, installation challenges, market adoption and consumer awareness as well as state and local electrification regulations. As a leader in energy-efficient water heater solutions, we believe A. O. Smith is well positioned to deliver a broad range of products that will meet or exceed the DOE requirements. And finally, our focus remains on meeting the needs of our customers as we continue to execute key strategic objectives to advance our position as a global water technology leader. With that, we conclude our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first call comes from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Matt Summerville : A couple of questions. As we think about kind of the first half, second half margin cadence in North America, how should we be thinking about how much margin compression is going to come from steel versus maybe some of the mix headwinds you might have given the change in your boiler outlook for North America? And then I have a follow-up. Charles Lauber : Matt, this is Chuck. So when you kind of look at the front half, back half, I think of it in terms of 3 buckets, right? So you've got the price cost relationship to be compressed a bit by steel costs being up about 20%. That's probably the largest piece of the delta between first half and second half. Also the way the year is setting up on residential water heater, we've got the first half, and this is fairly typical, but maybe a little stronger than normal of residential and water heating at about 52.5% to 53% of the year, and then it is 47% to 47.5% in the back half. So there's a little bit of pressure on that because of the detriment of some volume on the residential side. And then the smallest piece, I would say, is kind of related to boilers in the mix, a little bit less mix on the higher end commercial boilers. Matt Summerville : Got it. And then as a follow-up, just with respect to China, can you talk about the sustainability of water treatment demand there that you saw in the second quarter, perhaps maybe why the water heater business may be lagging a bit? And maybe also comment on sell-in versus sell-through and inventory levels overall in China. Kevin Wheeler : That was quite a question, there's 4 of them in there. But let me just take the sellout. Sellout was good. It was double digits. We saw sellout improve in each of the months. And so that was a positive trend. Inventories are between that 1% and 2%. Charles Lauber : One to 2 months. Kevin Wheeler : One to 2 months, excuse me. Thank you, Chuck. 1 to 2 months and maybe just a tab but nothing out of the ordinary. And as far as going back to water treatment, we just have some terrific products out there that we've introduced, and we mentioned it in our remarks on the hot water purifiers that we have in the high flow. They just continue to be well received in the market. Clean water is a priority for the Chinese consumer. So we see that continuing. And then you throw on top of that, our consumables that were really strong, up over 20-plus percent. And each time we sell a water treatment product, we have that potential of the ongoing consumable for the next several years. So that's gone really well. We continue to see that being a priority for the consumer going into the back half of the year. And as far as water heating and water treatment and electrics, they are tighter bit to some new housing foundations. So that's been under pressure for a while. But the electric side performed well, particularly some of our product that we introduced last year, and that continues to move in the right direction. So overall to be up the 50% in Q2 considering the challenges that the economy is having there, I think, is a positive statement of our premium products and how they're viewed in the market. And maybe the last thing is, if you look at the back half, there is talk about China with some targeted stimulus that's going forward. They've also kind of pulled back on homes as not being able to buy them for speculation. So Q3 may be a little bit tougher, but there's still some positive momentum in a number of areas, not only with our products, but hopefully, with some of the economic stimulus that should take effect in the back half of maybe Q3 and part of Q4. Operator : And we have Michael Halloran from Baird. Michael Halloran : So just some help on the margins in North America here. If you look at the implied assumption in the back half of the year is kind of a historically high pullback in the margin levels and the steel assumptions that you laid out seem a little steep relative to what the market pricing is today. So maybe just help add some context to why there's that magnitude after all, it was an awfully impressive front half of the year on the margin side. And how we should think about that normalizing for you? Charles Lauber : Yes. I mean the 20% increase in the back half compared to the front half, it's a lag. So just to kind of remind you and everybody that there is kind of a 90 to 120-day lag on that pricing. And so even though steel costs have come down a little bit from the peak, they really are -- we're really being measured on those costs, particularly in the third quarter from kind of the February time frame for the next couple of months. So even though they've moderated a bit, we're going to see that headwind. I think the other piece on the mix side and taking the boiler outlook down a little bit, maybe causing a little more pressure, a little more pressure than what you might be accounting for. And I think also if you kind of think about just the volume side and what I mentioned earlier, that's causing a bit of a mark. We've got back half of the year pricing on boilers and water heating last year that [indiscernible] anniversary, right? So there was improvement year-over-year for the first half. from a comp perspective, but we won't be seeing that in the back half. Hope that helps. Michael Halloran : Okay. Yes, it does. And then second one is, I think Kevin in the prepared remarks, you squeezed any idea that you guys are pretty happy with the progression on the margins for your filtration business, water filtration business in the U.S. Just like some context there, is that scale, mix, operations, what are the moving pieces there? Charles Lauber : Yes. So I mean, we are pleased with the second quarter results for North America water treatment margins for the quarter are right around 12%. There's a couple of pieces of that. One is pricing that we put in last year that's now in place. That helps a bit. There's still some pressure on costs for the water treatment business, but a little relief on transportation is helping a bit. And our direct-to-consumer business was strong in the quarter. So we had a strong direct-to-consumer business that helped a bit on the margin side. So pleased with that. The volume, just recall that last year, we were working through -- we're working through getting our backlog down and got a little bit of benefit there. So pleased with the operating performance. Volume is kind of right where we expect and we expect 5% to 7% growth for the year. Kevin Wheeler : And maybe just throw in, the team is also doing an excellent job in vertically integrating and cost reductions. And that's going to continue as we go forward as well. We're -- if you recall, we've been a cause of some acquisitions. We're pulling the water treatment business together in 1 company and in 1 water treatment business and be able to leverage each of the locations and put production where it's the best cost for us. So overall, all the things that Chuck mentioned, and just a real strong focus on driving cost and continuous improvement has really benefited the organization. And I look at that continuing over the next 6, 7 months as well. Operator : We have David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Joseph Nolan : This is Joe Nolan on for David. I just have one quick follow-up on boilers. I think you talked about inventories approaching normalized levels kind of towards the end of the quarter. I guess if you could just talk a little bit more about order patterns and just when we might see those inventory levels officially get back to normalized levels and how you're thinking about approaching inventories in the back half of the year? Charles Lauber : Yes. I mean, we exited the second quarter -- or we exited this quarter now feeling like the inventories are approaching or we're probably putting in a good space on normal. Let me kind of break that into 2 pieces, though, on the boiler side. So there's our larger commercial product that's not really an inventory item. So that larger commercial product, and we mentioned -- Kevin mentioned the Crest 02 sensing product that is doing well. Those orders are steady, larger product really doesn't have any headwind in any way on kind of the inventory build, where we get the inventory product, and I'd say the lower, smaller, lighter commercial boilers, along with residentials where we're seeing some of that. But we do believe we're largely through that. And as we get into the heating season next year, we'll kind of have better visibility into kind of where we are on inventories, but we do believe we've kind of worked through that. Operator : Okay. Our next question comes from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Susan Maklari : When we think about the change in the guide, especially as it relates to the boilers, is there anything also in there as it relates to price especially as you think about some of the changes in demand and perhaps some of the shifts in the steel costs over the last few quarters? Charles Lauber : Our assumption, I'll just kind of summarize it is overall, our price/cost relationships a bit improved, and that's driving a piece of that increase. Susan Maklari : Okay. And then I guess if we think about the residential water heater demand, and the levels that it's been running for the industry and for yourselves through May, Europe really nicely versus 2019 even with the level of demand that we saw during the pandemic. Can you just on a higher level, perhaps talk about what are some of the core strengths of that demand, and how do you think about the sustainability of the current level of volumes of the industry and that yourselves are seeing in here as we look out over the next, call it, 12 or even 24 months? Kevin Wheeler : Well, let's just maybe break that down into, again, the replacement side. It's always going to be resilient. The emergency replacement that continues. When we look at right now where it's at, on the proactive side of the business, people are -- we look at -- renovation is still a priority for current homeowners and people are going to be staying in their homes, protecting their mortgage interest rates. So we think that's part of it as it continues to move forward, and we remain an important component of our volume. And then new construction, if you look at just completions have been pretty steady and moving up as well. So and then you look at new builder new builders are confident going forward. So overall, yes, we're up over the 2019, but we had a CAGR of 1.5% to 2% CAGR that you have to put on the 2019 number. And as you start to look at where we're ending up this year, what we think we're going to end up, it's going to be fairly in line with where the industry would have benefit. We didn't go through the ups and downs of the pandemic. So I think we get -- we had a little mixed up in 2021 and '22. And now we're starting to see things more normalize and the economy has been good, housing's been good, our renovations have been good. So if you look out in the next 12 to 24 months, I think we'll start to see more of the normalized growth rate coming out of our water heater business. And maybe just a tad more depending on where interest rates go and how the economy continues to progress. Operator : Thanks. And our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : Can you talk about the strength you continue to see in commercial water heaters here in North America, maybe the durability of that strength. You raised your forecast a little bit for the year. You've had easy comps, obviously, given the regulatory situation. But could you talk about, as financing costs have been slowly moving up, it still seems like the demand is quite strong in that business. Kevin Wheeler : On the commercial water heater side, and again, that's different from boilers because it has the same profile as a residential with emergency replacements and so forth that remains strong. And again, the comps get a little bit difficult because of the greater than 55-gallon electrics. So there was a regulatory change that caused it to downturn in the quarter of 2020 in first quarter. And now we're starting to really stabilize -- and it looks like the greater than 55-gallon electrics going to kind of come back in to where it was prior to that regulatory change. We're also seeing good mid-single growth on commercial gas as well. And from our perspective, we still have a backlog. And we're still working through it. It's -- we're making progress on it. But the industry seems to be resilient. I look at restaurants and the areas that we sell quite a bit of prior to restaurants, hotels, those things are still coming back and our units are being exercised more. So that's been a plus for us. So overall, it looks like the industry is again kind of coming back to a normal level of volume coming off, if you remember, in '21, we were up, I think, 11%, in '22, we were down 17%, and now we're moving up to mid-teens. But I think when you level it all out, we're getting back to a normal cadence. And again, from our perspective, we've been outperforming the market in both our residential and commercial products in 2023. Andrew Kaplowitz : That's helpful. And then you didn't change your Rest of World assumption for margin for the year, but you did see a nice step up in Q2, which I think you predicted. But I think you also suggested that you would see incremental margin improvement as the year went on. And again, you didn't change your overall year guidance. So are you seeing any incremental competitive pressure given the tough China market or incremental supply chain headwinds? Or is it just kind of conservatism given the good Q2 results? Charles Lauber : Well, we are really pleased with Q2, right? China's margins were about 12%. We're very pleased with the results in China for the quarter. If you look out for the rest of the year and China drives the majority of the results in the Rest of the World, Q3 -- I'm sorry, Q4 is the big, I'll call it, holiday shopping, online shopping quarter. Typically, when we have our largest sales, we are turning a quarter on volume, growing 3% to 5% is our outlook. And it will be important we invest behind that. So some of that is waiting to see how Q3 plays out, which we expect we'll be fine, but not a ton of volume and then investing behind kind of the growth in Q4 keeps the margins a little bit in line with that 11% -- 10%, 11%. But nothing from a competitive nature that we're concerned about. Operator : Thank you very much. And our next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Adam Farley : This is Adam Farley on for Nathan Jones. Most of my questions have already been answered, but I wanted to ask about your capital allocation, the balance sheet remains very strong net cash position. What are the priorities for putting this to work for shareholders? And are there any M&A opportunities out there to move this capital forward? Charles Lauber : Yes. I mean capital allocation really hasn't changed. We're going to continue to invest in ourselves, making sure that we're investing in the new product developments, the plant automation and the efficiencies that we know we need to continue to drive. Our dividends, we continue to have an increasing dividend year-over-year, and we've declared the next dividend. So dividends would be a part of that for sure. We've got from a stock buyback, we certainly are in a good underlevered position. So we do expect to repurchase $300 million of shares this year, and that's expected to be carry out. From an M&A perspective, I'd say it's still active. So we've talked in the past about looking at kind of our priorities around water treatment. We still see opportunities to grow geographically in North America. We see opportunities to look to acquire maybe in the commercial space in water treatment. We also looked globally since that's a global technology and global product, other markets where we can see our positioning in a premium space are also of interest. So continue to be active, and we look to deploy capital. Operator : Stand by for our next caller who is Damian Karas with UBS. Damian Karas : So sorry if I missed this, but I was hoping you might be able to give us a sense for pricing in the second quarter in North America, kind of thinking about the 3 product categories, water heaters, boilers and water treatment, if you can maybe just give us a sense where pricing is trending? And is kind of the expectation as we get through the rest of the year, maybe a little bit of modest price fade in North America water heaters, just given kind of steel indexing, but no real formally announced price increases kind of in the wholesale channels? Charles Lauber : Yes. Just a couple of comments. And we don't get into a lot of detail on pricing. But for the quarter, we've got pricing that's year-over-year improvement in boilers and water treatment because we've got price increases this year that were announced at the end of last year. So a little bit of improvement there. I think if you just look at North America overall in our bridges in our presentation, we show what organic -- we had a decrease in organic growth. About half of that is volume. So you kind of infer the other half is right around pricing. So if you look at the North America piece in total, it's fairly weighted on organic growth equally on where the pressure is. Back half of the year, we've increased our guidance from where we were for North America margins. So just kind of looking across North America, we're seeing a little bit of improvement. Our, still, outlook really hasn't changed. Kevin Wheeler : Yes, just maybe another comment on this is, again, we're very consistent in how we manage our businesses and our pricing. There's not much difference from Q1 to Q2. We continue to have the underlying goals to keep our customers competitive. We look at both the markets that we're in and the boiler market, that's remained very consistent. So not a big change. Again, we sell on A. O. Smith value quality delivery, a number of other things that go forward that's been consistent for a number of years, and it's not changing as we enter the back half of the year. Damian Karas : Understood. And then, Kevin, I think you mentioned kind of getting back to normalized demand for resi water heaters. So I'm just curious how you're thinking today about what normalized demand is. I think historically, maybe you guys have talked about flattish to up a few points of volumes on an annual basis. plus a few points perhaps of price/mix. But how are you thinking about what that kind of framework is thinking of IRA, energy transition, other factors at play today? Kevin Wheeler : Yes. I don't think about some of the industry as a whole has changed a whole lot. That 1% to 2% growth is pretty consistent, and it does move a bit when you have new construction. And again, we're in this economy right now, I mean the economy is still doing pretty well. GDP came out, still moving in the right direction. Housing were still at a deficit. You've heard us say that. I think how many years in a row. There's quite a bit of work to be done, maybe a few million homes that still need to be built. So I think the case is going to get back to that 1% or 2% and probably the variable will be new construction in multifamily, how that continues to progress over the next couple of years. My guess is probably going to be a bit favorable to the industry and to our company. Charles Lauber : And just a comment around the IRA Act. I mean, there are incentives in there in the IRA act for heat pump water heaters, high-efficiency water heaters. Certainly, that's an upside, but we have -- we really haven't seen traction to move the consumer's decision away from kind of the decisions they make today on replacement, which generally is under an emergency replacement type of environment to trade up to an energy-efficient product with a supplement on some sort of incentive through IRA Act. But certainly a longer-term opportunity as we look at that. Operator : Thank you very much. And our last call comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jeffrey Hammond : Just on resi water heaters. So I wanted to come back to price because I think you said it was going to be similar, but I'm just wondering if some of the material price formulas flip into the second half with the steel up. And then just how should we think about your 0 to 2 industry number given that it seems like first half was a little more resilient destocking done and the comps, obviously, in the second half are really easy? Charles Lauber : Yes. Let me talk about the industry first. And if we kind of look back and look back at our Q1, we talked about coming out of 2022 with inventories normal, and I think they might have been a little low. So we have got a little help in Q1 on volumes, building back some of the inventories in the industry that may have been depleted a bit. So kind of a little bit of help in that category. I think if you look at the full year though, and Kevin kind of described it, if you skip COVID, and you just go to 2019 and the 5 years before, and take an average of where we are in those 5 years and then look at the jumping off point of 2019, take a CAGR of 1.5%. And you're kind of in the ballpark of where we have the industry this year at flat to up a little bit. The industry ended last year in the tank side on residential, it may be and change. And if we're flat to that or a little bit up, that's a 1.5% CAGR jumping off between 2019. The other part of your question, could you remind me on that? Jeffrey Hammond : Just material price formulas move... Charles Lauber : Yes. I mean as steel also follows what we see on anything we have with material price in the steel portion is that there's a 90- to 120-day lag. So that portion also sees pricing follow. Kevin Wheeler : Yes. And that's baked into our guidance. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay. And then last one, water treatment, I think you're kind of flat to slightly down first half, you're saying 5% to 7%. Is that just lapping tough comps? Or what's driving kind of the [indiscernible] there? Kevin Wheeler : Well, certainly, it's lapping a tough comp. I mean, if you look at all of our businesses, Q2 of last year, we were strong. But I'll give you an example. I mean, the North America water treatment back in Q2 of 2022, it was plus 18%. So it was solid. And but we are seeing some softness in various parts of the market as things start to stabilize. But overall, if you look at our 5 core channels, we still see positive growth in them over time. And so that's just that 2% of 18% comp, still a pretty good quarter, quite frankly, for our water treatment business. And in every one of those channels, we have some ups and downs. I yet to see all 5 up and I have to see all 5 down. And so -- but overall, the business is going well. I suspect we'll see our deal or specialty business make and come back in the back half of the year as they were down a little bit in Q2. But overall, the business is in good shape. The overall underlying water quality concerns are going to continue to grow, and that's the key point. I think when you look at this business, you're going to have your PFAS and different type of chemicals and the quality of water being questioned by consumers on a regular basis. And we have great solutions, whether they be under the counter or point of use or point of entry. And we're going to be able to take advantage of that trend as it continues to go forward as we have in the past. Operator : Since I'm showing no further questions at this time, I will turn the conference back to Helen Gurholt for closing remarks. Helen Gurholt : Thank you, Eric, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Let me conclude by reminding you that our global A.O. Smith team delivered record second quarter performance and record EPS. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the quarters to come. Please mark your calendars to join our presentations at 3 conferences this quarter : North Coast on August 7, Stifel on September 6 and Davidson on September 21. In addition, we are very pleased to announce that we will host an Investor Day on Monday, November 6, in Chicago, Illinois. Invitations to register for our event will be forthcoming in September. Thank you, and enjoy the rest of your day. Operator : And this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call over to our first speaker for today, Helen Gurholt. Your line is now open. Helen Gurholt : Good morning, and thank you, everyone, for your patience while we dealt with our technical difficulties. Welcome to our A. O. Smith\u2019s third quarter conference call. I\u2019m Helen Gurholt, Vice President, Investor Relations and Financial Planning & Analysis. Joining me today are Kevin Wheeler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer. In order to provide improved transparency into our operating results of our business, we provided non-GAAP measures. Free cash flow is defined as cash from operations, less capital expenditures. Adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted segment earnings and adjusted corporate expenses exclude the impact of impairment charges, nonoperating noncash pension income and expenses as well as legal judgment income and terminated acquisition-related expenses. We also provide total segment earnings. Reconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and on our website. A friendly reminder that some of our comments and answers during this conference call will be forward-looking statements that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include matters that we described in this morning\u2019s press release, among others. Also, as a courtesy to those in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. We will be using slides as we move through today\u2019s call. You can access them on our website at investor.aosmith.com. I will now turn the call over to Kevin to begin our prepared remarks. Please turn to the next slide. Kevin Wheeler : Thank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m on slide 4 and will review a few of our third quarter highlights. I\u2019m very pleased with the execution of our team across all of our businesses to deliver a strong third quarter EPS of $0.90. The performance of our North America segment was particularly strong. We saw resilient demand for our residential water heaters as well as year-over-year improvement in our operating margin. China\u2019s new products drove year-over-year improvement as newly introduced kitchen appliance products were well received by the market. Innovative new products, combined with our strong brand, drove growth despite a continued challenging economic backdrop. India entered the year introducing a number of new products in both the water heating and water treatment categories and has delivered year-to-date sales growth of 17% in local currency. We also acquired Water Tec, a high-quality Arizona-based water treatment company. This acquisition aligns with our strategic growth aspirations to expand water treatment across the U.S. We welcome Water Tec team to the A. O. Smith family. Please turn to slide 5. North America water heater sales increased 13% in the third quarter as a result of continued strength in residential water heater demand. As you may recall, sales in the third quarter of last year were negatively impacted by channel inventory destocking of residential water heaters, primarily in the wholesale channel. Our North America boiler sales declined 18% in the third quarter against a difficult comp in 2022. In the third quarter last year, we worked down our backlog after making significant production and supply chain improvements. We believe channel inventories are approaching normal levels. Demand for our commercial high-efficiency condensing boilers, particularly our Hellcat CREST boilers remained steady in the quarter. North America water treatment sales increased 5% in the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by pricing and e-commerce sales. The quarter also benefited from pricing-related margin improvement. In China, third quarter sales increased 9% local currency compared with the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to our newly introduced dishwasher and steam oven products. The quarter also benefited from higher commercial water treatment sales and positive mix. I\u2019m now on slide 6. We continue to introduce new innovative products in water filtration. I\u2019m pleased to highlight the launch of our new SmartFlow reverse osmosis filtration system under both our A. O. Smith and Aquasana brands. The product takes up less space and features an easy filter replacement process. Our SmartFlow technology features a multistage filtration process that removes up to 99.9% of 90 contaminants, including PFAS, arsenic, microplastics and lead. It also features our innovative and exclusive side stream reverse osmosis technology, making this one of the most water-efficient systems in the market. This is one example of our commitment to bringing innovative water heating and water treatment -- treating products to the global market. On November 6th, at our Investor Day, each of our businesses will highlight new products that are driving results in the marketplace. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on our third quarter performance. Chuck Lauber : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m on slide 7. Third quarter sales in the North America segment were $710 million, a 9% increase over the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by higher residential water heater volumes that were partially offset by lower boiler volumes. North America segment earnings of $170 million increased 28% compared with the adjusted segment earnings in the third quarter of 2022. Operating margin of 23.9% improved 350 basis points compared to adjusted segment operating margin in the third quarter of last year. The higher segment earnings and operating margin were primarily due to higher residential water heater volumes and lower steel costs, partially offset by lower boiler volumes. Segment pricing was relatively flat in the quarter compared to last year. Moving on to slide 8. Rest of the World segment sales of $233 million increased 1% year-over-year and 6% on a constant currency basis. Currency translation unfavorably impacted segment sales by approximately $11 million. Sales of newly introduced kitchen appliance products, higher commercial water treatment sales and a positive mix in China drove the sales increase in the quarter. India sales grew 13% in local currency in the third quarter compared to last year. Rest of the World segment earnings of $23 million increased 6% compared to segment earnings in the third quarter of 2022. Segment operating margin was 9.9%, an increase of 40 basis points compared to the same period last year, primarily as a result of higher sales of new products and a positive mix. Please turn to slide 9. We generated free cash flow of $396 million in the first nine months of 2023, more than 2 times the free cash flow generated in the same period last year. This was largely due to higher earnings and lower working capital cash outlays, primarily related to lower inventory levels and lower 2022 incentive payments paid in 2023. Our cash balance totaled $342 million at the end of September, and our net cash position was $212 million. Our leverage ratio was 6.4%, as measured by total debt to total capital. Our free cash flow and solid balance sheet enable us to focus on capital allocation priorities and return of cash to shareholders. Earlier this month, our Board approved a 7% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.32 per share. We repurchased 2.4 million shares of common stock in the first nine months of 2023 for a total of $161 million. We expect to repurchase $300 million of our shares for the full year 2023. Let\u2019s now turn to slide 10. In addition to returning capital to shareholders, we continue to see opportunities for organic growth through innovation and new product development across all of our product lines and geographies. The strength of our balance sheet also allows us to pursue strategic acquisitions along with organic growth. Please turn to slide 11 and our revised 2023 earnings guidance and outlook. We have increased our 2023 outlook with an expected adjusted earnings per share range of $3.70 to $3.80 per share. The midpoint of our adjusted earnings per share range represents an increase of 19% compared with 2022 adjusted EPS. Our outlook is based on a number of key assumptions, which include a stable supply chain with limited disruption. We have increased our North America full year margin guidance to be approximately 25% based on our full year outlook on volumes and price cost relationship. We forecast that our Q4 material costs will be similar to our Q3 material costs. Our Rest of the World margin guidance of approximately 10% remains unchanged. We expect to generate strong free cash flow of between $575 million and $600 million. For the year, CapEx should be approximately $65 million. Corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $60 million. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately 24%. And with the expectation to repurchase approximately $300 million of shares of our stock, the resulting average outstanding diluted shares, is expected to be 151 million at the end of 2023. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Kevin, who will provide more color on our key markets, top line growth outlook and segment expectations for 2023, staying on slide 11. Kevin? Kevin Wheeler : Thank you, Chuck. We have narrowed our 2023 sales outlook to grow approximately 2% compared to 2022, which was the high end of our previous guidance. Our outlook includes the following assumptions : Residential water heater orders remained strong through October. Therefore, we project 2023 residential water heater industry volumes will increase approximately 4% compared to last year. We continue to monitor proactive replacement and new housing completions, both of which remain favorable. Demand for commercial electric water heaters greater than 55-gallon continue to be robust. Our guidance for commercial water heater industry volumes to increase mid-teens compared to 2022 is unchanged. We maintain our guidance that our sales in China will grow 3% to 5% local currency in 2023. Our forecast assumes that the Chinese currency will devalue approximately 6% in 2023 compared to 2022. Our boiler business outlook of being down high single digits compared to last year is unchanged. As a reminder, 2022 is a difficult comp. We entered last year with a large backlog, which we worked down and exited the year with a normalized backlog, partially contributing to our boiler business growth of 28% in 2022. Our outlook for North America water treatment sales is to grow approximately 5% to 7% for 2023 also has not changed. We project that our sales in India will grow 15% this year. Please turn to slide 12. Again, we are very pleased with our performance in the first nine months of 2023. In North America, residential commercial water heater demand remained strong through the third quarter. The year is lining up to have a normalized split of approximately 52% of volume in the first half of the year and 48% in the back half of the year. As we expected, North America operating margin was down sequentially in the quarter, but remained strong relative to historical performance at 23.9%, even as we recognized higher steel costs in the quarter, compared to the first half of the year. In China, the team continues to execute very well across our various product lines through a balanced go-to-market channel strategy. New product introductions, continued growth in commercial water treatment and positive mix led to a 10% operating margin in the quarter. India continues to outperform the industry. We see great potential for our India business as it continues to deliver growth through new product introductions and premium customer service. Our focus remains on taking care of our customers as we continue to execute our key strategic objectives to advance our position as a global water technology leader. With that, we conclude our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Halloran of Baird. Your line is now open. We will now move to our next question. Please stand by. Our next question comes from the line of Saree Boroditsky from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Saree Boroditsky : Hi. Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. So just digging a little bit more about North America residential water demand, it obviously came in much stronger than you initially anticipated at the start of the year. What\u2019s been the biggest surprise for you as you went from thinking volumes are going to be down 3% to 5% to now up 4%? And how does that set you up as we look into 2024? Kevin Wheeler : Well, I\u2019ll tell you -- and we\u2019ve been talking about it each quarter, a biggest surprise has been the proactive replacement side of the business. That\u2019s -- we thought that would moderate as we came into 2023. And quite frankly, it stayed strong and continues to be strong. And we\u2019re very pleased with our number of completions that\u2019s been positive as well. So you put those two together, a surprise, yes, but along with having that strong convergence in place. I mean, you put the two together, and it\u2019s been a good year for water heater demand, and we see that continuing into the fourth quarter. Saree Boroditsky : And then maybe just staying on that similar type of question. Obviously, North America margins have been stronger than you expected. It looks like price cost has been better. What was that contribution in the quarter? Is there anything else outside of higher volumes that we should think about with this year\u2019s margin performance? And is it a good starting point as we think about 2024? Chuck Lauber : Yes. I mean, when you look at our organic growth for the North America segment -- this is Chuck, by the way. Good morning. The pricing contributed very little to segment growth. We had a little bit of incremental pricing on the boiler and water treatment side, a slight headwind on the water heating side. But most of the organic growth in North America was contributed to volume. Saree Boroditsky : Is there any onetime items in this year that we should think about or is this a good starting point for -- as we think about 20242? Chuck Lauber : No, there\u2019s nothing significantly -- nothing significant from a onetime item. We are pleased with how the quarter came out from a margin perspective. Margins remain fairly resilient. Operator : Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones of Stifel. Your line is now open. Nathan Jones : I just wanted to follow up on the proactive replacement side of the business, and just see if you can give any more color or any thoughts around why that continues to be so strong. I mean, I would have -- I know part of that is typically generated when you have sales in existing homes. Obviously, high interest rates discourage the sale of existing homes, but that business has continued to be really strong for you guys. Do you think there\u2019s something that\u2019s structurally changed in that market? Would you still expect it to go back to a more normal mix or a more traditional mix of the business? Just any more commentary you can give us on why you think that business is and continues to be so strong? Kevin Wheeler : Well, you outlined many of the reasons right now. Certainly, people are staying in homes. There\u2019s higher renovation. People aren\u2019t moving, so they\u2019re taking different actions. There\u2019s some anecdotal here that we just have to be careful with. Really proactive replacement has been trending up since about 2019. And so, we don\u2019t take one year as a trend. But we\u2019re in our fourth year here, and it hasn\u2019t really changed. And there\u2019s some anecdotal evidence here that there\u2019s some generational impact here. And so, where you look at a maybe a baby boomer would wait till it breaks, maybe the younger generation, Gen Zs and millennials indicate that they do a bit more proactive work than their predecessors. But, I would take that with a grain of salt right now, but it\u2019s one trend that we watched now for a number of months, and it hasn\u2019t changed, and it continues to be strong. So you put that together, is there a generational impact there? Maybe. But we\u2019ll continue to monitor it. But right now, it\u2019s held up surprisingly well now for 16 straight quarters. Nathan Jones : That would be a nice tailwind, if it\u2019s a structural change to the industry. I guess, my second... Kevin Wheeler : I would tell you, we think that as well, but we\u2019re not ready to say that. But again, it\u2019s something we watch and the data that we use, we\u2019ve been doing this for a decade-plus. So, it\u2019s been a good guidepost for us long term. But again, we\u2019ll see how it plays out. But right now, we see the proactive side of it holding up pretty well. Nathan Jones : That\u2019s good news. Second question on, I guess, your cost input. You guys had guided to seeing sequentially lower margins in the second half than the first half. And despite the outperformance you\u2019re still are getting a bit lower margins in the second half than the first half, with higher-priced steel costs rolling through the P&L in the second half. We did see pretty significant declines in steel costs over the last six odd months before the last week. Should we expect to see that start rolling P&L in the first half of \u201824, and you should get some nice benefit from a price cost standpoint in the first half price of 2024? Kevin Wheeler : [Technical Difficulty] Operator : Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Blair of Oppenheimer. Bryan Blair : To help us think about Rest of World segment profitability and your potential there, how does the contribution margin on your new China offerings compared to segment average? And what\u2019s the run rate margin in India? And how does your team think about operating leverage there? Kevin Wheeler : [Technical Difficulty] Bryan Blair : That makes sense. Any quick color you\u2019d offer on your M&A pipeline? You\u2019ve executed some bolt-ons that are pretty down the middle in terms of your water treatment strategy. It\u2019s been an interesting year with macro uncertainty in the rate environment and just that overall mosaic. Just curious how your deal funnel has progressed and how your team is thinking about actionability over the near term? Chuck Lauber : [Technical Difficulty] Operator : Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari of Goldman Sachs. Susan Maklari : Maybe to start with, I\u2019m not sure if maybe it\u2019s our line, but I think you broke up a little bit when you were talking about the previous question on raw materials and how we should be thinking about steel over the next coming quarters. Can you just maybe perhaps go back and reiterate some of those key points for us? Chuck Lauber : [Technical Difficulty] Susan Maklari : No, you\u2019re very clear right now. Chuck Lauber : [Technical Difficulty] Susan Maklari : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. And then, following up on the conversation earlier as well on thinking of proactive replacement versus the more nondiscretionary pieces of there. Can you give a bit more color perhaps on how you\u2019re defining one versus the other? And as you\u2019re thinking about that potential structural shift that\u2019s coming through, any thoughts on what portion of the volumes today or the demand today is really sort of coming from that proactive replacement relative to the sort of nondiscretionary side of it? Kevin Wheeler : [Technical Difficulty] Operator : Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Andy Kaplowitz : Kevin and Chuck, can you give us more color into the components of China growth in terms of the strength in commercial water treatment and the new products growth you\u2019re seeing as well as the mix benefit you\u2019re getting? And then, how do you think about the durability of that growth going into \u201824? Kevin Wheeler : [Technical Difficulty] Andy Kaplowitz : It\u2019s very helpful. And then maybe shifting back to North America, commercial water heaters, you\u2019ve kept up pretty impressive strength. Maybe the expected duration of that strength, have you still seen reasonably good quoting activity? Any sort of conversations you\u2019re having, given the rise in rates lately? Any color would be helpful. Kevin Wheeler : [Technical Difficulty] Operator : Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville of D.A. Davidson & Company. Matt Summerville : Can you guys hear me? Is it clear because every answer is really garbled on my end and that\u2019s happening to at least one other sell-side counterpart that I\u2019m aware of, just FYI. Kevin Wheeler : [Technical Difficulty] Matt Summerville : Yes, yes. No, I appreciate that. If this has already been asked, I completely apologize, but the channel inventories, can you give us kind of what you\u2019re thinking as a year-end assessment, channel inventories will look like in North America in resi water heaters, commercial water heaters, boilers and treatment and how that may inform you as to the volume outlook for each, respectively, a level for next year? Chuck Lauber : [Technical Difficulty] Matt Summerville : Yes, I can. Chuck Lauber : [Technical Difficulty] Matt Summerville : Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, and again, my apologies if you answered this already. You\u2019ve obviously kind of been benefiting from this product cycle, if you will, in China as it relates to your kitchen-related offering. When did those products launch? And how should we think about the duration of that cycle on the top line just in the context of the macro environment in China? Thank you. Kevin Wheeler : [Technical Difficulty] Operator : Thank you. Please stand by for our last question. Our last question comes from the line of Damian Karas of UBS. Damian Karas : I can hear you guys loud and clear now, but I do echo Matt\u2019s comment, I literally haven\u2019t been able to understand a lick of anything you said since we started the Q&A. I think what\u2019s going on is like the analyst that asks the question can hear you, but it\u2019s very kind of garbled for everybody else. So I do apologize for touching on ground you\u2019ve already covered here, but I wanted to ask about the proactive replacement, just a follow-up. I\u2019m just trying to think of like to what extent may be IRA and some of these efficiency credits are factoring in. So, I\u2019m curious if you\u2019re actually seeing any notable mix shifts on the efficiency scale in that proactive replacement or not really? Chuck Lauber : [Technical Difficulty] Damian Karas : Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. And just having seen steel prices move lower since where we started earlier in the year, how are you thinking about the next potential price cost impact from that? Just realizing that you do have some floating price but also index price. Chuck Lauber : [Technical Difficulty] Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Helen Gurholt for closing remarks. Helen Gurholt : [Technical Difficulty] Operator : Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call over to our first speaker for today, Helen Gurholt. Please go ahead. Helen Gurholt : Thank you Abigail. Good morning everyone and welcome to the A. O. Smith\u2019s full year and fourth quarter conference call. I\u2019m Helen Gurholt, Vice President, Investor Relations and Financial Planning & Analysis. Joining me today are Kevin Wheeler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer. In order to provide improved transparency into the operating results of our business, we provided non-GAAP measures. Free cash flow is defined as cash from operations, less capital expenditures. Adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted segment earnings and adjusted corporate expenses exclude the impact of impairment charges, non-operating noncash pension income and expenses as well as legal judgment income and terminated acquisition-related expenses. Reconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and on our website. A friendly reminder that some of our comments and answers during this conference call will be forward-looking statements that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include matters that we described in this morning\u2019s press release, among others. Also, as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. We will be using slides as we move through today\u2019s call. You can access them on our website at investor.aosmith.com. I will now turn the call over to Kevin to begin our prepared remarks. Please turn to the next slide. Kevin Wheeler : Thank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m on slide 4 in our full-year results. 2023 was a record-studying sales and earnings year, driven by resilient water heater demand and excellent execution by our team. North America sales increased 4% and adjusted segment margin increased 310 basis points due to higher water heater volumes and improved price-cost relationship. Our rest-of-wall segment, sales grew 4% in local currency as our recently introduced kitchen products in China were well-received by the market. In India, our sales grew 15% local currency in 2023 and benefited from sales of new products which represented 30% of our sales. Free cash flow grew to $598 million, primarily driven by record profit. We returned $490 million of capital to shareholders with our dividend and share repurchases. Please turn to slide 5. Our global A. O. Smith team delivered record sales of $3.9 billion in 2023 and adjusted EPS of $3.81, a 21% increase over 2022. North America water heater sales grew 6% in 2023 due to strong demand for our residential and commercial water heater products. The residential unit industry demand increased approximately 6% compared to 2022, as new construction and proactive replacement demand remained resilient. Commercial industry units increased approximately 15% year-over-year, as volume of commercial electric water heaters greater than 55 gallons re-bounded and aligned closer to pre-2022 levels. We are pleased with our market share strength in both residential and commercial water heaters. Our North America boiler sales decreased 12% against a difficult comp of 28% growth in 2022. We worked down our backlog in 2022 after making significant production and supply chain improvements, which led to elevated channel inventories going into 2023. The resulting channel inventory de-stocking impacted our residential and small commercial boiler sales. Sales of our CREST commercial boilers with Hellcat technology increased over 50% in 2023. North America water treatment sales from 2% in 2023, as higher sales in the e-commerce and direct-to-consumer channels were partially offset by lower sales in the wholesale and retail channels. Sales in the prior year benefited from strong shipments as supply chain constraints improved and we worked down our order backlog, which resulted in elevated channel inventories in early 2023. In China, full year sales increased 4% in local currency. We are pleased with our performance in a continued weak economy. In addition to the successful launch of our kitchen products, we saw double digit sales growth of our HVAC and commercial water treatment product categories. Our core water heating and water treating products also performed well as replacement approaches 60% of residential water heater sales. The residential water treatment sales, particularly consumables, remain resilient. I'll now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on our full year and four quarter performance. Chuck Lauber : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm on slide 6. Full year sales in the North America segment rose to $2.9 billion, a 4% increase compared with 2022. Higher volumes of water heaters were partially offset by lower sales of boilers and pricing. North America segment earnings of $726 million increased 19% compared with 2022. Adjusted segment margin was 24.8%, an increase of 310 basis points year-over-year. The higher adjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin were primarily driven by higher water heater volumes and lower material costs. Moving to slide 7, the rest of the world's segment sales of $957 million decreased 1% year-over-year, including unfavorable currency translation of $44 million, primarily related to China. Segment sales increased 4% on a constant currency basis. Our sales increase was primarily driven by higher sales of kitchen products and water treatment products in China. India sales grew 15% in local currency in 2023, which is approximately three times the market. Rest of the world's segment earnings of $99 million increased 3% compared to segment earnings in 2022, primarily due to higher sales in China. Adjusted segment operating margin was 10.4%, an increase of 40 basis points compared to 2022. Please turn to slide 8. Turning to fourth quarter performance, we delivered sales of $988 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 6% year-over-year led by higher water heater volumes in North America and higher kitchen product sales in China that more than offset lower boiler sales and pricing. Adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter were $0.97 per share compared with adjusted earnings of $0.86 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022. Please turn to slide 9. Fourth quarter sales in the North America segment was $738 million, a 7% increase compared to sales in the fourth quarter of 2022 as a result of higher water heating volumes partially offset by lower boiler sales. North America segment adjusted earnings of $173 million increased 8% compared with 2022. Adjusted operating margin of 23.5% increased 20 basis points compared to last year. The higher adjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin were primarily due to higher water heater volumes. Moving on to slide 10. Fourth quarter rest of the world's segment sales of $260 million increased 4% year-over-year primarily driven by sales of new products partially offset by unfavorable currency translation of $3 million in China. India sales grew 11% in local currency in 2023 compared to 2022. Rest of the world adjusted segment earnings of $30 million decreased 6% compared to Q4 2022 segment earnings. An adjusted segment margin of 11.5% decreased 120 basis points compared to segment margin in the same period last year. The decreases were primarily due to promotions and advertising supporting the launch of our dishwasher and steam oven products in China. Please turn to slide 11. We generated pre-cash flow of $598 million during 2023, an increase of 86% over 2022 primarily driven by higher earnings and lower working capital needs. In 2023, pre-cash flow conversion was 107%. Our cash balance totaled $363 million at the end of December and our net cash position was $236 million. Our leverage ratio was 6.5% as measured by total debt to total capital. Now turn to slide 12. As we detail at our investor day, in addition to returning capital to shareholders, we continue to see opportunities for organic growth, innovation, and new product development across all of our product lines and geographies. We target strategic acquisitions that meet our financial metrics of the creative earnings in the first year and return our cost to capital in three years. The strength of our balance sheet allows us to continue to invest in ourselves through research and development and capital expansion while pursuing strategic acquisitions. Earlier this month, our board approved our next quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. We have increased our dividend for over 30 consecutive years. We repurchased approximately 4.4 million shares of common stock in 2023 for a total of $307 million. We continue our strong track record of delivering return to shareholders. Over the last two years, we have returned over $1 billion to shareholders through our dividends and share repurchases. Please turn to slide 13 in our 2024 earnings, guidance, and outlook. We are pleased to introduce our 2024 outlook with an expected EPS range of $3.90 and $4.15 per share. The midpoint of our EPS range represents an increase of 6% compared with 2023 adjusted EPS. Our outlook is based on a number of key assumptions, including our guidance assumes that steel prices in 2024 will be a slight headwind compared to 2023. Relative to current steel prices, our projection includes a decline in steel price index in the second half of the year. Our outlook assumes non-steel material costs are similar in 2024, as they were in 2023. Our guidance also assumes a relatively stable supply chain environment similar to what we experienced throughout 2023. We are monitoring the situation in the Red Sea in Panama, and currently have not experienced any negative impacts. We launched our internally designed and manufactured gas tankless products earlier this month. As we mentioned at our investor day, these products will be manufactured in China facility until our North America capacity is completed in 2025. Associated import tariffs and other launch costs will impact North America margins by approximately 50 basis points. We are investing in manufacturing in Juarez, Mexico that will eliminate the tariff in the future. For the year, CapEx should be between $105 million and $115 million. An increase over the last several years due to capacity expansion projects related to our gas tankless manufacturing facility in Juarez, the expansion of our engineering capabilities in Lebanon and Tennessee, and an increase in high-efficiency commercial water heating manufacturing capacity to align with regulatory changes coming in 2026. We expect to generate strong pre-cash flow between $525 million and $575 million. Corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $60 million. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be between 24 and 24.5% , and we expect to repurchase $300 million of shares of our stock, resulting in our outstanding diluted shares of $147 million at the end of 2024. I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin, who will provide more color on our key markets and top-line growth outlook and segment expectations for 2024, staying on slide 13. Kevin? Kevin Wheeler : Thank you, Chuck. We project 2024 sales to grow between 3% and 5% compared to 2023, which includes the following assumptions. We believe the U.S. new home construction remains in a deficit, and we project it will be flat in 2023. We also assume that 2024 proactive replacement will remain at a level similar to 2023. Therefore, after an approximate 6% increase in the industry in 2023 compared to 2022, we project that 2024 residential industry unit volumes will be approximately flat until last year. We project U.S. commercial water heater industry volumes to increase low single digits, as demand for our commercial electric greater than 55 gallons continues its positive trend to pre-2022 levels. In addition, our outlook includes the announced price increases in North America water heating of 4% on most of our water heater products. Price increase for heat pump products is 8%. These increases are projected to be effective late in the first quarter. In China, we believe it will take time for the economy to improve amid weakened consumer confidence in a challenged real estate and housing market, and we have not yet seen signs of significant improvement. Even with the continued backdrop of a weak economy, we project our sales in China will again grow 3% to 5% and local currency in 2024, driven by resilient replacement demand, growth in demand for our water treatment products, and our recently released kitchen products. Our forecast assumes that the currency translation impact will be minimal in 2024. We expect a return to growth in our North America boiler business, with a projected sales increase of between 8% to 10% in 2024. We expect a continued benefit from the transition to higher energy efficient boilers, particularly as commercial buildings look to improve their overall carbon footprint. We predict sales of North America water treatment products to increase approximately 10% to 12%, as we expect to grow at two times the pace of the market. Based on our 2024 assumptions, we expect our North America segment margin to be between 24.5% and 25% and rest of world's segment margin to be approximately 10%.  Please turn to slide 14. I'd like to thank everyone who joined us at our investor date late last year, either in person or via webcast. The recording of the webcast is available on our website. The team and I enjoyed sharing the exciting growth opportunities that we see on the horizon for all of our businesses. A summary of the key topics that we covered are on slide 14. I look forward to sharing periodic updates on our initiatives, including the launch of our gas tankless products. As we looked at 2024, we remained focused on our key strategic priorities to advance our position as a leader in heating and treating water around the world. Those priorities are expanding and enhance our high efficiency product portfolio, including heat pumps for space and water heating, expand our global water treatment capabilities by investing in technologies, people, and geographic expansion, and deploy capital effectively by investing in our south, pursue our active acquisition pipeline, and returning capital to shareholders. We have many reasons to have optimism as we enter 2024. We see strong and market demand in North America for all of our product categories, and we expect to return to growth for boilers and North American water treatment as we believe our customers exited 2024-2023 with normalized channel inventories. We have begun several capacity expansion projects in North America that will support our growth in the long term. In China, we are projecting a second year of growth driven by innovative new products and resilient demand for our core products, and we expect to continue double-digit growth in India as our premium products and customer service are well-received in the market. And finally, this year marks an important milestone for A.O. Smith as we celebrate our 150th anniversary. What began as a small machine shop in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1874 has grown into an innovative industry leading global water technology company with more than 12,000 employees. A.O. Smith has a rich and proud history, and we are excited to celebrate it with employees, shareholders, customers, and partners across the globe. With that, we conclude our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will conduct the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Halloran with Baird. Your line is open. Michael Halloran : Hey, morning, everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning, Mike. Michael Halloran : So, I figured after last time where I had issues on my end getting through, I figured I'd give a [indiscernible] pause there, so make sure you guys could hear me. Kevin Wheeler : We can. I hope you can hear us also. Michael Halloran : Yes. Great. So, two questions here, both on North America. First, could you give some context to how you're thinking about the moving pieces within the residential water heater business between discretionary replacement, new build, and the non-discretionary replacement pieces? Chuck Lauber : Yes, I'll touch on that. We don't see much difference in 2024 as we forecasted in our guidance that 9.2 million new construction, whether it's single family or multifamily, continues to progress. And we see it flat. And the proactive replacement has stayed very resilient. It's been six to eight quarters now. We just received data from it recently, and it continues to move down that path. And, of course, the [emergency] replacement is a non-discretionary, and we expect that to continue. So, we look at really 2024 as having a very similar outlook as 2023. Kevin Wheeler : And maybe I'll just comment, Mike, that, it's been a couple lumpy years, right? I mean, we've had COVID and been a bit of a correction last year. We think the industry this year will be up maybe in that 5.5% to 6%. But if we kind of step back to 2019 and just look at a growth rate of 1.5%, we kind of we end up at what we think our outlook is going to be for 2024, along with, those assumptions that Kevin just mentioned. So it feels like a fairly stable residential market for us as we go into '24. Michael Halloran : Got it. And just to be clear, the 6-ish percent was a 20 or 2023 reference point. Right? Chuck Lauber : Yes, it was '23 over '22. I always trip up as we go into the next year here. Michael Halloran : Yes, no, same page, me too. So second question, then, is just putting the North American margins in context. They certainly get the 50 basis point headwind from the investments you're making. Did you talk about why the confidence that down steel costs, the lower levels of inflation or limited inflation remaining, and then, maybe in the context of what you saw in the fourth quarter and how that will ramp through the year? I know a lot in there, but just looking for a little bit more color around that North America margin guide? Chuck Lauber : Yes. So we see steel cost as a slight headwind as we go into the year. Steel cost have been kind of in that bandwidth and I'll quote, coal rolled of 950 to 1300, 1350. I mean, it's been in that bandwidth at the higher end of that bandwidth right now. So, as we come out of the fourth quarter, we're going to see a little bit of help on steel in the first quarter. And then we're going to see steel ramp up again in the back, back three quarters, likely, although we're calling out slight relief in the back half of the year. Fortunately, we have pricing coming in when steel kind of comes in the second quarter. So, as we come out of 2023, we're looking at a little bit better margin profile in the first quarter because it's down slightly and then get helped a little bit on pricing coming in with a higher cost deal. If you kind of look at the cadence for the year, kind of most quarters in North America are within that bandwidth of range, or at least pretty close in the 24.5% to 25% bandwidth. I'd say Q1 has maybe a little more pressure. And then, of course, as you mentioned, we do have some headwinds. Just, launching our tankless product is about a 50 basis point headwind as we import out of China, do the transportation and then, continue to promote that product. Operator : One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeff Hammond : Hey, good morning, everyone. Chuck Lauber : Hey, Jeff. Kevin Wheeler : Hey, Jeff. Jeff Hammond : Just trying to get a sense of feedback from the channel on the March pricing, you guys put through quite a bit. I think we were a little surprised to see a follow-on here, but maybe just speak to how the channels react into it and what's kind of supporting that price increase. Thanks. Kevin Wheeler : Yes. I would just tell you that our philosophy has always been on pricing that we feel the cost before our customers do. And so as much as steel bounces up and down, there's still other parts of components and other chemicals and so forth. And so our increase is always based on what we have to address going forward with our suppliers. And the cadence, it's off a little bit. We pushed it out to March, and that's pretty rare, but it happens on occasion. Our goal has always been and will continue to be to keep our customers competitive and the price increase along with the timing really reaches that goal for us. Jeff Hammond : Okay. And then just on the boiler, you've seen any kind of inflection in boiler demand or has this just growth off of easy comps? Kevin Wheeler : It's certainly coming off some comps. You can get a reminder, first quarter of last year was a pretty good year, a strong quarter for us on the boiler side. And we didn't see stocking until starting in the second quarter. But much of it has to do with coming off some comps, inventories coming down, getting back to our regular cadence. And we always get a little tripped up on sell out or sell in. You remember our sell in was down, but our sell out, we felt we held our own in the market. So overall, the boiler market is slightly down on some quoting. Residential has been a headwind for us most of the year that we look at turning that around in 2024. But overall, the market is a combination of comps and some of our new products. Our CREST with LCAP technology continues to grow. We outlined how much it's growing this year or last year. So a combination of getting back to our normal cadence and some new product offerings is how we get to that 8% to 10%. Operator : One moment our next question. Our next question comes from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Susan Maklari : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning, Susan. Susan Maklari : My first question is going back to that discretionary demand on the residential water heaters. You've obviously seen that in the last several years. You've talked to that holding fairly flat for 2024. When we think about that relative to some other categories, such as appliances where we're seeing that discretionary demand has been weaker just sort of across our building products coverage, what gives you the confidence that that will hold this year? And any additional thoughts on where that may trend over time? Kevin Wheeler : Yes. Again, we've been watching it and it's held pretty steady for a long time. Certainly, as we go forward and look at it, we still see housing renovation, even though things are going to be relatively flat, people are staying in the homes. We think housing renovation is still going to be a big part of how we go forward. And where it goes long term, we're still trying to get our arms around it. We talked a little bit about some generational issues that we've seen. But overall, right now in 2024, we're confident that the proactive replacement will stay steady. And we'll continue to monitor it as we continue over the years. Susan Maklari : Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then as we come into this year, any thoughts on where channel inventories are anything that you would highlight there or expectations as we move through the year on that? Kevin Wheeler : Well, I'll start with North America water heating. We entered the year this year, pretty strong January. And I think we maybe had a little bit lower channel inventories coming into 2023. But we feel like we're in great shape, very normalized on North America water heating. On the boiler and water treatment side, I think we still feel a bit ahead when as we go through the end of 2023, but feel like we're going to exit the year in a good position of normalized inventories. In China, all the channel inventories are pretty much very normal kind of event for a while and kind of continue in that normalized zone. Operator : One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies. Your line is open. Saree Boroditsky : Hi. Good morning. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Saree Boroditsky : Could you just go back and talk about what you saw from the water heater demand or market tier in the fourth quarter as shipments in October through November seem pretty strong versus the reported results and then any color on what you saw in January from a shipment perspective? Kevin Wheeler : Q4 came in a little bit stronger than we expected and mostly on the residential side and we held our own and got our fair share of that. And so that was a nice positive plus. I think we've talked about being up four, being close to six in the residential side of the business. I will see how that actually comes out specifically. And I will tell you January gets early and January was a pretty strong month, particularly on the water heater side of the business. But orders remain strong. I mean, we continue to track towards our guidance. So in a one month view, we feel pretty good about what we're at. And I would just tell you orders are fairly strong across all of our businesses starting the year. Again, one month doesn't make a year, but we're off to a good start. Saree Boroditsky : Thanks. The rest of the world margins at 10% are flat from this year despite expectations for higher sales. So maybe just talk about some offsets that you expect to see there? Chuck Lauber : Offsets for next year? Saree Boroditsky : Yes. On the rest of the world side, on the margin. Chuck Lauber : Yes. I mean, I'll speak to China. So China first, we're expecting growth in China 3% to 5%. Next year looks very similar in our outlook and that we're going to be investing in new products, promoting new products, looking to have top line growth and kind of maintaining margins in China right around that 11%. So margin operating margins in China year-over-year, roughly the same. I think we're, we're really leaning on growth as in India. And maybe when you look at overall rest of the world, and you look at our outlook for India, we continue to invest in growth. So we're going to continue to put kind of our, certainly we're pleased to be in a profitable position in India. We would like to continue to invest in growth and have, growth outlooks of 15% in India next year. Operator : One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is open. David MacGregor : Yes, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start by asking you about the North American gas tankless business. You talked about, it's a contribution to that 50 basis points in margin pressure, but could you talk about the top line impact? What should we expect in terms of timing and the size of the impact in terms of, the initial channel fill? And how are you thinking about that within the context of your revenue guide? Chuck Lauber : Yes. I mean, so we've got a revenue guide. I'll just tie it back to the overall 3% to 5% growth on the top line. And, we're pleased that there's a number of drivers within that growth, and all of them are within the same amount, roughly. And if you kind of look at, just overall growth on tankless, heat pump, Kevin talked about pricing. We've got boilers growing kind of in that 8% to 10%. We've got North America water treatment growing 10% to 12%. And then, growth in China at 4%. And India, the ones that I mentioned are all very similarly sized. So it contributes in a meaningful way to growth, but it's not, it's not the largest part of growth in North America next year. We, I'll just kind of tie it back to that we were expecting $100 million on the top line over three years. So, when we get to 2026, we would expect to be incrementally there. It'd probably be a little lumpy as we start out, but we're looking for contributions in year one. Kevin Wheeler : Yes. Just to add on the tankless side of it, we are building inventory as we speak. [Audio-Gap] on the ground in, we'll launch in late March. We've already taken orders for it. And we're excited about it. One, that we own the technology, we're manufacturing, but more importantly, the first product that we're bringing to market, which is a condensing premix, has all the features that quite frankly, we've been a little bit hamstrung with our product line. So two inch band, half inch connection, better flow rates are all, our team's excited about getting in the market and being able to compete. So we'll start in March. Early indications from a lot of customers are pretty excited about the product. We're excited about the product. But as Chuck mentioned, this will be a ramp that we'll start this year and continue to gain momentum over the next couple of years. David MacGregor : Got it. Thanks for that. And there's a follow up. I just wanted to ask about China, that the analysts meeting you outlined kind of a three segment, good, better, best market segmentation model. And what if you could just talk about what you're seeing in terms of demand dynamics across those three segments right now. I realize AI link is still pretty new. But if you could share what you're thinking, what you're seeing there? Kevin Wheeler : Yes, I'll touch on that, maybe Chuck will jump in on it. We've not seen much change on our mix. And I would tell you that we're, our good is premium good. And I mean, we're not down in the low end of the market. But throughout even the pandemic and even into the last year, and how we're looking going into 2024, our premium price products that premium sector of the market has held up. It's not growing, but it's holding. And so our mix looks relatively the same as it has over the last several years. And we feel pretty good about that considering the consumers not as engaged as it needs to be. And we look at that as being upside as that consumer confidence grows a bit. Chuck Lauber : Yes. I just put some numbers to that. So I mean, we define kind of the premium sector of the market, above 3000 RMB for electric water heating, and above 5000 RMB for gas water heating and water treatment, which are our core products in China. And the premium sector of the market that we sell, it's been in the 60% to 70% range, a little lower on water treatment, right around 50%. But it's been a nice zip code for quite a while now. So for probably the last couple of years. So we haven't seen a change, certainly hasn't decreased, but it's been pretty steady. Operator : One moment for our next question. Next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. This is Adam [indiscernible] on for Nathan. My question relates to your balance sheet is in a very good position, significantly underlevered with a strong net cash position. So what are your plans to optimize the balance sheet? And maybe could you provide an update on your M&A pipeline? I'll leave it there. Thanks. Chuck Lauber : Sure. Good morning, Adam. Yes, we are underlevered. We like the position that we're in going into an opportunity for M&A, which we'll talk about. We continue to have kind of a balanced approach. I talked a little bit earlier about investing in ourselves, which are some of the three major expansion projects that we have going on with building manufacturing capabilities for gas tankless for investing in commercial high efficiency capacity, and then continue to invest in our R&D facilities in Lebanon, Tennessee. So we continue to make sure we're doing the right things to invest in ourselves and have three major projects going on. We're also doing a bid on the share buyback. We've got $300 million of share buyback in our outlook for 2024. We continue to feel that that's an appropriate component of capital allocation as we're underlevered. And then we're reserving firepower for the opportunities within M&A. We look forward to maybe some opportunities this year. It's always difficult to tell. Certainly investors' expectations always remain high. We feel like we're in a great position, though, to continue to kind of look for those opportunities as we go into 2024. Kevin Wheeler : I would just maybe add on to that. I mean, our pipeline is active, and we continue to look at spaces not only within our core, certainly water treatment, but geographic expansions, and even levering, potentially our customers and footprints that we have in various industries. So a lot of different spots on the board. We're engaged on a pretty regular basis with a number of companies. And again, just a matter of not it, but when the time comes about. But again, when we look at acquisitions, culture is exceptionally important for us in making sure that we find the right company that fits within A.O. Smith. On top of that, we are going to stay disciplined in making sure that we can return to our shareholders. So putting that all in context, we feel really good about the pipeline, and we'll see if we can bring some of those home in 2024. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning, everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Hey Andy. Chuck Lauber : Good morning. Andy Kaplowitz : I just wanted to follow up on the 10% rest of world margin, 11% in China. You obviously spoke about it the investor day, 400 base points of improvement over the next several years. Do you need a better Chinese economy for that margin expansion to kick in, or do you start to dial down your advertising and promotion soon on the new kitchen products, and that will help? How does that work? Kevin Wheeler : Yes, we need a better economic backdrop to achieve that. I mean, we really are in a situation now where we feel good about the cost we've taken out at the level we're at. Feel like we can leverage growth going forward, but we need to get the economy back. We need to get housing formation kind of reignited so that we've got a larger portion of the market that is growing in house formation. As you know, most of the water heaters go in when an individual moves into their home, even if it's a new construction. We're pleased we've got 60% replacement on the water heating side, so in the meantime, we're very happy with the resiliency of the business at the levels we're at, but we will need some economic help to kind of achieve that expansion. Andy Kaplowitz : It's helpful color. And then just shifting gears, North American commercial water heater industry had a good year in '23, so maybe a difficult comparison in '24, but you've dialed in the low single-digit growth. So can you talk about the visibility you have to that end market holding up in '24? Chuck Lauber : Yes. It held up, and you have to go primarily back to, and we've mentioned a couple times the greater than 55 gallon electrics. We went to a regulatory kind of change, and we had to get the industry had to get its legs underneath, which it did, and we're starting to benefit from that. But the growth of almost 70% came out of that category, and it's almost back to where it needs to be, but you look at that low single digits, a large majority of that growth is going to be in that particular category as it gets back to a more normalized level that it exited in 2022. But overall, a commercial business held up well. Our gas business showed some growth. We break it down small electrics versus large. Small electrics had growth, so each category is still growing, and we expect that to continue. There's still a very big part. We talk about residential replacement versus discretionary. Still, 85% of that business is replacement market for us, and we have a really nice market share in that particular category. And as restaurants, hotels continue to come back online like they have been, our units are going to get exercises like everybody else's, and that replacement should continue for the foreseeable future. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from [indiscernible] with UBS. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Good morning, guys. I'm on for Damian this morning. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Unidentified Analyst : Yes. So, a quick question on North America pricing. So, you announced a 4% increase in November and got pushed to March. I wanted to understand what was the reason for pushing the price increase? Did you get some pushback? What's happening there? Kevin Wheeler : Yes. Details on pricing are really within our strategy here. We've always evaluated each time we bring a price increase to market. And early on, as we discussed, we make sure that we're addressing costs. We always make sure that we feel the cost before our customers is. And the bottom line we're at today is what's going to keep our customers competitive and that's really all we're going to say on the pricey side of this. Unidentified Analyst : Cool. Okay. And as a quick follow-up on China, you seem to see most of the growth is coming from kitchen appliances and water treatment. So, I just wanted to get your color on what you're seeing for water heater demand in China going into 2024. Kevin Wheeler : Yes. Most of the growth that we see in 2024 relates to commercial business and water treatment, water treatment overall, particularly consumables. And then, we do see some growth in our kitchen products that are newly introduced. Overall, the core products were relatively flat year-over-year. I mentioned a little bit earlier about, we've kind of seen the stabilization of maybe what's being sold into the premium side. So, we think we're in a good spot for when the economy does come back, but we're looking at relatively year-over-year or flat for our core products. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude the question-and answer-session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Helen Gurholt for closing remarks. Helen Gurholt : Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Let me conclude by reminding you that our global A.O. Smith team delivered record sales and earnings in 2023. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the quarters to come. In addition, please mark your calendars to join our presentation at three conferences this quarter. Citi on February 21, Barclays on February 22, and North Coast on March 7. Thank you and enjoy the rest of your day. Operator : Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Helen Gurholt. Please go ahead. Helen Gurholt : Good morning, and welcome to the A. O. Smith First Quarter Conference Call. I'm Helen Gurholt, Vice President, Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis. Joining me today are Kevin Wheeler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer. In order to provide improved transparency into the operating results of our business, we provided non-GAAP measures. Free cash flow is defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures, adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted segment earnings and adjusted corporate expenses exclude the impact of impairment expenses. Reconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and on our website. A friendly reminder that some of our comments and answers during this conference call will be forward-looking statement that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include matters that we described in this morning's press release, among others. Also, as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. We will be using slides as we move through today's call, you can access them on our website at investor.aosmith.com. I will now turn the call over to Kevin to begin our prepared remarks. Kevin Wheeler : Thank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start off by extending a warm welcome to Steve Shafer, who has recently joined A. O. Smith as our Chief Operating Officer. Steve is an accomplished business leader with deep global experience in manufacturing and leading innovative businesses. His strategic acumen and extensive global leadership experience will prove invaluable as we continue to focus on innovation and driving operational performance to enhance shareholder value. Let's now turn to the quarter on Slide 4. Our global A. O. Smith team delivered sales of $979 million in 2024 and EPS of $1, a 6% increase over 2023 adjusted EPS. North America sales increased 2% and segment margins increased 80 basis points due to a positive mix, higher commercial volumes and lower material costs principally steel. Our Rest of World segment, sales grew 4%, recently introduced products in China contributed to the majority of the growth. In India, our sales grew 16% in local currency in the first quarter of 2024. Please turn to Slide 5. North America water heater sales grew 2% in the first quarter due to higher commercial volumes and a positive mix towards commercial gas and high-efficiency products, including heat pumps. Volumes were favorably influenced by our price increase effective March 1. However, year-over-year comps were somewhat muted by a strong first quarter 2023. Our North America order sales were flat compared to the first quarter of 2023. As a reminder, we do not begin to see the effects of the 2023 channel inventory destocking until the second quarter of last year. We are pleased to see sales of our high-efficiency residential orders returned to more normalized levels in the first quarter of 2024. Sales of our CREST commercial boilers with Hellcat technology increased over 30% in the quarter. North America water treatment sales grew 4% in 2024, driven by acquisition-related sales growth and pricing. Organic growth in the e-commerce and specialty wholesale channels were offset by softness in the direct-to-consumer and retail channels. In China, first quarter third-party sales increased 6% in local currency. Our recently launched Kitchen products continue to be well received in the market and provide bundling opportunities that drive overall sales growth. Sales of HVAC systems which generally combine a combi boiler with the heat pump water heater increased 14% local currency in the quarter as well. I will now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on our first quarter performance. Charles Lauber : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 6. First quarter sales in the North America segment were $766 million, a 2% increase compared with 2023 driven by higher commercial volumes and the benefits of mix shift towards high-efficiency water heaters, including heat pumps. North America segment earnings of $199 million increased 5% compared with 2023. Segment margin was 25.9%, an increase of 80 basis points year-over-year. The higher segment earnings and margin were primarily driven by positive mix and lower material costs, partially offset by selling and advertising expenses in support of higher sales. Moving to Slide 7. Rest of the World segment sales of $227 million increased 4% year-over-year, including unfavorable currency translation of $9 million primarily related to China. Segment third-party sales of $219 million increased 4% on a constant currency basis. The increase was primarily driven by higher sales of kitchen and HVAC products in China. India sales increased 16% in local currency in the quarter, driven by growth in both water heating and water treatment with particular strength in our e-commerce and commercial end markets. Rest of the World segment earnings of $17 million decreased slightly compared to adjusted segment earnings in 2023, primarily due to sales promotions associated with new product introductions and product mix in China. Third-party segment operating margin was 7.9%, a decrease of 20 basis points compared to adjusted segment margins in 2023. Please turn to Slide 8. We generated free cash flow of $85 million during the first 3 months of 2024, a decrease from the same period last year, primarily as a result of higher incentive payments associated with record sales and profits last year and higher inventory levels that more than offset higher earnings and lower accounts payable balances.  Capital expenditures increased $11 million year-over-year, driven by expansion projects. Our cash balance totaled $303 million at the end of March, and our net cash position was $183 million. Our leverage ratio was 6% as measured by total debt to total capital. Let's now turn to Slide 9. In addition to returning capital to shareholders, we continue to see opportunities for investment in organic growth, innovation and new product development across all of our product lines and geographies. We target strategic acquisitions that meet our financial metrics as accretive to earnings in the first year and return our cost of capital in 3 years. In the first quarter, we welcomed Impact Water Products to the A. O. Smith  family. Impact supports our growth strategy by expanding the West Coast presence of our water treatment business. Please turn to Slide 10 in our 2024 earnings guidance and outlook. We reaffirm our 2024 EPS outlook of an expected range of $3.90 to $4.15 per share. The midpoint of our EPS range represents an increase of 6% compared with 2023 adjusted EPS. Our outlook is based on a number of key assumptions, including our guidance assumes that our steel costs in the full year 2024 will be a slight headwind compared to 2023. We project an increase in steel input costs in the second quarter of approximately 20% over the first quarter. Our full year steel input cost projection includes a slight decline in the steel price index in the second half of the year. Our outlook assumes non-steel material costs are similar in 2024 as they were in 2023. Our guidance also assumes a relatively stable supply chain environment, similar to what we've experienced throughout 2023. We introduced our internally designed and manufactured gas tankless products earlier this year. These products will be manufactured in our China facility until our North America capacity is completed in 2025. We expect customer shipments to begin later in the second quarter. Associated import tariffs and other launch costs will negatively impact North America margins by approximately 50 basis points when we begin to ship product. We are investing in manufacturing of Juarez, Mexico that will eliminate the tariff in the future. For the year, CapEx should be between $105 million and $115 million, an increase year-over-year due to capital -- the capacity expansion projects related to our gas tankless manufacturing facility at Juarez, expansion of our engineering capabilities in Lebanon, Tennessee, and adding high-efficiency commercial water heating manufacturing capacity to align with regulatory changes coming in 2026. We expect to generate strong free cash flow of between $525 million and $575 million. Corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $65 million. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be between 24% to 24.5% and we continue to expect to repurchase approximately $300 million of our shares of stock, resulting in our outstanding diluted shares of $147 million at the end of the year. I will now turn the call back over to Kevin, who will provide more color on key markets and top line growth outlook and segment expectations for 2024, staying on Slide 13. Kevin? Kevin Wheeler : Thank you, Chuck. We reaffirm our outlook that 2024 sales will grow between 3% and 5% compared to 2023, which includes the following assumptions. We maintain our projection that 2024 U.S. residential industry unit volumes will be approximately flat to last year after seeing a 6% growth in 2023. Our assumption projects that new home construction and proactive replacement remain at levels similar to last year. Our projection that U.S. commercial water heater industry volumes will increase low single digits in 2024 is unchanged. Our outlook includes the announced price increases in North America water heating of 4% on most of our water heater products. Price increase for heat pumps products is 8%. Our April orders are strong year-over-year as a result of resilient and demand in our management of prebuy orders. In China, we believe that the economy and consumer confidence remains weak. The real estate and housing markets are challenged. We have not seen signs of improvement. Through March and April, we have seen headwinds in consumer demand. Given the continued weak economy and the softness we are seeing, we are lowering our 2024 third-party sales growth guidance in China to be flat to 3% up in local currency. Our forecast assumes a negative currency translation impact of approximately 1% for the year. We ended the second quarter with a strong backlog in our boiler business and reaffirm that we expect boiler sales to grow between 8% and 10% over last year. We are revising our sales growth guidance for North America water treatment products from an increase of 10% to 12% to an increase of 8% to 10%. This reduction is a reflection of softness we are experiencing in our direct-to-consumer business, average order price in our retail channel, particularly for water softeners. Based on our 2024 assumptions, we expect our North America segment margin to be approximately 25% and Rest of World third-party segment margin to be approximately 10%. Please turn to Slide 11. We are pleased with our performance in early 2024. We had year-over-year growth in residential and commercial water heaters, along with a strong mix in the first quarter and we are pleased with our order rates we are seeing in this month. India is on track for another year of projected double-digit sales growth. During the quarter, we initiated three capital expansion projects that will add capacity for key product categories in North America. First, we broke ground on our tankless manufacturing facility in Juarez, which is on the same campus as our current residential water heater facility. Production in Juarez will improve logistics as well as eliminate the tariff on products currently manufactured in our China facility. Production is targeted to begin in 2025. In addition, we launched our high-efficiency commercial gas water heater expansion in McBee, South Carolina. This expansion will increase our production capacity for our high-efficiency products, including our market-leading Cyclone product. As a reminder, Department of Energy Regulatory changes largely impacting commercial gas water heater efficiency levels will eliminate lower efficiency products from the market beginning in late 2026. Finally, in support of our R&D and product innovation within our commercial water heater and boiler markets, we have initiated the expansion of our Lebanon, Tennessee commercial lab and engineering test facility. The state-of-the-art facility will combine our commercial water heating engineering expertise under one roof and allow for cross-functional collaboration, particularly with mutual technologies like heat pump. We are in the early stages of all three projects, but we're off to a very good start. As always, we remain focused on meeting the needs of our customers as well as executing our key strategic priorities to advance our position as a leader in heating and treating water around the world. With that, we conclude our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies. Unknown Analyst : This is James on for Saree. So I wanted to ask about the first quarter water heater demand. So January and February shipments came in higher than your full year expectation. So can you kind of talk about what you saw from the water heater demand in the first quarter and potentially into April? Kevin Wheeler : Yes. Certainly, if you saw January and February AHRI data, and that was up and a portion of that was really due to a prebuy based on our price increase. We expect and see March coming in at a more normalized level and starting to get back to our forecast of a flat 2024 on the residential side of the business. We are -- we entered April with a really strong backlog, and we'll be working that down in the second quarter. It kind of behaved like we thought. We thought the 4% was probably would not have as much of a prebuy as it did, but it did. And we're working through that. We feel we got our fair share of orders from our customers. And again, in the second quarter, we'll work down that backlog and we remain on track, and it really ties right into our forecast and our -- where we expect the year to end. Unknown Analyst : Got it. And I wanted to touch on the margin here. So I think you're now looking for North America segment margin to come in at a higher end of the range while like maintaining the steel cost expectation. So can you kind of provide more color on increasing your margin expectation for North America? Charles Lauber : Yes. I mean we had previously guided to $24.5 to 25%. Now we're saying approximately 25%. We're very pleased with our North America margin performance in the first quarter, came in nicely, helped a bit by mix. We had some weather situations in January, and the plants performed very well coming through that. So as we kind of look at the top end of that range and moved it slightly up, it's just some confidence in kind of the way the operations are running. We have pricing coming in, in the April time frame with steel costs going up. So there's a bit of pressure in the back half. But the way we started out and kind of looking through the full year and considering some of the launch costs that we know will be coming at us in the later part of the year with tankless, we feel pretty comfortable with moving closer to 25%. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird. Michael Halloran : Just want to clarify what you're talking to right there, Chuck. When you said pressure in the back half, you mean pressure sequentially versus front half, not year-over-year? Charles Lauber : Correct. sequentially. We're thinking about North America margins, our lowest steel costs that we project for the year is in Q1. So we'll see some pressure on steel in the back 3 quarters of the year quite actually. And then just relative to the first quarter, a little bit of pressure as we're excited to launch our tankless product. But for the time being, until we get production up running in Mexico, it's going to be a bit of a headwind to North America margins of about 50 basis points. Michael Halloran : So what you're essentially suggesting then is 1Q might be the high watermark? 2Q is still decent. Well, they're all decent margins regardless. And then back half just down a touch from front half, right? Charles Lauber : Right. 25.9% in Q1 and then we're saying about 25% for the year. Michael Halloran : So then could you put the earnings seasonality in context and how you're expecting the earnings to flow through, is this a relatively normal seasonal year from your perspective? Or does some of these margin nuances shift that around a bit? Charles Lauber : Yes. When we kind of look at water heater volume, and there's noise in the first quarter, as Kevin mentioned, there's a bit of pull in. But when you kind of look at the whole year, it's still -- our projection is it's still 52-48 balance from half back half. And then you think about historically, boilers are typically stronger in the third quarter. So we would hope that, that mix would help us a bit on margin. But relative to prior years, it's pretty normal, Mike, is the way we have our outlook. Operator : Our next question comes from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Susan Maklari : My first question is, given the level of pull forward that you mentioned on the -- in the first quarter on the residential side, how would you characterize channel inventories coming into the second quarter? Any thought on where that stands? Kevin Wheeler : Yes. I will tell you, based on the feedback that we have from our distributors, one, our distributors are all doing pretty well to even to slightly up. Inventories are basically in line. There's going to be some pull forward, but they'll work that off in the second quarter. So things overall are pretty positive with our distributors. I wouldn't say crazy positive, but certainly, they're starting the year off in a more positive sales kind of mode. And I don't think this whole pull forward, this is not a unique thing in our industry. We've gone through it many times with our distributors. It was right in line what we thought, we see that being worked up in the second quarter. Charles Lauber : Yes. I'll just add that some of the pull forward was within the quarter. You saw the strong data that came out on AHRI through February. For us, we saw a bit of moderation in March. as we kind of work through that price increase. Susan Maklari : Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then maybe turning to commercial. You highlighted that as a bright spot in the quarter. Just any further color on what drove that strength that you're seeing and the sustainability of it as we go into the spring and the summer? Kevin Wheeler : I think there's a couple of points you're making with regards to commercial. One, there was a prebuy there as well. What was a bit different is if you look back to last year and the increase we had in the commercial market, a lot of it was that greater than 55-gallon electric. And in the quarter, we saw commercial gas up kind of mid-single digits, which was a nice positive surprise. We don't think that was all pretty buy, but overall, the industry, we said it's going to be that low single-digit growth. We still think the majority of that's going to be in the electric category. And we're optimistic that part of that will also come in our commercial gas. So -- and in the year, really favorable, and I think we're right in line with that low single-digit growth rate for the commercial market. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Matt Summerville : A couple of questions, and I apologize if you touched on this. But just with respect to China, in the 0% to 3% constant currency growth expected. Can you kind of touch on your main product categories, water heaters, water treatment, some of the newer products, kitchen and HVAC relative to that 0% to 3%, how do you see those product groupings positioned, if you will? Charles Lauber : Yes. So we did lower it a bit our guidance. We were saying 3% to 5%. And last year, we grew at 3% to 5%, Matt. And some of that is kind of what we've seen in demand through the first 4 months of the year. We've seen a bit of pressure on our core products as we've come in through the end of April. We've seen a bit of slowness in the market with core products, the newer products, the kitchen products that we've launched year-over-year certainly, we launched this at the end of last year. So they continue to be well received. It's just early on in that process. So seeing a little bit of pressure on the order rates through April. Kevin Wheeler : Yes, just maybe tie into that in Q1, we saw some heavy promotions, particularly in the March time frame. And we took an approach that we are very selective and targeted how we went to market on our approach. We have a premium brand there and really treated as much. So part of that softness we saw in some of the water heating and water treatment product had to do with that. We're not concerned about it. But as you look forward, there's a couple of big drivers there. Consumer sentiment is just not coming back and the overhang from the real estate market is still there. So -- what we just -- we moved it down because that's what we're seeing today. As you know in China, things can change pretty rapidly. But we feel positive that we're still going to be in that flat to up market, we're still getting our fair share of, I think, of the product categories, and we're being very selective on how we're spending our money when it comes to promotion, and we're going to continue to watch our expenses to kind of balance that sales and profitability for the China business. Matt Summerville : Got it. And then as a follow-up, still sticking with China, what's your assessment of channel inventories in China? And then can you remind us how much of your China business today you feel is driven by replacement versus new? Charles Lauber : Yes. I mean channel inventory is pretty normalized right now we believe they're kind of in that normal range. We're estimating replacement business is -- on the water heating side is about 50% to 60% in that range. So that does help our resiliency in China to have that buffer of replacement business continue to kind of drive a portion of our volume. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Jeffrey Hammond : So just some clarifications here. Did you quantify or can you quantify how much you think was pulled forward 2Q to 1Q from the prebuy? And then just this 50 basis point headwind from shipping product, is that kind of a full year impact? And when do you think that the plant opens and what happens to that headwind once you get the plant open in Juarez? Charles Lauber : Yes. I mean, that 50 basis points is a full year impact. It's kind of on an annualized basis. And production is scheduled mid-2025 roughly. We've broken ground. We've made good progress. We'll give updates as we go, but we're pleased with the start of the construction of the facility in Juarez. The quantification of the pull forward in Q1, it's always a little bit difficult to estimate that. It wasn't a huge price increase, 4%, did drive some volume. Clearly, we saw that in the data through February. We felt a bit of relief of that volume in March. Order rates are still strong through April. We do have a backlog, though, as we exit the quarter. So it doesn't impact our full year outlook, not a significant amount. We don't believe in the quarter, but there was some. Kevin Wheeler : Maybe just to make a comment on this. We also limit the amount of prebuy that we have with our price increases. We realized that people are going to try to pull forward a bit. But it's going to be less than 30 days. And again, it's really difficult because business has been pretty good going through the first quarter. How much was prebuy, how much was just the need for the market. And I think it's going to wash itself out as we go into the next month or so. And that's why we've kept our flat U.S. residential industry volumes and where they're at. We don't think the prebuy is going to change our outlook at all. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay. And then just on the high mix product shift, how much of that is kind of being driven by clarification or support from IRA  and then how sustainable do you think this kind of mix shift is? Kevin Wheeler : Yes. I would tell you the mix shift, I'll separate that from the gas side of the business, we've always been a high efficiency leader in and that continues to -- as people replace their existing lower efficient products that continues to replace those with higher efficiency. On the heat pup, rebates matter. And they're very regionalized to more on the West Coast and parts of the East. And they do matter. And -- but there's number of programs out there, certainly where we're going with the regulatory side of this in 2029. So we see this as not a onetime, we've been increasing 20%,  30%,  40% on the year on heat pumps for the last 3 years. We expect that's going to continue to 20%, 25% as we get closer to 2029. This is not a onetime. It's going to be an ongoing growth, and we expect that kind of growth over the next few years. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Graham with Seaport Research Partners. Scott Graham : I wanted to understand maybe ask the prebuy question a little bit differently. We're all looking at the AHRI data, and obviously, February was quite strong. Are you suggesting that March, that we're going to see numbers of March down less than February was up, and then that works then into April numbers being down? Because you said 30 days, I'm not sure if I followed that. Kevin Wheeler : Well, what I said is we limit prebuys to 30 days. It doesn't mean that everybody pulls in 30 days. And so -- what I've mentioned in our scripted remarks and so forth, as we look out at March, we see March starting to become more normalized. The prebuy is in February, which everybody focused on. March will be as a percentage of an increase year-over-year will be going back down to more as a normalized level. So again, a prebuy is just a pull forward. It doesn't necessarily always mean that there's additional orders out there. And how we're looking at this as we get into the quarter as Chuck mentioned, some of it's already been shipped and maybe a bit is still to be shipped out in Q2. But it's more of a -- we're going to go back to normalized volumes there. There's nothing to read that we see from perspective that 7% is going to stick, nor is it going to be a negative as we go into the quarter -- second quarter and the rest of the year. It's going to be at that 9.2 flat million units a year. That's kind of where we're staying based on what we know today. Charles Lauber : Yes. And I'll just add we've seen orders in April pretty strong on a relative basis. So we haven't seen a drop in that, Scott. So along with kind of managing, as Kevin said, the orders and then pushing some out and extending a bit of our lead times to manage the order rate. We've also seen decent order rates through April. So we feel pretty good about going into the second quarter. Scott Graham : Got it. I guess really my other question was a very simple one housekeeper. The boiler business. Could you tell us how that did in the quarter and what that backlog looks like? Charles Lauber : Yes, it was flat for the quarter. So if you recall last year, we had a pretty decent first quarter in boilers and then we really got a bit of a comp headwind on channel inventories coming down. We had worked down our backlog quite a bit in 2022. So we saw some challenges in boilers last year. So we've got easier comps as we go forward. We feel good about the 8% to 10% growth rate. Our third quarter is typically highest in boilers. And backlog is strong, it's strong. It's a bit stronger than it was last year. And relative to other years, we feel relatively strong going into the second quarter in both commercial and residential. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : Can you give us more color into what you're seeing in Rest of World margins? Margin is usually, I think, seasonally weak in Q1, maybe slightly weaker than I thought. Did you just have higher advertising expense or something like that? And then you did keep your Rest of World margin the same for the year despite the slightly lower sales growth in China. So it looks like you still feel good about that. Anything you're doing to make sure that margins stay up at those levels? Charles Lauber : Yes. Sure, Andrew. I mean, first quarter is always a challenge for us in China on margins. It's usually our lowest margin quarter. And as you know, Rest of the World is largely China. So it wasn't out of line with what we expected for the first quarter. We haven't changed our full year outlook. You're right. We did lower our top line guide a bit. But the team in China has done a great job of taking a look at SG&A being more flexible, more variable on those costs and we have confidence that the team, even with a little lower volume is going to continue to manage the bottom line. So yes, a little bit of a headwind on the top line. First quarter is always a challenge, but we still feel good about that range for the full year. Andrew Kaplowitz : Great. And then just on North American water treatment, you did lower your forecast a little there. I think it was on the direct-to-consumer side that you said little bit more weakness. Maybe just talk about visibility into sort of that end market, it does tend to be a bit fragmented, how our inventories on the channel side and just more elaboration around visibility would be helpful. Kevin Wheeler : Yes. I think it certainly is a fragmented market. We're in five different channels. So the visibility is not as crystal clear as we would like. But if you look at it, the two things we highlighted was on the consumer demand side of it and just more average pricing for our orders in our consumer side of the business, just a little bit lower people being a bit more price cautious. And then also highlighted the water softeners and that just hasn't rebounded back from where we thought it was going to be. I just think there's -- that's more of a discretionary item sometimes people can delay it. So those are two things that we're seeing. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with the channels. It's just a matter of some of these discretionary spends consumers are being a bit more cautious. We still feel really good about the business. I mean, again, it's going to be up 8% to 10%. We didn't make an acquisition that puts us in California, which we're really excited about. So there's a lot of good things going on within the North America water treatment business and each channel has got its own little challenges, but also it's a positive side. Operator : Our next question comes from Damian Karas with UBS. Damian Karas : I appreciate all the color on the AHRI data and some of this monthly choppiness around distributor inventories. I was hoping maybe you could just give us an update on your perception of proactive replacement. Is that still around 30%? Or have you seen any changes there versus where you we're exiting 2023? Kevin Wheeler : No. It's interesting, we watch that really closely because coming out, it's been elevated, and it's kind of normalized right now at that 30% level. We check it every quarter, and it's still holding up in that percentage. So no change. And with that, of course, our merchant replacement always remains consistent. And we also like what we're seeing in the new construction side, particularly on single-family housing. So overall, I think the consumer and kind of the components of how our units and volumes are made up are pretty consistent and have been that way for now for several, several months. Damian Karas : Interesting. Good to hear. And then I have a follow-up question for you on North American tankless. Obviously, exciting, you're going to start shipping that product in the second quarter. I think you've been soliciting orders maybe since late last year. Any chance you can give us a sense on the level of orders that you've already been able to line up for that product? And how are you thinking about the potential sales impact for this year on that new product? Kevin Wheeler : Well, one, we're really excited about the tankers and only that technology and so forth. And yes, we do have prebuy orders already in-house and so forth. And as we look out on our tankless, we've kind of modeled an additional kind of $15 million to $20 million of incremental growth throughout the year as we launch this new product and bring it to market. And that will come in phases. The convincing premix is our high-end really premium product. That's what we're going to be launching next month. But we also have two other product lines that will be phased in the back half of the year. So excited about it, excited to own the technology and being able to go-to-market with which we believe is a very competitive and compelling product line, and we haven't had that for another year. So that's kind of where we're at and look forward to sharing more of that as we get into the rest of the year. Operator : Our next question. Our next question comes from Nathan Jones of Stifel. Adam Farley : This is Adam Farley on for Nathan. I wanted a follow-up on the commentary around kitchen products in China. Just wondering if you could provide any detail on the percentage of revenue these products account for and maybe where you expect kitchen products in China to go over time? Charles Lauber : Yes. So this is Chuck. Kitchen products are still a very, very small part of our business in China. If you kind of look at the full year, it's around 5%. And I include in that range hoods, dishwashers, cook tops and steam oven. So you lump those altogether, it's still a very small part of kind of our revenue in China. It's an important part though of our strategy and having products that are in or around the kitchen that we can bundle, link together through AI Link, and give our distributors a more value-oriented package to sell to consumers. So a small part of our business but fits very well into our strategy. Adam Farley : And are these products accretive to Rest of World segment margins? Charles Lauber : There are a little pressure on the Rest of the World segment margins. We're launching them. We've mentioned in some of our prepared remarks that we've got some cost and promotions behind them. We do appreciate the fact that launching into them and being a little bit of a headwind to average margins that they provide opportunities for us for top line stability and growth as we bundle products and go to market that way. Operator : Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David S. MacGregor: I want to start off by asking about the commercial business. And have you rolled out the 2-step pricing model yet? And if so, can you talk about the level of acceptance that you're seeing and just the initial impact on the business? Kevin Wheeler : I'm assuming two step, you talked about our catalysts that we talked about during Investor Day? David S. MacGregor: Yes, exactly. Kevin Wheeler : Again, it's been rolled out. We've done a number of pilots. We continue to roll it out to various customers. So I think right now, we're still in the early stages of it. The value proposition of it is outstanding. We're able to have a few models and be able to turn it into 25 different products immediately. So you don't -- when you are not capturing that inventory that you're tying up capital, but more importantly, your availability goes up and your customers are going to get served much, much better. So that continues to roll out. It's not going to be a program for everyone, but our larger stocking commercial accounts. This is a real benefit and a real separation of us in the market on the value proposition. So very pleased with it. Customers seem to be very pleased with it as well, and we'll continue to leverage that with the appropriate customer. David S. MacGregor: Right. It's still early. Okay. Got that. And then I want to follow up and just ask you a little more on the steel pricing. And I appreciate that a portion of this is indexed to what you're selling the product for. But thinking about the residual steel risk exposure, price risk exposure. How much variability is there still remaining this year in kind of your steel forecast? You talked about 2Q being up 20% versus 1Q and then you gave some general commentary about the second half. But I'm just wondering how much variability or uncertainty remains in that outlook? Charles Lauber : Yes. I mean we've talked about kind of the lag that we see. So we've got -- we have visibility looking forward in kind of a 90- to a 120-day time frame. So you kind of look from April, we can see forward through that amount of time. So really fourth quarter is the biggest risk or opportunity for changes in index in steel as we kind of look forward to the rest of the year. So we've got a decent amount of the year covered from visibility. Operator : And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Helen for any closing remarks. Helen Gurholt : Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Let me conclude by reminding you that our global A. O. Smith team delivered strong sales and earnings in the first quarter. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the quarters to come. In addition, please mark your calendars to join our presentations at four conferences this quarter : Oppenheimer on May 6, KeyBanc on May 29, William Blair on June 4 and Wells Fargo on June 12. Thank you, and enjoy the rest of your day. David S. MacGregor: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",

After the speakers presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Helen Gurholt. Please go ahead. Helen Gurholt : Thank you, Marvin. Good morning, and welcome to the A.O. Smith second quarter conference call. I'm Helen Gurholt, Vice President, Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis. Joining me today are Kevin Wheeler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer. In order to provide improved transparency into the operating results of our business, we provide non-GAAP measures. Free cash flow is defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures, adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted segment earnings and adjusted corporate expenses exclude the impact of pension settlement income and restructuring and impairment expenses. Reconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and on our website. A friendly reminder that some of our comments and answers during this conference call will be forward-looking statements that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include matters that we described in this morning's press release, among others. Also, as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. We will be using slides as we move through today's call. You can access them on our website at investor.aosmith.com. I will now turn the call over to Kevin to begin our prepared remarks. Kevin Wheeler : Thank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 4 and our second quarter results. I'm very pleased with our second quarter performance and how we are tracking for the year. In the second quarter, our global A.O. Smith team delivered record quarterly sales of $1 billion and EPS of $1.06, a 5% increase over 2023 adjusted EPS. North American water heater and boiler sales increased 10% due to higher volumes and pricing action. China third-party sales grew 2% in local currency. India achieved double-digits growth in local currency for the 10th consecutive quarter. And last week, we announced that we signed an agreement to acquire Pureit, a leading water purification business in South Asia. We look forward to welcoming the Pureit team to the A. O. Smith family later this year. Please turn to Slide 5. North America water heater sales grew 10% in the second quarter due to higher residential and commercial volumes and pricing actions. We began shipping our internally developed and manufactured gas tankers products in the quarter, and we are very pleased with market acceptance. Our North America boiler sales grew 10% compared to the second quarter of last year, driven by higher commercial volumes. I am pleased to see a return to growth as channel inventory levels normalize, we are on track to achieve our boiler sales forecast of 8% to 10% for the year. Sales of our commercial boilers, particularly our CREST boilers with Hellcat Technology continue to outperform the market. North America water treatment sales increased 8% in 2024 as acquisition-related dealer sales increases were partially offset by weakness in the retail channel. In China, second quarter third-party sales increased 2% in local currency as a result of sales of kitchen products as well as HVAC products that were partially offset by lower volumes of residential water treatment. While markets for our core products remain challenged, we are pleased with our market share in the premium portion of the water heater and water treatment product categories. However, we have seen pricing and promotion pressures, particularly in the mid-price sector of the market. I'm now on Slide 6. This year, we are celebrating our 150th anniversary. It's a time to reflect on those 150 years of living our values of achieving profitable growth, emphasizing innovation, preserving our good name, being a good place to work and being a good citizen. It is also gratifying to be recognized for the continuation of those values. So far in 2024, our team has received several honors that reflect our employees' dedication to our core values. Earlier this year, A. O. Smith was named one of the world's most ethical companies by Ethisphere, a global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices. In addition, our commitment to innovation and energy management has resulted in our Nanjing China plant being selected as one of the 2024 Nanjing Environment Protection Model Enterprises in recognition of our waste and emission reduction efforts. We also received a 2024 ENERGY STAR Sustained Excellence Partner of the Year Award from the EPA for the sixth year in a row for our long-term commitment to energy management through our products. In addition, we were named 2024 U.S. News Best Companies to Work for in manufacturing by U.S. News & World Report. While the reward is the satisfaction our team receives for doing the right thing and living our values, these honors validate our values as a differentiator for our employees and stakeholders. I'll now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on our second quarter performance. Chuck Lauber : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 7. Second quarter sales in the North America segment were $791 million, a 9% increase compared with 2023, driven by higher water heater and boiler volumes as well as year-over-year pricing actions. North America segment earnings of $198 million increased 2% compared with 2023 adjusted segment earnings. The higher segment earnings were primarily driven by increased volumes and pricing that were partially offset by higher steel costs and higher selling expenses to support our growth initiatives including the launch of our gas-tankless products. Segment margin was 25.1%, a decrease of 180 basis points year-over-year. The lower segment margin was due to the reasons I reviewed with regard to segment earnings, which more than offset higher volumes in the quarter. Moving to Slide 8. Rest of the World segment sales of $245 million were essentially flat to last year and included unfavorable currency translation of approximately $7 million, primarily related to China as well as intersegment sales associated with recently launched tankless water heaters. Segment third-party sales increased 3% on a constant currency basis. The increase was partially driven by higher sales of kitchen and HVAC products, partially offset by lower sales of residential water treatment products in China. India sales grew 16% in local currency in the quarter, driven by growth in both water heater and water treatment categories with particular strength in our e-commerce, retail and commercial end markets. Rest of the World segment earnings of $26 million decreased slightly compared to segment earnings in 2023, primarily due to the unfavorable product mix and sales promotions in China. Third-party segment operating margin was 11.5%, slightly lower than segment margin in 2023. Please turn to Slide 9. We generated free cash flow of $119 million during the first half of 2024, a decrease from the same period last year, primarily as a result of higher inventory and accounts receivable balance as well as higher incentive payments associated with record sales and profits last year, which more than offset higher earnings and higher trade payable balances. Capital expenditures increased $21 million year-over-year driven by our expansion projects. Our cash balance totaled $233 million at the end of June, and our net cash position was $93 million. Our leverage ratio was 6.8% as measured by total debt to total capital. Now let's turn to Slide 10. In addition to returning capital to shareholders, we continue to see opportunities for organic growth, innovation and new product development across all of our product lines and geographies. As Kevin mentioned earlier, we signed an agreement last week to acquire Pureit from Unilever for $120 million. Pureit offers a broad range of residential water purification solutions and has annual sales of approximately US$60 million, primarily in India. The addition of Pureit strengthens our leadership position as a global supplier of premium water treatment products and will double our market penetration in South Asia. The acquisition will also support our corporate strategy by enhancing our premium product portfolio and distribution footprint. Please turn to Slide 11 and our 2024 earnings guidance and outlook. We narrowed our 2024 EPS outlook to an expected range of $3.95 to $4.10 per share. The midpoint of our EPS range has not changed and represents an increase of 6% compared with 2023 adjusted EPS. Our outlook is based on a number of key assumptions, including our guidance assumes that our steel costs in the full year 2024 will be roughly flat to 2023. Our outlook assumes non-steel material costs that are similar in 2024 as they were in 2023. Our guidance also assumes a relatively stable supply chain environment, similar to what we experienced throughout 2023. We began shipping our internally designed and manufactured gas-tankless products in the second quarter. These products are being manufactured in our China facility until our North America capacity is completed in 2025. Associated import tariffs and other launch costs will impact North America margins by approximately 50 basis points in 2024. The tariff will be eliminated when production moves to Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico. For the year, CapEx should be between $105 million and $115 million, an increase over the last several years due to our capacity expansion projects, including our gas-tankless facility in Ju\u00e1rez, the expansion of our engineering capabilities in Lebanon, Tennessee and adding high-efficiency commercial water heating manufacturing capacity ahead of the 2026 regulatory changes. We expect to generate free cash flow of between $525 million and $575 million. Corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $65 million. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately 24%. And we expect to repurchase approximately $300 million of our shares of stock, resulting in outstanding diluted shares of $147 million at the end of 2024. I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin, who will provide more color on our key markets and top line growth outlook and segment expectations for 2024, while staying on Slide 11. Kevin? Kevin Wheeler : Thank you, Chuck. We reaffirm our outlook that 2024 sales will grow 3% to 5% compared to 2023, which includes the following assumptions. Our outlook includes previously announced price increases in North America water heating of 4% on most of our water heater products. Prices increase [ph] for heat pump products is 8%. We began to see realization of the price increases in the second quarter. We believe that a pre-buy ahead of the price increases pulled forward some demand in the first half of the year for both residential and commercial water heaters. We have seen some softness in our orders in July. Due to normal seasonality in the pre-buy, we maintain our projection that 2024 U.S. residential industry unit volumes to be flat to last year. And our projection that U.S. commercial water heater industry volumes will increase low single digits in 2024 is also unchanged. Our outlook assumes that new residential home construction and proactive replacement will remain at levels similar to last year. In China, we believe the economy and consumer confidence remain weak. We continue to see headwinds in consumer demand. While we are cautious about the second half of the year, we maintain our 2024 third-party sales growth guidance to be between 0% and 3% in local currency. Our forecast assumes a negative currency translation impact of approximately 2% for the year. We reaffirm that we expect our boiler sales to grow 8% to 10% over last year. Our sales growth guidance for North America water treatment of an increase of 8% to 10% is also unchanged. Based on our 2024 assumptions, we expect our North America segment margin to be approximately 25%. And the Rest of World, third-party segment margin to be approximately 10%. Please turn to Slide 12. We are pleased with our performance in the first half of 2024. We saw strong growth in water heaters in the first half of the year, which we believe was partially driven by the pre-buy. We are pleased to see a return to growth in our North America boiler business as channel inventory levels normalize and we continue to benefit from the transition to higher energy efficiency boilers, particularly in commercial applications. Our three capital expansion projects that will add capacity for key product categories in North America are on track and will position us well for long-term growth. India remains on track for another year of projected double-digit sales growth, and we're excited to complete the Pureit acquisition later this year, which will double our sales in the South Asia region. Pureit's strong brand and strength in the e-commerce channel will complement our premium brand will make us the number three residential water treatment company in India. Even as we celebrate our 150th anniversary and our rich history of innovation with employees, customers and partners, we remain focused on meeting the needs of our customers and executing our key strategic priorities to advance our leadership position in heating and treating water around the globe. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville of D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open. Matt Summerville : Thanks. A couple questions. I was hoping maybe you could spend a moment, Chuck, kind of talking about how we should be thinking about the margin cadence in both North America and Rest of the World in the back half of the year, given some of the pluses and minuses you were describing? Chuck Lauber : Yes. Good morning, Matt. Happy to. If you look at the cadence for the back half of the year, clearly, we had a strong first six months. We mentioned a bit of what we believe to be a pre-buy in the North America market with our price increase. So as you kind of look at volumes of North America, we look at Q3 as being a bit challenged because of some of that pre-buy and then Q4, probably looking very similar to Q2. So a little bit of headwind and the volumes in Q3 and a little bit of return back to where we were on Q2 in the fourth quarter with continued momentum on the tankless gas, tankless product. Margins will follow. The margin cadence in the third quarter will be challenged by the volume headwind in the third quarter. In China, we're coming off what I would say, a solid first half of the year, still see weakness in the economy, as Kevin mentioned. As always, our fourth quarter is expected to be the strongest as we go into the back half of this year. Third quarter also will be a bit challenged on the volume side, we believe. We've seen a bit of weakness, July orders, both on China and both -- within -- I'm sorry, within China and in North America. So a little bit of a slow start to the third quarter, and that will probably translate into volume headwinds, and it will leave a little bit of an impact on the margins. Matt Summerville : Got it. And then as a follow-up, could you maybe comment on what the channel inventory picture looks like in China? And I think in your prepared remarks, there was a mention about maybe seeing a little bit more price competition in the mid-price point category. Can you elaborate on that a bit? Kevin Wheeler : Yeah, hi. This is Kevin. Maybe I'll touch base on. Inventories are pretty much where we expect them to be in that 4 to 6-week range. So nothing that meaningful. There's ups and downs as we go forward. What we mentioned is it's a very competitive market. Consumer demand is weaker than it's been. And so the consumers are a bit cautious. So we're seeing a bit more I would say, promotional activities, we saw it in Q1, and that's kind of carried over into Q2 as well. I think our team is managing it really well. Again, we don't chase every order. We're very selective on how we go to market. And if you look at it overall, growing 2% in local currency in a very competitive market it has some consumer headwinds. I think our team has done a really nice job of balancing those competitive dynamics. I also want to remind people that we also have some areas in China that are growing well. You look at our kitchen products are doing well. Our commercial water treatment is doing well and so was our HVAC part of the business. So being diversified as we are on the water heating side and water treatment, but also having the other adjacencies has helped -- it made a difference in this difficult market. So overall, I'm very pleased that we're in China, and we'll keep managing it in the back half of the year. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our question. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Jeff Hammond : Hey, good morning. Kevin Wheeler : Morning, Jeff. Helen Gurholt : Good morning. Jeff Hammond : Maybe just to start on the acquisition. Just give us a sense of kind of profitability of the business or opportunity from a profitability standpoint and kind of what the growth rate has been for the business in the last 5 years? Kevin Wheeler : Well, I'll take the first part of it and just to talk about the acquisition in general. First, I want to go back to our Indian business is performing really well. We have a terrific management team that's been executing for quarter after quarter. And we're looking to scale that business, both organically and inorganically. And Pureit plays a nice role in that business. It's a solid brand in the market. It complements our India business that we have today. They're stronger in e-commerce, have a nice retail presence - presence that also dovetails with our general trade and our retail presence. So overall, the business is doing well. It's a premium brand. We're not -- we do overlap. We're not exactly have products positioned right next to each other. So if you look at it, the overall, the brand, the product positioning, we're excited about bringing the team on, and doubling our business is going to make a big difference. It's going to make a difference in our scale. We're also going to be able to leverage our infrastructure and that we have on the ground there, whether it be logistics, manufacturing, you name it. So doubling our business is -- we're excited in doing with a premium company like Pureit and a premium brand really sets up nicely as we go forward after the close. Chuck Lauber : Yes. And from a financial profile, it looks very similar to our India business today. I mean, Pureit business is the majority is in India, but it's also in Bangladesh and some shipments outside of the -- in Sri Lanka and Vietnam. But in total, roughly same size of their business around $60 million. Profitability-wise, very similar to what our India business has experienced in the last couple of years, meaning low to mid-single-digit profitability. Growth-wise, as a premium brand, they've seen also very good growth in the region. Kevin mentioned 10 consecutive quarters of 15-plus percent growth. And I believe they've seen very similar growth rates. So we're pleased with the way the financial profile matches up. And as Kevin said, coming together, we would hope to continue that growth momentum on a larger base and look for opportunities to leverage the bottom line as we go forward. Jeff Hammond : Okay. And then just on working capital, it seems like you had a much bigger working capital build in the first half versus maybe the last couple of years. Is that just timing? Do we expect to get a lot of that back in the second half? Chuck Lauber : Yes, we expect to get it back in the second half. It's timing. And it's a little bit of tankless water heater inventory being built up for the large part, it's timing. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Susan Maklari : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning, Susan. Susan Maklari : My first question is, you mentioned that boilers saw some growth or reverted back to growth in the quarter. Can you talk about what's driving that and the sustainability of it? Just any comments on the comps that you face in the back half and how you're thinking about the path from here? Kevin Wheeler : If you look at it, it's mainly on the commercial side of our business, Susan. And we came off a pretty difficult quarter last year, but still our quoting [ph] has been active. That transition from kind of standard models to high efficiency continues. So overall, we're about where we thought we would be. Our new products are doing well. I mean, the CREST boilers has always done well, but you add the Hellcat Technology on top of that. And that's just being really well received in the market. Order rates have been good. They continue to be good. Backlog is strong. So overall, I just think the commercial segment is doing well. The overall industry is slightly up, and we're doing better than the industry. And even on the residential side of the business, that's also a positive. So again, 8% to 10% coming off some easier comps, but the overall macro environment is good, and it plays really well into Lochinvar and our high efficiency focus that we've had over the years, and we're seeing some real benefits from that. Chuck Lauber : And just to comment on cadence on the comps, I mean, we were up 8% this quarter, but the comps get easier quarter-over-quarter when we get to the third and fourth quarter. So we feel very comfortable with the 8% to 10% growth. Susan Maklari : Okay. That's helpful. And then turning to steel. We've seen that come down quite a bit recently. How do you think about the flow-through of that to the business, perhaps any impact there to North America over the coming quarters? And just overall, the trend for pricing? Kevin Wheeler : Yes. I mean the steel has come down a little bit. By the way, boilers grew at 10%, I said 8%. So I'll just correct that. It's a 10% growth for the second quarter. As we look at steel, we're thinking our outlook has still roughly flat year-over-year. As we mentioned, steel went up in the second quarter compared to first quarter by about 20%. It was about 25% higher than Q2 last year. So there was a bit of a ramp up. We've seen some softening in steel. As you recall, our lag is 90 to 120 days. So as we kind of look at the back half of the year, we see quarter-over-quarter, Q2 to Q3, a little bit of relief. And then as we look into the fourth quarter, with that lag, we haven't baked in all of our indexes because they haven't all been issued. As you know, it's a monthly index that sets the pricing as you look, 90 to 120 days out. So we do expect a little bit of relief in the fourth quarter. And it pegged kind of our outlook very similar to what the index was issued for the month of June. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our question. Our next question comes from the line of Saree Boroditsky of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Saree Boroditsky : Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. You cited some softer orders in July on the water heater side. Could you just quantify this at all? And then does your guidance assume that demand stays in line with this softer July rate? Kevin Wheeler : Yes. And just to mention, we always give you an outlook for the month we're in on the call. But if you look at -- we talked about a pre-buy, we do believe there was a pull ahead, and we started to see a bit of softness in May and June into July. But I think July is also are one of our weaker months, and really, the third quarter is one of our weaker months because of the summer and the heat and so forth. So that's why we do think it's going to return as we get into August and September, and that's why we're holding a flat rate for the U.S. residential tank type market through the balance of the year. So it's a temporary low that I think just gets us back to what our forecast has been for the entire year. Saree Boroditsky : Thank you. And then turning to tankless, you started to ship some in the second quarter. What are you seeing from a demand perspective there? And then just on the modeling, what is the impact from tankless to China sales this year? And does this create a challenging segment comp when you do ship production to North America next year? Kevin Wheeler : Well, I would tell you, again, we're coming from a low -- kind of a mid-single-digit market share. So we've had a very good launch. And I don't want to give you the numbers because they would sound really high. And they are for us. We're very pleased with the adoption by our customers. The -- and again, we launched the high-end condensing model first, and that's been well received by a number of customers, and it's easily hitting our expectations as we start to launch this product going forward. Again, we'll have two more products coming in by the end of the year, which will complete the line and then our factory in Ju\u00e1rez is on track, maybe a bit ahead of schedule, and we'll start to do some assembly to manufacturing towards Q4 and get ready in 2025. Maybe I'll help Chuck touch on that. But having the tariff go away at the start of 2025 is going to make a big difference in how we view this from a margin perspective going forward. Chuck Lauber : Right. I mean, Saree, from a comp perspective, it's all positive when we move to Ju\u00e1rez [ph] as we relieve ourselves of the 25% tariff. We take away of the long [ph] logistics lead time and some of the costs associated with bringing the product all the way back to North America from China. So we're really viewing when we start up production in Ju\u00e1rez is a very positive upside to our tankless category. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Your line is now open. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning, everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning, Andy. Chuck Lauber : Morning. Andy Kaplowitz : So you mentioned lingering pricing promotion pressure in China. I think you talked about margin there a little bit, but you obviously kept your guidance for Rest of the World margin 10%. So my question is how difficult it is to maintain that margin sort of guidance moving forward? What cost actions or anything else are you doing to sort of offset lingering price pressure? Kevin Wheeler : Yes, I'll touch on it first, and then maybe Chuck will jump in. It's a tough market. And as we said, we're cautious about even our guidance. But our team is doing a terrific job balancing not only price and promotion, but also the cost of our business. We talked way back when, when we went through the pandemic. A lot of our costs are now more variable than they are fixed. And so we're just balancing it. Again, we're a premium brand. So we're in a different part of the market in a different clientele. But overall, it's still a tough environment. And most of the pressures that we're receiving are kind of in that mid- to upper mid level, not on the higher level. And our team is evaluating it. Again, I think we're taking a targeted approach. It's not going to be easy, but we're confident in our China management that they can navigate the way through the second half of the year. Chuck Lauber : Yes. We took quite a few cost actions over - within the COVID time frame in China like Kevin said, to change some of our cost structure to more variable take costs out of the business. Closed some very less profitable store footprints and feel pretty good about our position to be flexible as volumes challenge us a bit. So we'll continue to watch it. Right now, I think we've got China at about 11% for the year, very similar to last year. We anticipate being able to kind of work through it and continue to focus on cost and be at that percentage. Kevin Wheeler : Yes. And we'll introduce a few new products in the back half of the year. Chuck mentioned, Q4 is our strongest quarter. And again, we're building some momentum in commercial water treatment. We're building momentum in our HVAC side. So again, putting the combination together challenging, but we think it's very doable. Andy Kaplowitz : Got it. And I just want to maybe ask the same question on North America, again, like in terms of the margin, like just to make sure I understand it. And so steel [ph] slightly better. You're saying flattish versus a modest headwind, I think, is what you previously said. But you also talked about Q3 maybe being a little light or lighter in sort of volume. And I guess that's the incremental margin headwind holding you back. Is there anything else like launch costs, investments a little higher than you expected? I know you said the 50 basis points. So any color would be helpful. Kevin Wheeler : I mean nothing new. I don't think that that we've talked -- that we haven't talked about before. I'll just mention that the tankless launch does cause some pressure on margins, that 50 basis points is sort of spread to the full year margin projection of 25%. So clearly, as we launch it, it's heavier weighted into Q2, 3 and 4. So that's probably the only other area of a little bit of headwind on margins that I would say to take into account as you're thinking about the back half of the year. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Your line is now open. David MacGregor : Yes. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my questions. I guess I wanted to focus in on the increased selling expense in North America. Can you talk about how that North American selling expense compared year-over-year when you exclude the gas tankless rollout? And also, I guess how we should be modeling that through the second half? Kevin Wheeler : Yes. I mean it really tracks closely with volumes, right? So our cost structure on selling expense is largely based on a commission basis. So as we sell more product, we're going to have a higher selling expense. We also emphasize different products with a different commission level to drive initiatives from time to time. So somewhat variable, I think, is the best way to look at it, and it tracks closer to volumes than it does just kind of flat out expenses. We do mention the launch of tankless products. So we've got some initiatives within our launch of the tankless products that's driving that number, just a little bit higher. Chuck Lauber : Yes, I just would add, I mean, we're excited about our tankless offering, be that is internally designed. It's going to be manufactured in North America. And we're going to own the category and from our own perspective rather than from partnering with somebody. So we're going to expend some -- we're going to promote this product for the first part of the year, make sure we could get everybody to understand what the product does, training, some promotional activities. All those are really important for us to get that product into the market, make sure people understand the futures and benefits and how they really can benefit them going forward and how we can compete long term in this category. So this is a onetime expense, but it's one that we're going to kind of lean into and make sure that we get the product off and off to a good start. David MacGregor : Got it. Thanks for that. And then as a follow-up on the boiler business, I mean you guided to up 8% to 10% for the year. What's the right way to think about how profitability compares with last year and what you may have in your guidance? Chuck Lauber : Well, volumes being up certainly helps us. When you look at the boiler business, it's largely a commercial product that we're talking about being increased 8% to 10%. So it's an improvement when you've got growth in that segment or in that product category. Operator : Thank you. One moment for your next question. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham of Seaport Research Partners. Your line is now open. Scott Graham : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Kevin Wheeler : Hey, Scott. Scott Graham : Hey. So the no change in the U.S. resi water heater industry thinking of flat. I know we talked about in quarters past a couple of quarters that second half comparisons get a little bit tougher, so you want to be careful with that number, the first half year-to-date. It's up in resi, maybe even a little unexpectedly, certainly from this point of view. Is your thinking on flat now, maybe a little bit more leaning into the -- maybe the market is, in fact, weakening given your last couple of months sales volumes? Or are you kind of going to hold the course with flat because the comps are tougher? And this really -- and you're not trying to message anything. Kevin Wheeler : Yes. I don't think we're really trying to message. We've always thought we came off a pretty strong year last year. And going forward, if you look, you look at our - our merchant replacement, which is always going to stay the same proactive new construction. Again, whether it's single-family or multifamily, we felt that was going to be relatively flat. Interest rates would probably keep it flat. So we saw that the pre-buy - we're a little surprised when the 4% pull forward a bit more than we had thought. But when you step back now and you kind of look at how we started the year, kind of a trending down to maybe give some back and then you look forward the next five months. We're just very comfortable as a flat year with strong growth in gas-tankless, and we're going to see some good growth in heat pump both residential and maybe even some commercial as well. So just trying to get back on track where we really think the market is, and we're very comfortable with that flat residential outlook just based coming off a very strong year. Scott Graham : Thanks for that Kevin. So similar question. On the North American segment margin, you kind of -- you didn't change that either yet you're kind of calling for some spot weakness here in the third quarter, no pun attended. I'm just wondering, is it that -- is there no change in that margin because maybe you left some wiggle room in there and or that you're actually seeing things that are making you more bullish on the fourth quarter margin? And if so, what? Kevin Wheeler : No, I would say we're more bullish. I mean we still believe 25% is going to be where we'll end up. We were about at that in Q2 on some really nice volumes. So Q3 will be a little more challenged on that because we will give back some of the volumes at least in our outlook, and then back to volumes that would drop to the bottom line. A little lower steel than our last assumption. So there is a little bit of opportunity on the steel side when we look at kind of our guidance from a quarter ago. But we're still feeling 25% is kind of the midpoint of where we think we'll end up. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Damian Karas of UBS. Your line is now open. Damian Karas : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Helen Gurholt : Morning. Kevin Wheeler : Morning, Damian. Damian Karas : I was wondering if you might be able to give us a little bit of an update on what you're seeing for heat pump water heaters. I think we've seen states like New York and some others finalize their IRA allocation, a lot of those kind of really ramping up. So could you tell us what you've been seeing with the heat pump product, how it's been trending and kind of expectations through the rest of the year into next year? Kevin Wheeler : Yes. I would tell you that, one, I always want to start with is just a calibrate, it's still 2% of the market, but it is a growing category, and it's very specific. You just mentioned New York, California, other parts that are really promoting it. That continues to grow pretty nicely. I mean, we've kind of forecasted a 25% to 30% growth over the next several years, but we were north of that in Q2. So it still gets momentum. We have a great product line. We're having more and more distributors and retailers stock it in a broader variety. So that's a good thing, availability is everything. So overall, the category continues to grow, albeit in certain states. But again, it's well above our growth that we've had, and we see it continuing. It's a great product. We have a great product line. It has a nice payback story. It's just one that needs to be planned and so forth in the markets that are subsidizing it and putting money up front and helping with the purchase, it's growing quite well. So again, 25%, 30% going forward the next several years, and we had a nice Q2, there was several points above that. Damian Karas : Great. That's good to hear. And then maybe if we could touch back just on the North American tankless. Congrats on getting that product rolled out. Now I know a lot of your wholesale distributors across the country for your tank products have relied on other manufacturers, such as Rinnai, Navien [ph] and Rheem for tankless in the past. Can you just talk a little bit more about what you're seeing and hearing from your distributors? Are they kind of sampling in your product? Or is it sort of more of an all or none type of switch that they would have to make? Any color you could give us just kind of on the receptivity and what your conversations have been like? Kevin Wheeler : Well, I would tell you, you described the market pretty well. And so I think what we're hearing from our distributors, they have some optionality and they would like to buy from us. When you look at the commitments we have and the long-term relationships that we have with our distribution and be able to sell not only tank-type and commercial, but also tankless on there, I think, is really important. We still have to meet the market and be competitive and so forth, and we are. So overall, do I expect every one of our distributors to drop their current product lines? The answer is no. But I do look forward to adding a very competitive gas-tankless product line to their inventory and then let us compete in the market. And I think we're going to do very well. It's going to take us several years to move that forward. But again, we control our own destiny now. We have great support from our distributors. And I look forward to what's going to happen with our gas-tankless line as the next few years kind of develop. Operator : Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Helen Gurholt for closing remarks. Helen Gurholt : Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Let me conclude by reminding you that our global A. O. Smith team delivered record sales and strong EPS in the second quarter. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the quarters to come. In addition, please mark your calendars to join our presentations at three conferences this quarter, Seaport [ph] on August 20, Stifel on September 4 and D.A. Davidson on September 19. Thank you, and have a great day. Operator : Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.+",

We will be using slides as we move through today's call. You can access them on our website at investor.aosmith.com. I will now turn the call over to Kevin to begin our prepared remarks. Kevin Wheeler : Thank you Helen and good morning everyone. I'm on slide four and our third quarter results. As we previously announced, our third quarter sales and earnings decreased compared to last year as consumer demand in China and water heater demand in North America was weaker than expected. China third party sales declined 17% in local currency. North America water heater sales decreased 4% as pricing actions were more than offset by lower volumes. I am pleased with the double digit growth we had in the quarter in our North America boiler and water treatment businesses as well in India. In October, we increased our dividend by 6%. We have increased our dividend annually for the last 32 years. In addition, we are on track to close Pureit by the end of the year. Please turn to slide five. In China third quarter third party sales decreased 17% local currency as a result of weaker than expected consumer demand. We believe our position in the premium portion of the market remains stable. However, we saw increased pricing and promotional pressure, particularly in the mid-price sector of the market. While we expect consumer demand softness to persist through the remainder of the year, a government sponsored appliance trade in program and other recently announced government stimulus programs may provide a positive impact beyond 2024. In our North America water heater business, orders were softer than expected in the quarter in both the U.S. and Canada for both residential and commercial water heaters. We believe a price increase related pre buy and a reduction in our order lead times and a softening in end market demand led our customers to adjust order patterns and reduce their inventories during the quarter. As we have discussed, we launched our A.O. Smith design and manufactured tankless product in the second quarter, which is currently manufactured in our China facility. Early feedback has been positive on our innovative scale resistant design. While sales have lagged our expectations, we remain positive about the long term outlook and we are on track to launch two additional models in early 2025. Our North America boiler sales grew 15% in the quarter compared to last year. As our commercial condensing boilers continue to perform well in the market, we believe we are growing our share in the commercial condensing portion of the market led by our CREST boilers with Hellcat Technology. North America water treatment sales increased 16% year-over-year due to acquisition related dealer sales and organic growth in our dealer and wholesale channels. I'm now on slide six. As we have discussed earlier this year, we commenced several expansion projects in 2024 to support our long-term growth strategy. We recently celebrated the grand opening of our new facility on our campus in Ju\u00e1rez where we will manufacture gas tankless water heaters for North America. While there is still startup work to be completed, production is expected to begin in early 2025 with the ramp up through the year. We have also added additional heat pump capacity on the same site in support of increased demand for our residential heat pump water heaters. Also, we have made progress on our new state of the art commercial product development center, which is located on the same site as our Lebanon, Tennessee facility. This expanded facility, which is projected to be completed in mid-2025, will enhance our product development and testing capabilities and knowledge sharing by bringing together our commercial water heater and boiler engineering teams. I'll now turn the call over to Chuck who will provide more details on our third quarter performance. Chuck Lauber : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning everyone. I'm on slide seven. Third quarter sales in the North America segment were $703 million, a 1% decline compared with 2023, as higher boiler and water treatment sales and the benefit of year-over-year pricing actions were more than offset by lower residential and commercial water heating volumes. North America segment earnings of $163 million decreased 4% compared with 2023. Segment margin was 23.1%, a decrease of 80 basis points year-over-year. The lower segment earnings and segment margin were primarily driven by lower water heating volumes that were partially offset by higher boiler and water treatment sales and pricing. Moving to slide eight, rest of the world segment sales of $210 million decreased 10% compared to last year. The decline was primarily driven by lower sales of our core water heater and water treatment products in China India sales increased 12% in local currency in the quarter as our new products continue to be well received in the market. Rest of the world segment earnings of $14 million and segment margin was 6.5% in 2024 compared to segment earnings of $23.2 million and segment margin of 9.9% in the prior year. The lower segment earnings and segment margin were driven by lower sales, partially offset by lower material costs that resulted from cost saving projects in China. Please turn to slide nine we generated free cash flow of $283 million during the first nine months of 2024, a decrease from the same period last year, primarily as a result of higher inventory balances as well as in higher incentive payments associated with record sales and profits. Last year, they were partially offset by lower accounts receivable balances. Capital expenditures increased $35 million year-over-year due to the growth focused expansion projects that Kevin just reviewed. Our cash balance totaled $256 million at the end of September and our net cash position was $136 billion. Our leverage ratio was 5.9% as measured by total debt to total capital. Now turn to slide 10. In addition to returning capital to shareholders, we continue to see opportunities for organic growth, innovation and new product development across all of our product lines and geographies. As previously announced, we signed an agreement to acquire Pureit from Unilever for $120 million. The acquisition aligns with our strategy of adding scale and enhancing our premium water treatment product portfolio distribution footprint in the South Asia region, particularly in India. The acquisition of Pureit is on track to close by the end of 2024. Earlier this month, our board approved a 6% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.34 per share. We repurchased approximately 2.9 million shares of common stock in the first nine months of 2024, for a total of $237 million. Please turn to slide 11 and our updated 2024 earnings guidance and outlook. We reaffirm our recently revised 2024 EPS outlook to an expected range of $3.70 to $3.85 per share. Our outlook is based on a number of key assumptions, including our guidance assumes that material costs in the full year 2024 will be roughly flat to 2023. Our guidance also assumes a relatively stable supply chain environment similar to what we experienced throughout 2023. For the year, CapEx should be between $105 million and $115 million, an increase year-over-year and from the past several years, due to our capacity expansion projects and expanded engineering capabilities. We expect to generate operating cash flow of $525 million and free cash flow of approximately $415 million, a reduction from our previous guidance due to the lower earnings outlook, increased inventories and lower customer deposits in China. Corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $70 million. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately 24% and we expect to repurchase approximately $300 million of shares of our stock, resulting in an outstanding diluted shares of $147 million at the end of 2024. I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin who will provide more color on key markets and top line growth outlook and segment expectations, all while staying on slide 1l. Kevin? Kevin Wheeler : Thank you, Chuck. We reaffirm our recently revised outlook for 2024 sales to be approximately flat to 2023, which includes the following assumptions. In China, we believe that the weakness we experienced in the market in the third quarter will persist through the remainder of the year. While we are encouraged by the recently announced government stimulus programs, we expect minimal impact from the programs in 2024. As a result, we lowered our 2024 China third party sales guidance to be a decrease of between 6% and 8% local currency. Our forecast assumes a negative currency translation impact of approximately 1% for the year. Our North America residential water heater orders have been weaker than we expected since July when we provided our prior guidance. With our improved lead times, reduced backlog, and some signals of softness in the market, we believe our customers have reduced their inventories and that inventories will remain at current levels for the remainder of the year. Our July outlook assumed we would outperform the market and slightly improve our share year-over-year. On weaker orders we project our share will remain similar to last year. We maintain our projection that the 2024 U.S. residential industry unit volumes will be relatively flat to last year. We have reduced our projection for the U.S. commercial water heater industry volumes from a low single digit increase to approximately flat in 2024. There has also been an industry wide mix shift within the commercial categories where electric unit shipments have increased and gas unit shipments have decreased compared to last year. We are pleased with our share in both categories. However, the change in the mix creates a headwind as the average price of a commercial gas water heater is approximately three times that of a commercial electric heater. The benefits of our previously announced price increases in North America water heating of 4% across most of our water heater products and 8% on heat pumps are included in our outlook. Our outlook assumes proactive replacement will remain at levels similar to last year. However, on signals of end market demand softening, we'll be watching our data closely. We revised our boiler sales growth guidance to be approximately 8% on the lower end of our previous range. We are pleased with our commercial boiler sales. However, we see weakness in our residential order rates. Our sales growth guidance for North America water treatment of an increase of 8% to 10% is unchanged. Based on our revised 2024 assumptions, we expect our North America segment margin to be approximately 24.5% and rest of the World third party segment margin to be approximately 8%. Please turn to slide 12. We are pleased with our boiler and North America water treatment sales growth in the quarter. Our China and North American water heater businesses experienced challenges in the third quarter. Although we have some caution around end market demand, we expect quarter-over-quarter improvement in North America water heater volumes and even though we expect the weak demand in China to continue through the end of the year, our outlook projects quarter-over-quarter sales improvements as fourth quarter sales are typically seasonally stronger in China due to shopping holidays. We are pleased with our year-to-date sales growth in our North America boiler business, particularly for our high efficiency commercial products. Market optimism continues. However, we have seen a modest slowdown in coating activity. As we have in the past we are assessing the current environment in China now, reviewing our operations to optimize the business to align with lower volumes and create a solid foundation to leverage profitable growth in the future. In our manufacturing facilities in North America, we have adjusted to operate more efficiently at the current lower volume rates while still maintaining our improved lead times. A.O. Smith has 150 year history of navigating through all economic cycles. We estimate replacement demand represents approximately 80% to 85% of U.S. water heater and boiler volumes. That stable replacement as well as our strong balance sheet allows us to continue investing for the long-term in ourselves and through acquisitions. We are focused on servicing our customer and continue to grow our leadership position in heating and treating water. That concludes our prepared remarks and we are now available for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs. Susan Maklari : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning, Susan. Susan Maklari : My first question is focusing on the North America residential water heater segment of the business. If I'm doing the math right, I think, considering your guide, that the industry volumes will be flat for the year. And based on what we know in terms of your commentary around price in that part of the business, it would suggest that you trailed the industry fairly significantly in the third quarter, and then you expect that to reverse pretty meaningfully going through the fourth quarter. I guess. First of all, is that right? And second of all, if so, can you just talk to what's driving those big moves that we've been seeing in the last several months? Kevin Wheeler : Yes, I think it's. Let me just step back on that a little bit. The price increase that we had in the second quarter, we talked about generated motors than we anticipated a 4% and particularly an 8% increase would generate. And that, that increased our lead times and pushed out some orders. And when that happens, we have ERP systems in our customers that also start to generate more orders, and then we get behind. And then as we got into the second quarter and then even on our call in July, we had mentioned we saw some softness, and that was us working down our backlogs and really kind of bringing in line our lead times with again cause our distributors to reduce the inventories as they change their ERP systems back to a normal lead time. So there's been some puts and takes moving up and down in the market, but a lot of that deficit is just the inventory imbalance and timing. So when you just look at it from a share perspective, from our customers getting their fair share of the market, we're in pretty good shape. But it's just some lumpiness that we experienced that just happens during some price increases or during some volatile time. So nothing here from our side that I would tell you that we're concerned about. It's just something that we had to work through with our customers. And the only concern we have is maybe some softness that we saw in the market that we still have to work through. Chuck Lauber : And maybe just a couple of comments in addition. So, as Kevin said, there's a lot of timing that goes on with that. And we, we haven't changed our full year outlook. But in July, a flat industry, I would say we were thinking of it as flat being really the floor and probably flat to up. And now as we look at the full year being flat, we'd say that, the flat is probably the ceiling and more flat to down. So just kind of to gauge that for the fourth quarter, we feel very good about going into the fourth quarter, at least at the trend rate of what we see in orders, which have increased, really starting from August through September. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBank Capital Markets, Inc. Jeff Hammond : Hey, good morning, guys. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Jeff Hammond : Just wondering about the stickiness of your March price increase. We've seen a lot of deflation in steel, and I'm just wondering if that's making it harder to push price in North America. Kevin Wheeler : Well, you know how much we like to talk about pricing here, but it's a good question. And as we look at it, the increase was executed as we indicated. And I would tell you the markets are always competitive. But as I step back and how we build our business plan and what we expect out of volume and pricing, we're exactly where we thought we would be according to our plan. So it's a competitive market, but nothing from a perspective that we're concerned about. Our goal is always, always come back to. Our goal is always to keep our customers competitive. And I feel we're in good position as we head into the fourth quarter. Jeff Hammond : Okay. And then just on China, I mean, the business has been down significantly, then uneven for some time and the returns are much lower than the North America business. Just wondering how you're thinking about that business strategically, long-term, does it make sense in the portfolio? As an analyst, we get increasing number of questions about that over the last, 12, 18 months. Thanks. Kevin Wheeler : Yes, that's a fair question. I mean, let me step back. A. O. Smith is a long term company, and when we sit back and look at the markets, there's three markets that I think A. O. Smith should participate in and be a part of going forward on a long-term basis, obviously is the U.S. I would tell you China is right behind that. It's the second largest economy moving potentially to the number one economy in the market still has a lot of upside from urbanization in the middle class. And the third is India. And you put those three countries together where we have footprints in those markets, strong brands, strong organization. So to answer your question more on a holistic standpoint, we're very comfortable in the markets that we're in and we see them have an upside, albeit some markets go through some tough patches and we're going through one in China. But long-term we still feel the demographics and so forth and the economics make sense for A. O. Smith. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville from D.A. Davidson Co. Matt Summerville : Maybe just to follow up on China. Obviously any early read you have on how we should be thinking about that business in 2025 in the context of the stimulus that you mentioned and do you feel like this is the beginning of a longer duration down cycle in China? I'm just kind of getting back to Jeff's comment, which I thought was a fair one. I mean, this business has not been able to sustain, string together a multiyear period of growth since the late 2010s. Kevin Wheeler : Yes, I think it's a little early on the stimulus side. We do think that's a positive outcome that, that we still need more information about. But again, as you look at it, I think the government of China realizes that they need to do something. They've announced a number of stimulus programs to increase credit to the stall construction projects. They've canceled purchasing restrictions, lower mortgage rates down. They put out a litany of lists I think are going to have a positive impact. However, we still don't know the size of the stimulus and that's an important part of it. But again, when you look at the market, you look at our brand, you look at our value proposition there, we still think there's upside. Again, it's been a tougher haul the last few years, particularly coming out of COVID. But again, the stimulus programs, people are talking about our brand positioning, our distributors and so forth. We still feel good about the business. Now when's it going to come out of that? That's a whole different story. We don't forecast that, but we do prepare our business to do business in that environment and we talked about that, how we're assessing the business today. But overall it's, I think we'll get some good indication of what the stimulus looks like over the next few weeks and then we'll start to tie that back into what it means for our business going forward. Matt Summerville : Then just as a follow up, you mentioned what sounds like it may be more of a sustained pivot in your North America commercial business to electric away from gas. Are you appropriately capacitized today to address that market trend? Help me kind of understand a little bit more about what's going on there. Kevin Wheeler : Yes, Matt, we're very comfortable with our share in both electric and gas. And if you recall, earlier in the year we were talking a bit about being heavier on the gas side of the business, which helped us a bit in Q1 and Q2. And now it's real what we're really seeing is a little bit of an unwind of that and from a headwind. We'll be facing that in the back half of the year. But we're very comfortable with our capacity and our position in both electric and gas commercial. Matt Summerville : Got it. Thank you guys. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Saree Boroditsky from Jefferies. Saree Boroditsky : Hi, good morning. Just as we look towards 2025, can you just walk us through the impact of the tankless water heater factory switch on both the rest of the world and North America segments? Because I think it should be a maybe a headwind to rest of world sales, but a margin benefit. So it should be helpful to kind of walk through those impacts as we look to next year. Kevin Wheeler : Yes, we will reserve, kind of framing it in a lot of detail as far as what it actually means for 2025. But the headwind that we're talking about this year and we've been talking about 50 basis points to the full year to launch tankless and Kevin mentioned we're a little behind. So most of the weight, it'll be a little less than that because we're a little behind. But most of the weight will hit the fourth quarter going into next year. We would still expect a headwind. There's some benefit to the rest of the world from the volume perspective. But as we've talked about, we'll be transitioning that product from manufacturing in China to our Ju\u00e1rez facility over the course of 2025. So there will be a continued headwind into 2025, but we'll frame that a little bit closer as we get into the end of January and on our fourth quarter call. Saree Boroditsky : Thank you. And maybe just digging into the residential water heaters in North America a little bit more. It seems like, quarter to date shipments are up for the industry. So you just help us understand how you performed in residential water heater volume from a volume perspective in the third quarter. How did this differ from the market, and if there was a difference, why is that the case? Thank you. Kevin Wheeler : Yes. Again, the data you see is always a month or two behind. So based on our September and how we finished the quarter, we look at the industry having a pretty good shift back down in that 10% range, if you will. It's going to come in line to where we thought that the 3% you're talking about, we don't believe it's going to stick. There's going to be further softening in that number. And that's why we're, we've been pretty consistent. We talked about it being flat for the rest of the year, and we're, as Chuck just mentioned, we think it's flat to maybe slightly down by the time we exit 2024. So, you know, I just think it's timing in the orders and how things are, are actually going to play out in 2024. But we're very comfortable. We think that the industry is going to be relatively flat. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Blair from Oppenheimer. Kevin Wheeler : Morning, Bryan. Hey, Bryan. If you can hear us, we can't hear you. Operator : Bryan Blair from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Please proceed. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran from Baird. Mike Halloran : Good morning, everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Hey, Mike. Mike Halloran : So just kind of following up on the last question there, maybe just talk about what sellout dynamics look like from an industry perspective. So I guess kind of twofold, is it more stable from a sellout perspective and then secondarily, when you look at your specific sellout data through your channel, I mean, is that what kind of backs up the stable share side of things from your perspective? Kevin Wheeler : Yes. I would tell you we don't have perfect Mike, we don't perfect sell out information, but we do communicate with our customers on a pretty regular basis. And it varies by market. But we have distributors that are plus, say, low single digits up to some that are low single down. I think some of them are leaning a bit more to kind of even. But the feedback we're getting is things have slowed a little bit. But know, overall, the market's still holding up and, but it's going to be in that kind of flattish zone as we go forward and don't see anything changing there right now based on the customer feedback that we have, and that goes for both our residential business and our commercial business. Chuck Lauber : Yes. And I would just add that, one of the insights we get is we do that proactive replacement survey. And so we did that again this quarter and it's maintained relatively in the same position. So proactive replacement has been fairly strong. So we don't, we don't see a concern on proactive replacement movement down as of this quarter. Mike Halloran : Right. Thanks for that. And then secondarily, just maybe talk about how you're thinking about steel cost and kind of the price cost trend from here as we, as we look at the fourth quarter and then, kind of loose thoughts on steel curve into the front part of next year. Kevin Wheeler : Yes, I mean, we've gone to the fourth quarter. We had a little bit of help on steel since steel took a tick, favorable of about, maybe 15% movement from Q3 to Q4. Some of that also is timing as we slow down kind of volumes, we've got a little bit of a lag and we're going to experience that. But our price, the other costs, I mean, I think we, in our prepared remarks, we said overall material costs relatively flat. So while still is a little favorable for the fourth quarter year, fourth quarter and the year other material costs are a little bit unfavorable. So relatively flat. So price costs, we feel pretty stable on going into the fourth quarter. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research. David MacGregor : Yes. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. You had talked in your prepared remarks about with respect to North American water heater, the de-stock and just softer conditions, slightly slower coating activity, I think is what you said. Is it your sense that this is just replacement demand slowing down? You've indicated proactive is stable, or is it just builder and particularly maybe multifamily starting to impact that? And I guess to what extent you can talk about these factors that you've identified as having a negative influence on North American second half. Are they expected to carry forward as earnings headwinds into 25, where you're largely looking upon these as second half 24 issues? Kevin Wheeler : Yes, I guess I would take it that replacements obviously continues to be stable. As Chuck just mentioned, it's been four years that we've had proactive replacement at the higher level. So I'm almost calling that a trend now. And so when we look at the quarter and the lower order rates, we really believe that was primarily driven by inventory and just people rebalancing their inventories for one hour lead times, but also for maybe a bit slower demand over their counter. So that's really, I think the key part of it. It was an inventory correction driven by lead times coming down and I, the rest of the business seems to be pretty stable. Multifamily is down a little bit, but I don't think that's going to be a big driver as we close Q4. Chuck Lauber : I'll add that, we do get comfort on kind of what we see in trends overall residential order rates. So we said on our last call in July, order rates were down. We saw August also a bit down in order rates and residential, but then September took a tick up in order rates and October months to date is also up a bit. So, that trend just is very positive and gives us a confidence that it's largely related to the pre buy as you go into the fourth quarter. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham from Seaport Research Partners Scott Graham : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Kevin Wheeler : Hey, Scott. Scott Graham : I wanted to just talk about China again because you had organic positive in the first half and third quarter was a pretty significant turnaround from that. And I know you talked about pricing and I guess it would be the upper middle price point, but that's, I thought, less than half of those sales. So could you unbundle that for us a little bit? What do you think caused the significant flip in China sales in the third quarter versus the first half? Kevin Wheeler : Yes, I'm going to give you what we feel are some possible reasons for it. It comes back to consumer confidence. And if you look at the Q3, there's two items. GDP doesn't always tell us a whole lot, but one area that we look at constantly is property development and what's happened in that property market, and it got significantly worse, hasn't been addressed. And so if you look at it. If you own property, about 70% of the Chinese consumer\u2019s wealth is in property, so that's continuing to decline. So I think that's driven some real poor confidence by the consumer and really holding back their spending. And I think it accelerated in Q3. And if you look at employment also, it's been a challenge there. And a lot of that I think happened in Q3 and it just accelerated the lack of consumer confidence where consumers just stepped back and decided they weren't going to spend unless it was absolutely necessary. Those, that's how we feel. The quarter, I mean, it was going along pretty well, as you talked about for the first six months, but there was a change there, particularly in the property sector, that I think got the consumers attention. Chuck Lauber : Just one other, one other add on to that and Kevin's, Kevin's comments cover the majority of the impact for the quarter. We also did launch our kitchen products last year in Q3, so we're anniversarying [ph] that and up against kind of our launch of that. We didn't have any benefit for kitchen products quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. As we've come across that anniversary of launching those products. Scott Graham : That makes a lot of sense. Thank you for that color. I guess really the other question is on tankless. I think obviously you had high hopes in that area. What do you think is the drawback here? Is it maybe just that the market has weakened a little bit for, let's say on the, maybe on the proactive side, it would seem, because the housing stats haven't really gotten worse. Right. So maybe on the proactive side, has that led into that sort of weaker reception to new products and in this case, the tankless? Kevin Wheeler : No, I don't think it's that specific. Remember we launched one product category that was our premium condensed premix product line. So that's the upper end of the market as we launched it. And again, there's still two other product lines that we'll be launching in early 2025. It might have got caught up a little bit into Q3 and some of the destocking that happened there. But if I step back, it's, this is a long term approach. You have to. My view is we're going to have to take share on a regular basis as we go forward. We think we have the product lines, the features and benefits. Being North America, having our own control, I think is going to be terrific. It's going to reduce lead times for our customers. They'll be able to put it on their trucks with water heaters. So there's a number of things that come along here, but we're in the early, early stages. We just launched it in May, but we just wanted to give you some color, how things were going forward. But as we start to launch the new product, start to build out, we're still very comfortable and as we mentioned in our analyst meeting, that we feel there's $100 million incremental sales for us as we get towards 2026. So, Scott, I just think it's just too early to make any assumptions there. Well, the full product line, we should see a nice tick up as we enter in 2025. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones from Stifel. Nathan Jones : Good morning, everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Nathan Jones : I wanted to just ask a question on the shortened lead times. My recollection is that your lead times have got back to normal post COVID, like a couple of years ago. So maybe you can provide just a little bit more color on what you're talking about on lead times. Did they extend out and they've come back in again, or have you reduced them further or just what the details around that comment are? Kevin Wheeler : I think your memory is perfect. But they did get extended out when we did the price increase in Q1 and Q2. And so, and as we talked about, that increase was a little bit lower. That increase was, we thought would have a minimal impact, but our customers really bought into the maximum amount they could. That raised our lead times up again. If you look at an overall part of our business, our boiler lead times are in good shape. Our water treatment lead times are in good shape. But that point in time for North America water heating, that increase did put us out almost double our normal lead times. And that was a reason for it. It was a specific event, and this took us a little bit longer than we anticipated to work it down. So that's why you're hearing lead times back and forth. But we're really across most of, I'd say all of our businesses. Our lead times are pretty much where they need to be, providing there's some kind of event like an increase that would change that. Nathan Jones : Okay. And I wanted to ask a question on China from a different angle. It sounds like you don't have enough information to kind of figure out what impact this one will have. But you have been through cycles where China's provided stimulus to the market before, not deliberately for water heater markets, but for consumer spending. Can you maybe just give us a little color on some of the previous stimulus impacts that you've seen from the Chinese government, kind of how long that typically takes to flow through to the consumer? Any kind of magnitude you can put around that just from a historical perspective? Kevin Wheeler : Yes. I would tell you this is probably a bit different than the prior stimulus is. There was still a lot of FDI going into the country and people were expanding and the environment's changed. So if you go back historically on this now it's just a different environment. The market is much more mature. I think the property sector, this issue, there is one that they have to deal with they haven't had to deal with in the past. So I would really be cautious about us trying to predict how and when China will come out of this. I do think though, the steps that they're talking about taking in and it seems to be serious where they were doing more incremental stimulus and they're leaning in on a bit more larger stimulus package to move the economy. I think it's a good thing, but I couldn't really give you a prediction of when we think will come out of it. We know what they'll come out of it in some form or fashion down the road. We just, and again, I think what we're going to do is we're going to manage our business on the current environment, make the adjustments we need to make. We still have a strong brand there and then as it starts to come out, we'll be in position to really benefit from that as things start to get better in China from an economic standpoint. Chuck Lauber : I would add that we have in the past heard of appliance programs specific to appliances that have not really gained much traction. But I would say the most recent program that they've announced, a trade in program at least appears at early stages to be a little more specific, a little more qualified type of a program. So we'll see where that goes. But historically, the appliance programs have not been as specific as this last program, and again, it's early stages to that program. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Damian Karas from UBS. Damian Karas : Hey, good morning, everybody. A couple follow up questions on China. When you were talking about the water heater business there, it sounded like you're seeing varying trends in the premium side of the market versus the mid-tier price portion of your business. Could you maybe just break out the numbers to help us better understand kind of like what the difference was in the year of a trends for those two pieces? Kevin Wheeler : Well, I would say overall, we're feeling that the entire market is a bit down. So, we're feeling that. I think we're down about 17% in local currency. And I'd say it's fairly, fairly even. We feel like we've protected the premium position that we had. So our share from how we can measure it. It's always a challenge to measure share in China that we predicted our premium position, but the whole market, we feel, is a bit down, probably down a little bit more on the upper mid-price of the market because we did not fully participate in all the promotional programs. But overall, we just feel the whole market is a bit depressed based on some of the factors that Kevin mentioned earlier. Chuck Lauber : And I would just add to that again, we've been very selective. You got to remember, we sell one water heater at a time to a consumer. So if we don't participate in a promotion, someone's going to maybe lean towards a competitive brand. But overall, our brand is strong, and we're going to continue to take our targeted approach to promotions and think about the long-term value of the A.O. Smith brand and our premium position, which I think is held up really well in this difficult environment. Damian Karas : Got it. Okay. And then just thinking about that 17% core sales decline, how much of that was purely kind of volume pressures versus maybe negative price and mix impacts? Kevin Wheeler : Mostly all volume, Damian. Chuck Lauber : Yes, it's substantially all volume. You know, there's pricing pressure, and again, we didn't participate in all of that pricing pressure, but there's a little pressure on next. But the majority of that decline in volume. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes in line of David McGregor from Longbow Research. David MacGregor : Yes, thanks for taking the follow up. I guess. Just again, on China, where are unit volumes today on your premium segment, water heaters versus or maybe as a percentage of pre-COVID levels? Kevin Wheeler : Well, if you go back, and if you go back pre 2019, 2018, the majority of our sales were falling into the premium category and keeping the same baseline measurement on how we define premium. In the third quarter, quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year, we actually saw an increase in the premium portion of our market that we sold. So a little over 60% on the water heating side is in the premium category. And I would say on the water treatment side, it's a little bit less. We're kind of hovering the 40% to 30% premium. David MacGregor : Great. I guess I was just trying to get a sense of a compare versus where you were pre-COVID. Kevin Wheeler : Pre-COVID. Before we saw a downturn a bit in the market, we were above 90% premium. The majority of our product was premium, particularly on the water heating side at that time. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Blair from Oppenheimer. Bryan Blair : Good morning, everyone. Helen Gurholt : Good morning. Bryan Blair : Unfortunately, it's a technical issue, so I cut out from the call for a bit. I apologize if I'm repeating any questions there. You mentioned optimizing costs both China and North America in response to demand conditions. Are there structural costs actions that are in flight right now? If so, can you quantify the anticipated savings or are these more variable moves for the timing? Kevin Wheeler : Well, I'll cover China separately from North America. I mean, I'll say in North America we've made a few moves by realigning, aligning production between plants. We've reduced some headcount through attrition. We've balanced, really production and headcount at our largest facility. So taking some actions in the manufacturing facility to be able to adjust to the volumes in the third quarter, which did cause a headwind to our margin in Q3, but feel like we're in a decent position going out of Q3 into Q4 in North America. In China, when we're looking at China, we have really two pieces. One is we're always looking at cost reduction. It's part of our process and it's part of our process through looking at product innovation, redesigning product to take cost out, process improvement in the plant. So that's an ongoing process along with that ongoing process, particularly since COVID is looking at the efficiencies of our store footprint, looking to streamline and improve the efficiencies and what we support for retail outlets. So those things continue. And in the current environment, as we did going into COVID, we're challenging ourselves to evaluate structurally. Is this the right foundation? And we want to have the best foundation. So we're taking a look at kind of our cost in China to be in a stronger position for profitable growth in the future. We don't have a quantification of what that may or may not cost, but we'll be looking at that through the course of the quarter and be back talking about kind of where we're at on China when we get into January. Bryan Blair : Understood. And perhaps offer a smart color on your pending peer at acquisition. I think high level and strategically makes a lot of sense. Just hoping you offer some detail on how the asset helps to accelerate profitable growth in South Asia and India in particular. The low to mid-single digit margin profile you have right now, the levers to the upside, is that as simple as scale channel presence? How else will that make your business that much stronger in the region? Kevin Wheeler : Yes, those are two pretty important items that you just mentioned, scale and footprint, along with complementary brands in the markets. Pureit has some strengths. Certain markets like e-commerce that we don't. And you look at bringing the scale together and leveraging the various functions and so forth as we go forward, having access to different markets that maybe one side didn't then putting the combination together to, bring a package to a, some type of dealer or retailer. So the scale really matters. We're going to double our business in India, which is a big deal. We're going to move to the number three market share position, which again, gives us that foundation that we're looking for. And it's been a goal for us. India is doing quite well, but organically, we just can't grow fast enough to get where we want to be. And we think strategic acquisitions like Pureit are going to make a big difference as we scale that business up. I believe it's a perfect time coming up the election and where India is going to go. Having two strong water treatment brands in the market, being able to leverage the synergies between the two companies over the next year or two. So when you put that all together, I think it's going to drive certainly incremental margins. And we're still in the early stages. We haven't closed, but I, we look forward to not only top line growth, but profitable growth and margin enhancement as we get into the first couple of years. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good morning, everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Hey, Andy. Good morning. Andrew Kaplowitz : Could you give us a little more color into how you're thinking about North American commercial water heaters? Obviously, you revised industry forecasts down a little bit, and you mentioned in the move toward electric versus gas, but what's the risk that commercial could still get a little worse before it gets better, given it does tend to lag? What happens in U.S. residential water heaters? Kevin Wheeler : It does lag a bit. But as we look at, again, we start with our coating, we look at our distributors inventory, replacement market. I think we don't really see a significant shift down coating still seems to be holding up pretty well. Again, remember, boilers plus water heating is 85%, 80%, 85% is replacement. And then, but there is a shift going on. We have a nice heat pump product line that is in the commercial space as well. And of course, we have the premier condensing commercial gas product line. So we just think there are just going to be different solutions we're going to have to work through. What I like about our position is we have a full portfolio from gas electric to heat pump technology to condensing high efficient gas product that we can provide that solution going forward. So again, we see it being relatively flat, but don't see a further downside to the business as we exit 2024. Andrew Kaplowitz : That's helpful. And obviously boiler is still strong. I think you said you saw a modest slowdown in coating activity in boilers despite the overall strong growth. You mentioned the weaker residential boiler market. Are you at all concerned regarding slower slowdown in that market or generally still good outlook there? Kevin Wheeler : Well, we just look, we're kind of pointing out where we're at, what's happening here. Our commercial, our conditioned commercial boilers have outperformed the market this year. We've gained some share, feel really good about the pepper products, particularly some of the benefits that we have, like Hellcat technology. So there's still a lot of activity out there. We just said we saw some softness there. But again, I go back to 80%, 85% of this business is still replacement. We're heading into the cold season, which is always a good time for us. So just wanted to maybe just put that on the table. But overall, business is going well. Our backlog is where we expect it to be. So overall performing really well. I do want to make one cautious. We were up significant, as we talked about, for the quarter, but if you go back, we were. That was a pretty easy comp. But we look going into Q4 as kind of a normalized run rate for our commercial boilers. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes in the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBank Capital Markets, Inc. Jeff Hammond : Hey, guys, just a quick follow up. Free cash flow. You cut pretty significantly, clearly the lower earnings, but just walk through the moving pieces. Kevin Wheeler : Yes, it's really two moving pieces there. One is inventory. Our inventory forecast is up. And you heard a little bit about us slowing a bit on our tankless plans. We still are very positive about tankless, but it's going to be a little slower out of the gate. And so we of our inventory, that's gone up a meaningful piece of that. Probably about 40% of the increase is due to carrying more tankless inventory than we would have at the end of last year. Some of that is planned. Some of that is just a little heavier than what we would have expected in July. The other piece is in China. We get, we receive customer deposits in advance of shipments. And as we've seen, China slow, our projection on year end customer deposits just come down. So those are really the two major pieces. Operator : Okay, thank you. Thank you. At this time, I would now like to turn the conference back over to Helen Gerhard for closing remarks. Helen Gurholt : Thank you for joining us today. Let me conclude by reminding you that our Global A. O. Smith team delivered solid execution while navigating many challenges in the third quarter.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Helen Gurholt. Please go ahead. Helen Gurholt : Good morning, and welcome to the A.O. Smith full year and fourth quarter conference call. I'm Helen Gurholt, Vice President, Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis. Joining me today are Kevin Wheeler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Shafer, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer. In order to provide improved transparency into the operating results of our business, we provided non-GAAP measures. Free cash flow is defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures, adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted segment earnings and adjusted corporate expenses exclude the impact of restructuring and impairment expenses and pension settlement income and expenses. Reconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and on our website. A friendly reminder that some of our comments and answers during this conference call will be forward-looking statements that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include matters that we described in this morning's press release, among others. Also, as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. We will be using slides as we move through today's call. You can access them on our website at investor.aosmiths.com. I will now turn the call over to Kevin to begin our prepared remarks. Please turn to the next slide. Kevin Wheeler : Thank you, Helen, and good morning. First, I'd like to start off by saying that I'm pleased to have Steve Shafer joining us on the call today. Steve joined A.O. Smith in March of last year and has spent the last 10 months getting to know our business, people, customers, and operations. His global leadership experience and strategic acumen have brought a valuable perspective to our business as we continue to create value for our key stakeholders. I'm pleased to have Steve as a member of our leadership team. Turning to Slide 4 and our financial performance. After a record 2023, our sales and earnings decreased in 2024. In North America, sales increased slightly as higher boiler and water treatment sales, as well as water heater pricing benefits were offset by lower heater volumes. We experienced lower sales in China as a weak economy continued to negatively impact consumer demand which led to a 4% price decrease in our rest of the world segment local currency third-party sales. Our legacy Indian business sales grew 13% in local currency in 2024, which is approximately 2x the market. We closed the Pureit acquisition in the fourth quarter, which had a minimal impact on sales and earnings. With the strong business climate and the addition of Pureit, we continue to be excited about the long-term prospects of our India business. We returned $496 million of capital to shareholders with our dividend and share repurchases. And also in the fourth quarter, we completed construction of our tankless manufacturing facility. We put into action a strategy to improve the margin profile of our North America water treatment business. We began the process of reorganizing our China business to reduce costs and position us for profitable growth as the economy returns. And we announced our new sustainability goal of a reduction in water usage of 40 million gallons of water by 2030. This goal follows our previously announced and already achieved 10% greenhouse gas emission reduction goal. Please turn to Slide 5. North America water heater sales decreased 1% in 2024, as pricing benefits were more than offset by lower volumes. We saw strong shipments in the first half of the year, which were then balanced out by lower second half as volumes were below our expectations. We project full year residential industry unit volumes were roughly flat to 2023. We are confident in our stable retail and wholesale customer base, strong partnerships, and competitive products. Based on customer conversations and certain stocking programs that we track, we believe our customers enter 2025 with water heater inventories in a normal to lean position. During 2024, residential new construction and replacement demand will be resilient compared to 2023. We believe commercial industry unit shipments increased marginally year-over-year, driven by growth in commercial electric water heaters greater than 55 gallons. We project industry commercial gas units were down 3% to 4% in 2024. As a reminder, commercial gas has an average selling price of approximately 3x that of commercial electric units, and therefore impacting the results more meaningful than the commercial electric growth. Our North America boiler business performed as expected, and sales increased 8% compared to 2023, led by a CREST commercial boiler with Hellcat technology, as well as our Knight FTXL, one of our commercial boilers that was impacted by the 2023 channel inventory destocking. We are pleased with our 2024 boiler performance and with our market share growth in that category. North America water treatment sales grew 10% in 2024, largely driven by acquisition-related geographic expansion. We saw growth in our dealer, direct-to-consumer, and eCommerce channel that were partially offset by lower sales in the retail channel. We have taken action to rebalance our product portfolio and improve profitability. In the fourth quarter, we took a restructuring and impairment charge of $6 million to allow us to focus on the more competitive and financially attractive channels of the business. In China, full year third-party sales decreased 6% in local currency as a result of a weaker economy and soft consumer demand, particularly in the second half of the year. Higher sales of kitchen products were more than offset by lower volumes of our core water heater and water treatment products. In the fourth quarter, we took a restructuring charge of $11 million. The actions taken will reduce costs by optimizing our business structure to better position us for profitable growth when the economy improves. In the fourth quarter, the appliance-trained stimulus program generated increased demand for our products relative to the third quarter. This increased cell demand [ph] helped our customers reduce their inventory levels and improve working capital. I'll now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on our full year and fourth quarter performance. Chuck Lauber : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. We delivered sales of $3.8 billion in 2024, a decrease of 1% year-over-year. Higher boiler and water treatment sales and the benefits of pricing actions were more than offset by lower water heater volumes in North America, as well as lower sales in China. 2024 adjusted earnings were $3.73 per share, compared with adjusted earnings of $3.81 per share in 2023. Turning to Slide 6. Full year sales in the North America segment of $3 billion increased slightly compared to 2023. Pricing actions in higher boiler and water treatment sales were offset by lower volumes of water heaters. North America adjusted segment earnings of $714 million decreased 2% compared with 2023. Adjusted segment margin was 24.2%, a decrease of 60 basis points year-over-year. The lower adjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin were primarily driven by pricing benefits and higher boiler and water treatment sales that were more than offset by lower water heater volumes and continued strategic investments. Moving to Slide 7. The Rest of the World segment sales of $919 million decreased 4% year-over-year, including unfavorable currency translation of $13 million, primarily related to China. Segment third-party sales decreased 4% on a constant currency basis. Our sales decrease was primarily driven by higher sales of kitchen products that were more than offset by lower sales of water heater and water treatment products in China. India sales grew 13% in local currency in 2024 due to strong market demand for premium products. The Rest of the World adjusted segment earnings of $76 million decreased 24% compared to segment earnings in 2023 primarily due to lower sales in China. Adjusted segment margin was 8.3%, a decrease of 210 basis points compared to 2023. Please turn to Slide 8. Turning to fourth quarter performance, we delivered sales of $912 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, a decrease of 8% year-over-year, primarily due to higher boiler and water treatment sales and the benefits of pricing actions that were more than offset by lower water heater volumes in North America and lower sales in China. Adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter were $0.85 per share, compared with adjusted earnings of $0.97 per share in the fourth quarter of 2023. Please turn to Slide 9. Fourth quarter sales in the North America segment were $690 million, a 7% decrease compared to sales in the fourth quarter of 2023 as a result of higher boiler and water treatment sales as well as benefits of pricing actions that were more than offset by lower water heating costs. North American adjusted segment earnings of $154 million decreased 11% compared to 2023. Adjusted operating margin of 22.4% decreased 110 basis points compared to last year. The lower adjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin were primarily due to lower water heater volumes that were partially offset by pricing benefits and lower material costs. Moving to Slide 10. Fourth quarter Rest of the World segment sales of $237 million, decreased 9% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower sales in China. India's sales grew 11% in local currency in 2024 compared to 2023. Rest of the world adjusted segment earnings of $19 million and an adjusted segment margin of 8.1% were lower than 2023 adjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin of $30 million and 11.5%, respectively. The decreases were primarily due to lower sales in China. Please turn to Slide 11. We generated free cash flow of $474 million during 2024. Lower than 2023, primarily driven by lower earnings and higher inventory balances that were partially offset from lower accounts receivable balances. 2024 free cash flow conversion was 89%. Excluding the impact of the higher capital spending for investments we are making in 2024, our free cash flow conversion was 95%. Our cash balance totaled $276 million at the end of December, and our net cash position was $83 million. Our leverage ratio was 9.3%, as many of our total debt to total capital. Let's now turn to Slide 12. In addition to returning capital to shareholders, we see opportunities for organic growth, innovation, and new product development across all of our product lines and geographies. In addition to the strategic acquisitions we made in 2024 to grow our domestic and global water treatment footprint, we also increased investments in our business to ensure that we have the right product portfolio and capacity to continue strengthening our position as a leader across all the markets that we serve and providing the most value for our shareholders. Earlier this month, our Board approved our next quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share. We have increased our dividend for over 30 consecutive years. We repurchased approximately 3.8 million shares of common stock in 2024 for a total of $306 million. We continue our strong track record of delivering returns to shareholders. Over the last 2 years, we have returned almost $1 billion to shareholders through our dividends and share repurchases. Please turn to Slide 13 and our 2025 earnings guidance and outlook. Our 2025 outlook includes an expected EPS range of $3.60 to $3.90 per share. The midpoint of the EPS range is slightly higher than a 2024 adjusted EPS. Our outlook is based on a number of key assumptions, including our guidance assumes that steel prices in the full year 2025 will be similar to 2024, and that steel costs in the back half of the year will increase from where they are today. We project that our 2025 non-steel materials and freight costs will be roughly flat to 2024. We project the launch of our tankless products, including tariffs in place today, and higher shipping and other costs will be a headwind of approximately 50 basis points to our North America margins. We estimate that 2025 CapEx will be between $90 million and $100 million, a decrease compared to 2024, but higher than our historical CapEx as we continue to invest in our engineering capabilities and prepare for upcoming regulatory changes. We expect to generate free cash flow of between $500 million and $550 million. Interest expense is projected to be between $15 million and $20 million. Corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $75 million. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be between 24% to 24.5%. Our Board has approved 5 million additional shares of stock for repurchase and we expect to repurchase approximately $400 million of our shares of stock, higher than previous years as we have confidence in our strong free cash flow generation and we believe our shares have been undervalued in recent months. We project our outstanding diluted shares will be 142 million at the end of 2025. Our outlook does not assume a change in tariffs for China, Mexico, or Canada. Potential increase in China tariffs would temporarily negatively impact us with regard to our gas tankless imports from our facility in Nanjing until that production is fully transitioned to Juarez, Mexico. Our North America manufacturing footprint, largely based in the U.S., gives us flexibility to competitively navigate potential future tariffs which may impact trade between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. I'll now turn the call over to Steve, who will provide more color on our key markets and top line growth outlook and segment expectations for 2025, while still staying on Slide 13. Steve? Stephen Shafer : Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. Before discussing our outlook on 2025, I wanted to start by briefly sharing some early thoughts on my first 10 months with A.O. Smith. First and foremost, I've been impressed with the culture of how we do things at A.O. Smith. We are laser focused on doing business the right way, an ethical way, the Smith way. We also have a strong culture of innovation, collaboration, people development and driving performance that is a great fit to my own personal leadership style. As I've gotten to know our business better, we clearly have a portfolio of strong businesses and markets that we know well, with very close customer partnerships and industry-leading products. This positions us well to help lead the industry forward through future changes, disruptions, and opportunities. I am energized and confident in the opportunities in front of us that first drew me to join this great leadership team. Now, turning to our 2025 guidance. While I'm positive about the future positioning of our business, as Chuck highlighted in our guidance, we expect 2025 to be another year of relatively muted growth on both the top and bottom lines. Our outlook is influenced by a relatively flat industry growth expectation in our core North America water heater and boiler markets, while we expect to continue facing a soft market environment in China. We are also taking some portfolio actions that will reduce growth in North America water treatment in the short-term, but will better position our business going forward. On the bottom line, we anticipate the near-term benefits of our restructuring and realignment actions to be mostly offset in 2025 by the continued strategic investments we are making to launch and scale innovative new products in support of our North America water heating and boiler businesses. These investments will help ensure profitable growth over the long-term and build upon our market leadership. Our top line outlook includes the following assumptions. We believe that U.S. new home construction remains in a deficit, and that new construction and proactive replacement will be similar to 2024. Based on those factors, we project that 2025 residential industry unit volumes will be approximately flat to last year. We project U.S. commercial water heater industry volumes to also be flat to 2024, as demand for our commercial electric products greater than 55 gallons has returned to pre-2022 levels. In addition, our outlook includes carryover from our March 2024 price increases in North America of 4% on most of our water heater products and 8% on heat pumps. In China, we believe the economy remains challenged with low consumer confidence and a weak real estate market. While we see the stimulus programs as a positive, we think it will take time to see real, fundamental signs of recovery. As a result, we project that our sales in China will decrease 5% to 8% in local currency in 2025 as the decline in consumer demand that we experienced in the second half of 2024 carries over into 2025. Our forecast assumes that the currency translation impact will be minimal in 2025. We anticipate that our restructuring program in China will be mostly implemented by the second quarter, and we expect to realize annual savings of approximately $15 million. This would result in a recovery of operating margins to the 8% to 10% for 2025, even with lower volumes. I have worked closely with the team and feel confident the actions being taken will better position us to compete in the more mature and more competitive market environment, while still positioning us well to realize the benefits when the Chinese economy improves. While we are cautious about the near-term market outlook, including the level of sustainable impact from the appliance discount trading program, we remain confident in our team in China. We project our North American boiler sales will grow between 3% to 5% in 2025. We expect to continue benefiting from the transition to higher energy efficient boilers, particularly as commercial buildings look to improve their overall carbon footprint. We expect North American water treatment sales to be between $235 million to $245 million, a decrease of approximately 5% as we execute a reprioritization of our business to more competitive and profitable channels and products supported by our announced restructuring. We project this shift will drive an operating margin expansion of approximately 250 basis points in 2025 for the North American water treatment business. I am personally excited about the potential of the water treatment space in North America for A.O. Smith and believe the actions being taken by the team to focus on the most attractive opportunities will position us well going forward. We project mid-teen top line growth in our legacy India business as we continue to build out the A.O. Smith water franchise in this attractive market. We expect the addition of Pureit will add approximately $15 million in sales in 2025. We do not expect Pureit to have a significant bottom line contribution in 2025 as we work through the integration of this business. Based on these 2025 assumptions, we expect top line growth to be flat to up 2%. We expect our North America segment margin to be between 24% and 24.5%, and Rest of World segment margin to be between 8% and 9%. As we exit 2024 and move into 2025, our commitment remains steadfast to lead the industry forward and support our customers. We are confident that our innovation and infrastructure investments position our business for profitable growth. We remain committed to driving the following top investment priorities from 2024 into 2025 to maintain this momentum. Our continued investment in the launch and scale up of the Adapt Gas Tankless Water Heater with X3 Scale Prevention Technology. We are on schedule to introduce two additional tankless products to round out the product line in the first half of 2025. While there is a headwind to profitability today as we launched with production in China and then transfer production to Juarez, Mexico, we firmly believe that our gas tankless product line sets us up for long-term success in this product category. Also, our near-completed investment in a world-class commercial R&D testing and lab facility in Lebanon, Tennessee. The new center will house our commercial water heater and boiler engineers, where they will focus on the continued innovation of our commercial water heating and boiler portfolio. The collaboration and powerful exchange of ideas coming from this new facility will ensure that we continue to have leading-edge products, including heat pump technology, for today and into the future. And finally, our ongoing manufacturing capacity investments to serve the market as regulatory changes in federal, state and local incentives drive demand higher for specific technologies. We have increased production of commercial heat pump water heaters and doubled our residential heat pump water heater capacity to meet this growing demand. We are also increasing our capacity to produce high-efficiency condensing water heaters. To sum up, while we expect some of the market challenges in China to continue, and we anticipate growth headwinds in the first half of the year for the North American water heating business as we face tough comps against last year's order pattern, we remain confident in our future. The investments we are making in our capacity footprint, our engineering capability, and our product portfolio have us positioned well for the environment ahead, including any tariff or regulatory uncertainty. Additionally, the restructuring actions we have announced today will support our future growth and create more space for investments and more attractive space. A.O. Smith has a long history of managing through many economic cycles and uncertainties, and this proven experience will continue to serve us well. While there are growth headwinds in 2025, our leadership position in all of the markets that we serve, our stable 80% to 85% replacement business in water heaters and boilers, and our strong balance sheet allow us to continue to invest in our business, make attractive strategic acquisitions, and maximize shareholder returns. With that, we conclude our prepared remarks and we are now available for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Mike Halloran of Baird. Your line is open. Mike Halloran : Hey, good morning, everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Chuck Lauber : Good morning. Mike Halloran : Can you just help provide some thoughts on how you think demand cadence is out through the year? I certainly understand some of the remarks you made in the press release about what's volatile first half to second half of the North America water heater business, but is this a year where it's returned to relatively normal seasonality, do you think quarter-to-quarter? Any puts and takes we should think about and just kind of how that levels out through the year? Chuck Lauber : Sure. Mike, this is Chuck. It does, we -- our outlook for 2025 on the water heating side does return much more normal to the normal cadence. So, we talk about 51% to 52% in the front half of the year. The way we've laid out next year is about 51% in the front half of the year. What to really recall is that in 2024, it didn't lay out that way. 2024 laid out a bit different. The residential market was up 3% at the end of June. The commercial market was up 8% at the end of June. So in 2024, it was just not a normal cadence. So we'll have some difficult comps as we go through the first half of the year. Residential being up 3% last year means we're going to probably see the industry down 3% to 4% in the first half and a little bit stronger on the commercial side. Plus, we had a bit of tailwind in 2024 in the first half for the commercial mix. So, when you put it all together, 2025, we've got the cadence in North America closer to normal, maybe a little bit lighter on the front half of the year, but again, some pretty aggressive first half comps. Now when you look to China, China -- we're talking about volume decrease of 5% to 8%. I would say the first quarter, we're a little cautious around it. The appliance discount trading program was paused for a bit. Now it's back in place pretty quickly. And we have the Chinese festival. And as Steve outlined, our restructuring program impacts us more in the back three quarters of the year. So, just a couple comments around that. I think boilers will play out pretty similar. Third quarter is typically pretty strong. So, the caution I would have is back to closer to normal and just tough comps in the first half. Mike Halloran : Thanks for that. And then on the North American margins, kind of a two-fold question. One, maybe in the incremental color on what the treatment portfolio moves that you referenced were and then secondarily, when you think about the 50-point drag from the tankless production being China, when that moves to Juarez, does that go away or do you need some scale or any timing around how that should cadence? Kevin Wheeler : Let me take the tankless headwind for 2025 and I'll let Steve talk a little bit about water treatment restructuring. So we'll start transitioning production from Nanjing to Juarez during the early part of the year, introducing two new models in Nanjing and then eventually moving to Juarez. So that'll be about mid-year. So, we're going to see a headwind in 2025 of about 50 basis points still, we believe, as we kind of go through the year. We wouldn't wait that much different than kind of ratably through the year, because we're going to be in flight on those transitions for the year. And then, for the water treatment, I'll turn it over to Steve. Stephen Shafer : I think regarding what we're doing on the portfolio and water treatment, we've been building out this growth platform over the last 7 years, making a number of acquisitions. We've taken an approach of kind of an omni-channel go-to-market approach. And I think we've learned a lot about the business through that time. And the actions we're taking now, I think are a natural progression to focusing on the parts of the market that we think are most attractive where we can be most competitive and that are most profitable. And so with that, obviously, the restructuring is helping us to do that repositioning. We'll be kind of rotating and getting a mixed benefit to moving towards the areas that we think are more profitable, and that we see as getting us about 250 basis points of margin improvement in a year, but I think also just positioning us more successfully for the future going forward about where we're going to grow and how we're going to do it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Summerville of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Matt Summerville : Thanks. A couple of questions. Does what you're seeing in China and really what you've experienced in China over the last several years, does that change the growth algorithm as you guys sort of presented it last? And are you thinking differently about that business from a strategic standpoint? And then I have a follow-up. Kevin Wheeler : Yes, I mean, China is a market that has always moved fast and you have to be prepared and ready to respond. And I think as we've looked at the market landscape over the last few years, it's led us to make some strategic decisions about how we think about the business going forward. We've talked about launching into additional categories to help support our business and leverage our brand. And I think, going forward, certainly the last few years haven't met the growth and recovery profile that we had anticipated, but it's given us a chance to sort of learn a little bit about our market positioning and, again, our restructuring that we're announcing here today is a chance for us to do some of that and I think really get more competitive. Now, will the market come back? I think we feel confident it will. The question really is when. And it's really going to come back to consumer confidence, right. And I think when consumer confidence returns to China, we'll be able to participate in that recovery and with a stronger portfolio to do so. Chuck Lauber : Yes, maybe a little bit more onto that. We've always said that China was going to need some help from the economy. And quite frankly, we just haven't seen it materialize. And we were talking about what we outlined was about a 5% or 6% growth in our Investor Day, that first year, obviously, we're short of that. But I think if you still have 3 or 4 more years to move it forward, there are some real policy changes that are being talked about. But for us, we haven't given up on the 5% or 6%, but we do need help from the government, some stimulus to get the economy moving. Steve's right on track with the consumer confidence. It's critical because that ties into new housing formations, which is a big part of our business, as well as our premium products. So still some work to do. We saw some really nice benefits from the appliance trading program, but again, we're moving into 2025 a bit cautious because the scope and scale of these policies still need to be more defined. But we still feel really good about China. We feel good about the long-term of urbanization and growing middle class, but we do need some help from the economy to move this business forward. Matt Summerville : There's a follow-up on the water treatment side of the business. Maybe it's not clear to me what channels you're maybe deemphasizing a bit versus where you're placing greater emphasis. And as you get beyond this year, kind of a down mid single digits, what does the 3 to 5-year growth trajectory organically look like in that business? Thank you. Kevin Wheeler : Yes, it's the -- the places that we're really focusing on going forward are going to be our direct-to-consumer businesses as well as our dealer and wholesale businesses. And what we're deemphasizing is on the retail side, and we just believe we can be more competitive and have a better offering and a financially more attractive business there. And I think we still view water treatment as a growth engine for A.O. Smith. As I mentioned in my own comments, I'm excited about the space. I think there's good mega trend tailwinds there. And I think this is a natural progression of repositioning ourselves. And so, our early estimates of double-digit growth, I think we will get back to that at some point. But I think it's maybe we're evolving in terms of exactly how we'll do that. And that's part of what our process was all along, is to learn about the space, figure out where we compete, and then focus on it going forward. Chuck Lauber : And I'll just add that when we talk about our growth rate in water treatment, we've also talked about acquisitions, and that continues to be our focus, to grow, not only grow faster than the market, but also bring into A.O. Smith some additional acquisitions to grow water treatment at an accelerated rate. That's still our focus. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Damian Karas of UBS Securities. Your line is open. Damian Karas : Hi, good morning, everyone. Steve, great to have you on the call. Stephen Shafer : Thank you. Damian Karas : I was wondering if you could -- I was wondering if perhaps you saw a fall off of in North American water heater shipments in December, because the data that we were privy to the October, November HR shipments, they did seem to show sequential improvement. And I think with the normal seasonality that you see in the industry in December, your North American water heater sales would have likely been at least a few percent higher in the fourth quarter. So could you just maybe talk to the progression that you saw in water heater volumes over the course of the quarter? Kevin Wheeler : Yes. Let me just talk about that sequence. I'm going to take you back to 2023. That was a record year for our business, and that record was largely driven by our North America water heater business. And so if you go back to, because you're doing a comparison, you go back to 2023, we had a very strong back half of the year, really outperformed the market. If you remember, we had strong backlogs, kind of lead times were really out there, so our residential selling was strong, our customers were kind of building some inventory to compensate for that, for the lead times. And conversely, now you come to 2024 and our back half, and we entered that back half with our lead times back to normal. We saw, and we talked about this last quarter, we saw our wholesalers and our retailers adjust their order rates and their inventory levels, and we had a lower back half volume. So to me, it's about timing, it's situational with regards to where our customers were on the inventory side. But if you step back here, we have solid customers, base still, strong relationships, no major customer loss there. But just because of that dynamic and that timing, yes, you're right, we did see lower volumes, but there are some reasons behind it that are more situational than they are ongoing. Damian Karas : Okay, got it. And then could you just confirm, so you did see positive pricing in North American water heaters in the fourth quarter, or was that comment more of a full year comment? And I'm just curious kind of the industry in general has been pretty disciplined on pricing or if you're seeing any competitor discounting of note? Chuck Lauber : Yes, what I'll tell you is we saw, yes, we had positive pricing, and the pricing that we implemented the first quarter of last year kind of played out the way we expected it and met our expectations. So we had positive pricing across all of our categories in 2024. Now that's as far as we pretty much will talk about pricing. There's always situational discounting here in markets. That doesn't change, but what happens in maybe New York is the same thing that happens in Los Angeles. So I would just tell you we implemented, it played out what we thought. There's always a little bit of fate, but we had favorable pricing across all our categories as we planned. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Blair of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Bryan Blair : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning, Bryan. Helen Gurholt : Good morning. Bryan Blair : I wanted to follow-up, dig in a little bit more on the shift in your North American water treatment strategy. I know your team has touted the benefits of the omni-channel presence historically. Has there been meaningful change in competitive dynamics, customer dynamics within retail over recent past that drove this decision, or is it simply the sheer mass of focusing more on wholesale dealer network direct-to-consumer, having a much stronger margin profile and then deemphasizing the weaker economics of the retail strength. Stephen Shafer : This is Steve. I would say there's definitely different competitive dynamics and market dynamics across those different channels. And part of having the omni-channel approach is to learn about the consumer, learn about these channels, learn about how you compete, learn about the competitors. And I think as we've done that over the last few years, we've learned where we think our strength, our product portfolio, and our go-to-market model play best. And it's not that we're exiting and totally shutting down other channels. We're still part of the learning process, but I think we've got more clarity now on where we want to focus and where we think we can kind of win in the marketplace. And that's representative of the shift that we're talking about. Kevin Wheeler : Yes, I would just say our omni-channel approach is still there, it's just changing. Where we focus our time and energy, I think early on someone mentioned the word deemphasizing. We're not exiting any of the channels, but we are deemphasizing one area and really kind of putting more energy and effort into areas where we believe, we have competitive advantage and we can drive greater sales and margin growth. And we're excited about launching that this year and see what it would bring, but very confident in those parts of our business that really play well to our strengths. Bryan Blair : Understood. And the margin benefit you've cited is notable. You mentioned top line expectations for Pureit. Can you remind us where margins are on a run rate basis and having owned the assets for a little bit now, where you think medium-term profitability should check out? Chuck Lauber : Yes, I mean, so roughly Pureit is going to contribute in 2025 about $50 million in revenue. The earnings profile is very similar to our India business. Right now we're really leaning into growth in India, and so the operating margins and around mid single digits, very similar to our business, legacy business in India. I would say, for 2025, we've got a real focus on integrating Pureit in a way that will set us up for continued growth in India, and that integration is going on track. It's been a couple of months, but on track so far. Maybe just to touch base on, we've been looking to scale India, and this was a very important component for us to move forward. The Pureit business really complemented where we're at. They're very strong on the eCommerce and retail, and we're really strong on retail and on our dealer side of the business, or general trade, as they call it. But more importantly, that scale brings us to the number three position in the market. I think that was a nice step up, and as Chuck mentioned, it's going to take some integration. But when you combine the business, you double the size of it. It gives you some real optionality to continue to grow the business and drive costs and margin improvement. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Graham of Seaport Research Partners. Your line is open. Scott Graham : Hey, good morning and welcome, Steve. Stephen Shafer : Thanks. Good morning, Scott. Scott Graham : I think, Steve, you said 4% water heater pricing, if I heard you wrong, please correct me. And that that was a carryover number 2025? Stephen Shafer : In March we went to the marketplace with a 4% water heater price, and that's March of 2024, of which that will be carrying over into 2025. Scott Graham : Okay. And then by extension, if you're expecting steel prices to rise in the second half of the year, like I think most of us are, are we looking at another price increase sometime in the first or second quarter of this year? Kevin Wheeler : Hey, Scott. Hi, it's Kevin. Listen, I think the way that we would frame this is that how we manage pricing hasn't changed for multiple years. And as I mentioned before, one of the things that we try to do with our customers is we have credibility because we take the increases before we pass it on to them. And we also want it to the market very closely so that we know when to take those actions. And so I would just go back to historically, Scott, we've been able to offset inflation given time. That's not going to change going forward. I just don't want to get into any specifics about hypothetical if steel goes up or doesn't go up. I think if you just step back and look at our business and how we've managed it in the past, we have really the track record of addressing any inflationary pressures, whether it's steel or any other type of products or components. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Susan Maklari of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Susan Maklari : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Chuck Lauber : Good morning. Stephen Shafer : Good morning. Susan Maklari : My first question is going back to the channel inventories and water heaters. How would you generally characterize the tone of the conversations that you're having with customers? What do you think their appetite is to restock over the course of this year? Are there any key points that you or your customers are watching for to kind of determine maybe the path or the cadence for some of that restock that could come through? Kevin Wheeler : I just think, I'll let others comment on this, I just think there's a backdrop of uncertainty. And so people are going to be pretty close to watching their inventories and the driver is always going to be sellout whether you see the new construction. There's still some questions about interest rates out there. So I think if -- when we're talking to customers, they're a bit cautious going in. I think the business is still good. We've called it out to be flat on both residential and the commercial side of the business. But I think we're entering the first part of the year just with a bit cautious and letting us see how things play out. There's just a lot of moving parts right now and there hasn't been a lot to find. But overall, I guess I'd come back to that, particularly in the water heater side and boiler side, 80%, 85% is that replacement. And people just don't go without it. And the other 15%, I think, is what you're talking about. We'll have to -- we'll see how things play out in that first quarter. Chuck Lauber : And Susan, this is Chuck. I mean, when we track order rates, and we said this on our last call, sequentially our order rates were better in Q4 than Q3. So we did see an increase. So as our customers are probably in a better, normal position, they did increase orders. Then when we look into January of 2025, not as large an increase that we saw Q4 over Q3, but another increase slightly up on a daily order rate, which gives us some confidence that we're seeing that buy back in. I will note, like I said before, we have some tough comps, so order rates are not back up to 2024, first quarter, or January order rates yet. We probably won't see that for the quarter, but we are pleased that we saw a bit of an uptick in order rates in January. Susan Maklari : Okay, all right. That's helpful. And then, just wondering if you could talk a bit about the North America water treatment side. You got it for about a 5% decline there this year. Talk a bit about what you're seeing and what's driving that? Chuck Lauber : The 5% decline in the top line is primarily driven by the repositioning of the portfolio that we talked about. So as we're deemphasizing certain products and certain go-to-market models, that will be a headwind to growth, but we are still confident we see growth in the remaining focused areas. So the net of that for 2025, which is a bit of a transition year for us, will be down about that 5%, but we feel confident that with our refocusing, we'll get back to growth. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nathan Jones of Stifel. Your line is open. Nathan Jones : Good morning, everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Chuck Lauber : Good morning. Stephen Shafer : Good morning. Nathan Jones : Just maybe a question on the China trade-in/stimulus kind of programs over there. I think you said 4Q -- that the impact in 4Q was to allow your distributors to reduce some of their inventory, so it doesn't sound like there was much impact for your business in the fourth quarter. Just any more color you can give us on what you're expecting from that in 2025, kind of how you've addressed that in the guidance of down 5 [ph]. It doesn't really sound like you're expecting it to have a lot of impact on the business. So just any color you can give us around your expectations there. Stephen Shafer : Okay. This is Steve. I'll start by maybe just getting some character around the Q4. We did see the impact in our market, right? And as we talked about, the channel and the retailers had a good sell-off performance, actually had growth in the quarter, just didn't flow all the way back to our business. But it is a good indication that the trade-in program did have some demand generation effect. I think we're entering 2025 just cautious about what that sustainability looks like. It has been extended province by province. The execution of that program still is kind of working itself through. Some provinces, the program is off and running. Some are still working on how it's going to get executed. Obviously, they're in a holiday period right now, but we'll see that in Q1 in terms of just sort of what kind of continued impact it's having. We're cautious right now because we want to understand how much of it is true fundamental demand generation, right. At the end of the day, consumers need to be installing more equipment. There might have been some pent-up demand there as people were waiting for this program, so we're working through that. It's encouraging, that the impact it did have on Q4. It's encouraging that it has been extended through 2025. We're just cautious and we're following it very closely to see what that impact will actually look like for us. Nathan Jones : Is it fair to characterize the approach you've taken to guidance from that is that you're not really including any benefit from it? Stephen Shafer : Maybe a little bit, but I'd say we're very cautious, right. It could swing where we see that benefit early parts of the year, later parts of the year. But we really want -- what we're really watching for is at the end of the day is more kitchen remodeling happening. Our people living in the new apartments are people actually investing and upgrading -- and when that starts happening, fundamentally at the consumer level, that's why I think we'll have more confidence in the long-term health of the business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Saree Boroditsky at Jefferies. Your line is open. Saree Boroditsky : Hi. Good morning. Maybe a little bit longer term growth question. With China down another year, how do you think about your long-term guidance, for I believe 5% to 6% growth through 2028? Like can sales recover stronger than that to make up for the weaker start. Kevin Wheeler : Yes. I think we talked a bit about that. I mean, it's the first year in our guidance. Even in our guidance, like I said, we were looking for some recovery -- so yes, obviously, you would have to recover at least at a higher rate as we go forward. But part of that also is not just the economy, it's our mix and our products and how we're growing our premium categories. So right now, we're behind the first year. But as we look forward, I mean, I think some of the things that we are seeing are positive. But again, for us to get to that 5% or 6% number -- percent number, we just need to see real growth that's sustainable, and that still needs to play out, as Steve has mentioned. Chuck Lauber : And I would just add, as you think about 2025 we have two areas of growth for us in water treatment and in China that are going to -- we are anticipating right now to be repositioning years. And that's going to be a drag on our top line. And then I think we are also making investments and have been through last year and will continue this year, which is positioning us well, I think, for growth looking forward, but we've got to get through and get those investments executed. Saree Boroditsky : I appreciate the color. And then I know there's been a lot of talk on the North America water heater market, but just is one more, maybe just a little bit on the competitive environment. And your position, are you seeing any gains by competitors that are impacting the results and the volatility that we saw this year? Kevin Wheeler : Well, there's definitely some volatility out there and probably a little bit more than normal particularly up in the kind of the Northeast, Midwest area. But overall, I'm going to speak from an A.O. Smith perspective. We've navigated through that before. And so nothing that I would consider to be new. It's just some changes, some distributor changes. And anytime there is a change in the market, there's always some disruption, there's always opportunity. But overall, we navigated through these in the past, and we'll continue to do that. And I'll go back to our customer base is strong no loss of major customers in 2024. And those partnerships are decades long, and I think they'll continue to benefit both of us going forward. So nothing meaningful to A. O. Smith, but yes, some disruption in the market. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeff Hammond : Hi. Good morning. Helen Gurholt : Good morning. Chuck Lauber : Hey, Jeff. Jeff Hammond : Hey. I guess, Steve, good to have you on the call. I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about similar things that early observations and the things that impressed you about A. O. Smith, but just wondering where you see opportunity for change, whether it be commercial or op excellence maybe you take an early look at your tenure here? Stephen Shafer : Sure. As I said, I've been really impressed with the quality of the businesses that A. O. Smith has, market-leading position, market-leading products, really great, deep customer relationships has obviously been a lot of the last 10 months getting to know those better. But -- and had a great culture fit for me. So those are some of the positives. I do see opportunities where my experience and background has a chance to bring something new or add some value to A. O. Smith. I think I'd say right now, there's three areas that I'm kind of leaning into. One is our A. O. Smith operating system, which there's a great foundation here that we've built around a culture of problem solving on the plant floor and I've got a personal experience in deploying and running different operating systems. And I think there's an opportunity to expand it even further kind of take it to the next level, be more focused on how we're driving waste elimination. So that's an area I'm leaning into. Second one is on the IT technology side. We've built and deployed our ERP system over the last few years. And that's also an area I have some experience as a previous employer, I led the implementation of their ERP system. And I think we're at the phase now about how do we get value out of both the IT investments we've made. And then it's also a space where technology is moving quite quickly. And how do we just position ourselves for where technology is going to be more competitive as a company. And I think initially, that sort of internally, how we run the company and eventually it could be more involved in how it interacts with our products. And then the third area, I've spent a lot of time on is just on the portfolio side. And obviously, some of the restructuring announcements today are an outcome of some of that work, but thinking through how do we get more competitive with our portfolio? How do we drive innovation in the market spaces where we are at. And then taking a big picture about where is the portfolio going in the future. So I'd say those are three areas that I spent a lot of time on. Again, it taps into a little bit of sort of my own experience that I'm bringing into A. O. Smith, and I think there's a lot of lot of opportunity to build out some good foundation and add more value. Jeff Hammond : Okay, great. Appreciate the color there. Just a couple of cleanups. One, on the -- just the tariff dynamic and Mexico, Canada, can you talk about your footprint versus what you think your peers footprint, does that put yet maybe an advantage, disadvantage in any way should some of them the Mexico-Canada tariffs go in? And then just last one, corporate expense. What's driving the $10 million increase in 2025 in a tough environment? Kevin Wheeler : Well, I'm going to have Chuck take the expense side of it, but I'll take the Mexico and the tariffs and so forth in our positioning. And I'm going to candidate as well because they're both in play and -- what I would tell you that A. O. Smith is positioned pretty well with regards to that. If you look at North America, in Mexico, we do have a facility down there. That's about maybe 15% of our production. We have two large facilities in North America, which -- in the U.S., which gives us some optionality there, if needed. So -- and we are positioned well. So have a small footprint, but also having some factories that can -- we can lever if we need to is of comfort to us. And I would say you up in Canada, we are the only major water heater company that has a water heater tank plant up in Montreal. So that gives us, again, some optionality to look at different views of capacity and manufacturing. So if I step back, just from a manufacturing footprint, we are in pretty good shape. I think in some cases, better than most of our competitors because we are not all in, in 1 area, and we have that flexibility with a number of plants and having -- Steve talked about the ERP system, but also having standardized products, just allows us to move that around, if necessary. So we feel -- listen, we don't know what it's going to take, but we feel we are in the a really solid position for A.O. Smith, but also to be competitive long-term. Chuck Lauber : And then your question on corporate expense, up $10 million, that's $25 million versus $24 million? Jeff Hammond : Yes. Chuck Lauber : Okay. I mean there's some puts and takes on it, but roughly equally weighted -- the two largest pieces are interest income that is less in 2025 as that's lumped into that category as well as incentives that are at target versus lower than target versus lower than target in 2024. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning, everyone. Kevin Wheeler : Good morning. Helen Gurholt : Good morning. Andrew Kaplowitz : So you obviously have a very strong balance sheet. And Steve, I think you mentioned you're focused on where the AOS portfolio can go in the future. I know you just closed period, but would you expect AOS to get more aggressive in terms of portfolio management in the future, whether you ramp up an M&A or is something else? Like how do you think about that moving forward? Stephen Shafer : I think it's something that we've always been looking at. And I think we are a company that is exploring where we should go next in terms of our portfolio and yet at the same time, still being disciplined about that. So in terms of being aggressive or more aggressive or less aggressive, I'd just say it continues to be on our radar screen, and it's on my radar screen and certainly trying to bring my own sort of lens of how I think we can move that forward. But I think it's a lever available to us, but we're going to continue to be disciplined about how we pursue it. Andrew Kaplowitz : Very helpful. And then if I go about the last quarter, I think you said you saw a modest slowdown including activity in boilers, but your guidance for this year is still for 3% to 5% growth. So any color there on the boiler side still looks like you're pretty confident about another growth year for that side of the business? Kevin Wheeler : Yes. I would -- this is Kevin. I would say that 3% to 5% that we have out there -- the driver for us is always our coating activity. That seems to be really stable. Quite frankly, some of our product categories, the CREST boiler is doing exceptionally well. So -- that's a market that tends to grow 1% to 2% units. We're going 3% to 5%. And I think a lot of it has to do with our products and also that continuing transition from a non-efficient to a high-efficient product line and 90% of what our boiler business does is sell high-efficient products. So it's a nice space to be in, and we think we'll get more than our fair share. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Your line is open. David MacGregor : Good morning, everyone, and thanks for squeezing me in here. I guess just on China, the restructuring, can you just talk about the timing of the benefits of that restructuring? And when do you expect to see the first signs of success. And then maybe where within that Chinese sort of mix of businesses would we expect to see the greatest impact? Kevin Wheeler : So we've already -- we're already underway with the restructuring. So we're a bit more than halfway through it already. So we'll start seeing benefits right now. And then we've got more to go. So we'll finish off the rest of the restructuring over this quarter and the following quarter. And as I mentioned, by the end of Q2, we'll expect it to be pretty much fully implemented at that point. I would say a lot of it is just getting us more streamlined and better positioned to compete in China. So obviously, our business today is not the same size as it was a few years ago. We have to think differently about how we are organized. So from that standpoint, different than how we characterize water treatment, it may be less about major portfolio ships and more about just getting more competitive and getting more streamlined about what we need to focus on going forward to compete in the China market. David MacGregor : So if I'm hearing you correctly, are you saying the benefits are more kind of SG&A benefits than COGS benefits? Kevin Wheeler : Yes, there's a lot of structural cost. I think I would say we are getting more efficient now. Chuck Lauber : Yes. I mean that -- this is Chuck. But that's specific to the restructuring. We always have initiatives to reduce costs, productivity improvement, cost out. So that will continue next year also. Kevin Wheeler : And there is a focus on certain parts of the portfolio that has more work to do there than others, and that's also well aligned. And I think where we're focused going forward. David MacGregor : Got it. And the follow-up question is just on the balance sheet, I guess, inventories. What is kind of the target in terms of days of inventory? What would you like to get that down to? Chuck Lauber : Yes. We are a little higher than we'd like to be. I mean if you look at our inventories, they're up about $35 million year-over-year. There's a couple of reasons. One is we did invest a bit in tankless inventory as we are rolling out those initiatives have a longer lead time. We are also looking at overall, just a little higher inventory as the volume was a little lighter than what we expected during the last quarter of the year, which we'll take that out. So our initiative on an overall days, when you kind of look at overall days on hand when you take receivables, inventory and payables is to be below that 40-day level and we are targeting to be below that 40-day level as we come into the end of 2025. Operator : Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Helen Gurholt for closing remarks. Helen Gurholt : Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Let me conclude by reminding you that our global AOS team continue to invest in ourselves even while navigating many challenges in 2024. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the quarters to come. In addition, please mark your calendars to join our presentations at two conferences this quarter. Citi on February 18 and North Coast on March 6. Thank you, and enjoy the rest of your day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",
