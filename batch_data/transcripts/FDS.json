[Operator Instructions] Now I'll turn the meeting over to the Senior Vice President, Strategic Resources and General Counsel, Ms. Rachel Stern. Ma'am, you may now begin. Rachel Rebecca Stern : Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thanks to all of you for participating today. Welcome to FactSet's First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Phil Hadley, Chairman and CEO; Peter Walsh, Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Frankenfield, Director of Global Sales. This conference call is being transcribed in real time by FactSet's CallStreet service and is being broadcast live via the Internet at factset.com. A replay of this call will also be available on our website. Our call will contain forward-looking statements reflecting management's expectations based on currently available information. Actual results may differ materially. More information about factors that could affect FactSet's business and financial results can be found in FactSet's filings with the SEC. Annual subscription value or ASV is a key metric for FactSet. Please recall that ASV is a snapshot view of client subscription and represents our forward-looking revenues for the next 12 months. Lastly, FactSet undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. I'd like to turn the discussion over now to Peter Walsh, Chief Operating Officer. Peter G. Walsh: Thank you, Rachel, and good morning, everyone. Here's how I plan to spend our time today : first, I'll highlight 3 notable items; second, we'll review first quarter results; third, I'll provide guidance for the upcoming second quarter of fiscal 2014; fourth, we'll end with your questions. Regarding the notable items : one, as covered in our Q4 earnings call in September, the acquisition of Revere diluted earnings by $0.01 per share in Q1 and reduced our operating margin by 30 basis points; two, the U.S. federal R&D tax credit is set to expire on December 31, 2013. Accordingly, EPS includes a $0.03 reduction for both Q1 and future quarters. Only once in the 32-year history of the R&D tax credit has it lapsed permanently, which was between July '95 and June '96. Accounting rules mandate that tax credits can't be factored into our effective tax rate unless it's part of currently enacted law. Our tax rate would have been 29% rather than 30.5% had the credit been reenacted before the end of our Q1. Please refer to Page 10 of our earnings press release for a discussion on the history of the R&D tax credit. Three, I'm also pleased to announce that we recently made an investment in a U.K. company called Matrix Data. We purchased 60% of the company for GBP 12 million and have the right to buy the remainder, which we expect to do in February 2014 so 100% of Matrix could be owned by FactSet within our second fiscal quarter. Matrix provides intelligence to the U.K. financial services market for mutual fund distribution. Matrix will serve as a European complement to our Market Metrics business, which focuses primarily on the U.S. market. Matrix has 85 employees in England and has annual subscriptions of $7 million. In Q2, we expect that Matrix will increase revenues by $2 million, reduce operating margins by 50 basis points and dilute earnings by $0.01 per share. For the full year fiscal 2014, we do not expect Matrix to have an impact on our diluted EPS. Now let's dive into our first quarter results. Overall, we had a solid beginning to our fiscal 2014 year, but performance was mixed. All of our key metrics for our core buy-side clients were up nicely, but users declined within the sell-side space. Organic ASV grew 5% over the prior year to a total of $890 million. Our U.S. operations saw ASV rise to $609 million while international operations grew ASV to $281 million or 32% of total ASV. Of total ASV, our buy-side clients accounted for 82.2% of the total, with the remaining 17.8% generated by our sell-side clients, M&A advisory and equity research businesses. Just to remind you, we include off-platform data sales and Market Metrics in the buy-side category, and the sell-side sales consist only the banking functions I just mentioned. Our adjusted diluted EPS grew this quarter to $1.22, a 10% increase compared to last year's first quarter. This quarter marks our 14th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, and we're proud of that result. Our free cash flow for Q1 was $53 million, up 18% over the same period last year. Free cash flow over the last 12-month period was $259 million, up 26%. When compared to net income, free cash flow was 29% higher over the last year, which we believe continues to demonstrate the high quality of our earnings. Free cash flow increased this quarter due to growth in net income, improved accounts receivable collections and the timing of compensation payments. Our DSO at November 30 was 31 days compared to 34 days in the same period a year ago. FactSet's cash and investment balance was $188 million at November 30, down $22 million from August 31. During the quarter, we bought back 530,000 shares for $58 million and paid $15 million to acquire Revere. Yesterday, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $300 million for future share repurchases, bringing our total repurchase program authorization to $305 million. Over the last 12 months, we have returned $421 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now let's move to the P&L. FactSet's Q1 revenues rose to $223 million, up 5.6% compared to the prior year. Excluding the Revere acquisition and foreign currency, organic revenue growth was 5.5%. Additional revenue from the Revere acquisition was almost completely offset by a revenue reduction from a weaker yen over the last 12 months. For the first quarter, operating income grew to $75 million, up 5% over the same period last year. Our adjusted net income rose 7% to $53 million during the quarter, and our adjusted EPS grew 10% this quarter to $1.22. Please note, adjusted net income and diluted EPS both add back income tax benefits as the federal R&D tax credit is set to expire on December 31 and was not extended as of the end of our Q1. First quarter revenues in the U.S. increased to $153 million, up 6% over the same period last year. Non-U.S. revenues grew 4% to $70 million compared to last year. Excluding foreign currency effects, our international segment grew at 6% this quarter. Revenues from Europe and the Asia Pacific regions for the first quarter were $54 million and $16 million, respectively. Excluding foreign currency effects, year-over-year growth rates were 4% Europe and 11% in Asia Pacific. This quarter, a number of different elements continued -- contributed to our continuing growth. Let's take a look. Client growth was solid this quarter as we added 25 net new clients compared to 9 in Q1 last year. Our total client count is now 2,525. Firms are included in our reported client count only when they spend more than $24,000 annually with us. Consistent with prior quarters, our annual client retention rate was greater than 95% of ASV and 92% in terms of the number of actual clients. Our user count rose by 89 users over the past quarter compared to 105 in Q1 last year. The increase brought our total to just over 51,000 users at November 30. We saw an expansion of new users from the buy side, especially from our wealth business, which was largely offset by a reduction of users at sell-side clients. We are pleased by the growth we see from our efforts in the wealth management sector and continue to push forward in that area. Wealth users have increased every quarter over the past 5 years. Sales in that sector require persistence and the ability to manage switching costs since the number of users and locations can be significant. Consistently expanding our footprint tells us our product is improving its competitive position. On the banking side, there's seasonality, with Q4 normally a strong quarter for new hires out of college and Q1 being weak as analyst programs come to an end. That played out again in Q1 this quarter. But this quarter also saw 2 large banks reduce the number of users when their long-term contracts were renewed. These firms experienced workforce reductions over the past 3 years and the new level of deployment matches their current level of headcount. On the positive side, calendar year 2013 is tracking to be the best year for IPOs since 2007, and Q4 will be the best quarter this year by a wide margin. Follow-on debt offerings were also very brisk. While we do not believe bulge bracket banks will break stride in their approach to cost containment, 2013 will be the first increase in deal flow for our IB clients in the last couple of years. ASV for Market Metrics decreased $2 million in Q1. The decline was primarily driven by clients exiting the light and variable annuity businesses due to low interest rates. We continue to be successful with our Portfolio Analytics suite of products. The PA suite includes separate add-on applications for equity and fixed income analytics, risk quant, returns-based analysis and Portfolio Publishing. Like previous quarters, we experienced increased subscriptions broadly across this product suite. Our global content sales team focuses on expanding distribution of FactSet clients -- content. Sales of content through subscriptions to single-purpose applications or through bulk data feeds continue to see demand among our users. The technology skill set of our largest clients is advancing, and servicing their needs with bulk data outside the FactSet Workstation has proven to be another valuable means to monetize our investment in content. Now let's take a look at the expense side. For the first quarter, operating expenses were $148 million, and our operating margin this quarter was 33.5%. Our operating margin was up 10 basis points compared to Q4 and 20 basis points lower than the same period last year. As I mentioned last quarter and as expected, the Revere acquisition lowered our operating margin by 30 basis points. This quarter, our cost of services as a percentage of revenues increased 240 basis points compared to the same quarter last year. Higher compensation from employee growth within our engineering, content and consulting groups was the cause of the increase and was partially offset by lower third-party data costs, a reduction in computer depreciation and a decrease in intangible asset amortization expense. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased by 240 basis points in Q1 compared to the year-ago period. We did not enter into any material new leases this quarter, so our occupancy costs were lower and we experienced lower employee compensation from a reduction in variable compensation. At the end of the first quarter, we had 6,399 employees, an increase of 141 employees this quarter. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 30.5%, up from 30.4% in the same quarter last year. As I mentioned previously, the increase was because the R&D tax credit was not reenacted as of November 30. Had the credit been reenacted, our tax rate would have been 29%. Now let's turn to our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2014. Please note that our guidance figures include consolidation of Matrix at 100%. We expect that our revenues will range between $225 million and $228 million. Our operating margin is expected to range between 32.6% and 33.6%. This range includes a 30-basis-point reduction from the Revere acquisition and a 50-basis-point reduction due to the Matrix acquisition. We expect that GAAP diluted EPS will range between $1.20 and $1.23. This GAAP diluted EPS estimate presumes that the federal R&D tax credit will last during Q2, so we have lowered each end of the range by $0.03 per share. The annual effective tax rate should range between 30% and 31%. This range also assumes that the R&D tax credit will not be reenacted. To sum it up, Q1 adds to our continuing string of successful quarters. Our EPS grew by double digits while we continued to invest for the future. Over the years, regardless of the market cycle, FactSet's relative performance has been strong. At FactSet, we believe we're well situated to serve our broad range of our client needs, given our core competency with equity analysis and research and our expertise with fixed income that we've been developing now for nearly 10 years. At the same time, our capital allocation continues to be aggressive, and we're excited about our recent M&A investments. We have a great deal of work to accomplish this year, and we're focused on our goals. Even as the market changes and funds flow from fixed to equity assets, we'll be ready for the needs of our clients. Thank you. We're now ready for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will be coming from Shlomo Rosen (sic) [Rosenbaum] of Stifel. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : The implication is that the mean hit on the ASV was sell side, not buy side. But if I kind of normalize for Revere, it looks like there was only a $2 million increase in ASV on the buy side. Is that the right way to look at that on a sequential basis? Philip A. Hadley: Shlomo, it's Phil. Your calculation will be correct. I think the only color I would put in that is the color that Peter added with Market Metrics, which would be certainly buy side but not a traditional buy side as you might think it as far as workstations and normal services. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Can you give us kind of a little bit more color as to what the impact of Market Metrics was? I mean, is that a $5 million ASV impact to $10 million? Like, how should we be thinking about that? And is that something you expect to continue? Philip A. Hadley: The answer is don't expect it to continue. It was because of the exit of the -- the primary reason was because of exiting particular businesses for our clients, so those services were not renewed. Last year, we benefited from them still selling LMS strong, and this year, we got hurt because they were -- we had clients exiting the business. I guess I'll give you the numbers, it's onetime, it's not something we plan to renew, but just because it's material for this particular quarter. So Market Metrics was down $2 million this quarter and prior period was up $3 million. So it's a swing of $5 million relative to Q1 last year. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : And then -- so it seems like -- just to continue on the line of the ASV. There were reductions of workstations as some clients came to end of contract and kind of aligned the contract with their headcount. Were there any significant losses or just -- clients just moved off the platform that impacted that? Or is that really what the major impact was on the sell side? Philip A. Hadley: Those were longtime clients, longtime big clients, who had long-term contracts with us, where the service level they had subscribed to was no longer the size of their investment banking team. And it comes time for those contracts to get renewed, and we have to rightsize subscriptions to match their current headcount. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : So there wasn't -- it wasn't like there was a major loss to that or anything on that, okay. And just what was going on with variable compensation? Is that just less of an expectation that certain targets will be hit so you're not accruing the same amount? Peter G. Walsh: Yes. I think that's just -- Shlomo, it's Peter. In terms of variable compensation, I think we just adjust the amount that we accrue for bonuses related to our ASV growth rate. So comparing where we are this year relative to a year ago period, it just reduced SG&A as a percentage of revenue. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Okay. And I'm just going to leave off with this last thing, can you just describe the hiring environment in the different areas with -- in your client base? Michael D. Frankenfield: Shlomo, it's Mike. I think in the banking segment, we've characterized -- you sort of look at that as 2 pieces, the big bulge bracket firms and the middle market. I think middle market remains fairly steady. Bulge bracket certainly varies a lot by firm. They're choppy. I think we're going to continue to see a lot of choppiness in that segment. And the most steady part of the business for me is the investment management segment, where index levels are up. And you saw, based on the client count, that they're good -- not great but decent levels of firm creation and steady improvement. Operator : The next question will be coming from Mr. Peter Heckmann of Avondale Partners. Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division : Can you talk about your intentions for price increases? Have you communicated that to buy-side customers for fiscal '14? Michael D. Frankenfield: Peter, it's Mike. So what's happening with the price increases, as you know, we've historically done a price increase in the second quarter targeted at our U.S. Investment Management clients. What's happened over the last several years and it's possibly accelerated in the past year is we have shifted our price increases out of that quarter to more directly align them with individual client contract renewal days. So the amount of ASV that we'll see in the second quarter directly from price will be smaller in that quarter, and the amount will be spread out more over the course of the year. Our general philosophy is to raise price in line with CPI. Select products may see slightly higher increases; other products, lower increases. And we'll provide additional guidance next quarter. Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division : Okay, okay. And then can you talk about -- within the wealth management sector, can you talk about have you figured out or do you feel like you've figured out the right price point for that solution, for that customer base? And can you talk about how it compares to the institutional business? Michael D. Frankenfield: Sure. Both are exciting segments for us, as Peter highlighted in his opening comments. There are 3 reasons why wealth is working really well for us. First of all, we've done a great job on the product development. The actual UI that the clients use really helps them get answers faster and helps them work within the context of their clients' portfolios to be more effective in front of their clients. We've done a great job with the pricing packaging on that, offering a tiered offering that enables clients to select the level of functionality at the price point that works best for them. Where we really start to differentiate ourselves is in our service model. We've built a service model that virtually eliminates conversion risk, so there's always a big concern for clients when they're moving from one supplier to another. In the conversions that we've done, we've been able to execute those flawlessly. We then are able to offer very compelling add-on support once the client is a client to continue to service those user's need. And finally, what I get really excited about on the wealth side is the growing sophistication and complexity of that segment. Two of our largest Portfolio Analytics suite wins this past quarter were 2 wealth clients. And that tells me that those clients are going to have more complex needs in the future, and FactSet is perfectly positioned to continue to grow in that segment due to the well-established offering we have at the institutional level. Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division : Great, that's helpful. And then just 1 follow-up on the acquisition of Matrix. Where will we see the minority interest come through? And based on your comments of modest dilution, I would assume that the minority interest will be a slight benefit on that basis. Philip A. Hadley: I mean the minority interest will just come through on the minority interest line, at the bottom. We don't expect it to be there for long. As we've alluded, we expect to complete the acquisition to 100%, where it will probably be a 1 quarter event. As a business, we're excited that it complements the Market Metrics business and really gives us -- our LMS opportunity in Europe a big boost and gives a global perspective on being able to attack that marketplace. Operator : The next question will be coming from Mr. Tim McHugh of William Blair. Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : I just wanted to ask a little more on the gross margin. I know you described some of the investments in content and the staff for that. I guess can you just talk more qualitatively about how that, I guess, pressures gross margin? Is it just that it takes time before you can leverage those investments and we're more of an investment stage still in that? Or is it -- is this a lower gross margin business long term and that's just a mix shift that we're going to see continue to kind of play out over the next couple of years? Peter G. Walsh: Tim, it's Peter. Thanks for your question. I think our philosophy is really to invest aggressively in the future, and it's really best captured by our measured approach to manage operating margins to be flat, not the fluctuation between gross margins or SG&A. That investment is in headcount, and it's been up 6% on a year-over-year basis, which is consistent with our ASV growth. Simply stated, the more we grow ASV, the more we invest for the future. And since ASV is a great predictor of revenue, trailing 12-month revenue, 6 months into the future, it really allows us ample time to tune up or down our hiring plans to align it with our revenue growth rate. So we continue to manage at the operating income line and feel aggressive about -- or feel good about our headcount investments there. Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Okay. And is the content primarily equities related? Or is there significant investment in building out fixed income type of content as you try and push more in that sector at this point? Peter G. Walsh: We invest both in -- content that's both directed towards investors of equity and fixed income. Specific to fixed income, we have a very robust content set related to debt capital structure and our own terms and condition collection. Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Okay. And I guess a little more -- stepping back a little more on the buy side. I know you explained the Market Metrics impact that it had on the growth of that business, and it's trended up a little bit. But I guess in the context of kind of looking at fund flows and I guess the overall stock market, I guess, how do you look at the growth rate of that? Are -- would you have expected it to have been up more? Or is this consistent with -- is the environment, I guess, consistent with what you would have expected maybe as you look at some of those broader trends out there right now? And if not, why not, I guess? Philip A. Hadley: It's Phil. I think if you go back and look at the questions from last quarter, one of the things I've highlighted, and I've highlighted this for several years now, is our first and third quarters are kind of choppy quarters. And there are several reasons for their choppiness. Getting clients to make decisions between September and November isn't the ideal time of the year for people to be making purchase decisions of products, though it does happen. Second, since we're an August year-end, we've got a sales team, obviously, who pushes hard for the year-end and therefore, things go into fourth quarter that essentially aren't in the first quarter. Hard to measure that, but I think it certainly is a factor out there. And then the third reason is it's not the hiring time for our clients either, which certainly is our fourth quarter. So as I look back in history, it's always been a less predictable quarter and will continue to be. So to answer your question more specifically and part of the reason we gave the data on Market Metrics is if you look at the part of the business that is accelerating, not in a rah-rah, good-old-days type perspective is the core IM, both U.S. and non-U.S. And that's really the traditional business of speed to product against what we think of is Bloomberg, TR and S&P in the marketplace. It's -- first quarter being not a material quarter from an ASV perspective, it's hard to make that a trend, but it's definitely one where it's not decelerating. Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Okay. And I guess just relative to those comments, you mentioned that core IM business is getting better, but it's not rah-rah like kind of the good old days. What -- can you pinpoint what feels different as you hear back from the clients in that core business relative to the past and why you can't be at those growth rates? Philip A. Hadley: I think -- I guess I have several theories, whether they're valid or not only time will tell. I think that the clients have ventured several cycles now where cost becomes very important, and they have to downsize their business and really tighten their belt. And they've continued to keep that cost discipline longer through this cycle than they had historically. And I guess, the second part of it would be, I think, if you look at their hiring plans, coupled with that, it doesn't -- they haven't hired into this cycle the way they have in historical cycles. Whether that's a lag effect and they'll hire later in the cycle is one that's hard for me to project. But definitely, it feels like that's the case. Operator : The next question will be coming from Mr. Peter Appert of Piper Jaffray. Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : So Phil, just continuing on the last question in effect. So I guess the expectation would have been with AUM growth positive, positive inflows, you would have seen sequential acceleration as the year progressed. I understand your thesis with regard to the current year. But just thinking about the tone of business going into 2014, should -- or are you anticipating that we will see some further acceleration on the growth into next year? Philip A. Hadley: I think we'll always take the stance of giving you 1 quarter's guidance because it's really as far forward as we can project and feel. I think you have to look at our guidance and what we're currently doing and put your own spin on where you think the marketplace is going, combined with the comments that you get out of us. Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : Well, I mean, the guidance, obviously, suggests static growth on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Philip A. Hadley: The guidance is it's a choppy market. It's hard for us to figure out what's going on. And obviously, we've got huge choppiness that happens on the sell side. If you took last quarter's sell side plus this quarter, it's positive. But this quarter was certainly significantly negative. So it's really hard for us to tell exactly what's going on with these terms. Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : What should we read into that then in terms of competitive dynamic? Or maybe more specifically, what can you report back to us in terms of how you're seeing the competitive environment evolve? Michael D. Frankenfield: Peter, it's Mike. Like I said in previous quarters, we have a number of internal metrics we track that compares our results to what we perceive our competitive results are, our own tabulations of win-loss records, and I'm very pleased with the progress we're making. There's no question there's consolidation in the industry. The days of a single analyst or portfolio manager having multiple data platforms on their desk are behind us, and the number of platforms has been reduced. Typically, users have much less on their desktop. There have been a number of publicized competitor product announcements. None of those announcements, none of those products are materially changing the competitive dynamic. There are things we monitor closely. We expect our clients and prospects are evaluating those things, yet we had robust client additions this quarter. And like I said, the metrics are still very positive. So it's going to continue to evolve. We assume they're going to get better. Our objective is to improve faster than our competitors do, and I think our product team is executing well on those objectives. Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : Okay. And then, last thing, can you give us any color, Phil or Peter, in terms of how we should think about the pace of buyback activity? Philip A. Hadley: Thanks, Peter. We constantly revisit our capital allocation decisions between acquisitions, dividends and buybacks. I think we noted on the call that we have returned $421 million to shareholders over the last year. Specifically, the buybacks, our quarterly amounts have ranged from $15 million to $144 million and averaged $61 million over the last 12 quarters. So with interest rates near 0, we're very comfortable that the earnings accretion of buybacks is attractive. So unless we become more acquisitive, I think we'll continue to allocate capital in the form of dividends and repurchases in order to avoid a drag on return on capital. We certainly have enough dry powder in terms of cash on the balance sheet at roughly $190 million, and our free cash flow generation is close to $260 million last 12 months. Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : Great. And in the context of that, Peter, would you ever consider possibly taking on leverage to fund buybacks? Peter G. Walsh: We have gone through that process. We have considered it. But I think we like the opportunity to stage our buybacks and have them fluctuate from period-to-period based on our view of valuation to maximize EPS accretion. Operator : The next question will be coming from Hamzah Mazari of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : A question on just sales force strategy. Has there been any change in the way your sales force is approaching defending the installed base, particularly on the sell side, where you have some larger competitors trying to aggressively grow their installed base? Michael D. Frankenfield: Hamzah, it's Mike. I don't think we've made any real significant changes. Our sales force is a combination -- when I describe our sales force, I describe it in terms of the peer relationship managers, the consultants who provide all of the technical and telephone and on-site support work, as well as the team of sales specialists who are really subject matter experts. And our entire organization is very, very focused on servicing and retaining existing clients. One stat that maybe very pleased to see this quarter is there's been a fairly material uptick in the number of client visits and client touches that are happening as we measure them internally. And I think continuing to stay close to our clients to understand their needs and to overservice them has always been part of our strategy, and it's part of what we're going to continue to do. Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Great. And then just a follow-up, on the wealth management business, could you give us a sense of the geographical footprint of that business? Is it pretty similar to your company footprint? Or how do we think about that business geographically? Michael D. Frankenfield: It is pretty similar. The majority of the business is in the U.S., U.K. and Europe. Not a lot of development at this point in Asia Pac, but we anticipate that will be coming. Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Great. And just lastly, on the operating margin guidance, is the delta -- is the 100-basis-point delta just a factor of what you're going to reinvest in the business through the P&L? Peter G. Walsh: It's Peter. Most of the operating margin delta is really related to acquisitions. So the operating margin has an 80-basis-point reduction due to the 2 acquisitions we covered on the call today. Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Right. I'm just referring to the guidance actually, the 32.6% versus the 33.6%, just the delta between the low end and the high end of guidance on margin. Peter G. Walsh: That's consistent with ranges that we've put out in the past. So that's -- it's always been roughly 100-basis-point range, which is consistent this quarter to what we've done in previous quarters. Operator : The next question will be coming from Mr. Joe Foresi of Janney Montgomery Scott. Jeffrey Rossetti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : This is Jeff Rossetti for Joe. Peter, I believe you mentioned in your remarks that there were 2 large banks that did not renew their contracts. Just wanted to see if there was any large renewals upcoming in the next quarter or 2. Peter G. Walsh: I'll -- let me, first, just rephrase the facts and then I'll have Mike -- we -- the clients did renew their contracts. They just renewed at lower user amounts because their businesses scaled back over the past 3 years. And I'll have Mike give you color looking ahead. Michael D. Frankenfield: We have clients renewing contracts every quarter, as you would imagine. Some of the contracts are shorter duration, a year, some are longer, 2, 3 years. So there's -- they are happening every quarter, and we don't anticipate any significant changes in the future quarters compared to what you've seen in the past. Jeffrey Rossetti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then just on the relationship of headcount growth versus ASV growth, I believe you mentioned they were kind of expected to be similar. Is that correct? I just noticed that hiring has -- growth has kind of exceeded ASV growth, so -- maybe in last fiscal year. I just wanted to see what the relationship -- what you expect the relationship to be going forward. Peter G. Walsh: Yes. I think you are correct. In the last few years, our hiring growth has exceeded our ASV growth. And the primary reason for that was we are building out our content operations. That's certainly reached critical mass and scale. And looking ahead, as far as we can see, our headcount growth and ASV growth rate -- and ASV growth will track pretty consistently. Operator : The next question will be coming from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : This quarter, Thompson shut down Bridge on, I believe, September 30. And for that product specifically, I guess their conversion rates to Eikon were lower. I was wondering if that had any impact. Did that benefit you during this quarter? Michael D. Frankenfield: This is Mike. We've certainly been focused on identifying clients and prospects that use competitor products, Bridge certainly being one of them, and spending sales efforts to introduce them to our offering. And there's no question, over prior quarters, that we've -- we saw a benefit from that. We continue to see some benefit from that this quarter. A lot of times what happens, though, by making that -- the decision that they made that actually takes capacity out of the market, you have users that I described to my answer to Peter. The days where users had multiple platforms on their desks are behind us, and it's common for firms to reduce the number of platforms that each user has. And I think that happened a fair amount with the Bridge shutdown, that users had that platform, it went away, that workflow went to other products that were on their desk, and in essence, no new product replaced the terminal loss there. Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. And just also on the competitive environment, when you look at fixed income, are you getting competitive wins there? And if so, who are you getting them from? Michael D. Frankenfield: Most of our fixed income wins are greenfield opportunities. We really have a unique opportunity in the marketplace. We're delivering fixed income within the context of our Portfolio Analytics suite, and that is a really new offering in the marketplace. It stems from all of our clients that are accustomed to viewing their equity portfolios through the tools we have and now want to perform the same analysis for the fixed income portion of their portfolio, as well as brand-new fixed income managers. So we're less focused on head-to-head competitors in the fixed income space and more focused on leveraging our existing client base, as well as new fixed income prospects. Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. And just one last clarification. On the Matrix acquisition for next quarter, I saw that the annual subscriptions of $7 million. So whether you have acquired the whole thing or you're just -- have the 60%, ASV will basically be increased by $7 million next quarter regardless. Is that correct? Philip A. Hadley: Yes, correct. Michael D. Frankenfield: That's correct. Operator : The next question will be coming from Mr. Alex Kramm of UBS. Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Just wanted to come back to the sell-side comments you made. Sorry, I know there's been a bunch of questions. But I know you've talked about these, basically, renewals at smaller sizes because, I guess, of what's going on in the sell side. But from our conversations, I think I'm aware of at least 4 sell-side firms that in research, in particular, which, obviously, very close to people on this call, have made the decision to either -- or have switched, made the decision to switch or in the process of switching, so -- and basically, to a competitor, basically, based just on price. So maybe you can just flush it out a little bit with your previous comments. I mean, how are these discussions going? Are you basically walking away and saying, \"Hey, I'm not going to compete on this because it's not profitable for us anymore?\" Or -- and actually, more importantly, is -- most of these things that I'm talking about, are they already reflected in ASV? Or are there a couple of more that will be showing up here over the next 3 or 6 months? Philip A. Hadley: Alex, it's Phil. So what we referred to on the call -- let's see. I'm not giving names. One announced, 2 years ago, that they were getting -- they were shutting down their investment banking division. They basically have done that and are down to 100 users or what they call investment bankers at this point. The other one was somebody who really -- I guess just the easiest to say would be overbought in '09 and had a contract they've carried out, and there comes a time for us to renegotiate that contract and we did. And it's still very much an investment banking business, just not as big as they were, but certainly a bulge firm. More specifically to competitive environments in research, on the sell side, certainly, it's a competitive environment. The competitor you're referring to is Thompson. They used their barter research bundling that they do, which is very anticompetitive, but that's their choice or at least, that's what they currently do. I don't think it's very fair in the marketplace, but it certainly makes a -- puts competitive pressure on them in that particular space. And it's one where we fight tooth and nail, and at some point, it's not a good business for us so we don't do it. But that's life in the marketplace. Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : So from that perspective, I mean, it sounds like there are probably going to be a couple more that are going to show up in the numbers. Is that correct? Or are we -- do you see everything already reflected right now? Philip A. Hadley: So based on our projections and based on what we do, that's when we say that sell side is choppy. There's -- we win some and we lose some. And to pretend you win 100% is never going to happen. Operator : The next question will be coming from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Keith M. Housum - Northcoast Research : Coming back to your -- the use of cash and the share repurchases, can you guys provide a little bit color on where your cash is? And is that perhaps going to be impediment to perhaps using your share repurchases as quickly as you'd like to? Peter G. Walsh: The bulk of our cash is in the U.S., and we haven't -- we don't anticipate that whatever cash is invested outside the U.S. to be an impediment to executing on the share repurchase. Keith M. Housum - Northcoast Research : Got it, okay. Appreciate that. The Matrix acquisition, assuming you guys make the entire 40-some percent purchase before the end of next quarter, how much of the -- revenue is $7 million in ASV. Is there also a non-subscription value component to that revenue as well that you can speak of? Peter G. Walsh: No. Keith M. Housum - Northcoast Research : Got it. And then you guys talked about the wealth management being up for the past 5 years and quarters. How about your fixed income initiative? How would you guys describe that growth over the past, say, 2 or 3 quarters? Michael D. Frankenfield: We continue to make sequential progress in fixed income. That's an exciting story for us internally. It's solving some of the most complicated problems that clients have, and we love complicated problems because we're good at solving them and it creates significant barriers to entry. Keith M. Housum - Northcoast Research : Okay. And a final question for you, outside of the 2 sell-side customers you guys referred to, who's responsible for the large portion that dropped. Was the business down outside of those 2 guys as well? Or are those 2 guys primarily responsible for the entire drop? Michael D. Frankenfield: I think there's choppiness to the entire segment. And I mean I think it's important also to remember that while there are a number of, maybe you'd call them headline-grabbing negotiations or client conversions, FactSet has over 2,500 clients. We've got a very, very broad diverse client base across different business segments, different geographies. We've got a very diverse product line. And I think while these clients are, as I've said, headline-grabbing, I think you really need to look at the big picture and put them in the right context. Operator : The last question will be coming from Mr. Andrew Hummel of Oppenheimer. Andrew Hummel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : Andy Hummel on for Glenn Greene. So looking at the international market, are you guys seeing anything from a demand perspective or hiring perspective that's anything different than kind of what you're seeing in the domestic market and as far as buy side maybe being slightly more positive and sell side being a little bit more choppy? Philip A. Hadley: Probably, we see a lot of what you expect if you are just thinking about the global economy. Asia Pacific is certainly a healthy region for us. Southern Europe is not as strong as the rest of Europe. That's probably the way I'd characterize it. Andrew Hummel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then as far as Matrix goes as being an acquisition in the international scape, does that kind of imply you guys are taking a little bit more concerted effort towards expanding international through this type of venture? Is it just kind of a one-off opportunity you guys saw? Philip A. Hadley: I think if you look at our acquisitions, over time, we've made several acquisitions that were non-U.S. or European-centric acquisitions. And we have a very global business and global clients, so we're constantly looking to provide global solutions for them. Our global managers that use the Market Metrics product in the U.S. have been pushing this very much so to get into the same business in Europe. And we had an organic strategy, but this certainly accelerates that dramatically. Thank you, everyone. Have a great quarter. Operator : That concludes today's conference call.

(Operator Instructions) Now, I will turn the meeting over to your host, Ms. Rachel Stern, Senior Vice President, Strategic Resources and General Counsel. Ma\u2019am, your line is open. You may now begin. Rachel Stern : Thank you, operator. Good morning and thanks to all of you for participating today. Welcome to FactSet\u2019s second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Phil Hadley, Chairman and CEO; Peter Walsh, Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Frankenfield, Director of Global Sales. This conference call is being transcribed in real-time by FactSet\u2019s CallStreet service and is being broadcast live via the Internet at factset.com. A replay of this call will also be available on our website. Our call will contain forward-looking statements reflecting management\u2019s expectations based on currently available information. Actual results may differ materially. More information about factors that could affect FactSet\u2019s business and financial results can be found in FactSet\u2019s filings with the SEC. Annual subscription value or ASV is a key metric for FactSet. Please recall that ASV is a snapshot view of client subscription and represents our forward-looking revenues for the next 12 months. Lastly, FactSet undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. I\u2019d like to turn the discussion over now to Peter Walsh, Chief Operating Officer. At the end of his remarks, we will have time for questions. Please limit your questions to one each and one follow-up so that we have time to address as many as possible. Peter Walsh : Thank you, Rachel and good morning everyone. Here is how I plan to spend our time today. First, I will review two housekeeping items. Second, we will review Q2 results. Third, I will provide guidance for Q3. Finally, we will end with your questions. So, let\u2019s begin with some housekeeping. You will remember that in December, we acquired a 60% ownership interest in Matrix Data Limited for $20 million. On February 17, we acquired the remaining 40% for a total purchase price of $32 million. As we have mentioned before, Matrix provides intelligence to the UK financial services market for mutual fund distribution and complements our Market Metrics business. In Q2, Matrix added $2 million to revenues, while reducing our operating margin by 40 basis points and earnings per share by $0.01. We do not expect Matrix to have an impact on our diluted earnings per share for the full fiscal year in 2014. We have also kept you updated on the U.S. Federal R&D tax credit and its impact on FactSet. The credit expired on December 31, 2013, and therefore our Q2 EPS and Q3 guidance includes a $0.03 reduction compared to the prior year. The R&D tax credit has only lapsed once in its 32-year history. Our tax rate would have been 29% rather than the actual rate of 30.5% had the credit been reenacted before the end of Q2. Now, on to second quarter results. FactSet had a solid and encouraging second quarter. ASV, revenues, client count, user count, and EPS, all grew to record highs. We are pleased that this quarter ASV totaled $920 million, up 6% organically over the prior year. We grew ASV by $29.8 million this quarter, of which $7.3 million came from the acquisition of Matrix. Our ASV from U.S. operations totaled $626 million, while international operations accounted for $294 million or 32% of the whole. Buy side clients, which include off platform data sales in the Market Metrics business accounted for 82.7% of ASV while the remaining 17.3% of ASV was generated by our sell side clients, which include M&A advisory, capital markets, and equity research businesses. Adjusted EPS rose to $1.22, a 10% increase compared to the same period last year. Prior year adjusted EPS excludes tax benefits from the R&D tax credit and a charge related to stock-based compensation. We are proud to point out that this quarter marks our 15th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, which is nearly four years of growth at that level. Free cash flow, which is defined as cash generated from operations less capital spending was $38 million for the quarter, down 12% compared to the same period last year. Over the last 12 months, free cash flow was $254 million, up 21%. Free cash flow was lower this quarter due to an increase in accounts receivable. In each of the last five years, DSOs have peaked in Q2. This year in Q2, DSOs were 39 days, compared to 36 days a year ago. The increase in accounts receivable was driven by the timing of client payments. Client collections through yesterday, the first 11 business days of March, was $13 million higher than the comparable periods in January and February 2014. We believe the increase in accounts receivable is temporary and like previous years will return to normal levels during Q3. Our cash and investment balance was $103 million at February 28, down $85 million in the past three months. Share repurchases this quarter increased to 800,000 shares for a total of $86 million. As of February 28, we still had $219 million remaining in our share repurchase program. During the prior 12 months, we have returned $398 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. At the end of the quarter, we had 42.4 million shares outstanding. Now, let\u2019s review our P&L. In the second quarter, FactSet\u2019s revenues increased to $227 million, up 7% compared to last year. Organic revenues grew 5.1% over last year, excluding $3 million in revenues from recent acquisitions. Operating income for Q2 grew to $75.1 million. This quarter adjusted net income grew 6% to $52 million and adjusted diluted EPS grew 10% to $1.22. Please note that the prior year adjusted net income and EPS both exclude income tax benefits from the Federal R&D tax credit and a charge related to stock-based compensation. Our U.S. second quarter revenues rose to $154 million, which equates to 6% growth compared to the same period last year. Non-U.S. revenues rose to $73 million. Excluding incremental revenue from the acquisition of Matrix and the impact of foreign currency, the international growth rate was 6%. More specifically, revenues in the second quarter from Europe and the Asia-Pacific regions were $56 million and $17 million respectively. Excluding foreign currency effects and acquisitions, year-over-year growth rates were 5% in Europe and 12% in Asia-Pacific. Our second fiscal quarter was the strong one from a number vantage points. One, client growth was strong this quarter as we have added 64 net new clients organically compared to 35 last year. Overall, we added 96 clients with 32 acquired from Matrix. Organic net client growth this quarter was the highest total since 2006. Our total client count is now 2,632. We continue to include in our reported client count only those clients that we bill at least $24,000 annually. Consistent with prior quarters, our annual client retention rate was greater than 95% of ASV and 92% in the terms of actual clients. Our net user count of the FactSet terminal rose by 849 users over the past quarter compared to a decrease of 150 in the year-ago quarter. Total user count was 51,900 users at quarter end. While users declined slightly at sell-side clients, user growth on the buy side experienced the highest quarterly change since 2004. Wealth management continues to be a growing area for us with positive returns. We have found that our workstations can be well tailored to the needs of our wealth management clients who operate in both large teams and in small groups depending on the client. Their use of our workstations often closely parallel to those of our traditional institutional asset management clients as their practices have become ever more sophisticated. Those clients are also increasingly making use of our Portfolio Analytics suite of products. Four, our portfolio analytics suite of products continues to be a strong seller for us. In particular, our clients and prospects have appreciated the value of this set of applications that is capable of use in analyzing securities and portfolios, based on a variety of asset classes. We were gratified this quarter to see sales related to our equity attribution and risk with success from clients who focus heavily on fixed income portfolio analysis as well. In addition, our publisher and SPAR applications have been successful this quarter too. Our investment banking clients continue to face challenges in their industry making their purchase decisions lengthier and more difficult. Sales of proprietary content by our global content sales team have expanded as well. FactSet\u2019s StreetAccount product, both on and off platform, continues to be a highly regarded and desired product by many of our clients seeking condensed, easy to digest, up-to-the-minute news. We have also been successful in licensing proprietary FactSet data, including FactSet\u2019s Fundamentals, FactSet Estimates, Ownership, Transcripts and Data Linking entities as well. A range of clients consume our data feeds from large existing FactSet clients to many that are entirely outside of our core client base. Lastly, as has been our practice over the last few years, we issued our annual price increase for many U.S. investment management clients during the second quarter and increased ASV by $7 million. As we previously mentioned, the price increase issued in second quarter has been becoming progressively smaller and not as a fundamental matter, but because more and more clients have been experiencing a price increase at the time of the renewal and renegotiation of their contracts with us. As a result, price increases are imposed throughout the year and there is not as much a standard item in Q2. Now, let\u2019s take a look at the expense side. For the second quarter, operating expenses were $152 million and our operating margin this quarter was 33.1%. As forecasted, the recent Revere and Matrix acquisitions lowered our Q2 operating margins by 70 basis points. Q2 cost of services expressed as a percentage of revenues increased 280 basis points compared to the same quarter of 2013 due to incremental cost from the Matrix and Revere acquisitions plus higher compensation expense from additional headcount in our engineering, consulting and product development groups. SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue decreased by 950 basis points in Q2 compared to the year ago periods due to prior period pretax charge of $50.7 million for vesting of performance-based stock options and lower occupancy costs as we did not enter into any material new leases this quarter. By the end of the second quarter, we had 6,486 employees, a net increase of 87 employees primarily due to the acquisition of Matrix. In Q2, our effective tax rate was 30.5% consistent with Q1. As I have mentioned, the effective tax rate was impacted by the expiration of the federal R&D tax credit. Had the credit been reenacted, our Q2 effective tax rate would have been 29%. Now, let\u2019s turn to our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2014. Please note that all guidance figures include full consolidation of Matrix. We expect that our revenues will range between $229 million and $233 million. Our operating margin is expected to range between 32.5% and 33.5%. This range includes a 70 basis points reduction from Revere and Matrix acquisitions. We expect that diluted EPS will range between $1.24 and $1.26. This diluted EPS estimate accounts for the expiration of the Federal R&D tax credit, which had the effect of lowering each end of our range by $0.03. The annual effective tax rate should range between 30% and 31%. This range also takes into the lapse of the federal R&D tax credit. In reviewing the first half of our fiscal year, we continued to make strides. We have grown by every measure EPS, ASV, client count, user count and revenues. Our return on equity exceeded our three year average of 35% and we continue to be aggressive in deploying capital in the form of new product development, acquisitions and share repurchases to maximize EPS accretion. Although we are in many instances the smaller player on the field, we still believe we have the preeminent products and the best solution for our clients, coupled with one of the greatest service models and teams in the industry. This was most evident as new clients and user acquisitions on the buy side reached quarterly highs not seen since 2006. We plan to keep on pushing ourselves to create the best solutions for a variety of problems, no matter how simple and straight forward or elegantly complex. Thank you. We are now ready for your questions. Rachel Stern : Operator, we are ready for the first question. Operator : Yes. Thank you. Alright, the first question comes from Mr. Peter Appert. Sir your line is open, you may proceed. Peter Appert : Thanks. So Peter on the SG&A costs, the \u2013 even I take out the vesting thing a year ago, it looks like the SG&A was flat or down a little bit year-to-year, anything you would call out on that? Peter Walsh : Peter, I wouldn\u2019t call out anything specifically. As you know we have been managing FactSet at the total operating income line and that\u2019s really where we focus, so there hasn\u2019t been anything specific that I would call out. Peter Appert : Okay, the sequential acceleration in passwords is very encouraging obviously and the \u2013 so I don\u2019t think you gave a specific number for buy side, did you in terms of percentage increase in buy side passwords? Peter Walsh : We didn\u2019t give a specific percentage increase. We just said it was the best since 2004. Peter Appert : Okay, the \u2013 you can help, I know that Phil in the past has said that he doesn\u2019t really focus on revenue per terminal, but it can\u2019t help notice that the revenue per password number has decelerated a little bit over the last couple of quarters, I assume some of that is a function of mix and pricing, but anything else that\u2019s noteworthy in that metric and is that something we should be concerned about? Phil Hadley : No, Peter, it\u2019s Phil. I think the way I would think about it, anytime we have strong password growth like we did this quarter, it\u2019s going to bring down the average per password, because as we sell our products in that vector of revenue, they wouldn\u2019t come on at the average, so it\u2019s actually a good thing. And the same is true with client count. We have a strong quarter for adding clients. The new client does not come on at the average client rate that we have. So as I have said many times I think it\u2019s important to look at it as a positive but as soon as you start dividing the numbers there is lots of things that come into play. Peter Appert : Got it. And then last thing, Phil the acceleration in password growth is particularly noteworthy because some of your competitors have seen tougher times, any color you can offer in terms of how you are feeling about the competitive dynamic in the market currently or how it\u2019s changed from a quarter or a couple of quarters ago? Phil Hadley : No, it really doesn\u2019t change that much quarter-to-quarter. Same players in this space, I think we feel very good about the product and mix that we have in the marketplace. As Peter kind of added in the color, it was certainly primarily a buy-side phenomenon for us, and we continued to gain share both in seats as well as clients. Peter Appert : Okay. And this is actually the real last thing, the cap spending number looked particularly low this quarter, so Peter any thoughts on where that should be for the full year and how we should think about that going forward? Peter Walsh : Yes. In terms of capital spending, I think the real drivers of it in terms of the movement from quarter-to-quarter really relates to real estate we build out of new space. We mentioned on the call that we hadn\u2019t signed any new leases, and I think that\u2019s really the reason why it was sort of a muted quarter in terms of capital spending. In terms of full year, we stopped including in our guidance because it\u2019s been such a small and really irrelevant number. I think if you look at it in terms of historical numbers relative to percentage of revenues, it stays very consistent year-to-year. Peter Appert : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. Shlomo Rosenbaum. (Operator Instructions) Mr. Rosenbaum, your line is open. You may proceed. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, thank you very much for taking my questions here. Hey Peter and Phil, may be you can just give us a little bit more color in terms of the strong user and client adds for these (inaudible) hedge funds, were they wealth management, can you just give us a little bit more color as to what the composition was? Mike Frankenfield : Hey, Shlomo, it\u2019s Mike. Growth in user count is primarily coming from the investment management segment, which includes wealth managers. We think of \u2013 when we think of wealth managers, I will remind everybody that we are targeting really the high net worth managers who are operating very much like traditional institutional investment managers. We had several big wins in the quarter, some important client displacements that led us to have some really good user growth in that area, so little bit offset by some headcount reduction in the banking segment though the reduction in users in the banking segment is happening at a much slower pace and it\u2019s also being offset by positive growth amongst the middle market banking users, so any decline in that segment is really only happening in the big firms. Shlomo Rosenbaum : It\u2019s just the tone from you guys just seems to be better this quarter, and I am wondering if you are sensing that the environment just overall is getting better or is it just because hey, you had some competitive wins there really did pretty well over here? And can you just talk about that a little bit more, because it sounds like the buy side is definitely doing better for you and then on the sell side, it\u2019s just not quite as bad, and you are just not seeing the declines at the same pace and actually getting more traction, so just delve into that a little bit more? Mike Frankenfield : It\u2019s Mike again. I hesitate to get too excited or too low. Our sales process is characterized as one that has a very, very long sell cycle. Our product development process involves making bets and developing product that takes years to get into the marketplace. So really what you are seeing in this particular quarter is the results of work that began many quarters ago, has come to fruition now, and I think we just take a steady as she goes, keep trying to understand what our users need, how we can add value to them, and try and build the best product possible. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Well, give us a little bit more in that, just to turn the tone. Is there any, would you say you are better, you see the environment is better this quarter than last quarter, I mean just -- or is it really just a pop this quarter because\u2026? Mike Frankenfield : Again, I am not \u2013 it\u2019s hard to get too excited on a quarter-to-quarter basis. If you look at why we are doing well, we have got great improvements to the product in terms of functionality, user experience fee. Our content sets enable us to sell complete solutions to clients without having to involve third-parties and that gives it a little bit of momentum. We have specialized the sales team even further and have greater segment focus and specialization on new client acquisition. These are all things that I think are really resonating with clients and maybe there is a little bit of firm creation on the buy side. There is certainly a little bit of firm creation in the middle market on the sell side. And all of that is -- there is till uncertainty amongst the very biggest clients on the sell side. So overall, it\u2019s a positive environment and I feel like we have got a great product to go after. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Very good. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Manav Patnaik. Your line is open, you may proceed. Manav Patnaik : Hi good morning everybody. I was just wondering if you could remind us how you define sort of the size of the wealth management market and maybe what your current penetration is today, just to get a sense of how much lag is left in sort of your wealth management side? Phil Hadley : I mean, this is Phil. Well, it\u2019s certainly depending on where you draw the line, give you over 500,000 users, I am not sure that\u2019s really the target we are after at this point as Mike alluded to we are after the higher net worth of the ultra net worth end user, who maybe in old school days you might think of it as a trust officer in a commercial bank, but things have changed and assets kind of gather in a bunch of different ways. And as Mike alluded we have had success in that space. Bigger thing for us is it\u2019s really the same product we are selling to that space and our work flow solution since they really have institutional nature, it worked very well for us. Manav Patnaik : I mean any sense of I guess obviously 500,000 is the big market opportunity which you maybe you are not off to but how many of those users you guys currently have? Phil Hadley : Not something we would quantify at this point, but that just is a driver for us. Manav Patnaik : Alright and then just one more from me, in terms of these nice little acquisitions, that you seem to have done with Revere and Matrix, how would you characterize just sort of the M&A pipeline and what the opportunities look like in terms of or maybe even not just small but even mid-size ones that you guys track? Peter Walsh : I would call pipeline is very consistent. We are generally an attractive buyer, so we are involved with pretty much anything that\u2019s in our space. We have a pretty high threshold when it comes to things that we are truly interested in and the threshold really is it is going to help our financial professional end users that we currently sell to. So we put that under that filter and look for things that are going to be great for our shareholders and for FactSet. Manav Patnaik : Okay, alright, fair enough. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. Glenn Greene. Your line is open, you may proceed. Glenn Greene : Thank you. Good morning. Nice results on the quarter. A few questions, I want to drill down a little bit on the buy side user growth front, try to tackle it in a couple of different ways. Was there any change from your existing clients in terms of their propensity to sort of add seats or licenses, I mean just trying to get a sense for the core business, ex new client adds, was there any acceleration there? Peter Walsh : I think there was modest deceleration amongst the existing clients. It really came \u2013 there were three drivers that are the big expansion amongst the wealth users, core business added users and then the acquired new clients that certainly drives for efficient growth. Glenn Greene : Okay and where is the 850,000 odd or there about almost 900,000 buy side user as in the quarter, was it skewed by a few large deals or do you think it was more broad based when you alluded to the wealth management and a few competitive takeaways, but just trying to get a sense was this is a few sort of one-off nice big wins or was it more broad based sort of systemic? Peter Walsh : Well, I think it was broad based. There was unquestionably couple of big wins that there were not a disproportionate amount of the total user increase. Glenn Greene : Okay. And then just to help me understand how you are defining the strongest user growth since 2004 as I \u2013 as we sort our look back for our model there has certainly been plenty of quarters of stronger user growth in this quarter, does that imply that historical user growth we have seen might have been more dramatically skewed towards the sell side than I guess I would have thought? Peter Walsh : Yes, it\u2019s the way we were just calling that out in this particular quarter Glenn which we are just isolating the buy side user which was the strongest since that period. Glenn Greene : And that\u2019s a \u2013 is that a year-over-year or a quarter-to-quarter metric sorry that you are thinking about it? Peter Walsh : In the quarter itself related to previous quarters. Glenn Greene : Okay and one more clarification if I may, the organic ASV growth number the 6% year-over-year just as I think about just to make sure I am on the same page and how you get there, I would have thought you would have the $7 million for Matrix and the $5 million for Revere that you would adjust out maybe there is something else in there? Peter Walsh : No, I think those are the two adjustments. Glenn Greene : It\u2019s noise, but you get \u2013 it\u2019s about a point lower organic growth I think? Peter Walsh : Maybe after the call we can compare our numbers, but I think you might \u2013 it rounds up to 6. Glenn Greene : Okay, alright. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. Joseph Foresi. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed. Joseph Foresi : Hi. My first question is how sustainable do you think the momentum is on sell side? And maybe you could just talk about how many of those additions were new versus takeaways? Mike Frankenfield : Hey, it\u2019s Mike. So the sell side is characterized really by two clients, they are the large bulge bracket firms and the middle-market firms. The areas that we are seeing the best growth though by no means spectacular growth is in the middle-market area. In the big firms, they continued to be very cost focused spending lot of effort rationalizing their spend. They have not yet turned into the point where they are investing materially in the business. So we are not seeing any sort of material growth in the bulge bracket firms. Joseph Foresi : Okay. And then just on the \u2013 sorry, go ahead. Phil Hadley : I was just going to add a couple of point of clarification. I think the percentages we put out the 17.3% and 82.7% would be what we would think on the organics, so we would exclude the $12 million or the $5 million from Revere plus the $7 million from Matrix, which might be leading people to think that the sell side grew and it did. So the growth this quarter is on the buy side. Joseph Foresi : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then just on the margin front, how do you think about those long-term as you continue to integrate the acquisitions? And how do you think of it in relation to SG&A spending? Phil Hadley : I would go with Peter\u2019s answer and I honestly don\u2019t think of SG&A and cost of goods as something different in FactSet even though the accounting profession divides those two up. And I would think that over time, we\u2019ll integrate and get efficiencies with those acquisitions, but I would stay focused on FactSet from an EPS growth perspective. Joseph Foresi : Okay. If I could sneak one last one in on the banking, I think you said you lost a couple maybe you could just talk about what was the reason for that? Phil Hadley : Well, I think that Mike alluded to the fact that banking is just a very choppy space for us. They typically do all of their hiring in the fourth quarter and everything in between can be up or down depending on an individual client can swing a quarter on an ASV basis. But I wouldn\u2019t characterize it any different other than the fact that quarter-to-quarter it\u2019s very choppy, this quarter less choppy than last, but still choppy. Joseph Foresi : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. Alex Kramm. Sir you line is open. You may proceed. Alex Kramm : Hey, good morning. Just a couple of things left here. One I think in that quarter past or maybe two quarters ago, you made a comment that when you actually get new users or new clients on board that a lot of times actually give them a little bit of a fee waiver for a year or a few months or so and that\u2019s been one of the reasons why ASV growth has trailed some of the user and client growth, so obviously this year \u2013 this quarter we saw nice little acceleration in ASV or so. Just wondering is some of that playing out over the last few quarters you have been giving fee waivers and now finally those users are kicking in and starting to pay and if that\u2019s the case what is the pipeline of maybe more people going from that transition into actually paying for the services they are getting? Phil Hadley : Alex, just I think a point of clarification, we wouldn\u2019t \u2013 user and client wouldn\u2019t count if somebody is on a zero revenue trial to match a contract expiration. Alex Kramm : Okay, but then I mean in general can you make comments about that revenue kicking in for maybe some of the guys that you have generated in general? Phil Hadley : So Alex, every quarter, a very high percentage of our ASVs that we derive come from existing clients. New clients when they come on, come on in a much lower average ASV than our existing trends. We may also offer transition discounts to help clients manage the transition from one supplier data analytics to FactSet. Once these clients become clients that\u2019s really when our opportunity begins to introduce new products and services and to upsell and help them improve more and more of their workflow process. So the punch line is new clients come on at a typically low ASV level and over time they grow and that relationship we have with clients that drives ASV for FactSet. Alex Kramm : Okay, that makes sense. Thanks for that clarification. And then just secondly maybe on the margin a little bit, I don\u2019t think you commented on it, obviously that has come down from the acquisition here. And I think the guidance next quarter again the margin is still looking at that lower level but at the same time you\u2019re seeing the acquisition is not dilutive for the full year. So is that implying you getting back to kind of like the margins 50 basis points higher or so that you\u2019ve seen last year as we move throughout the quarter, throughout the year and then into fiscal year 2015? Peter Walsh : Hi, Alex, it\u2019s Peter. There is a lot of things that influence our operating margins from quarter-to-quarter even the two acquisitions that, that we referenced while they did have an impact in our margin. The relative size to FactSet\u2019s entire business is quite small. Historically looking back we\u2019ve managed our margins to be flat and we\u2019re very proud of that fact because at the rate which \u2013 this business is generating margins at between 33% and 34%, we\u2019re still \u2013 which is very high, we\u2019re still aggressively investing back in the business. In terms of looking ahead I definitely would encourage investors to look at our forward operating margin guidance in Q3 and also EPS which implies that on an adjusted basis again EPS will grow by more than 10%. Alex Kramm : Alright. Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Tim McHugh. Sir your line is open. Tim McHugh : Yes, thanks. I just have one question, most of mine have been asked. But on the pricing trend you gave the commentary that the price increase looks smaller just because of I guess different timing in terms of \u2013 when you\u2019re pushing through price and in terms of adding inventory renewals. Can you give us any color in terms of how that year-over-year kind of I guess pricing trends look right now versus what you\u2019ve seen the last six, 12, 18 months and I guess just trying to normalize for that timing factor and how pricing is trending for you? Phil Hadley : So as Peter alluded historically we\u2019ve \u2013 as he said in his opening statements we saw less from price increase in the second quarter of this year because more of the price increases happen over the course of the year in a way that corresponds with client\u2019s renewals. Our philosophy around pricing is pretty consistent. Over the course of the year, FactSet releases hundreds of enhancements to its clients at no incremental cost. As the year goes on we study the competitive dynamic, we study the effect of these enhancements on our users and we try to determine where we added the most value. It\u2019s a very fluid process. I would say our price increases tend to near CPI about that level and that\u2019s the level that I would anticipate going forward. Tim McHugh : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Bill Warmington. Sir your line is open. Bill Warmington : Thank you. And I\u2019d like to add my congratulations on the strong subscriber growth and strong client growth. So a question for you on the \u2013 you mentioned your investment in new products. Just wanted to ask about the new products pipeline, how that was looking if there was anything particularly that you wanted to focus on? Peter Walsh : Thanks, Bill. It\u2019s Peter. In terms of new products we\u2019ve been investing both in terms of new applications and new content. Our fixed income portfolio analytics product has been one that has been garnishing a lot of investment for us and continues to do quite well in the marketplace. Bill Warmington : Yes. Peter Walsh : We\u2019ve been \u2013 on the content side I would say that we\u2019ve been investing aggressively in StreetAccount in terms of expanding its coverage and also its value points and different types of new stories and we\u2019ve gotten particularly good feedback from users on that investment. Bill Warmington : Yes. I did also want to ask how StreetAccount was doing just in terms of an acquisition that you guys made, how that\u2019s performed versus your expectations over the past couple of years? Mike Frankenfield : I\u2019d characterize StreetAccount as materially outperforming our expectation is giving us opportunities to enhance the workflow of our existing users, but it\u2019s also given us an opportunity to attract new users to FactSet and penetrate firms and users that we didn\u2019t have before. Peter Walsh : And I might just add to Mike\u2019s comments just for clarity. As we add users to subscribe to StreetAccount through their existing product that we acquired they\u2019re not included in our user count. So the user count that we\u2019re describing is just back to terminal zone. Bill Warmington : On the wealth management side how should we think about revenue proceed as it compares to traditional buy-side and traditional sell-side? Phil Hadley : As I think we alluded to before, we\u2019re really targeting the users in the wealth community that are operating very much like institutional asset manager. Bill Warmington : Right. Phil Hadley : The price points are very similar. It\u2019s been exciting to see these users increase their level of sophistication and generate interest in some of the more advanced analytic applications we have such as portfolio analytics. So I think as the information needs and sophistication of that user group increases over time it represents a greater the FactSet potential growth. Bill Warmington : Okay. And one last question the \u2013 on the $7.3 million contribution to ASV in the quarter you just reported from acquisitions. Is that a good number to use for next quarter as well or how should we think about that? Phil Hadley : The way we treat acquisitions when we add them to just to make sure that everybody is clear on what organic, that\u2019s just a beginning point. If they add ASV next quarter it will be part of the organic growth that the \u2013 the $7.3 million will stay in our organic calculation for four quarters and then dropout. Bill Warmington : Got it. Alright. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next one is from the line of Hamzah Mazari. Your line is open. Flavio Campos : Hello there. This is Flavio. I\u2019m standing for Hamzah today. Great quarter guys and thank you for taking my question. I\u2019m going to take you back a little bit on the pricing question and just play on the wealth management theme as well. We know that probably the sell side clients are the ones that are more price sensitive, but within the buy side do you see any difference between the wealth managers in the more traditional buy side, institutional buy side in regards to pricing and how they react to that? Mike Frankenfield : We don\u2019t see a lot of difference. The information needs and (local) needs of both the institutional managers and the wealth managers are similar and the complexity of the needs, the degree to which they need to do complex analysis is one of the important drivers of how much value we can deliver and therefore then how much we can charge. Flavio Campos : That makes sense. And you also mentioned that the wealth management clients are the ones driving up the client count. Is that because they\u2019re brand new clients or is it because even if you sign the wealth management division of a sell side client that counts as a new client as well so I was just wondering\u2026 Mike Frankenfield : In terms of user count, wealth management clients are certainly a factor in that. In terms of client count, that is being driven in a much more broad-based way in a combination of traditional managers, some small wealth management shops, hedge funds, middle market investment banking boutique firms. And then they clarify if a wealth division of a sell side firm who we\u2019ve always counted as a client wouldn\u2019t add to our client count. It would just be counted as part of the major client. Flavio Campos : Perfect. That\u2019s very helpful. And I think you mentioned in your last call that wealth management was not still a big part of the Asia-Pac side of the business, it\u2019s more UK, U.S. centric business. Is there any difference there and what drives that double-digit growth in Asia-Pac, just a comparison on what are the drivers on the non-Asia and the Asia side of the business? Mike Frankenfield : There is little change in the mix though wealth is still not a material driver in Asia. Asia growth is being driven by firm creation, certainly all of the things that are driving the core business. It\u2019s also coming off of a relatively low base, which helps it achieve higher growth rates on a percentage basis. Flavio Campos : That\u2019s helpful. Right, I think I already sneaked one question too many. Thank you so much for your time guys. Operator : Thank you. Next one is from the line of Toni Kaplan, and our last question is from Toni Kaplan\u2019s line. Sir, your line is open. Toni Kaplan : Thank you. So Thomson recently started to rollout its Eikon functionality for investment management when your salespeople are either going to existing or new prospects. Is there anything that they are starting to hear on that product and how it compares to FactSet? Thanks. Mike Frankenfield : We haven\u2019t seen much Eikon in our core users. It suddenly popped up in select cases, but so far the majority of what we have heard is that they have released a new version, they have released several versions of the product. We know they are going through some conversions and that we believe most of the Eikon users that are out there today have been converted from other legacy Thomson platforms. We know that they have recently expressed their desire to convert to the Thomson ONE users to Eikon. The Thomson ONE users do have overlap with the FactSet target user group and that\u2019s a group of users and a group of firms that we have been talking to for years. So the direct answer to your question is we haven\u2019t seen it much in our market and we will continue to monitor it. Toni Kaplan : Okay, thanks. And just one follow-up on M&A, are there any areas that you are maybe potentially looking for holes in the product portfolio that you think would be incremental? You talked about there is big M&A pipeline earlier, so just wanted to see what areas might especially be useful for adding enhanced functionality to the product? Thanks. Phil Hadley : Thanks, Toni. I think our D&A really is to think about organic growth. Peter was talking about all the investments we have been making in product and we really think about our plans going forward for the next 12 and doubling of the business being in organic opportunity. I think we look at acquisitions on a strategic basis as an opportunity for us to potentially in some cases buy something instead of build, but it\u2019s not part of our plan. There is no portion of next 12 months revenue that we are planning to buy versus build. I think that puts us in a very strong position in the acquisitions we have made have been very accretive to FactSet both strategically as well as performed well from a financial perspective. So we are very, very careful about that process. And I was really just alluding to the fact that it\u2019s kind of a pipeline as normal and there is always things that are kind of interesting, but it really involves lots of factors before it would be something that we would actually acquire. The culture needs to fit. It needs to be something that\u2019s strategic for the business. In addition to that the financial criteria (indiscernible) being accretive to us in the long run is important. So it\u2019s really more business as usual in that category. Toni Kaplan : Thanks a lot. Nice job on the quarter. Peter Walsh : Yes, thank you, Toni and thank you everyone else for your questions today. We look forward to catching up with you next quarter. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes today\u2019s FactSet\u2019s second quarter conference call. Thank you.",

Operator : Welcome and thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the discussion, we will have a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Now, I will turn the meeting over to your host, Ms. Rachel Stern, Senior Vice President, Strategic Resources and General Counsel. Ma'am, your line is open. You may proceed. Rachel Stern : Thank you, operator. Good morning and thanks to all of you for participating today. Welcome to FactSet's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Phil Hadley, Chairman and CEO; Peter Walsh, Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Frankenfield, Director of Global Sales. This conference call is being transcribed in real-time by FactSet's CallStreet service and is being broadcast live via the Internet at factset.com. A replay of this call will also be available on our website. Our call will contain forward-looking statements reflecting management's expectations based on currently available information. Actual results may differ materially. More information about factors that could affect FactSet's business and financial results can be found in FactSet's filings with the SEC. Annual subscription value or ASV is a key metric for FactSet. Please recall that ASV is a snapshot view of client subscription and represents our forward-looking revenues for the next 12 months. Lastly, FactSet undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In addition to our quarterly update, we are pleased to announce that the company has named Phil Snow as President, effective July 1st. Phil Snow is an 18-year veteran of FactSet. His most recent role is Senior Vice President, Director of U.S. Investment Management Sales. As President, Phil Snow will report directly to our CEO, Philip Hadley. I would like to turn the discussion over now to Peter Walsh, Chief Operating Officer. At the end of his remarks, we will have time for questions. Please limit your remarks to only one question and just one follow-up, so that we will have time to address all questions effectively. Peter Walsh : Thank you, Rachel, and good morning everyone. Here's how I planned to spend our time today. First, I'll review a few housekeeping items. Second, we will review Q3 results. Third, I will provide guidance for Q4. Finally, we will end with your questions. Let's begin with four housekeeping matters to add clarity to our reported results. To start, when we acquired StreetAccount in June 2012, we granted performance-based options. StreetAccount has had great success and we are pleased to report a non-cash pre-tax charge of $1.4 million was recorded in Q3, related to changing our expectations that performance targets will be achieved which triggers vesting of these options. Secondly, we recorded a $1.6 million pre-tax legal charge primarily from settling a claim. Third, we experienced income tax benefits of $554,000, primarily from the expiration of the statute of limitations on open tax years. Lastly, regarding the R&D tax credit, as you will recall the credit expired on December 31, 2013. Accordingly, as we did in Q2, today our Q3 EPS and Q4 guidance includes a $0.03 reduction compared to the prior year, and adjusted EPS excludes this benefit in the prior year quarter. The R&D tax credit has only lapsed once in its 32-year history and has been retroactively restated in previous years. Our annual effective tax rate would have been 28.7% rather than the actual rate of 30.5%, had the credit been reenacted before the end of Q3. Now on to our third quarter results, I am pleased to say that FactSet has had a good third quarter and much stronger than a year ago. All key metrics grew. ASV, revenues, EPS, client count and user count. Our organic ASV growth rate also expanded by 130 basis points, ASV grew to $932,000, up 7% organically over the prior year. Organic ASV rose by $12.3 million this quarter. The buy-side performed well this quarter and accounted for 83.1% of total ASV. Remember, that our buy-side business includes off-platform data sales and the market metric business. For us, the sell-side includes only the M&A advisory, capital markets and equity research businesses, which stabilized in terms of users and accounted for 16.9% of ASV. This quarter, adjusted EPS rose to a $1.25, an increase of 11% compared to the same period last year. We are proud to point out that this quarter marks our 16th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth. Free cash flow is defined as cash generated from operations less capital spending. We generated $91 million free cash flow this quarter compared to $92 million in the year ago quarter, which is our record high. Over the last 12-month period, free cash flow was $253 million, up 9%. DSOs this quarter were 34 days, up from 29 days in the same period last year. DSOs were 39 days at the end of Q2, representing a decline of 13% in the last 90 days. Our cash and investment balance was $134 million at May 31, up $31 million in the past three months. We repurchased 540,000 shares this quarter for a total of $57 million. As of the end of this quarter, $162 million remains authorized for future share repurchases. Over the prior 12 months, we have returned $409 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. During the third quarter, our Board of Directors authorized the increase of our quarterly dividend by 11% from $0.35 to $0.39 per share beginning with our dividend payment today. Over the last three years, our dividend has grown at a compounded annual rate of 13%. At the end of the quarter, we had 42 million shares outstanding. Now let's turn to our P&L. FactSet's third quarter revenues grew to $232 million, an 8% increase compared to last year. Organic revenues grew 6% over last year, excluding $3.7 million in revenues from acquisitions completed since June 2013. Operating income for Q3 increased to $73 million compared to $72 million in the same period last year. Adjusted operating income for the quarter increased 6% over the prior year. Adjusted net income also grew 6% this quarter to $53 million and adjusted diluted EPS grew 11% to $1.25. Please note that current year adjusted operating income, net income and EPS exclude $554,000 in income tax benefits, the non-cash pre-tax charge of $1.4 million related to stock-based compensation and a $1.6 million pre-tax legal charge. Last year's adjusted net income and EPS excluded $3.3 million of income tax benefits related to the federal R&D tax credit and finalizing prior year tax returns. Third quarter revenues in the U.S. grew to $156 million, up 6% over the same period last year. Our non-U.S. revenues grew to $76 million. Excluding incremental revenue from the acquisition of Matrix and the impact of foreign currency the Q3 international revenue growth rate was 8%. On the international side, third quarter revenues from our Europe and Asia-Pacific regions were $58 million and $17 million, respectively. Excluding foreign currency effects in the Matrix acquisition, year-over-year growth rates were 7% Europe and 14% in Asia-Pacific. Our performance during the just completed third quarter was positive on all fronts, especially since the third quarter is typically not a robust one for us. Our client growth was strong this quarter as we added 30 new clients compared to four a year ago. In fact, this Q3 was our best third quarter for new client acquisition since 2007. Total client count was 2,662 as of quarter end. As you know, we only count as clients those that we bill at least 24,000 annually. On our annual client retention rate was greater than 95% of ASV and rose for the very first time since the credit crisis to 93% in terms of the number of actual clients. Not only we are adding new client, but we are keeping the existing ones too. This quarter, our net user count of FactSet terminals rose by 620 compared to only 61 in the year ago quarter. Total user count was 52,483 professionals at quarter end. While users declined only very slightly at sell-side clients, user growth on the buy-side was strong resulting in 632 net new users. This quarter, we entered into agreement with the QUICK Corporation, a Japanese financial information provider that is part of the Nikkei Group. Together we plan to develop a premium FactSet service for redistribution in Asia. The new service will integrate the Nikkei Group's high-quality content with FactSet's industry leading global content and workflow solutions. We are enthusiastic about this opportunity to further FactSet sales through this expanded partnership with QUICK. Whether at new clients or from same-store sales, our portfolio analytics suite of applications is a strong product line for us. We are gratified to see existing clients expand their use of our services and buy more products that integrate with the Portfolio Analytics suite. Clients continue to find value in our ability to serve as a single solution for their analytics, risk and publishing needs over a variety of asset classes. As in recent quarters wealth management continues to deliver growth for us.  We have both, a focused product suite and sales team to address the workflows of these particular types of clients. Aiming to deliver the most thoughtful service and comprehensive ease to generate reports for their clients, our wealth management clients are using more and more of our portfolio analytics suite of products in a manner similar to some institutional investors. We have also been happy to see growth in our proprietary content through the efforts of our global content sales team. StreetAccount, FactSet's condenses news product is [strongly] across all FactSet user types. Our proprietary data including FactSet Fundamentals, FactSet Estimates, Ownership, Transcripts [data] has been selling well. Many client consumer data feeds, some of them are traditional workstation clients that also want feed data for a particular use and some are not traditional FactSet clients at all. While not an area of growth for us during Q3, our investment banking clients fared better this quarter than in the recent past. While their purchase decisions are lengthier and more difficult, they are not nearly as negative as they have been in recent years. We are also encouraged by the uptick in both, the IPO and M&A marketplaces. Now, let's take a look at the expense side. For the third quarter, operating expenses were $159 million and our adjusted operating margin this quarter was 32.8%, lower than 33.4% we reported last year. The Revere and Matrix acquisitions lowered operating margins in Q3 by 120 basis points. Cost of services in Q3 expressed as a percentage of revenues increased 190 basis points compared to a year ago due to a non-cash pre-tax charge of $1.4 million related to the vesting of performance-based options, incremental cost of the Matrix and Revere acquisitions and higher compensation expense from additional headcount in our engineering, consulting and product development groups, partially offset by lower computer equipment capital expenditures. SG&A expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues decreased by 150 basis points in Q3 compared to the year ago period due to lower compensation expense from employees performing SG&A was partially offset by higher legal fees and [more] related to an increase in travel by our sales teams. By the end of the third quarter, we had 6,372 employees. Our total global headcount grew 8% since last May. As predicted in last quarter's call, our net headcount decreased by 114 employees. This trend will likely be reversing in Q4, because our new consulting and engineering classes have started and we restart hiring content collection personnel now that another successful peak filing season has passed. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 29.8%, up from 25.9% a year ago. As we discuss, our effective tax rate was impacted by the expiration of the federal R&D tax credit. Had the credit been reenacted, our Q3 effective tax rate would have been 28.7%. Now, let's turn to our guidance for fiscal 2014. We expect that our revenues will range between $235 million and $240 million. Our operating margin is expected to range between 32.5% and 33.5%. This range includes a 1% reduction from acquisitions made since September 2013. We expect that diluted EPS will range between $1.30 and $1.32. This diluted EPS estimate accounts for the expired federal R&D tax credit which has the effect of lowering each end of our range by $0.03. The annual effective tax rate should range between 30% and 31%. This range also takes into account the lapse federal R&D tax credit. On the whole, we have been pleased with our third quarter performance. We are encouraged that every key metric was up, each notching new record highs. Our buy-side user base is expanding and there are early signs of stabilization within the sell-side. Our organic ASV growth rate increased by 1% and our sense is that we are beginning to see some of the results of the efforts that we have been working on for some time now. Adjusted EPS again grew by double digits and has done so in every quarter for the last four years. While we are pleased with reason results, our aspirations are to go way beyond stringing together a couple of successful quarters. We like our position and our future market opportunity, but we still have a lot of work ahead. We are excited about the challenge and delighted to have Phil Snow as our President as we forge ahead. Thank you and we are now ready for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Mr. Peter Appert. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed. Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray : Thanks. Good morning. Peter, I was hoping you might be able to give us some incremental color on what's driving the acceleration in password and ASP growth. Specifically I am wondering if you could give us an granularity on drivers like pricing or growth from new versus existing customers or just anything to help understand what's the dynamic behind the accelerating growth. Thanks. Mike Frankenfield : Peter, it's Mike Frankenfield. It was a good quarter for us, Peter, throughout several metrics in terms of new client acquisition, which is obviously one source of user count, user growth and password growth. It's kind of a boring FactSet answer, but our growth was very, very broad-based. There were no single big defining wins. There was no significant price increase in the quarter. Rather, when we look at new client acquisition, it was broad-based. It came from new hedge funds, traditional asset managers, who keep M&A shops. When we look at the users, majority of the user growth happened on the buy-side. If you were to breakdown what's happening with the sell-side headcount, we have got solid growth in the middle market, in the boutique firms and that's offset a little bit by still some softness in the bigger firms, but even amongst the big bulge bracket firms, we are beginning to see signs of stabilization and potentially growth. New interns for example are up significantly this year and we will see if that translates to permanent hires in their firms. Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray : About the proportion of growth coming from new versus existing clients. Peter Walsh : When new clients come on to the system, they come on at a rate that's much lower than the average ASV per client and our strategy is to get clients to start out with a small amount of service that they can digest. As we get to understand their needs and they understand more about FactSet, we grow together, therefore the vast majority of our growth comes from what I would call same-store sales or sales to existing clients. Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray : Got it. Thank you. Just as a follow-up, Phil, could you talk a little bit about your thought process in terms of decision to create a president role. Phil Hadley : Well, through the annual - we have a December succession planning process that we go through every year. After conversations with Mike and Peter, we came to the conclusion that their timeline is less than five years and to make sure we are doing the right thing for the business, it became apparent that we need to groom the next generation of talent at FactSet. Through a process with Mike, Peter and I and the Board, we are very excited to have Phil as an outstanding candidate to lead the next generation of FactSet leadership team. The role of President is a great role for him, because it gives him the experiences necessary to be a valuable contributor in the strategy and where FactSet is headed in the future. Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray : Specifically Mike and Peter, you are saying are not necessarily anything beyond five years? Peter Walsh : All these are our kind of thoughts, but that was kind of if you look at it and say, my natural succession plan. If you looked at it historically, you would kind of think that that would be the case. As we kind of got together and put our heads together and we feel really excited about the outcome and in fact it was Mike's idea as we went through the process. We are excited about the next generation of FactSet and you know get to know more people at FactSet as opposed to the three of us. Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed. Manav Patnaik - Barclays: Thank you. Good morning. Just on the client retention, I just wanted to try and understand maybe with that as perspective, are there any changes to the competitive environment that's driving some of that or is that just less companies on the buy-side going out of business maybe. Just wanted to characterize where that improvement is coming from and is that sustainable? Peter Walsh : You certainly identified one factor and that is, clients' health overall is improving in the industry. There were fewer firms that went out of the business in this particular quarter. However, when look at the FactSet's product offering and what our development teams are putting together to build a really broad complete product that can service the needs of all these different user types and firm types that I described earlier. We are emerging in a very, very strong competitive position. When I look at the wins we had, the quality of the wins was very strong this quarter, because they came not just from new firm creation, but competing against well entrenched competitors and been able to win that business. Manav Patnaik - Barclays: I guess, does your you expansion on the wealth management side, does that have a role in this or is that maybe too small, maybe you can characterize that by what inning you guys feel you are in, in that penetration? Peter Walsh : On the wealth side, I think you are seeing the combination of some new client growth, but the majority of the growth on the wealth side - it really just represents, wealth represent a large group of users. I think in the past, Phil Hadley has mentioned, there's many as 500,000 potential of wealth managers out there. We are not going after all 500,000, but rather the high end users, which is a smaller community, but still a university. Manav Patnaik - Barclays: Okay. Then just one last one on, I think, last quarter you talked about the fixed income PA product doing very well, just any update there? Peter Walsh : We continue to be in the early stages of fixed income. We had several key wins this quarter that continued to give us confidence and to verify that we are building something that not only our traditional clients who managed equities and a little bit of fixed income are interested in, but also firms that manage purely fixed income, insurance companies et cetera, are all now being to take notice and it's exciting dive into that opportunity, which we feel we are still in the early stages. Manav Patnaik - Barclays: All right. Thanks a lot guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. Alex Kramm from UBS. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed. Alex Kramm - UBS: Good morning. Just want to come back to some of the growth that you are talking about. I think I would ask for, in terms of the users and clients growth, like, what areas are driving that? I was hoping that maybe you can be a little bit more specific that when you look at your organic growth rate actually for the quarter in terms of ASV or revenue, if you can actually isolate some of these growth drivers in actual numbers. For example, obviously, StreetAccount is doing very well. That's now in your organic growth rate. I mean, how much is that contributing to the growth, also wealth management? How many percentage of your growth is coming from if you can or anything else that you can highlight there? Peter Walsh : It would be very difficult for us to break down growth at that level. One of the challenges really in a product like ours is to really allocating revenue and that we sell a terminal based product that has lots of value and it comes from various pieces, so knowing exactly what the client valued in the purchase is difficult for us to do. We certainly attempt to for management purposes, but to be able to break it down and in the ways that would be able to give us concrete information for yourself, I guess I would focus on the theme of - as a business it may sound simple, but we are after terminals and clients and product to those clients and we really felt comfortable we had a great quarter and that we had all three of those metrics move in the right direction. We are gaining feeds - drivers. We are certainly gaining shares competitors as well as new users in a growth environment. New clients, same, and the product mix on top of those users in analytics space both fixed income and equity analytics products continue to do very well. Something like StreetAccount comes off of really small base for it to really be a core driver in incremental ASV based on its core product. We are certainly excited about how it does, but it wouldn't be material enough to move the big number. Alex Kramm - UBS: Okay, then maybe secondly on operating leverage. It seems like excluding some of these acquisitions, your margins are still improving and still getting some nice operating leverage. When we think about even 2015 early, I mean, is there anything - I mean, should that trend continue? Is there anything that you are seeing out there in terms of pricing or cost pressure that should maybe inhibit that and are there any sort of step function as maybe you integrate some of these acquisitions better or is the base that you are seeing right now are good base to grow off of? Phil Hadley : I have always looked at the business really from the bottom up, and as Peter pointed out, I think we are in our 16th quarter of double-digit EPS growth and I am really trying to double the shareholder value at the EPS line and what happens at margins sometimes acquisitions are dilutive to margins. Sometimes they are accretive to margin. As a business, we always try to manage margins flat. Obviously, things that come in and out of that make it, so that's not a true statement, but as the business philosophy, extending margins is not our focus. It's really investing in future product to drive our organic growth. Alex Kramm - UBS: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel: Hi. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Mike, can you comment a little bit about hiring at the clients and how much that was a factor of growth just the new terminals to existing clients. You talked a little bit on the sell-side encouraging, but how about the different areas in the buy-side? Mike Frankenfield : I think there is modest hiring going on, Shlomo. Nothing dramatic, but we certainly see pockets of growth and incremental hires going on, nothing dramatic. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel: \u2026improving them? Mike Frankenfield : I think it's a positive trend. Absolutely. Days when we were talking on this call several quarters ago when there was a lot of cloudiness and uncertainty about the direction are not the case now. Clearly the direction is positive hiring, but again I wouldn't get too excited about it, because I don't see signs that it's utterly dramatic. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel: Okay. Then if you can talk a little bit about the agreement with QUICK, I am trying to understand what it is you guys are doing over there premium to FactSet, what's going to be additive and is there going to be sold by FactSet or is it going to be sold by QUICK. Then the typical question I guess you could expect is are you going to be paying royalties to QUICK, so you are going to be selling a lower margin product, if you can just get into that a little bit? Mike Frankenfield : Great. Happy to add some clarity to that. QUICK is a subsidiary of the Nikkei Group, in Japan. We had a long-term working relationship with both, QUICK and Nikkei, and the relationship that we have worked on that culminated this quarter was the decision to form partnership to build a joint product that will combine their best-of-breed content that focuses primarily on the Japanese market, with our global content and superior workflow solutions. This joint product is going to be worked on by both, our teams and it's not ready for releases today. It will be ready in the upcoming quarters. We will work jointly to market and sell that product and our goal is to build a premium product. Our goal is not to build a product that is less expensive or has lower amounts of functionality, but rather to build something that is going to be perceived and used as a premium in that market place. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel: Does that mean that it's going to be a higher price product, which I shouldn't expect to change in the margin profile, is that the way I should think of it? Peter Walsh :  From a profitability perspective, I think it will have similar characteristics of the business we have in Japan or rest of the world right now. What's exciting about it is, all our clients in Japan have strong demand for the Nikkei content, which is not available currently on FactSet. They are particularly focused on local language, so we will do some work to localize that product and make it more accessible to a larger universe. Then certainly the QUICK group has a very, very broad reach and has client relationships that extend well beyond what FactSet has been able to develop over the years, so we believe that leveraging their reach in the marketplace will help both firms achieve a good outcome. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel: That would offset any potential cannibalization of other FactSet workstations in Japan? Peter Walsh : I expect it to be positive to the both firms. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. Hamzah Mazari from Credit Suisse. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed. Flavio Campos - Credit Suisse : Hi, there. This is Flavio. I am standing in for Hamzah today. Most of my questions have been answered, but just very quickly. On the competitive landscape, I think there was a question about pricing earlier, but how do you see your competitive landscape right now? We have heard a couple of your competitors were aggressive on pricing. Cap IQ is rolling out some of your products right now. Can you give us an update on how you see that? Phil Hadley : Competitive landscape changes very slowly quarter-to-quarter and there are always lots of announcements each quarter about new product, but the reality is that takes a long time for clients to evaluate this product to consider and make a purchase decision and decided if it's the product that they going to go forward with, so there isn't significant change happening. We continue to price our product in a way that captures the full value that we are delivering and we continue to be very excited about our prospects relative to what we can do for clients and relative to the competitors. Flavio Campos - Credit Suisse : Great. That's helpful. Just a different topic very quickly, any updates on your acquisition pipeline? Are you focused on right now on integrating or you are focusing on acquisitions already? Thanks. Phil Hadley : It's Phil. Our core focus certainly as our strategy is always on our organic and creating value for clients, so as a business we stay plowing ahead and creating value with our strategic plan that we march forward with every year. That said, obviously, we are in attractive place for many business and we are always going to have our eyes out for companies and opportunities that would fit into the FactSet's long-term strategy, so it's something that is pretty episodic and how it takes place, but it's definitely out there and one we pay attention to. Flavio Campos - Credit Suisse : Perfect. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next comes from Mr. Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed. Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley :  Thanks. You seem to be more positive on the client environment this quarter both, on the buy-side and the sell-side, so just in light of that are you are you expecting to increase your sales force to take advantage of the improving trend? Phil Hadley : Our headcount strategy is really to grow our entire client facing staff, which includes sales people, client support people and product specialists in line what we think our revenue growth rate is. Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley :  Okay. You have been growing the wealth management business over the last couple of quarters. Just when I think about that, inherently does that business have lower margins? I know you have said in the past that the price point are similar, but is it more costly to get to those clients? I am just trying to get a sense of whether there is mix pressure on the margins based on that business growing? Thanks. Phil Hadley : We had a interesting business. If we think of the product that we are selling to the wealth space, it's already been created for the institutional space. It certainly has some limitations in the feature sets that we allow into that, so at a cost of goods perspective if you were saying what incremental product I produce it's really zero. Then even the service level since there are different levels of the wealth basic events, terminals that have features that aren't included in institutional product. It's actually easier for us to support, so I think on margin of margin, you would find it accretive to what we are doing in the business. Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley :  Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Joe Foresi from Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is open. You may proceed. Joe Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott : Hi. I was wondering, could you give us some idea of what your investment schedule is for specific products? In other words, is there anything specifically that your are targeting throughout the business wealth management or fixed income? Peter Walsh : Well, if you think about our business and back up, we have roughly 3,500 employees in the content creation and there is constant investment happening in that space. I think in round numbers, we probably have another 2,000 employees in product and software that client-facing and we have huge internal projects going on all the time for things in the marketplace there is a next generation of PAs, there's a next generation of backend platform. There is a new interface. There are all kinds of huge projects that go on internally. We are very fortunate able to fund those all out of - our current product. When I was talking about investing in the business and not having a leak in the margin is because we are always building this business for the future. Not interested in maximizing next quarter, interested in making sure that we are looking at the next decade and making sure this company is positioned to, as I have always said, be in a position to double, so the product pipeline would be a very long and exciting and boring if I think in which chair you are sitting in. Joe Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott : I was just wondering, what is factored if anything and what impact are you seeing from some of the lack of trading volumes across the street? In other words, do you expect a dip in the fixed income business because of that or sell-side in the back half of the year or is that you are not seeing an impact on your product from that? Phil Hadley : Our product is very tight headcount in our clients, so it is really needs to be determined by their and the way you need invest in their business. As Mike alluded to, there are clearly signs of hiring and investment in the investment management side of the business. There are clearly signs of health in the boutique market businesses for us which are the bulk of our business if you take those pieces and put them together. The actual trading volume itself is certainly if you are a buy-side or sell-side client, affect your revenue and the levels of investments and depending on where your share is in that process can affect the ultimate staffing, but at this point we certainly see signs of health in our core user classes. Joe Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott : Okay. Then just finally the comfort that buy-side seems to have in hiring is that driven by you think the preservation of AUMs? In other words, the fact that the assets have remained and the markets remained at a highest level or would you think is driving that comfort level? Phil Hadley : Clearly, their revenues are driven by AUM and when the market is healthy it goes directly to the revenues, but I think that the last cycle was one where we definitely saw much lower return to investing in their businesses than we had in prior cycles. I think it's one of those where the cycle it happened, so quickly that people were just way more cautious than they have been in the past, but we definitely feel like the clients are in a healthier place than they were a year ago and definitely one or two years ago. Joe Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. Peter Heckmann from Avondale Partners. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed. Peter Heckmann - Avondale Partners : Good morning. Just a couple follow-up questions, could you quantify if any are you seeing any benefit on the expense line from currency? I know you hedged a good portion of your exposure there, but is that something that you can quantify for us this quarter and maybe last quarter? Peter Walsh : Peter, it's Peter Walsh. Directionally as you know, almost all of our revenues are billed in U.S. dollars, so our currency exposure relates to 100% for us on our expense side which really relates to people cost. Just to give you directionally understanding of what the current impact for us is really negative or adversely impact us in Q3 in terms of expense, just primarily related to the euro, which we are not hedged and pound as well. Peter Heckmann - Avondale Partners : Okay. All right. Then I know you have talked more about levying price increases more at annual renewal rather than once-a-year, but could you quantify any price increase that you levied on international customers in the quarter? Peter Walsh : Minimal price increase in the quarter is I think you accurately - you got it there. Peter, we have moved to this mode having the price happen in line with the clients' contracting. Peter Heckmann - Avondale Partners : Okay. Fair enough. That's all I have right now. Thanks much. Operator : Thank you. The question comes from Mr. Patrick O'Shaughnessy from Raymond James. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed. Patrick O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James : Good morning. Just to follow-up on that last question and something that was discussed on the call last quarter, so historically you guys have pushed through a pricing increase kind of earlier in the years both, in the U.S. and abroad, and now you have kind of switched to push into those price increases as contracts come up for renewals. I\u2019m curious -- does that reflect any reduction in pricing power that you guys feel in the current environment or is it just simply a function of it just makes more sense to address pricing when the contracts come up? Phil Hadley : Really, the latter. It just makes more sense. You are at - a logic point working with the client when they are thinking about how much - the service they are having, what the configuration is and it's a very logical conversation to have with the client at that point. Patrick O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James : All right. Got you. Then my follow-up, as the pace of European revenue growth seems to be outpacing the U.S. a little bit, would you expect any sort of impact on your weighted average tax rate going forward? Mike Frankenfield : I think you know it would be immaterial. When you look at the way the after tax rate in the short-term over a longer period of time, we really see the opportunity outside the U.S. as being at least the same size in the U.S., so perhaps over a longer period of time, we have the opportunity for the weighted average tax rate to decline at that - that trend really accelerated in a material way. Patrick O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. Tim McHugh from William Blair & Co. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed. Tim McHugh - William Blair & Co.: Yes. Thank you. First I just wanted to just ask, following up on the questions about QUICK earlier. Could you help us to understand how much of Asia right now is your business in Japan? I am trying to understand how much of an expansion this could be for you as we cite kind of that opportunity? Mike Frankenfield : I think Asia is less than 10%. Japan would be third of Asia, so - I am winging it a little bit, but I think that's the magnitude you would be talking about. Tim McHugh - William Blair & Co.: Okay. Can you talk the international growth rate picking up? I guess, how much of that - are you doing anything different in Europe and Asia right now versus do you think you are benefiting from improving economic environments and stock market activity in Europe and Australia, I guess, to some extent? Peter Walsh : Yes. I think, our effort in product have seen steady improvement over time, and I think we are now in a mode where we are getting perhaps a little bit of a tailwind or at least the headwinds or are abating, we saw good growth out of continental Europe this quarter, which has been a change from previous quarters. Australia happens to be one of our stronger markets and has performed well historically for last two quarters and was maybe a little bit softer this quarter, so it's a mixed bag of things but the overall theme is reduced headwinds and possibly tailwind emerging. Tim McHugh - William Blair & Co.: Okay. Then lastly, can you just elaborate, you made a comment towards the end of your prepared remarks about feeling a little bit more optimistic about the sell-side environment. I guess, someone answer earlier about trading bonus being tough. I guess, can you give any more specifics on what you are seeing or you are hearing from the sales force that gives you more optimism on that side of the business? Phil Hadley : I think, the two big workflows we have in the sell-side clients would be equity research and investment banking. On a numbers basis and our revenues basis, investment banking is much bigger for us than equity research, almost 3 :1. I think, that certainly feels like the macro environment, when it comes to investment banking and deal volume both, mid-market and large firms is certainly on a positive trend. You are probably very familiar with the equity research model, but the only thing that surprises me is our coverage has gone from a couple analysts to a dozen, so there must be something that's exciting in the equity research model. I think if you take both of those together and weight it very heavily to the investment banking on a user count basis, I think that's why we feel optimism. Tim McHugh - William Blair & Co.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The last question is from Mr. Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel: I just want to sneak in one more question just on the pricing side. As you guys have switched the pricing discussion to being concurrent with renewing the contracts, has that changed your ability to get any pricing from the clients? Usually that's the time when a vendor has the least amount of leverage and they are trying to renew the contract, so I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of color on that. Phil Hadley : Shlomo, today that hasn't had the negative impact. I will, for clarification purposes, there are still a segment of the client base that receives a price increase in January, not every client has moved over to the new model, but we have worked with our part with our clients in a partnership and when we walk into a client on a regular basis, we are providing them with training and project work and demonstrating new software updates. What we can do at the end of every year is, highlight for the client all the great value that we have added and demonstrate all the improvements we have made to the product and it's a very, very straightforward conversation. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel: Great. That's all I wanted. Peter Walsh : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. At this time, there are no questions in the queue. Peter Walsh : Thank you and enjoy your summers. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

(Operator Instructions) Now, I'll hand the call over to Ms. Rachel Stern, Senior Vice President, Strategic Resources and General Counsel. Ma'am, please go ahead. Rachel Stern : Thank you, operator. Good morning and thanks to all of you for participating today. Welcome to FactSet's Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Phil Hadley, Chairman and CEO; Phil Snow, President; Peter Walsh, Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Frankenfield, Director of Global Sales. This conference call is being transcribed in real-time by FactSet's CallStreet service and is being broadcast live via the Internet at www.factset.com. A replay of this call will also be available on our website. Our call will contain forward-looking statements reflecting management's expectations based on currently available information. Actual results may differ materially. More information about factors that could affect FactSet's business and financial results can be found in FactSet's filings with the SEC. Annual subscription value or ASV is a key metric for FactSet. Please recall that ASV is a snapshot view of client subscription and represents our forward-looking revenues for the next 12 months. Lastly, FactSet undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. I would like to turn the discussion over now to Peter Walsh, Chief Operating Officer. At the end of his remarks, we will have time for questions. Please limit your remarks to only one question and one follow-up, so that we will have enough time to address questions effectively. Peter Walsh :  Thank you, Rachel, and good morning everyone. Here's our agenda for this call. First, I'll provide color on Q4 results. Second, I will provide guidance for Q1 including how to factor the R&D tax credit into future earnings. Third, we will end with your questions. So let's begin with fourth quarter results. Following on our positive results from last quarter, FactSet had a solid fourth quarter. Our ASV growth rate accelerated. Operating margins rose sequentially. Adjusted EPS grew by double digits. And all our key metrics including client and user counts were up.  ASV increased $31.6 million to $964 million at August 31st. The ASV growth rate on an organic basis accelerated to 7.3% over the past 12 months. Buy-side accounted for 82.6% of our ASV this quarter while the remaining 17.4% of the ASV was derived from our sell-side clients. Organic ASV growth rates from buy and sell-side clients rose to 8.5% and 1.6% respectively.  Please note that our buy-side business includes traditional asset management clients, hedge funds, wealth managers, off platform data feed business, and market metrics. The sell-side part of our business targets M&A advisory, capital markets and equity research professionals. Adjusted EPS rose this quarter to $1.31, an increase of 11% compared to the same period last year. We are so proud to mark our 17th consecutive quarter of double digit EPS growth.  In Q4, free cash flow generation was $65 million compared to $71 million in the year ago quarter. Free cash flow over the last 12 months was $247 million, down 2%. We define free cash flow as cash generated from operations less capital spending. The decrease in free cash flow was driven by a rise in accounts receivable and stock option exercises in the prior year. In the just completed fourth quarter, our DSOs were 34 days, flat from Q3 but up from a record low of 30 days a year ago. Higher level of option exercises in 2013 reduced our tax payments thus improving prior year working capital. At the end of this quarter, our cash and investment balance was $136 million, up $2 million from Q3. We repurchased 620,000 shares this quarter for a total of $75 million. We still have $87 million authorized for future share repurchases. When capital allocated to share repurchases, is aggregated with dividends paid, we returned $341 million to shareholders over the past 12 months. Common shares outstanding were 41.8 million at the end of the fiscal year.  Now let's turn to our P&L. In the fourth quarter, revenues rose to $239 million, a 9% increase over last year. Organic revenues grew 7% over last year, excluding $3.7 million in revenues from acquisitions completed in the last 12 months. Q4 operating income grew to $79 million compared to $71 million in the same period last year. Adjusted operating income for the quarter increased 8% over last year. In fiscal 2013, adjusted operating income includes a non-cash pretax charge of $2.6 million for stock based compensation primarily related to the vesting of performance based options.  Adjusted net income also grew 7% this quarter to $55 million and adjusted diluted EPS grew 11% to $1.31. Please note that the increase in our average share price during Q4 increased weighted average shares outstanding and reduced EPS by a penny. U.S. revenues in the fourth quarter grew to $161 million, up 6.5% organically over the fourth quarter last year. Non-U.S. revenues increased to $77 million. The international growth rate was 7.3% excluding revenue acquired from the Matrix acquisition and the impact of foreign currency. Fourth quarter revenues from our Europe and Asia-Pacific regions were $59 million and $18 million respectively. Excluding foreign currency effects and the Matrix acquisition, year-over-year growth rates were 6% in Europe and 12% in Asia-Pacific.  As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, the company's performance in the fourth quarter was a positive across all our metrics. Please allow me to provide some detail on the drivers of our growth. The client count expanded by 81 compared to 60 in the same quarter last year. We added more clients this fourth quarter on a net basis than we\u2019ve had in the last nine years. This strong performance on new client acquisitions follows our solid Q3 growth as well. Total client count rose to 2,743 at quarter end. Looking back on the year as a whole, we added 200 net new clients in 2014, an 85% increase over the number of net adds in 2013. We view this as important because new clients typically come on with moderate deployments and often experience substantial growth in subsequent years. Our annual client retention rate was greater than 95% of ASV and rose to 93% in terms of the number of actual client, up from 92% last year. This quarter our net user count at FactSet terminals rose by 2,100 compared to 1,400 in the year ago quarter. This user count growth is the largest quarterly increase in three years. Users totaled 54,600 at quarter end. The fourth quarter typically includes new users on both the buy and sell-side as our largest clients usher in their new hire classes. This quarter we saw higher than expected new hire classes at our banking clients, coupled with fewer cancellations. While maybe too early to say that our banking clients have turned a positive corner, we were encouraged by the performance we saw on that side of our business in Q4. Improvements in the ITO and M&A market places have been a boost for our banking clients this year. Wealth management continues to be a growing part of our sales effort. We've been gratified to see that wealth management clients who selects FactSet workstation are also frequently interested in buying FactSet tools that do not come with the standard packages we offer, including some wealth clients buying applications in our portfolio analytics suite of products which leads to my next point. The portfolio of analytics suite of products remains a solid cornerstone of FactSet sales in the buy-side space. Our clients have increasingly demanded tools to help them with multi-asset class risk modeling, attribution and reporting related to equity and fixed income portfolios, which are the key elements of our portfolio analytics offering.  I'd also like to point out that we have had success marketing workstations to those focused on credit analysis. Our suite of reports covering debt and liquidity analysis has improved over several years and is relevant to users investing in both equities and corporate debt. We've also experienced expanded sales of our proprietary content. We've noticed strong demand for our Street account product and have focused more attention internally on ways to sell FactSet fundamentals, FactSet estimates to our ownership transcript and entity mapping data.  Now let's take a look on the expense side. The Q4 operating expenses were $159 million, and our operating margin this quarter was 33.3%, which is 50 basis points higher than Q3. Cost of services in Q4 expressed as a percentage of revenues increased 220 basis points compared to the year ago period due to incremental cost from the Matrix and Revere acquisitions and higher compensation expense from additional headcount in our consulting and engineering teams, partially offset by prior year stock based compensation charge from the vesting of performance based options.  Expressed as a percentage of revenue, SG&A expenses decreased by 330 basis points in Q4 compared to the year ago period due to lower compensation expense from employees performing SG&A roles including a prior year stock based compensation charge. At the end of our fiscal year, we had over 6,600 employees, an increase of 6% in global headcount since last year. In Q4, we increased headcount by 267 employees as expected since the fourth quarter as when our new consulting, engineering, product development and content collection classes begin.  Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 30.4%, flat with last quarter and up 150 basis points from last year because of the expiration in the Federal R&D tax credit.  Now let's turn to our guidance for the fourth quarter -- for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. We expect that our revenues will range between $240 million and $243 million. Our operating margin is expected to range between 32.8% and 33.8%. This range is 30 basis points higher than the margin guidance provided on our last call. The annual effective tax rate should range between 31% and 32%. This range also takes into account the expired Federal R&D tax credit and assumes it will not re-enacted before November 30, 2014.  We expect that diluted EPS will range between $1.31 and $1.33. This estimate accounts for the expired R&D tax credit which has the effect of lowering each end of the range by $0.02 compared to the just completed fourth quarter. The mid point of the range suggests 12% year-over-year growth after adjusting for the expiration of the R&D tax credit. Please note that the R&D tax credit has expired only once in its 33 year history without being retroactively re-enacted to previous years. Should the R&D tax credit be re-enacted on or before November 30, 2014, diluted EPS would range between $1.36 and $1.38 and FactSet would also recognize a benefit of $0.13 per share if the credit is retroactively applied to previous periods. Looking back on fiscal 2014, we are proud of a number of accomplishments. Our metrics accelerated in the second half of the year and were positive across the board. The fiscal year ASV was up 7.3% organically to $964 million. EPS grew by 11%. Return on equity was 40% increasing our three year average return to 37%. Clients and users reached record highs including Q4. $340 million was return to shareholders. We continue to reinvest in our business in terms of hiring new employees to fuel our growth.  We had a strong year and we believe that we are well positioned for growth in the coming year. We've been successful in expanding our market share against both internal client built systems and competitor products. From where we sit the global markets appeared to be getting stronger. So we are happy for that means for our clients. We worked hard this past year to get where we are. We are excited about the work ahead in 2015.  Thank you. We are now ready for your questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Your line is now open. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel: Hi, good morning and thank you very much for taking my questions. Phil, Peter, maybe could address the growth is accelerating, can you talk a little bit more about whether you think more of the growth is starting to come from hiring in the end markets or do you think you are being more successful in displacements or if you think it's a combination of both, where is the weight - where is it more heavily weighted? Phil Hadley : It's -- would be really difficult for us to know the exact answer to that but I think the answer we feel internally is both, when we\u2019re looking at the win losses for client this year, this last past quarter, we definitely won more clients and also didn't lose as many clients. I think we felt the same way when it came to seats and the number of users we had and the client base. So all-in-all it was just a very strong, broad based quarter for ASV growth. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel: Okay. And can you talk a little bit more about the composition of some of the new client - your clients and users are comprised of fair amount of [inaudible] shops, hedge funds -- how much is the wealth management becoming more of a factor if it is not -- so maybe a qualitative if not quantitative. Phil Hadley : I'll let Phil Snow answer this one. Phil Snow : Hi, Shlomo, it's Phil Snow. So we saw a very healthy mix of new client wins this quarter across traditional asset management, hedge funds, wealth, broker dealers as well as some other types of funds that we sell to. The qualities of wins are very high, so these weren\u2019t just new firms getting created. These were firms that we - where we took relative market share away from our competitors. And what's really great about getting new clients like there is so many of them. Is it really lays down the foundation for us to cross-sell our products across the existing users and new groups and departments within those as well. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel: Okay. So do you think it's basically broad based, it is not one thing that sticks out more than another? Phil Snow : Right, yes, it was broad based. We did well in every client category. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel:   Okay, very good. Is this -- if you allow to me squeeze in one more, I know you only wanted two, but how long will Matrix continue to be pointed out as a drag on margins? Phil Hadley : I think the only -- we didn't point out it as a drag on margins, Shlomo. We just pointed out in terms of organic ASV growth rate. As soon as we\u2019ve owned it for a year we will stop pointing out in terms of organic ASV growth rate. Operator : Thank you. Next from Peter Appert of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray : Thanks, good morning. So if I got these numbers right, I think at the mid point of the revenue guidance range it would imply something like an 8.3% growth for the first quarter and this is a little bit nitpicky but that will be down a fraction from what you did in the fourth quarter. So, does that suggest you are seeing anything in terms of password growth that would make you little more cautious near term? Phil Hadley : Are you talking ASV or future -- Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray : Revenue guidance Phil Hadley : We have organic. Organic can't be guided down. We\u2019ll have to check some numbers, Peter will make sure we have it. But organic wouldn't be -- the guidance wouldn't show organic [deceleration] [ph]. Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray :   Okay, so nothing to -- in terms of expectations for password I guess this is really the question. Would your expectations be that we should continue to see some positive momentum over the next couple of quarters in terms of the password growth rates? Phil Hadley : So, I mean I would say the way that I have answered the question and the way we would continue to answer is we definitely see our end markets firming and our relative market position improving as well. So all of our metrics, the ASV seats and clients would generally be headed in the right direction. First quarter sometime is a clean-up quarter for the big sell-side clients. So seats could be, I don't really know -- I honestly don't know, I haven't seen a forecast for the first quarter but it wouldn't be material in the ASV side. Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray : Got it. And you guys have held SG&A cost basically flattish here for the last couple of years. Is there ability to continue to control those cost? Should we expect some maybe some catch up in terms of SG&A cost growth on a near-term basis? Phil Hadley : GAAP accounting has SG&A, and internally we\u2019re 100% operating margin so I couldn't answer that question. Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray : One last thing then, the tax rate, even excluding the R&D credit, I think the implied tax rate is up maybe 100 basis points year-to-year, anything specific driving that? Peter Walsh : If you excluded R&D I think our tax rate would be flat on a year-over-year basis. Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray :   I was actually looking at, I am sorry, Peter, it was -- the guidance for last quarter ex the tax credit was like 30 to 31 and now it's 31 to 32 I think. Peter Walsh : In the just completed fiscal year we were eligible for the tax credit for four months out of the 12 and so relative -- our effective tax rate is increasing or projected to increase in the next quarter relative to the just completed fiscal year because it would be expired for the entire year in fiscal 2015. Operator : Thank you. Next from Alex Kramm of UBS. Your line is now open. Alex Kramm - UBS: Hey, good morning. Maybe just on the competitive dynamics, maybe little bit of an update here. Are you seeing more players I guess getting to the end line when it comes to negotiating for new I guess -- for new accounts and things like that or are you winning the same amount that you used before or has anything changed in terms of wins versus losses and new competitors entering the market particularly on the buy-side? Mike Frankenfield : Hey Alex, it\u2019s Mike Frankenfield. As we\u2019ve said in previous quarters, the competitive dynamic changes slowly quarter-to-quarter, even year-to-year. I think when we look at the wins that we are having as Phil or maybe Peter highlighted earlier, we compete not only against external competitors all the big names that you know, but a lot of the times we are competing against in-house systems. And I would say our execution on both of those fronts is very strong. We are doing well in the market place because our software development team continues to improve our product to add enhancement that our clients care about. And our sales force is very focused on new names and same store sales generation and they are executing well. Alex Kramm - UBS: Okay, great. And then just kind of clean up question here on FX. We've seen some major FX changes here recently. Can you just remind us how does it impact you, I think, from a revenue perspective, it is mostly dollar, maybe a little bit of pound which hasn't really moved and then the euro decline that could actually help you on the cost side. Is that right or how should we think about it? Peter Walsh : Hi, Alex. This is Peter. From an FX perspective, roughly 98% of our revenues are billed in U.S. dollar. We do have some substantial expenses that we pay in both pounds, euros and also have big operations in Hyderabad and the Philippines. We from time to time hedge some of those expense exposures. Currently, we are un-hedged on both the pound and euro. Operator : Thank you. Next from Manav Patnaik, Barclays. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is actually Greg calling on for Manav. First off I was hoping to get some granularity within the sell-side growth that you\u2019ve seen between kind of the mid market and boutique banks versus what you are seeing from the bulge banks, and then also whether most of that growth is coming from probably banking versus equity research. Phil Snow : Hi, it's Phil Snow again. So I think we\u2019ve said for a few quarters now that we've seen good activity at the middle tier firms. This quarter we definitely saw positive uptick in a number of workstations that we were catering on the bigger firms. Now I\u2019ll let Mike answer the question about corporate finance versus equity research. Mike Frankenfield : Continue to make good progress in both of those areas. Our product adds significant value to the financial modeling process that occurs in both of those firms or both of those firm types. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thank you. And then I wanted to ask about your strategy around selling to large corporations which one of your competitors has noted as an area of focus. Maybe you can give some color on the opportunity there and how you are positioned? Phil Hadley : Hi, it's Phil Hadley. We historically approach the corporate market via our partners. And we have several partners that sell into that market. And it's been our historic strategy primarily to allow us to focus on the financial professionals in the institutional market buy and sell-side. It's worked very well for us. So we have substantial revenue coming from that opportunity. And we continue to decide whether it's something we want actually put our direct sales force on, but at this point it's not something that is the best next opportunity for us. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And one more if I can squeeze it in on your strategy around chat function especially with the recent noise around new competitors like Babble and Wicker, maybe just what your thought process around integrating some of these new chat functions and then general your strategy there? Mike Frankenfield :  This is Mike Frankenfield. We have a messaging product. It's doing well in the market place. We have a 10% open platform or willing and have federated with other chat program. Our main objective is to develop products and chat is no different that facilitate work flow within our clients. So, common use application is buy-side portfolio manager wanting to talk to the buy-side trader in the firm. Both users having a FactSet and been able to communicate over the FactSet platform is a way for them to gain efficiencies and improve communications. Operator : Thank you. Next from Joe Foresi of Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is now open. Joe Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott : Hi, I was wondering if you could help us understand the step up in the business. How much of this do you think is attributable to -- I know you mentioned at the ITO market and M&A and how much do you think is sustainable? In another words, do you think that this is a full step up or do you think if those two factors start to moderate or you might see some moderation in user activity? Phil Hadley : Actually I think the capital market activity helps us our buy and sell-side client base particularly corporate finance. The equity research department and buy-side certainly is far more correlated to the overall equity -- health of the equity market. So certainly that helps us. But as a percentage of our total business and how much of it actually creates data on the sell-side corporate finance be certainly helpful. But I also feel like we are gaining on a share value part of the profit, the product team has done an outstanding job continue here reinvest in our product. And I think our competitive position is continued to expand both in content and in work flow on our platform. Joe Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott :   Got it. And then I wondered if you could just talk quickly about pricing. Do you think that pricing power is increasing as we head into this uptick in the cycle or do you think it's stayed about the same and we are not that inflection point yet? Phil Hadley : Price has not been a tool that FactSet has used as a form of growth. We have taken modest inflationary price over the last several years. Certainly if my comments are true and we feel our relative competitive position is there, the price will potentially be available to it. But quite frankly I would rather gain share and expand our opportunity as opposed to using price as a mechanism for growth Operator : Thank you. Next from Tim McHugh of William Blair & Co. Your line is now open. Tim McHugh - William Blair & Co.: Thanks. I guess just on the improvement in the sell-side. You talked about M&A environment. I guess can you give us a perspective how much is kind of M&A advisory or investment banks versus the research side of the equation? Have you seen any change in I guess the equity research and sell-side equity, research side of the equation or should we think of mostly the pick up coming from the M&A advisory? Phil Hadley : I am sure the answer is both. If you are just taking market opportunity in headcount, the corporate finance department typical firm and I pick a round number probably three times the headcount of an equity research department just in round term. We do have opportunities also in sales and trading which would be entirely separate workflow that has been successful for us. I think we feel like the opportunity is still expanding for us. Tim McHugh - William Blair & Co.: Is that three to one roughly an approximation we can think of for your split of business today? Or are you -- Phil Hadley : I think that's our split and what we think the market place looks like inside of a typical big sell-side firm, to somebody disagree round enough to get-- Phil Snow : Certainly works for me. It's a little bit hard for us to disentangle it because so many of either enterprise deal, where we are selling to the organization and that organization has the ability to then deploy within research, within banking M&A credit, sales trading etcetera. So we view that entire segment is a very attractive segment. I mean every firms are built differently. It certainly have some firms that are more research focused versus than corporate finance focused. We certainly have firms that were boutiques who are 100% corporate finance no research. I would just kind of picking that as -- if we took the Top 10 big firms that historically isn't just what I would pick as a round number mix between that just a headcount available for selling a product like ours. Tim McHugh - William Blair & Co.: Okay and then in the wealth management space, can you maybe -- who is the biggest competitor you are seeing out there? I guess both from an installed competitor and then people trying to compete for new engagement out there? Phil Snow : On the wealth side is -- each one of the big competitors has been operating in the wealth space. As we do whenever we try to enter a new market, we are trying to come up with unique functionality. We do some unique things with wealth manager portfolio. No surprise is direct extension of our portfolio analytics functionality that is so powerful for our traditional, institutional asset management client. So lots of the opportunities that we are identifying are greenfield opportunities. And certainly competition from the likes of Thompson etcetera. Tim McHugh - William Blair & Co.: Is the growth then -- you are saying green -- I guess would you attribute the growth in wealth management to more greenfield or displacement? Phil Snow : The combination of both. When you are talking about going into a workshop we have two potential solutions offer. We can offer broad based desktop deployment and that is typically a displacement situation. But there are areas within the wealth teams that have a need for all of these high powered analytics that FactSet delivers and they may have a very large spend on a few users. So it is the mix of both exploiting competitors as well as selling our traditional powerful analytics to well firms that as they become more sophisticated need the powerful tool. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I noticed that your hiring slowed a little bit this quarter to about 6% year-over-year. Should we read anything into that given that you have mentioned in the past that you tend to increase your headcount in line with your expected revenue growth rate? Peter Walsh : Hi, Toni. It's Peter. How are you? I don't think there is anything to really read into that percentage term. Headcount does have in flow from time to time. We were very excited with the acceleration in the second half sometimes headcount process needs to get adjusted. And there is a cycle of time to increase your headcount. So we are constantly looking at that making sure that we have the right go forward investment to accelerate growth. Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley : Okay, great. And one last one. If ASV continues to accelerate, would you start to invest more or could we see some margin expansion in 2015? Thanks. Phil Hadley : Hi, Tony. It's Phil. We certainly plan for flat margins and we probably continue to reinvest in the headcount that Peter was talking about to improve our competitive position in the market place. Operator : Thank you. Next from Bill Warmington of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Bill Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities : Good morning, everyone. It is nice to see the sell-side contributing something there. Phil Hadley : We are certainly happy about it. Bill Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities : So question for you on the data feed business. Just to ask whether that's been contributing to the growth as well and maybe give us a sense for how big that is. Phil Hadley : I don't think we break that out. But I think we had a very good fourth quarter in our feed business. So we delivered to clients both raw data feed as a content we collect as well as some good derived data that we might massage out of that based on the clients' need. So we can touch a lot of different parts of the organization there. We can touch performance systems; we can touch the quantitative work flows which can compliance, if a client is building a portal with all kinds of interesting ways the clients want to use our data. Bill Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities : Then on the capital allocation side. Just needed to ask your thoughts heading into 2015 in terms of M&A versus share repurchases? Peter Walsh : Hi, Bill. It's Peter. I think you really touch on our high quality problem for us. Bill Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities : Yes. Peter Walsh : So thank you for that. Over -- I guess over the last 12 months we've generated free cash flow of just under $250 million and we have $136 million of cash on the balance sheet. So we feel like we have quite a bit of gun powder for capital allocation whether it's M&A or share repurchase and dividends. We've been more aggressive in repurchases because over the last 12 months just because it's just correlates with the amount of our M&A activity, so our M&A -- a process is very healthy, we are constantly out in the market place and we are often because of our position to really allocate capital aggressively, we often get calls from bankers for different opportunity so I think it will continue to --it would be reverse correlation between M&A and share repurchase because they are quite accretive given the interest rates are near zero. Bill Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities : And then one more if I may. Just wanted to ask about the -- on the acquisitions that you guys have been doing over the last couple of years. Just wanted to ask whether they have been contributing to the client count and user addition either directly or indirectly? Phil Hadley : I am just trying to think of the last couple being Matrix, Revere, Street account; we would have given you the initial headcount or the initial client count change which wasn't that material. I am recalling maybe 30 or 40 but not a big number. But then going forward because there is so much overlap in our businesses and that's part of the reason they make the strategic cut in an acquisition level, very little impact on the overall client count. And then just to be clear, our client count threshold for counting client is 24,000 U.S. so we have a huge list of clients who don't make that cut and some of those products, it blow that price point. But just to keep our metrics clean and people focused on the core of our client base we've chosen to have that be threshold. Operator : Thank you. Next from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. Keith Housum - Northcoast Research : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Just come back to your question regarding data feed in the non subscription business. Can you remind me, is that business more of recurring revenue stream or is that usually that go one time revenue opportunity for you? Phil Hadley : It's a 100% recurring revenue subscription business for us. Keith Housum - Northcoast Research : Got it. And then just in terms of business for the quarter, was it pretty evenly weighted throughout the quarter or did it seem to get better as the quarter went on?. Phil Hadley : I wouldn't -- we typically don't dissect ASV growth by month within a quarter. So I think I would say-- I would leave it with -- it was a very strong quarter throughout. Operator : Thank you. Next from Peter Heckmann of Avondale Partners Peter. Your line is now open. Peter Heckmann - Avondale Partners : Good morning, everyone. Just a follow up question on some of the acquisitions and as they are growing to the organic growth rate. Would you say that Street account continues to grow at a rate in excess of the overall company and if so would you characterize that growth is coming internationally? Phil Hadley : Peter, as it was mentioned we are certainly very happy with Street account and what it's -- the value is deliver to our client. We won't breakout the future ASV and typically won't on any acquisitions as we go forward. Part of it because we can't. It becomes part of the product and part of the core terminal and you really don't have a direct number any more. But we are certainly pleased with the acquisition. Peter Heckmann - Avondale Partners : Okay. And then can you comment on standalone Street account those outside of the platform. It seems like there are some other competitors that are coming out with a more aggressive price point and maybe been able to mimic or copy to develop speed and maybe not quite the content level but seems like getting there and so would you say that within Street account that the service itself is stronger within the FactSet user or do you still see a strong growth in the base of user independent of the platform? Phil Hadley : So always competitors in the market place, we feel very strongly that we've got the best parts in market place and haven't seen any competitive inroads into the work flow to Street account. Peter Heckmann - Avondale Partners : Okay, that's great. And then as regard the other acquisition, since the acquisition any material growth in ASV? Should we assume that the ASV growth there has near the rest of the company or with the two acquisitions I would assume certainly there is a smaller would be growing at a rate faster than the overall company? Phil Hadley : None of the acquisitions are material relative to the company. We just haven't bought anything big enough revenue stream to make any impact that is material at the company level. Operator : Thank you. Next from Dan Dolev from Jefferies & Co Your line is now open. Dan Dolev - Jefferies & Co: Hey, thanks for taking my question. It looks like if I look at it correctly, looks like Europe organic growth decelerated a little bit. Can you maybe talk about the trends there? Mike Frankenfield : Hi, Dan, it's Mike Frankenfield. Europe actually did quite well in Q3. I think which are seen as a little bit of ASV that was pulled into that quarter from Q4. Certainly the macro environment is not strong in Europe as in the United States. But having said that we are still very optimistic about our prospectus in UK, in Europe and the rest of international. So I don't read too much into this quarter. Dan Dolev - Jefferies & Co: Okay. And then one more question. Sort of following on Toni's question. Historically when we looked at when revenues were growing in line with employment growth, you are able to expand OpEx that you are modeling, if I look at correctly at the mid point OpEx growing roughly in line with revenues. Is there any chance at some point that we could get to that historical performance where revenue growing little bit ahead of employment and OpEx expanding. I mean margin expanding, sorry about that. Phil Hadley : No. Everyone from our margin expanding because we can't send the money fast enough that would be good problem to have. But we got so many great product ideas that I think that we will continue to invest in business as we go forward. Dan Dolev - Jefferies & Co: That more of a structural thing. You don't see yourself going back to that 2001 to 2005 period where -- Phil Hadley :  I don't really think our margin expanding contraction -- contracting the question was asked earlier about metrics being dilutive to margin. We have a very high class problem -- there are very few businesses out there that would actually be accretive to our margin so almost everything we buy is get lower margin than we do. And therefore it ultimately dilutive to margins. I kind of look at really at the EPS level. So, our goal is to drive EPS that's something greater than the organic revenue growth. And as you can see from history, we've been pretty successful at that. Operator : Thank you. Next from Andre Benjamin of Goldman Sachs Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs : Thank you, good morning. My first question with regards to Asia and Europe versus the U.S. Is there anything else that you recall out beside the macros as things that are driving the trends in that business either at the U.S. clients asking for different things in different parts of the world? That will be helpful. Mike Frankenfield : Andre, it's Mike. Certainly when we move into markets in Asia, markets in Europe there are always demand for local content. And FactSet looks ate each market opportunity and we assess having an investment we can make in local content. And in terms of the general functionality in the product, there is a lot of commonality around the globe in terms of what users want from software functionality, how they want their work flow improve. So we feel we just had a great platform that we can leverage around the world. And meet the needs of users everywhere. Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs : Apologize if this question was answered, but in terms of thinking through say non desktop solutions, are there any logical areas that you would like to call out in terms of whether it's data feed or pushing into regulatory compliance or any other thing that you would think of that makes natural sense organically? Phil Hadley : I think we are doing a great job of addressing the goal of pushing out our functionality and content across multi platforms. So whether it's the traditional FactSet desktop, mobile, data feed. We are here and ready to meet the needs of our clients and give them our high quality data and analytics anyway they want to consume. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'll hand the call back to the speakers. Peter Walsh : Thank you very much. See you next quarter. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Joining me today are Phil Hadley, Chairman and CEO; Phil Snow, President; Peter Walsh, Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Frankenfield, Director of Global Sales. This conference call is being transcribed in real-time by FactSet's CallStreet Service and is being broadcast live via the Internet at factset.com. A replay of this call will also be available on our website. Our call will contain forward-looking statements reflecting management's expectations based on currently available information. Actual results may differ materially. More information about factors that could affect FactSet's business and financial results can be found in FactSet's filings with the SEC. Annual subscription value or ASV is a key metric for FactSet. Please recall that ASV is a snapshot view of client subscription and represents our forward-looking revenues for the next 12 months. Lastly, FactSet undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. I would like to turn the discussion over now to Peter Walsh, Chief Operating Officer. At the end of his remarks, we will have time for questions. Please limit your remarks to only one question and one follow-up, so that we will have enough time to address questions effectively. Peter Walsh : Thank you, Rachel, and good morning everyone. Here's our agenda for this call. First, I'll provide color on Q1 results. Second, I will provide guidance for Q2. Third, we will end with your questions. So let's begin with first quarter results. FactSet continue to accelerate its growth in the first quarter. Our key metrics were up including our ASV growth rate, EPS, free cash flow and our client and user accounts. This quarter, the organic ASV growth rate accelerated to 8.5%. Excluding FX, ASV rose $9.2 million and was $970 million at quarter end. We are pleased that the ASV growth rate has been on an upward trend every quarter over the last year rising 350 basis points since November 2013. Drivers of this improvement have been broad-based as the organic growth rates from our buy and sell-side businesses improve to 8.9% and 6.7% respectively. Buy-side clients accounted for 82.5% of ASV and sell-side firms accounted for the remaining 17.5%, Our buy-side businesses include traditional asset management clients, hedge funds and wealth managers, off platform data feed sales in the market metrics business. The sell-side targets only M&A advisory, capital markets and equity research professionals. Our growth was both top and bottom line oriented. In Q1, adjusted EPS grew 11.9% to a $1.32. This quarter marks our 18th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth. Let's now turn to free cash flow. We define free cash flow as cash generating from operations less capital spending. Over the last three months we generated $66 million in free cash, an increase in 26% over the same period last year. Free cash flows increased due to higher levels of net income, an improvement in our age receivables and lower taxes paid during the quarter. Our DSOs were 33 days at the end of the first quarter compared to 34 days three months ago. Our cash and investment balance was a $140 million up $4 million during the quarter. This quarter we spent $48 million on share repurchases. At the regular quarterly meeting yesterday, are Board of Directors authorized the addition of $300 million to our share repurchase program. Today $339 million is available for future share repurchases. We also paid regularly quarterly dividend of $60 million. When aggregating regularly quarterly dividend paid and shares repurchased over the past 12 months, we have returned $332 millions to shareholders. Common shares outstanding were $41.6 million at the end of the quarter. Now let's turn to our P&L. Revenues grew in the first quarter to $243 million, an increase of 9% over last year. Organic revenue grew 8% over last year, which excludes $2.5 million in revenue from the acquisition of Matrix that was completed within the last 12 months. Our operating income this quarter grew to $80 million, an increase over $75 million posted over the first quarter last year. Net income grew 7% to $56 million, and adjusted diluted EPS grew 11.9% to a $1.32. This quarter U.S. revenues rose to $164 million up 7% compared to the first quarter of a year ago. Non U.S. revenues increased to $79 million. Revenues from our Europe and Asia Pacific regions for the first quarter were $61 million and $18 million respectively. Excluding foreign currency and acquired revenues from Matrix, the international growth rate was strong at 9.8%. This growth rate breaks down into 8.2% from Europe and 15.2% from Asia Pacific respectively. Let's now go through key contributors for our positive growth this quarter. Our annual client retention rate in terms of the number of actual clients increased to 93% up from 92% a year ago. In addition, our client retention rate, when expressed as a percentage of ASC continues to be greater than 95%. Our strong retention record is showing up in our user count. Net user count, of FactSet terminals increased this quarter by nearly a 1,000 users, in total 55,600 at quarter end. The net user addition in Q1 is our highest since November 2007. Overall users are up 9% year-over-year. This is the best annual user growth rate in more than three years. The group came from both buy and sell-side clients. As discussed last quarter, we continue to see an uptick from our investment banking clients whose activities had previously languished over the past few years. From what we have seen M&A and capital market activities are on the rise. As a result, we've seen few cancellations and expected from our investment banking clients. The market environment for our buy-side clients also continues to be constructive as the majority of our user expansion in this quarter came from this segment. In Q1 we increased our net new client by 19 for a current total of 2,762. We're pleased with this expansion as the first quarter is typically not a popular time for new clients to sign on as the majority of firms are at the end of their fiscal year end and budgeting cycle. In general the positive ASV changes relate to strong performance in each of our three primary verticals, our U.S. investment management, international investment management and our global banking and brokerage teams. In the U.S. IM, we've seen sustain demand for our fixed income portfolio products, multi asset class risk and stress testing, attribution and publishing products. Our international IM team has seen strong performance in the Asia Pacific region driven by our portfolio analytics suite of products. We\u2019ve also seen continued growth from our wealth management work stations, which has fared successfully against some of our competitor's products on a number of occasions. Proprietary content also continues to be a strong product set for us as well as a -- point of entry for new clients looking for data feed. In addition to StreetAccount, clients also value our FactSet fundamentals, FactSet estimates, transcripts, take-over defense and entity mapping data. Now let's take a look at the expense side. Total operating expenses for the first quarter were $162 million, and our operating margin this quarter was 33.1%. First quarter cost of services expressed as a percentage of revenues increased by 290 basis points compared to the year ago period. The increase was driven by higher compensation and additional third party data cost. Employee compensation expense grew as we expanded headcount 8% year-over-year from new hires and from acquired employees in connection with the Matrix acquisition. A rise in third party data cost was driven by higher rates of client adoption of our risk suite and the use of certain benchmark families. SG&A expressed as a percentage of revenues decreased by 240 basis points in Q1 compared to the year ago period due to a decline in compensation and lower marketing and occupancy cost. At the end of our fiscal year, we had nearly 6,900 employees, an increase of 8% in global headcount. We hired 248 net new employees this quarter, primarily in our Hyderabad and Manila locations, which we primarily have content correction and engineering functions. The first quarter effective tax rate was 30.8%, up 30 basis points over the last year. The year ago effective tax rate includes an 80 basis points benefit from the U.S. Federal R&D tax credit. The U.S. R&D tax credit expired on December 1, 2013, and was not extended as of November 30, 2014, the end of FactSet's first quarter. Although a bill including the renewal of the R&D tax credit for calendar year 2014 has been approved by the U.S. House of Representatives, it has not been signed into law. Accordingly, FactSet did are not recognized any income tax benefits from the R&D tax credit during the just completed first quarter. The current impact of the R&D tax credit to FactSet is estimated to be $0.20 in EPS per year. Only once in its 33-year history has a tax credit not been retroactively reenacted. If FactSet is able to recognize the full value of the 2014 R&D tax credit in its Q2 effective tax rate, the annual $0.20 EPS benefit would break down into the $0.14 one-time benefit to EPS and a $0.02 increase in quarterly EPS in Q2 through Q4. Now let's turn to our guidance for Q2 of fiscal 2015. We expect that revenues will range between $244 million and $248 million. Operating margins should range between 32.8% and 33.8%. We expect our annual effective tax rate to range between 31% and 32%. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $1.35 and $1.37, the midpoint of this range suggests 12.4% year-over-year growth. In summary, Q1 was a strong start to our fiscal year. Our business expanded on many fronts and across all geographic regions. We are pleased with the 350 basis points acceleration in our ASV growth rate to 8.5%. Our user base is growing nicely at both buy and sell side clients. While our market share expense were continuing to invest aggressively in a forward market opportunity that we believe is many times our existing size. Our aim is not just to string a few quarters together, but rather to leverage our favorable position in the marketplace and execute at a high level through a longer term benefit of our shareholders. Thank you. We are now ready for your questions. Operator :  [Operator Instructions] We have our first question here coming from Manav, and he is from Barclays. Your line is now open, sir. Manav Patnaik :  Thank you. Good morning. The first question just on the R&D tax credit just to understand, so let\u2019s just say it does get signed into law today or in the coming week, how will you guys reflect that will -- like will you have a one-time benefit in the quarter, will you retroactively restate it? Just curious on how that would work? Peter Walsh :  It's Peter. Under your assumptions, if the R&D tax credit is reenacted just for 2014, in Q2 we would have a one-time benefit to EPS of $0.14 and our quarterly EPS in Q2 through Q4 would increase by $0.02 per share. Manav Patnaik : Okay. Got it. All right, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And just from an FX perspective, can you just help us understand, I know you guys do a lot of hedging, but in terms of your exposure and how we should think about FX impact either to revenue or margins or so forth? Peter Walsh : Certainly. I think in broad terms, I'm just rounding a little bit for the benefit fee. In expenses FactSet has in annual terms 200 million of expenses in currencies outside the U.S. dollar. Half of those are between Euros and pounds. And in revenues, we built 97% of our ASV in U.S. dollar. The other 3% is weighted to yen and pound sterling. So we\u2019re in a net expense position. The strength of the dollar does benefit our bottom line, but in addition what we\u2019re doing with it is we\u2019re going to reinvest back in the business and keep our margins flat. It certainly would encourage anyone to look at our public filings our Ks and Qs because we\u2019ll layout our foreign currency exposure by currency as well as watch hedge in very specific terms. Manav Patnaik : Okay. All right. And then lastly just from an industry perspective, there has been a lot of noise around chat services and I was just curious on how you guys -- I know you guys have launched one chat position -- chat platform. How you intend to either partner with those guys or compete against those guys any thoughts there would be appreciated? Phil Hadley :  I mean, as you mentioned, we have a successful chat service that many of our clients use. It saturates with AOL and many in the industry and we certainly have an open platform and we\u2019ll saturate with anyone. I think what you\u2019re referring to is a consortium that\u2019s been formed to create even a broader competing service with that area. I only see that as a positive in the industry as it creates chat in a more open form. Manav Patnaik : All right, fair enough. Thank you, guys. Operator :  Thank you. And our next question comes from Joe Foresi from Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is now open, sir. Joe Foresi : Hi. I wonder could you give us some color around the uptick on the sell side. What you think might be driving that and how sustainable it is? Mike Frankenfield :  Hey Joe, it's Mike Frankenfield. Overall we see solid fundamentals on the sell side of our business. If you break that into two pieces through the research side and the corporate finance M&A side things are relatively stable on the research side. From what we saw this year on the corporate and M&A side was much higher employment levels. In other words, the normal fall up that happens at the end of the year where analyst fleet was not as significant. And as a result we retained more users, the class hiring in those firms has been very robust. As you would imagine, most of the change in that is driven by really 10 firms and we\u2019re seeing solid hiring levels, solid deployment levels amongst our largest clients. Joe Foresi : Okay. And could you talk a little bit about pricing and when you go into -- maybe you can separate it by the buy-side and the sell-side? Mike Frankenfield : Is your question regard to pricing overall or pricing\u2026 Joe Foresi : Yeah, overall and if you\u2019re seeing any difference between the pricing function on either the buy or the sell-side? Mike Frankenfield : Pricing remains very consistent. Our challenge in the business is to ultimately add value to our product to continue to justify the prices that we charge and I think we\u2019re doing a great job with that. The product development pipeline that we have is very strong. Our product continues to improve at a very, very rapid pace relative to the value that we feel we\u2019re delivering and certainly relative to the competition. Joe Foresi : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question here comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Your line is now open sir. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Good morning. Thank you very much for taking my questions. My first question is just trying to hone in on exact organic growth just for this quarter and then again I guess for next quarter. If you would remove both the metrics revenue contribution and then the currency impact, what\u2019s the organic revenue growth for this quarter? And then, what should we expect for metrics revenue next quarter, in other words, what was the February quarters contribution in the last year? Or what we be excluding from the number in order to come with an organic revenue growth rate for FactSet next quarter? Peter Walsh : Good morning, Shlomo, it\u2019s Peter. The organic ASV growth rate is 8.5%. There is a table on page eight of the press release that lays out our methodology to calculate it. It backed out $7.3 million of acquired ASV for metrics and $2.6 million adjusted for FX from primarily the strengthening of the dollar against the yen. In Q2, next year, we will have -- metrics will be with FactSet for a full year. So, we\u2019ll be not adjusted at all in our organic ASV growth rate that we publish at the end of Q2. Shlomo Rosenbaum : So, I was asking about revenue as opposed to ASV growth in this last quarter? Peter Walsh : Revenue growth rate organically was 8%. And I\u2019ll have to come back to with -- we backed out $2.5 million for Matrix, and that will not be backed out in Q2. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. So, the currency you\u2019re seeing though is not a factor because almost everything, your billing is in U.S. dollars. Peter Walsh : Right, 97% is in U.S. dollars. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, got it. And then just on the margin side, can you go over the impact? It sounded like the reason why the gross margin went down was a significant uptake in products that have third-party data that\u2019s integrated into that. It seems that it was at the primary factor and why like all of a sudden this quarter did it have such a big impact? Was there particular push? Or was there significant client sale that took a bunch of those workstations, if you could just give us a little bit more info on that? Peter Walsh : That was a secondary factor. In terms of data cost, the primary factor by a large margin is investment in new employees. That was either through our organic headcount growth or through the acquisition of Matrix. The data cost, variable data cost did increase and that does increase when along with ASV, and in this particular quarter related to increased subscriptions to risk suite and some benchmark subscriptions that are variable, particularly in fixed income. Shlomo Rosenbaum : So, it\u2019s really the headcount growth that you guys are seeing in basically from the hirers. Is that the way to think of it? Mike Frankenfield : Yes. Our summer class traditionally, we\u2019re hiring engineers and consultants. Both of those would go into cost of sales. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Alex Kramm from UBS. Your line is now open. Alex Kramm : Hey, good morning. Just to start off, maybe you can just go back to the guidance, I seem to be a little confused, when I look at -- I think you talked about the midpoint, but when I look at your operating margin and sales guidance, I actually get to something a little bit lower. So, maybe you can talk a little bit about the items below the line, it looks like other income has been picking up. Do you expect more of a tick up there? And also, do you expect to actually be fairly aggressive in this next quarter on buybacks because that\u2019s what it seems to be implying? Thank you. Peter Walsh : I think Alex, what you\u2019re -- in the 12.4% that I was -- that\u2019s on an adjusted EPS basis and it backs out or adds -- reduces the last year\u2019s EPS by a penny, which had the R&D tax credit in it for four months, and our guidance has it out for all periods. Alex Kramm : Okay. Can you talk about those two items still a little bit? The other income and the share buybacks, any color there just for all models? Peter Walsh : Sure. On share buybacks, over the last three years, what we\u2019ve purchased quarterly has really ebbed and flowed. It\u2019s ranged from $28 million to $144 million. We\u2019re not on a specific program. We have the luxury of having high quality problem in terms of too much cash. And the amount which we allocate to share buybacks, does -- we know it\u2019s accretive and its variable related to M&A activity. Other income interest rates for us, hasn\u2019t been change in material and I wouldn\u2019t expect any material change in Q2. Alex Kramm : Okay, great. And then just, maybe a little bit bigger picture. Obviously growth in Europe or internationally, in general has been very strong. When I talk to people in Europe, portfolio managers, for example, I guess there\u2019s a few changes coming with or are already in place in terms of what asset managers can charge or can use soft dollars for and things like that. And when I talk to some guys over there, they\u2019re certainly looking at the technology spend that they have and what products they want or really need, and particularly if they have to pay for it themselves. So, have you seen any impact from some of those new rules? Or do you see a little bit more questions coming from over there? Or is it basically unchanged? Phil Snow : Hi, it's Phil Snow here. We have not seen any impact from that so far, in Europe. Alex Kramm : All right. That\u2019s all from me, then. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Tim McHugh from William Blair & Co. Your line is now open, sir. Tim McHugh : I guess just following up on that last one a little bit, on Europe, and I guess Asia, as well. Can you talk a little bit to the extent I guess any feedback from the clients in terms of the economic environment over there. The headlines we watch are a little bit more cautious in terms of what spending behavior would be out of Europe and Asia for that regard, but it seems like you\u2019re not seeing that so can you give some color around that? Phil Hadley : I think what we\u2019re seeing is really a strong competitive product in the marketplace. We\u2019re certainly growing more than we feel our competitors are growing in our markets we serve. As you can tell by our result on the international side, we had strong performance and that wasn\u2019t just Europe or Asia. It was really both. So, I think - we just feel that our product is strong and competitive and making inroads in the marketplace. Tim McHugh : Got it. Are there signs that the macro environment is creating a tougher market for others, and you\u2019re just selling through that? Or is it just wrong to -- is there such a secured option, lower penetration rate in Europe that maybe the macro environment is not relevant. Mike Frankenfield : Our macro, country by country, buy-side, sell-side, you got to dissect to really get granular. And I think we feel certainly on the sell-side, as you could tell we had a strong quarter relative to prior year. Your prior year was certainly an easy comp for us on the sell-side. And then on the buy-side, I think we\u2019re close both on the portfolio side as well as the core product are doing quite well. Tim McHugh : Okay, great. And then -- I am sorry, I missed earlier on the foreign exchange comment relative to your cost. Did you say because of the hedging and I guess where some of your costs are that it\u2019s a benefit to your margins, and I guess, is that -- was that comment related to this quarter or kind of looking forward the next couple of quarters? Peter Walsh : Overall, this quarter -- and if rates stay the same in Q2, we do get a benefit, a net benefit from FX. But if you look at our margin guidance, you\u2019ll notice that we\u2019re managing the company to be flat. So we\u2019re going to reinvest that benefit back in the product in the form of new headcount. Tim McHugh : Do you quantify at all the size of that benefit? Peter Walsh : I haven\u2019t quantified it. I think you can go into our Q and look at what we\u2019ve hedged and our next exposures by currency and take a crack at it. Tim McHugh : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open, sir. Andre Benjamin : Thank you. Good morning. I was wondering if may be you could provide an update on the efforts to penetrate the fixed income market. And maybe it would be good if you could -- I don't know if you have in the past gave color on how much revenue or growth is coming from that set of products versus the core equity product. Phil Hadley : The fixed income product is accelerating in terms of growth by every metric, in terms of ASV, in terms of client count. As a reminder, the primary way we're addressing the needs in the fixed income space is to load large quantities of fixed income data and combine that with our clients' portfolio, so that clients can look at fixed income data within the context of our analytics application, specifically portfolio analytics. It's really a unique offering in the marketplace. We don't breakout separate numbers for you, but in previous quarters we've described that we were in the very early innings of what we perceived the market potential to be. We'd maybe advance that an inning or two. It's still very, very early days. It's not inconceivable, but some day in the far future we could see a world where much as half of our ASVs coming from our fixed income products. We're long ways away from that but very excited about the opportunity. Andre Benjamin : Thanks. And then, I guess similarly on the buy side ASV, it's a traditional asset manager. I know you were helping others also going after the higher-end PVM clients. I don't know if there's anything that you call out there in terms of either percentage that comes from those two asset base or types of clients, and may be any differences that you're seeing and selling to those client mixes today. Phil Hadley : So, certainly from the sale side we segment the marketplace and attack traditional asst managers' hedge funds, and then as you pointed out, the high net worth or the -- we call PWM, the private net worth. I assume that's what you're talking about. Andre Benjamin : Yes. Phil Hadley : Works well, okay. We've highlighted on prior calls and continue to find great success in the wealth space. It's a smaller segment for us, so the growth rate is higher just because it's coming off a smaller base. Our core market always historically has been the traditional asset manager, and then a much smaller portion of our buy side revenues is the hedge fund space. Andre Benjamin : Thanks. Operator : And our next question here comes from Peter Appert from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open, sir. Peter Appert : Thanks. So, Peter, I know you've talked about this in prior quarters. Can you remind me why the big variability in cost growth between cost of sales versus SG&A? Peter Walsh : The big variability really relates to employee growth. It's -- as Phil previously mentioned, most of our new employee headcount starts off as consultants in engineering, which is part of our cost of sales line, and also obviously what we acquired from metrics all came into cost of sales. That's -- but I'd like to remind everyone really the way we're managing FactSet is that the operating income line and that's where we spend all our time and focus. Peter Appert : But there is no message in terms of flatter down fractionally SG&A expense. Now you're not trimming the size of the sales organization or something? Peter Walsh : No, no, not at all. There's no message in -- our general philosophy is we're growing the size of our sales force. And we're doing that today at least at the rate of ASV growth. Peter Appert : Got it. And then, I think Mike mentioned some -- might have indirectly mentioned this, but I'm wondering in terms of the sale side growth and the acceleration you saw this quarter, how broad-based was it? Is it one or two big sales driving this or is it more widespread? Peter Walsh : It was across virtually every client. Peter Appert : Okay. And do you attribute it to market share or just client growth? Peter Walsh : Just in terms of user count, really all the metrics; user counts, ASV growth, extremely broad-based not significant amount of lumpiness in it. Peter Appert : Okay. But I'm sorry, but I meant specifically do you feel you're taking business from someone else or this is add-on business just to reflect growth in these clients? Peter Walsh : The majority in this particular quarter was a function of expanding our existing footprints. We're not -- I don't think any significant challenge we're expecting. Peter Appert : Got it, got it. And Phil, I'm wondering just sort of big picture thing about next several years in terms of growth dynamic. How do you -- could you call out for us what we should look at in terms of what the primary growth drivers are. You've talked about the fixed income business. But I think there's a perception in the market that your end user customer base is relatively static. So the question is how does FactSet continue to grow? Phil Hadley : The FactSet -- the end customer base is static for us. It's true for almost every player in this industry. Certainly, the bulk of the revenue of the industry comes from the largest 500 firms in this space. I remember when we went public we had 85 of the top 100. I'm sure we're deep into the 90s at this point. So the client count hasn't changed much over time. It's really about selling workflows to the clients we have. And I think that's really where we excel. Every one of our clients, certainly the largest clients, there are significant numbers of users for us to get. I mean, I didn't give the exact number in our press release this quarter, but rounding at 60,000 end users in an industry with hundreds of thousands. We know our clients well enough to know that there are thousands of users just on the desks we don't have in those clients' book, buy and sell side. And then, as Mike mentioned, the fixed income workflows are very exciting for us. We continue to get deeper in to offering risk and quantitative tools for our clients. So it's a lot more product to the current clients we have. It is really exciting for us. We're on top of that. FactSet content is, in many categories, the premier content in the industry. And it really gives us all kinds of different channels to continue to grow our business without expanding our client count by a single client. Peter Appert : And on that front, Phil, can you share with us what portion of the business currently is from data feeds? Phil Hadley : I could, we don't. Peter Appert : Today, as you know\u2026 Phil Hadley : It\u2019s a good question to ask. I think the way to think about it is clearly before we were just in the integration business and we had a small integration feed business where we've helped clients with the productivity of taking multiple sources and turning them into one. But obviously with a big content engine that we have today, as I mentioned, premier content, the opportunity for us to distribute our content both to redistributors in this space, the corporate market, as well as being able to match workflows for our clients and feed their internal needs for data and other forms than spreadsheets are on our inner core product. Peter Appert : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Dan Dolev from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Dan Dolev : Hey, thanks for taking my question. The question is on ASV per workstation growth. If my numbers are correct, it looks like it was flat year-over-year in Q1, which compares to call it 107 basis points positive growth in 2014. What is that comes from, and is that related to maybe some price concessions on the sale side, or if you can give some color on that that would be great. Thanks. Peter Walsh : I think I will just point out that it's not a metric that we follow internally at all. There is so much revenue that's not workstation related that would skew that number up or down in a particular order. We'd -- as was mentioned on the last question will be a factor where we can change workstation now by any and clearly affect that number up and down. I think Mike mentioned I actually feel like our product is getting more competitive in marketplace and gaining share. So I don't feel like we're in an inflationary environment as the workstation level is. Dan Dolev : Got it. And then on the margins, it seems like margins were growing X metrics in the last few quarters and you're guiding to its margins possibly declining X metrics. I mean can you just give some color on are you taking investment in the business or is that pricing related or anything like that? Peter Walsh : We're currently investing in the business. We guide margins to be flat and this is the way we run the business. I think if you look at our history it's never flat. That's what you plan for and some of the things either move it up or down, depending on what happens in the third quarter. I think on a business level though we're trying to find out that we can even drive double-digit [indiscernible] Dan Dolev : And my last question is on a potential new entry into the market. There's has been a lot of news recently in articles is company called Money.net. they claim to have 15,000 customers or very big number. Are you seeing them in the marketplace at all, and may be you can share your views if you know about this product at all. Anything you can say about it would be great. Peter Walsh : We have seen Money.net. We have not faced them in any sort of competitive situations yet and very bright individuals from some of our competitors that spun off and created a compelling product that comes in very low price point, probably it's going to be interesting to the wealth management community, but I don\u2019t see it being competitive with FactSet for a long time to come. Dan Dolev : Are they going after different part of the wealth management, is that why you are not -- you don\u2019t think that's a threat to you longer term? Phil Hadley : Yeah, I think we've articulated our wealth strategy pretty clearly. We're looking at ultra high network wealth managers who are interested in the very sophisticated level of data and analysis. They are operating very much like our traditional institutional asset managers and I have had an opportunity to look at that product and there are not the same universe at the moment. That's the varied entries at the institutional level in part is substantial investment and content. It's across 10 years and we had a regular scale to be able to build out the content that we have on our system, and you start with company fundamentals, move to estimates, transcripts and institutional limits and you work your way down the list and just this year cost of goods to produce that level of content to be an institutional player in the space, really precludes or would make it very difficult for a small player to find their way through the institutional scale in any short period of time. Dan Dolev : Understood, thank you very much. Operator : And our next question comes from Toni Kaplan, Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Toni Kaplan : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. So sell-side ASV growth has improved over the last four quarters, almost this one being 6.7%. Can you give us a frame of reference of what that number looked like historically, like pre-financial crisis? Phil Hadley : My memory is not that good to be able to give you every quarter for any period of time. I can tell you that the sell-side for us has always been more cyclical in the stronger markets back pre financial crisis it has definitely been a driver in the organic growth rates. And then in the financial crisis it was definitely been dilutive to our growth rate. So it definitely if you looked at it over time, the buy-side has always been more stable and it would clock back and forth as to which one was the driver for organic growth in our business. Toni Kaplan : Okay. And then you mentioned the high demand for the risk suite, any more color on sort of what the reason was for that? Thanks. Phil Snow : Hi Toni, it's Phil Snow. So, part of the reason for that is we just continue to put up more and more compelling offerings in the risk space. Recently, last fiscal year FactSet released a multi-asset class risk model which is getting quite a bit of traction in the marketplace. So, that's another area that we're sort of being able to monetize our flexion in fixed income is combining that with equity on the risk side. Toni Kaplan : Okay and that's a FactSet model, it's not a third party model? Phil Snow : That particular model, yeah, is a FactSet model. Toni Kaplan : Terrific. Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from Pete Heckmann from Avondale. Your line is now open sir. Pete Heckmann : Good morning, everyone. I just had a comment on the second quarter guidance. Can you talk about what type of realized pricing increase is contemplated in that number? It looks like you've been very consistent in getting price increases in the 2% to 3% range. Do you think that around that same range is in the cards for fiscal 15? Mike Frankenfield : This is Mike Frankenfield. Our pricing has changed as we've over time as you recall, two years ago with the last that we really did the big formal price increase to all of our clients in Q2 and what we've done now is to make majority of our price be with the contract renewal dates of our clients. So really price comes over the course of the entire year. Pete Heckmann : Okay, okay and can you comment in terms of the range that might occur then over the full year, is 2% to 3% still in the right range or is that something that you're not going to, or where do you\u2026 Mike Frankenfield : I think overall price is probably in the, yeah, very low single digit. There are certainly price opportunities that we take on individual products that we perceive are a point extremely well and there are cases where there are products that we don\u2019t feel like we have any pricing power is we need to continue to invest in them. But that would probably be a good ballpark range if you want to\u2026 Peter Heckmann : Okay. And then just on, it looked like you had good strong growth in Asia Pacific, is there any contribution from that partnership, I can't remember the partner, was it Quick, you are looking at building potentially high end work station for the Japanese market was there any contribution from that in the quarter or is that still to come? Mike Frankenfield : Still to come. Peter Heckmann : Okay, I appreciate it. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Glenn Greene from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Glenn Greene : Thank you, good morning. Just a couple of questions left and maybe the answer is similar to the -- on ASV, but the user growth in the quarter and obviously you alluded to it being the strongest in seven years for the first quarter which was seasonally soft. What kind of drove the user growth, was it broad based, were there a few sort of big off, one off clients? And maybe just a little bit more color on the strength of the user growth? Phil Snow : Hi Glenn, it's Phil Snow. You know the user growth was broad based. It was across the sell-side and the buy-side. The sell-side had positive user growth for the first time in a long number of years for this quarter, but the buy-side was very strong as well. It was actually the bigger contributor of the two numbers for the quarter. Glenn Greene : So there weren\u2019t any sort of like one-off large client wins and that sort of drove that number in the quarter? Phil Snow : No, they were good single to 10, 20 digit users. Glenn Greene : Got it. And then just maybe a little bit of color on what you're seeing in the PA suite, any way to frame the momentum there relative to the ASV growth and have you seen any change comparatively obviously, Bloomberg rolled out a product some time ago, but any traction there? Mike Frankenfield : We're still very competitive in the PA space. We just continue to add more and more functionality to that application and again the addition of fixed income really rounds out the offering and allows people to look at either equity fixed or balance funds and with the risk on top of it. So analytics is doing well and that's being driven by every asset class. Glenn Greene : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our last question here comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Your line is now open. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi thank you for squeezing me in for one more. I just wanted to follow up on a question that was asked beforehand because the clients have been asking this as well. What percentage of our revenue is now coming from soft dollar payments as opposed to hard dollar payments? Peter Walsh : Shlomo, it's Peter. I have to get back with the actual percentage, but my guess is that it's around 20% and I'll come back and look at that from that back with you. Shlomo Rosenbaum : The 20% soft dollar is your rough guess? Hello? Peter Walsh : Yes, it's a question that hasn\u2019t been asked in long time. I think it's roughly 20% from soft dollars through the buy-side. Phil Hadley : Okay. I can tell you it has only trended down in my career starting at 100% in 1985 and down to something that we don\u2019t track regularly at this point. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Very good. Peter Walsh : Thank you. See you in 90 days. Phil Hadley : Thank you. Happy holidays everybody. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining and you may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions]. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this point. Now I'll turn it over to the host, Senior Vice President of Strategic Resources and General Counsel, Ms. Rachel Stern. Ma'am, you may begin. Rachel Stern : Thank you, operator. Good morning and thanks to all of you for participating today. Welcome to FactSet's second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. This conference call is being transcribed in real time by FactSet's CallStreet service and is being broadcast live via the internet at factset.com. A replay of this call will also be available on our website. Our call will contain forward-looking statements reflecting Management's expectations based on currently available information. Actual results may differ materially. More information about factors that could affect FactSet's business and financial results can be found in FactSet's filings with the SEC. Annual subscription value or ASV is a key metric for FactSet. Please recall that ASV is a snapshot view of client subscriptions and represents our forward-looking revenues for the next 12 months. Lastly, FactSet undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Joining me today are Phil Hadley, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Phil Snow, President; and Maurizio Nicolelli, FactSet's Chief Financial Officer. I would like to turn the discussion over now to Phil Hadley, our CEO. At the end of Phil's remarks we will hear from Maurizio Nicolelli, our CFO. After Maruizio's remarks we will have time for questions. Please limit your questions to one question and only one follow-up so that we will have enough time to address questions effectively. Phil Hadley : Thank you, Rachel and good morning, everyone. I would like to address two recent developments. First, on a somber note, as many of you know, Mike DiChristina, one of FactSet's greatest leaders and member of our Board of Directors passed away in late February after battling a long illness. His contribution over the past 29 years to the character and leadership of FactSet will never be forgotten. After only a few short years at FactSet as an engineer, the bulk of the online system was written by Mike or under his watch. His creation of Universal Screening in 1988 is still to this day the foundation of all of FactSet's quantitative and portfolio analytic products. He left a mark an indelible mark on this company and will always be in our hearts. Second, on a lighter note, effective July 1, I will be stepping down from my role as CEO which I've held since September 2000. I will remain with the company as Chairman of the Board of Directors. Phil Snow, our current President will become CEO on July 1. In addition, Mark Hale was promoted to Chief Operating Officer yesterday, replacing Peter Walsh. Peter is taking an active role in supporting Mark in his transition to his new responsibilities. Both Phil Snow and Mark Hale have at least 19 years of experience at FactSet and have lead many teams that have contributed significantly to the growth of our company. They each have a strong knowledge of our clients, a deep commitment to our employees and a clear vision for growth. We're all excited for FactSet's future as Phil and Mark take on their new roles. Employees, clients and investors should take away several clear points from this change. First, it is a great time to bring change to the most senior leadership positions at FactSet. Topline growth has accelerated 300 basis points over the past year and EPS grew by 14% in the just completed quarter, our 19th consecutive quarter of double digit growth. Second, this was a planned transition and it's been carefully arranged. We're pleased to promote leaders from our deep bench of FactSet veterans along with new talent to FactSet. We're excited by the addition of Scott Miller as head of our global sales team, who brings tremendous industry experiences to learn from the outside of our company. Third, I will remain a FactSet employee and will continue in my role as Chairman of the Board and as a resource to Phil Snow at this exciting period in our company history. Lastly, I would like to personally thank Mike Frankenfield and Peter Walsh for their contributions to FactSet. Mike has been with the company since 1989 while Peter since 1996. As key members of senior management over the years, they each have had a major impact on many initiatives which helped FactSet grow overall market cap fivefold in the last 10 years and reach $1 billion in ASV. All-in-all, I couldn't be more pleased about how this important transition process was executed and I look forward to supporting Phil Snow and our experienced senior management team. Thank you, everyone and I'll turn the call over to Maurizio to review our second quarter results. Maurizio Nicolelli : Thank you, Phil. Good morning, everyone. Here is where we will focus our time for this call. First, I'll review the second quarter results, including our recent acquisition of Code Red. Second, I'll cover guidance for the upcoming third quarter. Lastly, we'll close by addressing your questions. So let's proceed with our second quarter results. FactSet performed very well in the second quarter. ASV, revenues, client count, user count and EPS all grew to record highs. During the quarter, our total ASV exceeded $1 billion for the first time and our organic ASV growth rate continued at 8.5%, up 300 basis points from the prior year. Excluding foreign exchange and acquired ASV of $9.3 million, ASV rose $25.4 million during the quarter. In terms of geography, our U.S. operations generated $680 million in ASV. International operations accounted for $325 million in ASV or 32% of the total. Buy-side clients which include all platform data sales and the market metrics business, accounted for 82.8% of ASV, while the remaining 17.2% of ASV was generated by our sell-side clients which include M&A advisory, capital markets and equity research businesses. Included in our second quarter results were two items. One, operating expenses include a $3.2 million pretax charge primarily related to changes in the senior leadership of the company's sales teams, including the hiring of Scott Miller as FactSet's new Global Director of Sales and the optimization of our senior sales leadership in our European and Asia Pacific regions. Second, income tax expense includes a $5.1 million benefit primarily related to the reenactment of the U.S. federal R&D tax credit for calendar year 2014. Excluding these two items, our adjusted operating margin grew to 33.8% and adjusted EPS rose 14% to $1.39. This quarter marks our 19th consecutive quarter of double digit EPS growth. Let's now turn to free cash flow, we define free cash flow as cash generated from operations less capital spending. Over the last three months, we generated $43 million in free cash flow, an increase of 12% over the same period last year. Free cash flow increased during the quarter due to higher levels of net income, an improvement in our aged receivables and a higher accrued compensation. Our DSOs were 36 days at the end of the second quarter, an improvement of 39 days in the prior year period. Our cash and investments balance was $147 million, up $7 million during the quarter. We continued our strong commitment to capital return in the second quarter while investing in the growth of our business. This quarter we spent $56 million on share repurchases. As of quarter end, $283 million remains available for future share repurchases. We also paid regular quarterly dividends of $16 million. When aggregating regular quarterly dividends paid and shares repurchased over the past 12 months, we have returned $303 million to stockholders. Common shares outstanding were 41.6 million at the end of the quarter. During the second quarter we also completed the acquisition of Code Red which provides research management technologies to the investment community, including endowments and foundations, institutional asset managers, sovereign wealth funds, pensions and hedge funds. The addition of Code Red to our existing RMS solution will enable us now to offer a complete research management solution for all of our clients' workflows. The acquisition added $9.3 million in ASV and is expected to dilute our operating margin in the third quarter by 40 basis points. We do not expect the acquisition to have a material impact on our FY '15 EPS. The Code Red acquisition was financed using our new revolving line of credit. The current revolver totals $35 million and can be increased to a maximum of $300 million. Our current cost of capital is 67 basis points. The new revolving line of credit will enable us to manage our operational cash needs better between our U.S. and foreign entities as more than 75% of our cash resides overseas. Now let me walk you through our P&L. Revenues in the second quarter grew to $248 million, an increase of 9% over last year. Organic revenues also grew 9% over last year which excludes $500,000 in revenues from the acquisition of Code Red. Adjusted operating income which excludes the $3.2 million pretax charge primarily from the changes in the senior leadership of the company's sales teams, grew to $83.8 million, an increase of 12% over last year. Adjusted net income grew 12% to $58.7 million and excludes the net impact from changes in senior management and the reenactment of the tax credit. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 14% to $1.39. In the second quarter, our U.S. revenues rose to $167 million which equates to 8% growth compared to the same period last year. Non-U.S. revenues rose to $81 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, the international revenue growth rate was 13%. More specifically, revenues in the second quarter from Europe and the Asia Pacific regions were $62.6 million and $18.7 million respectively. Excluding foreign currency effects, year-over-year growth rates were 12% in Europe and 16% in Asia Pacific. Let's now review the growth drivers this quarter. In general, the positive ASV changes relate to broad based growth globally from the buy side. In the U.S. we have seen sustained growth for fixed income portfolio products, expansion of users focused on credit analysis and sales of equity attribution and our new geographic revenue module in PA. ASV in Europe and Asia Pacific was driven by our portfolio analytics suite of products including expanding the footprint of FactSet's multi-asset class risk and stress test offerings. Net user count for FactSet terminals increased 11% this quarter by over 1,800 users and totaled 57,408 at quarter end. Buy-side performance drove user count and accounted for more than half the change. Over the last 12 months, buy-side users grew 11%. FactSet also expanded its sell-side user base both this quarter and over the last 12 months. Similar to previous years, we've issued our annual price increase for select U.S. investment management clients during the second quarter which contributed $8 million to ASV. As we mentioned in the past, the number of clients affected by the price increase each second quarter has been declining because more and more clients have been experiencing a price increase at the time of their renewal and renegotiation of their contracts with us. As a result, price increases are imposed throughout the year and are not as much a standard item in the second quarter. Our wealth management products continue to grow and appeal to our clients and thus are delivering positive returns for FactSet. We continue to find that our workstation can be well tailored to the needs of our wealth management clients who operate in both large teams and in small groups depending on their needs. Lastly, our proprietary content also continues to be a strong product line for us as well as an opportunity to expand our data feed business. Clients continue to value highly our industry leading content such as StreetAccount news, FactSet fundamentals, FactSet estimates, transcripts takeover defense and entity mapping data. Now let's take a look at the expense side. Total operating expenses were $167.1 million. Our adjusted operating margin was 33.8% which excludes the $3.2 million charge primarily from changes in the senior leadership of the company sales teams. Cost of services expressed as a percentage of revenues increased by 180 basis points compared to the year ago period. The increase was driven by higher compensation, partially offset by lower computer related expenses and amortization of intangible assets. Employee compensation expense grew as we expanded headcount 8% year over year primarily from new hires and acquired employees in connection with the Code Red acquisition. SG&A expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues decreased 120 basis points in the second quarter compared to the year-ago period due to lower compensation expense from employees performing SG&A roles and a reduction in occupancy costs, partially offset by higher professional fees related to changes in the senior leadership of the company's sales teams. At the end of our fiscal year, we had nearly 7,000 employees, a year-over-year increase of 8% globally. We hired 91 net new employees this quarter, primarily within our software engineering and consulting classes. The second quarter effective tax rate was 24.1%, down from 30.5% a year ago due to $5.1 million in income tax benefit related to the reenactment of the federal R&D income tax credit. Excluding this discrete benefit, our effective tax rate was 30.4%, down 10 basis points from last year. Now let's turn to our guidance for the third quarter of FY '15. We expect that revenues will range between $251 million and $256 million. Operating margin should range between 33% and 34%. This range reflects an overall increase in the guidance by 20 basis points, but also includes a 40 basis point reduction from the recent acquisition of Code Red. We expect our annual effective tax rate to range between 30% and 31%. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $1.40 and $1.42. The mid-point of the range suggests a 13% year-over-year growth. In conclusion, our first half of FY '15 was very strong. We delivered at the upper most end of all the metrics in our guidance. More specifically, our ASV growth rate was 8.5%. The operating margin rose to 33.8% and EPS grew by 14%. Q3 guidance implies continued strong performance. We're also in the final leg of a successful transition to a new but seasoned senior management team. As our business crosses $1 billion, I would like to remind you that in 1996, FactSet's first year as a public company, there were over 5,000 public companies with revenues of less than $50 million. FactSet is one of only 60 companies in that pool of 5,000 to have crossed the $1 billion mark in revenues. This metric is a testament to our business model, our market opportunity and our experienced management team who knows how to execute. Phil Snow and Mark Hale were employees in 1996 and are part of an experienced team that will lead FactSet to future growth. Thank you. We're now ready for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from the line of Mr. Peter Appert from Piper Jaffrey. Sir, your line is open. Peter Appert : So the question is on trying to better understand the impact of FX. I know that the billings are primarily in dollars, but you've got costs in local currencies. So I'm wondering if there was a measurable impact on margin or profitability in the quarter from the FX impact. Maurizio Nicolelli : You\u2019re correct, there is an impact on the quarter from FX. Keep in mind, FactSet has a net exposure approximately of $170 million in FX. Half of that is in euros and pounds, so we're seeing a benefit from the stronger dollar there, but the offset there is also our investment in the business in headcount. If you look at our headcount, in the first half of this fiscal year compared to last year, it's significantly higher. So there is a benefit in FX. It's offset by investment in headcount and you're seeing the uptick result in our operating margin and you saw that this quarter at 33.8% for the quarter. And you also see our guidance has been upticked a bit and our guidance now is between 33% and 34% going forward. That also takes into account a 40 basis point effect decline from the effect of purchasing Code Red. Peter Appert : So a portion is flowing through, a portion is being spent on higher investment spend, but the improvement in margin is basically FX driven? Maurizio Nicolelli : The net effect, correct. Peter Appert : One other question. The guidance I assume would imply that the passwords are going to be relatively stable on a go forward basis. Is that a fair assumption? Phil Hadley : Yes, I think that's a fairly stable assumption. We're seeing good growth in passwords in both the buy side and the sell side. Peter Appert : Right, but no further accelerations, stable at this around 10% level? Phil Hadley : Peter, we really don't spend any time internally projecting password growth. We have always focused on ASV. Peter Appert : Okay and Phil one last thing for you, how active do you plan to be in your role as Chairman? Will this be an Executive Chairman role? Phil Hadley : That is correct. It's an Executive Chairman role. Phil and I have a list of responsibilities that I'm going to stay focused on for the next year and then we'll see how things go from there. Phil Snow : This is Philip Snow. I expect Phil to play an active role in M&A which he's done over his career at FactSet. I think we've averaged about one deal every year for the last 17 years and Phil has been huge in sourcing deals into the M&A pipeline and helping us execute on that. Peter Appert : So Phil Hadley, your expectation is you'll just stay for another year? Phil Hadley : I just said we'll see how it goes. I want to make sure I'm still accretive to the management team and they view me as a positive coming into the office. I'm loyal to FactSet through and through. Operator : Again for the next question from Mr. Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Sir, your line is open. Shlomo Rosenbaum : I want to get some thoughts on the underlying growth. You guys had the highest sales quarter ever for buy-side workstations. When you measure it in terms of ASV growth, it looks like it slowed a tad sequentially. Is the upward trajectory in general, do you think the underlying growth rate is continuing to accelerate? And is there any change in the nature of those buy-side workstations? Is there still the same upside cross sell potential that you usually have when you place a new workstation out there in the market? Phil Snow : Yes, I think we believe there is massive potential for us out there in the marketplace. I wouldn't read too much into the slight slowdown that you saw on the buy side. We think about sales now in terms of halves and we had an exceptionally strong half. The sales team outperformed its first half goal. I think this year what you're seeing is we pulled a little bit more into Q1 than we had in the previous year and that's most of what you're seeing. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. And then in terms of Phil's role in M&A and the fact that you guys are also, first time I can recall, have a real credit facility out there. Should we expect that you will be more active on the M&A side of the business? Phil Snow : We'll definitely execute on great opportunities when we see them. There are adjacent workflows that we're interested in. We've is shown that through our history, that we've continued to build out our presence within our largest clients and we're just going to look for good opportunities and if we have something that looks attractive, we'll execute on it. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Is the pipeline any better or worse than you've seen it in the last few years for deals? Phil Hadley : It's pretty stable. Shlomo Rosenbaum : So Phil, are you going to be bored? It's kind of the same thing, just you're only going to be working on M&A? Phil Hadley : Phil highlighted M&A as one of my responsibilities, but I still have several others. One is certainly making sure that the transition is smooth in his role, but there are several other smaller projects and products and things that I think we'll find interesting. Operator : Thank you. And for the next question from Mr. Manav Patnaik of Barclays. Sir, your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : This is actually Greg calling on for Manav. I was hoping to get some more details on the Code Red acquisition. Is this the type of product that you plan on selling standalone or is it something that you can take advantage of bundling it with the workstation and then some details on the competitive environment and positioning there? Phil Snow : Yes, Code Reds are a really nice local solution for clients that are interested research management solutions. We also have our own internal research notes product which has done very well over the last few years. So our strategy is to combine those teams and really go out there with a strong hybrid solution that we can sell to any type of client. There are certain types of clients out there that do demand a local solution. We certainly ran into that while we were selling our hosted solution. The team is already integrated. We're very bullish about this area, this area of analytics for our clients. The other thing that we're bullish about is that it really helps build community within the front office of our buy-side clients between the portfolio managers and analysts and that's something that we're focused on. Unidentified Analyst : Okay and then with the hire of Scott Miller and what sounded like some changes on the sales team, wondering if there's any changes in how you're planning to go to market with the sales team and if all those changes are already in place? Phil Snow : Scott's transitioned in exceptionally well over the last two months. His new team is in place. We've made a few changes there and some are having direct ownership of the European and Asian regions under individuals which we didn't have before. And all of Scott's are direct, actually are FactSet employees. So he has a very talented FactSet team reporting to him and we're excited about what he's going to do for FactSet. The combination of the inside and the outside is definitely something that we think is going to be accretive to the business. Operator : Thank you. And for the next question from Ms. Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Ma'am, your line is open. Toni Kaplan : To follow-up on that last one, do you think that the sales transition impacted growth this quarter at all? Phil Snow : I don't think it did. We've been going through a transition, as Maurizio pointed out, for the last year. So there has been some movement, particularly within the Americas Investment Management team over the last year. We did reorganize that group to more clearly align by the firm types that we're selling to. So it might have had an impact, but it's so minor that I don't know if we can directly attribute it to that and I firmly believe that we're positioned now to accelerate our growth rate based on how we're organized. Toni Kaplan : In terms of the management transition, do you think that there will be any changes in philosophy, whether it be in terms of margin expansion versus reinvestment or leverage levels or capital deployment, anything of that nature or will it be very consistent with the prior policies? Phil Snow : After spending 19 years with Phil Hadley, I think it's going to be pretty consistent. We've proven that it's a great business model that reinvesting in our business is the way to go and I don't see that we'll be changing that. Operator : And for the next question comes from Mr. Andre Benjamin of Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is open. Andre Benjamin : My first question, of the new clients that you've added, is there any color on potentially some of the size and the mix of who you've been adding? I'm trying to get of sense of how much of the growth is from really small shops with limited infrastructure versus some of the really large ones? Phil Snow : It's a typical quarter for us in terms of net new client additions, so healthy additions, a very good mix of hedge funds, wealth shops, traditional asset managers. As we've said on previous calls, typically we bring clients on, kind of the smaller size and we end up growing them over time. We already have most of the largest shops out there as our clients and we still view that as our biggest opportunity as a firm is expanding the wallet share that we have in those bigger clients. Andre Benjamin : As a natural follow-on to that, as you talk to them about their forward planning, I know you only guide a quarter out. I'm not trying to extrapolate guidance here, but generally what are they saying about their expectations for how they plan to manage the business over the next couple years? Trying to get a sense of whether or not they're thinking of maybe slowing things or not given the market has been a little bit more choppy of late? Phil Snow : You're asking about our clients and how they think about the business? Andre Benjamin : As they talk to you about how they're thinking of managing headcount over the next couple years, wondering if there is anything you can share on color? Phil Snow : Right now it appears to us as though the clients are in a healthy spot on both the buy side and sell side and are hiring modestly. Operator : Thank you. And for the next question comes from Mr. Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery Scott. Sir, your line is open. Joseph Foresi : I was wondering if we could get an update on the wealth management product and maybe you could give us some color on how meaningful that is at this point? Phil Snow : The wealth business continues to do well. On a relative basis, it's growing faster than some other segments of our business. In the last half we released an asset allocation functionality which I think will be good for that space and we've also increased coverage for some of our StreetAccount news areas which we think will help the wealth space as well. Joseph Foresi : And are you seeing any changes indecision cycles from your clients particularly anything in the European market? Phil Snow : Nothing material, no. Operator : Thank you. And for the next question from Mr. David Chu of Merrill Lynch. Sir, your line is open. David Chu : So if growth in new clients has been broad based, why has revenue per subscriber been trending lower in the past few quarters? Phil Snow : That's really not a metric that we track. We have a big variety of clients that pay us different price points for different types of users. So it's really not one that we pay attention to. David Chu : Okay. So you guys added about 1,800 new subscribers or passwords in the quarter. Can you share how many came from new clients versus existing? Phil Snow : I think it's pretty evenly split down the middle, to be honest with you. David Chu : Pretty even? Phil Snow : Particularly on the buy side. David Chu : And last one, the $3.2 million in onetime costs, how does that split between COGS and SG&A? Maurizio Nicolelli : The $3.2 million is predominantly in the SG&A line. Operator : And for the next question comes from Mr. Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer. Sir, your line is open. Glenn Greene : Just a question on -- you talked about the 300 basis points topline or ASV acceleration in the last year. Is there any way you can frame how much you think of that is coming from market share gains versus broad industry growth? Phil Hadley : I would say, if I had to guess, I would probably say half and half. I think half of it is probably pure market health and the other half of it when we look at our win loss, I think it's definitely coming from market share gains from others. Glenn Greene : Is there any change in the trend competitively? Is it accelerating or pretty much what you've seen for the last few years? Phil Hadley : I think it's pretty consistent over the last few years. It is something we focus on trying to understand, whether our ASV is coming from what we think of as alpha or beta meaning clients are adding more users and we're not really gaining share. But I think it's been pretty consistent through time as half and half would be the way I think about it. Glenn Greene : And then a quick update on what you're seeing with the fixed income product, how much traction it's having and similar to the prior question on the wealth management anyway to frame how meaningful it is to the business at this point? Phil Snow : The fixed income product continues to do exceptionally well in a few different dimensions. We have through our portfolio analytics products selling fixed income in PA is doing well. We have a fixed income analytical services product that has a high growth rate and we're also doing well and selling credit workstations. Operator : And for the next question comes from the line of Mr. Tim McHugh of William Blair. Sir, your line is open. Stephen Sheldon : It's Stephen Sheldon in for Tim. First, I want to ask has there been any notable changes in the growth drivers for the sell-side business? I think you've talked over the last few quarters about stronger M&A markets having an impact, but are there other areas that may be improving more than others over the last few quarters? Phil Snow : I think it's pretty consistent with prior quarters. We're not seeing any meaningful change there. Stephen Sheldon : Okay and then looking at the international growth specifically in APAC, I think you said that constant currency growth was about 16% in the quarter. Is the joint venture with Quick in Asia having any notable impact on the growth in the region? Phil Snow : I don't think we're seeing the impact of that yet. I think that will be coming in future quarters. Operator : And for the next question from Mr. Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Sir, your line is open. Keith Housum : Guys, as a reminder, are most of contracts that you guys have with your overseas customers, are those in U.S. dollars? Phil Snow : Yes. Keith Housum : So the impact on ASV is immaterial then for foreign currency, correct? Phil Snow : Correct. Over 95% of our invoices are in U.S. dollars. Keith Housum : And then administrative more on Code Red; is most of that revenue spread evenly throughout the ASV or is there any projects related revenue to that? Phil Snow : No. Operator : And for the next question from Mr. Bill Warmington of Wells Fargo. Sir, your line is open. Bill Warmington : So a couple of questions. First is for Phil Snow. I wanted to ask in terms of your thoughts now going forward in the role of CEO, what are the things that you would like to do the same and what are the things that you would like to do differently? Phil Snow : Sounds like an interview question. We've always looked at our opportunity at FactSet through multiple lenses. We'll look at the opportunity geographically, we'll look at it by the types of firms that we're selling to, the different sites of users or workflows within those firms lots of different ways of looking at it. One area that I think you'll see increased focus from at FactSet is specifically around that end-user work flow. So I'm going to be obsessed with making sure that we're providing different types of users the content and analytics that each of them wants and delivering it the way that they want. We've done that in past. We're just going to raise the priority or sort on that particular lens that we look through. Bill Warmington : Okay. Any thoughts to changes in capital allocation, perhaps shifting more to M&A versus buybacks? Phil Hadley : I think going forward our capital allocation will still be very similar to what it has been in past. We look at share repurchase, dividend and M&A and we try to find the best areas to invest our funds to get the highest return on capital at the end of the day. Operator : And for the next question comes from the line of Mr. Patrick O'Shaughnessy of Raymond James. Sir, your line is open. Patrick O'Shaughnessy: So just a quick one for me kind of following up on that last line of questioning. Your credit facility, $300 million capacity it looks like. Does that imply that you guys are open to looking at bigger deals going forward? Obviously, you haven't had a facility in the past. You've mostly done smaller deals, so does this broaden the scope of potential acquisitions for you? Phil Hadley : Our policy as Maurizio said, has always been to look at those three categories, dividend, share repurchase and M&A. We've looked at many deals that are much larger than we've actually accomplished, so we've always been open to it. It just has to be strategically the right thing to do. I think the actual $300 million facility was one that Bank of America offered us at no cost, so we took it, but I don't think it's really a change in policy. Patrick O'Shaughnessy: So there is no commitment fee on that facility? Phil Hadley : No. Phil Snow : Zero. Operator : And speakers, right now we don't have any other questions in queue. Phil Hadley : Thank you, everyone. Phil Snow : Thanks, everyone. See you next quarter. Operator : And that ends this conference. Thanks for joining. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer section of today's conference call. Now I will hand the meeting over to your host, Ms. Rachel Stern, Senior Vice President, Strategic Resources and General Counsel. Ms. Stern, you may begin. Rachel R. Stern - Secretary, General Counsel & Senior Vice President- Strategic Resources : Thank you, operator. Good morning and thanks to all of you for participating today. Welcome to FactSet's third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. This conference call is being transcribed in real time by FactSet's CallStreet service and is being broadcast live via the Internet at FactSet.com. A replay of this call will also be available on our website. Our call will contain forward-looking statements reflecting management's expectations based on currently available information. Actual results may differ materially. More information about factors that could affect FactSet's business and financial results can be found in FactSet's filings with the SEC. Annual Subscription Value, or ASV, is a key metric for FactSet. Please recall that ASV is a snapshot view of client subscriptions and represents our forward-looking revenues for the next 12 months. Lastly, FactSet undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Joining me today are : Phil Hadley, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Philip Snow, President; and Maurizio Nicolelli, FactSet's Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to turn the discussion over now to Maurizio Nicolelli, Chief Financial Officer. At the end of his remarks, we will have time for questions. Please limit your remarks to only one question and one follow-up so that we will have enough time to address questions effectively. Maurizio Nicolelli - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thank you, Rachel, and good morning, everyone. Here are the items that we will cover \u2013 that we will review for this call. First, I'll review the third quarter results. Second, I'll cover guidance for the upcoming fourth quarter. Lastly, we'll close by addressing your questions. Please note one housekeeping item. Included in our third quarter results was a tax benefit of $1.4 million, or $0.03 per share, from finalizing previous years' tax returns and other discrete income tax items. Amounts I disclose as adjusted exclude this tax benefit in order to present comparable figures with the prior year. A full reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP figures can be found in the table on page nine of our earnings release. Let's now proceed with our third quarter results. FactSet performed very well in the third quarter, as organic ASV grew $17 million compared to $12 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2014. With this performance, our organic ASV growth rate rose to 8.9%, up from 6.8% a year ago. In Q3, revenues, client count, user count, and adjusted EPS all grew to new highs. This growth translated into higher operating margins at 33.5% and a 14% increase in adjusted EPS to $1.42. Buy-side clients, who include off-platform data sales and the Market Metrics business, accounted for 82.8% of ASV, while the remaining 17.2% of ASV was generated by our sell-side clients, which include M&A advisory, capital market, and equity research businesses. In terms of geography, our U.S. operations totaled $688 million in ASV, while international operations accounted for $333 million, or 33% of the total. Let's now turn to free cash flow. We define free cash flow as cash generated from operations less capital spending. Over the last three months we generated $99 million in free cash flow, our highest quarterly total ever. Over the last 12 months, free cash flow was $273 million, up 8%. Free cash flow increased during the quarter due to higher levels of net income and an improvement in our working capital, primarily from higher levels of client receivable collection. Our DSOs were 33 days at the end of the third quarter, down from 34 days in the prior-year period. Our cash and investment balance was $183 million, up $36 million during the quarter. We continued our strong commitment to capital return in the third quarter while investing in the growth of our business. This quarter we spent $70 million on share repurchases. As of quarter end, $213 million remained available for future share repurchases. We also paid regular quarterly dividend of $16 million. When aggregating regular quarterly dividends paid and shares repurchased over the last 12 months, we have returned $317 million to stockholders. During the third quarter, we also increased our annual dividend by 13% to $1.76 per share, further increasing future returns to stockholders. Common shares outstanding were 41.5 million at the end of the quarter. Now let me walk you through our P&L. Revenues grew in the third quarter to $254.5 million. Organic revenues accelerated to 8.9%, our highest growth rate in the last three years. Operating income was $85.4 million, an increase of 12% over last year's adjusted operating income. Adjusted net income grew 13% to $60 million and excludes the previously mentioned income tax benefit of $1.4 million. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 13.6% to $1.42. In the current year third quarter, our U.S. revenues rose to $172.1 million. Excluding acquisitions, our U.S. revenue growth was 8.6%. Non-U.S. revenues rose to $82.4 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, international revenue growth rate was 10.5%. Revenues in the third quarter from our European and Asia-Pacific regions were $63.2 million and $19.3 million respectively. Excluding foreign currency effects, year-over-year growth rates were 9% in Europe and 15.6% in Asia-Pacific. Let's now review the growth drivers for this quarter. Our Portfolio Analytics suite of products continues to be a strong performer for us. In particular, our clients and prospects have realized the value of these applications and their capabilities in analyzing securities and portfolios based on a variety of asset classes. This quarter, we continue to see growth in our equity attribution and risk products, multi-asset class risk products, and fixed income portfolio analysis. Net user count for FactSet terminals increased by 1,600 users or 3% and totaled 59,000 at quarter end. Our user increase during the just completed quarter was our highest Q3 growth since the third quarter of 2011 (sic) [2010]. FactSet expanded in both its buy and sell side user bases. We also increased users within the corporate marketplace, primarily through partnerships with third parties. Client growth was strong this quarter, as we added 47 net new clients compared to 30 last year. New client growth in our buy-side business drove the majority of the increase. The client retention picture improved in Q3. In terms of number of clients, the retention rate increased to 94%, which is our highest ever retention rate. Consistent with prior quarters, our annual client retention rate was greater than 95% of ASV. Our wealth management products continue also to gain traction in our client base and thus are delivering positive returns for FactSet. Our clients operating in both large and small groups continue to find that our workstation effectively meets their needs in servicing their clients on a daily basis. Lastly, our sell-side business continued to expand due to growth in sales to middle market firms. Overall ASV from our sell-side clients grew at a rate of over 10%, reflecting a healthy M&A backdrop and the strength of our banking workstation and incremental value-added products. Now let's take a look at the expense side. Total operating expenses were $169.2 million, up $10 million from last year, while our operating margin increased to 33.5% from 31.5% in the prior-year period. Cost of services, expressed as a percentage of revenues, increased by 50 basis points compared to the year-ago period. The increase was driven by higher employee compensation, partly offset by lower third-party data fees and a prior-year stock-based compensation charge of $1.4 million from vesting performance-based stock options. Employee compensation expense grew, as we expanded head count by 9% year-over-year, primarily from new hires and acquired employees in connection with the Code Red acquisition. Lower data costs were the result of refinement and automation of our conference call transcription process. SG&A expenses, expressed as a percentage of revenues, decreased by 250 basis points in the third quarter compared to the year-ago period due to lower compensation expense from employees performing SG&A roles and decreased legal fees due to a $1.6 million legal charge in the prior year resulting from a claim settlement. Our head count at quarter end was 6,951, down 27 employees in the past three months but up 9% over last year. Q3 is traditionally not a heavy hiring quarter because many new consultants and engineers start in Q4 after college graduation. Consistent with previous years, we anticipate that our upcoming fourth quarter will be a strong quarter for new hires. We are also proud to point out that FactSet was recognized as one of Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For, marking our seventh appearance on the list in the last eight years. The third quarter effective tax rate was 28.5%, down from 29.8% a year ago due to $1.4 million in income tax benefits related to the finalization of previous years' tax returns and other discrete tax items. Excluding discrete income tax benefits from both periods, our current year annual effective tax rate was 30.1% compared to 30.5% in the year-ago period. Now let's turn to our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. We expect revenues will range between $259 million and $263 million. Operating margin should range between 33% and 34%. We expect our annual effective tax rate to range between 30% and 31%. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $1.46 and $1.48. The midpoint of the range suggests 12% year-over-year growth. In conclusion, we had another very healthy quarter. Our ASV growth rate continued to accelerate. We delivered at the upper end of all the metrics in our guidance, and adjusted EPS rose 14%. Adjusted EPS has expanded by double-digit percentages in every quarter over the last five years. This strong record has resulted in a high level of free cash flow and, in turn, increases our capital returned to shareholders. Our dividend increased this quarter by 13%. And including share repurchases, $317 million has been returned to shareholders over the last 12 months. More importantly, our business model has proved to be very strong and is supported by future investment and a seasoned management team. We like our position. We're excited about the prospects to continue to accelerate share gains over the long term. Thank you, and we are now ready for your questions. Operator : Thank you, speakers. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question is coming from Mr. Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Your line is open. Maurizio Nicolelli - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Hello, operator? Operator : Yes, sir? Maurizio Nicolelli - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : We're not hearing anything. Philip A. Hadley - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We're not hearing anything. Operator : All right, give me one second. All right, speakers, right now we don't have any questions in queue, but we're still waiting for them to press 1 to ask a question. Philip A. Hadley - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Operator, it seems like our speakers or our questions are having a hard time getting in the queue. Can you confirm that they're able to do so? Operator : Give me one second. Let me just double check that for you, sir. Philip A. Hadley - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: They were in the queue and then the queue cleared, so something obviously happened. Operator : Yes, sir, because I think \u2013 let me just double check that for you, okay? Thank you. Philip A. Hadley - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Shlomo and Peter, I know you both were close to the top of the queue. If you thought you were in the queue and had already done what you needed to do, you need to try it again because the operator seems to have cleared you out. Operator : Thank you. Right now, speakers, we don't have any questions in queue. Philip A. Hadley - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Operator, there has to be technical difficulty on your side. There are at least 10 or 15 normal questions that would come on this call. Operator : All right, give me one moment, sir. All right, speakers, let me just double check that for you, okay? Philip A. Hadley - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Somebody just came in the queue. Operator : Yes, sir, one moment. All right, we have a question now coming from Mr. Shlomo Rosenbaum, one moment. All right, give me one moment, sir. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hello? Philip A. Hadley - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, hi. Rachel R. Stern - Secretary, General Counsel & Senior Vice President- Strategic Resources : Hello. Philip A. Hadley - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sorry about the technical difficulties. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, I think it's the 20th press of 1 that's the charm. Philip A. Hadley - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, that's good to know. Obviously it worked for you. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Obviously, thank you for taking my questions. I just want to probe a little bit about some of the growth drivers on the buy side. If you guys can, just delve a little bit more into maybe uptake on the wealth management product. At the Analyst Day there was some commentary that it's the fastest growing product suite within the company. Is that being sold yet in international locations? Philip Snow - President: Hi, Shlomo. It's Phil Snow. I can take that one. First of all, I would say on both the buy side and the sell side this quarter, the growth drivers were exceptionally broad-based. To answer your question specifically about wealth, yes, that is a good solid double-digit driver for us. We've been monetizing or selling to the wealth market internationally for quite some time, and this quarter a lot of the biggest closes actually were over in Europe for wealth specifically. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And then on the sell side, sell side was particularly strong. What are you seeing? Is it just in particular to the M&A environment and more hiring, or were there any large displacements of a competitor in the quarter? Can you give a little more color on that? Philip Snow - President: Again, it was pretty broad-based. You saw that we had a great quarter in terms of net workstation additions. I think that's the strongest Q3 we've had in probably four years, and that was well distributed between the buy side and the sell side. So some of that growth was definitely coming from adding additional sell-side users. We had some healthy wins, in the hundreds, and a few losses as well, but it wasn't one big displacement that drove that number. And we're also doing very well against all of the competitors in our space. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. I'm going to let some other guys get in the queue. Philip Snow - President: Great, thank you. Rachel R. Stern - Secretary, General Counsel & Senior Vice President- Strategic Resources : Operator, we're ready for the next question. Operator : Give me one second, speakers. Philip A. Hadley - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Peter, are you there by chance? Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): I'm here. Can you hear me? Philip A. Hadley - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Excellent, I don't think we need our operator. Philip Snow - President: Yes, go for it. Maurizio Nicolelli - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Go for it. Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Okay, excellent. So you guys have been very clear that margin upside is not part of the strategic focus, but the margins have been very impressive here, up nicely in the last couple of quarters, anything we should read into that? And maybe this acceleration in revenue growth we've seen in the last couple quarters has given you a little more leverage than you might have otherwise expected. Maurizio Nicolelli - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Hi, Peter. It's Maurizio. You are correct. We've had some nice margin expansion from Q3 of last year. If you remember, last year our adjusted op margin was 32.8%, and I think this quarter it's 33.5%. We've gone up 70 basis points. Also, our margin was diluted by 40 basis points for the Code Red acquisition. We continue to reinvest in the business. Our head count has grown 9% on a year-over-year basis. And so essentially, a big part of the ASV growth is also going into reinvestment, but we have increased our margin over 100 basis points on a year-over-year basis. And we're comfortable with the guidance going forward. Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Okay. So we shouldn't anticipate a new trend here in terms of moving the margin up to perhaps a higher level in the context of faster revenue growth? Philip A. Hadley - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Peter, I'll chime in. I don't think Phil and the management team \u2013 the character of the business is definitely still to reinvest. As you know, quarter to quarter things bounce up and down. FX is helping us. But as Maurizio said, we're definitely continuing to reinvest heavily in our head count. Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Got it, perfect. Good, and I'm going to violate the one question only law because who knows if you get another question or not. I'm just wondering. This is an extension to what Shlomo was asking. The growth in users and in ASV has also been very impressive here over the last six quarters. And I'm just wondering if this gives you maybe a little more confidence in terms of the ability to accelerate the growth further going forward, or as you think about it, the guidance might suggest that the growth is a steady-state number going forward. I hope that was clear enough. Philip Snow - President: Yes, it's a great question. We still view massive opportunity in the market and all the market segments that we're going after. The new management team is in place. We've gone through I think a very well orchestrated transition over the last year. So I feel like we're poised to continue to grow. And the clients definitely feel healthy. I think we're seeing that on the sell side where the hiring trends feel good to us. Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Okay, great. Thank you. Rachel R. Stern - Secretary, General Counsel & Senior Vice President- Strategic Resources : Our next question is from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Thanks, guys. Can you hear me? Philip A. Hadley - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, we're good. Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right, perfect. Just to follow up on the margin question, how much has FX been contributing to the upside? I'm just trying to sense if your question is on reinvesting, how much is FX benefiting you. Maurizio Nicolelli - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : FX has been a benefit to us over the last 12 months. Again, that benefit has translated in two positive impacts for the business. One is head count has grown over 9% as we have reinvested a chunk of that business into investing it back into the business. And the other piece of that is our margin expansion of 110 basis points over the last 12 months. Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. But it's not easy enough to just quantify \u2013 so steady state you would have seen flat margins without the FX benefit? Maurizio Nicolelli - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I think our margin guidance would indicate that we're trending very similar to the third quarter. Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, fine. And then I guess a couple of quarters ago there was a lot of chatter in the industry around the new chat initiative, and everyone was trying to come up with the open source platform. Do you guys have any update or color on where that stands today from your point of view? Philip Snow - President: On the chat initiative? Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Philip A. Hadley - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Manav, it's Phil Hadley. I think we're certainly very supportive of it. For us it's an opportunity for the marketplace to create another platform for chat to occur. So I think all the industry participants both buy side, sell side, and participants like us will certainly be supportive of the process, and I think it's got a great chance. Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, all right, fair enough. I'll get back in the queue. Thanks, guys. Philip A. Hadley - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Alex, can you hear us? Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC : Yes. Rachel R. Stern - Secretary, General Counsel & Senior Vice President- Strategic Resources : So our next question is from Tim McHugh. Alex, we'll get back to you in two seconds. Can you press 1 again and get back in the queue and we'll get you? Tim, do you have whatever you want (27:13)? Timothy J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yes, okay. All right, I just wanted to follow up on the sell side. I know you described \u2013 I guess it was pretty broad, but there has been a pretty big acceleration just versus a year or two ago. So did the market get that much better in your view, or are you doing anything differently than I guess a year or two ago that you would attribute the improved growth on that side of the business? Philip Snow - President: I think one thing that I'll point to is just the strength of our product. I think we've got some good product differentiation, particularly with our office (27:47) suite and some of the unique content that we offer. And we have a great sales team as well. Timothy J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: I mention though, if I asked you a year ago, would you have said that same thing? Philip Snow - President: That's a good question. We've acquired a little bit more content and continued to build it out. And the hiring trends on the sell side are definitely helping. Timothy J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And I'll leave it at that. Thanks. Philip Snow - President: Yeah. Rachel R. Stern - Secretary, General Counsel & Senior Vice President- Strategic Resources : Alex Kramm is our next questioner, from UBS. Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Can you hear me now? Philip Snow - President: Yes, we can hear you. Philip A. Hadley - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Alex. Rachel R. Stern - Secretary, General Counsel & Senior Vice President- Strategic Resources : Yes, sorry for the... Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC : Fantastic. Anyways, I missed the last question a little bit, so hopefully I'm not asking the same thing. So coming back to the sales efforts, obviously there's been some management changes and obviously some new hiring on the sales front. And I guess it sounded like the sales force might be a little bit more held accountable in the future with some of the initiatives that you talked about at the Analyst Day. So could you just talk about what changes have been implemented, if you've seen any difference in motivation or efforts? So any color that you can give there would be great. Philip Snow - President: Yeah, I think we've always had a very motivated sales team at FactSet, and this is just sort of a natural opportunity for us to reorganize. So Scott Miller has done a great job. He's got his entire team in place at this point. I think we mentioned this on our previous call, but we now have dedicated heads for both Asia and Europe, whereas previously that was a little bit more mixed together, so I think that's very positive. We've done a lot to separate out the global majors from the rest of the sales force, so really focusing on the bigger banks and the buy-side components of those. That's another change. And I think thirdly, FactSet Consulting is really one of our really great competitive advantages in the marketplace, just how we service our clients. So we have someone leading that effort now globally rather than it being regionally and just bringing us to that next level with our consulting group. So to summarize, there's a lot of really great energy in the sales force, and we're really excited about what we can get out of the group. Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC : All right, that's helpful. Thank you. And then secondly, I think this question comes up once in a while too. But when I calculate ASV per user, that number year-over-year declines I think 2.5%. I think it's one of the largest declines we've seen in a while or ever. I know there's a lot of mix and I know you had a strong user growth, but anything you would call out there in particular, or is it just a mix issue? Philip Snow - President: We don't track it that heavily internally at that level. So it really is a function of which clients, what types of users within those clients, and what the mix is in terms of new business versus same-store sales, so all of those things play into that number. Generally speaking, when we bring on either a new client or a new user at certain types of firms, they come in at a lower price point, and our model is then to upsell them moving forward... Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC : Right. And I assume a lot of sell-side growth also probably depresses that a little bit, right, because that's usually a little bit lower, is that fair? Philip Snow - President: Sounds right. Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC : Excellent. Thank you. Philip Snow - President: You're welcome. Rachel R. Stern - Secretary, General Counsel & Senior Vice President- Strategic Resources : Our next question is from Joe Foresi at Janney. Joe, are you there? Robert E. Simmons - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Yes, well, actually this is Robert Simmons in for Joe. So you mentioned before the healthy M&A background. Do you see that picking up, just keeping it on this focus (31:41) we had before? Or any kind of color you can give there would be helpful. Philip Snow - President: I don't think I have any great insight into that other than what you would have. I think it just generally feels healthy for us, that it's probably at all-time highs and we're able to capitalize on that. Robert E. Simmons - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Okay. What are you seeing in terms of your own M&A? Philip Snow - President: We continue to evaluate a lot of different opportunities that we come across. There are some natural adjacencies for us, which I'm probably not going to get into in any detail on this call. But we're as active or more active than we've been in the past. Robert E. Simmons - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Okay, great. I'll hop off. Rachel R. Stern - Secretary, General Counsel & Senior Vice President- Strategic Resources : Our next question is from David Chu at Merrill Lynch. David? David J. Chu - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Can you hear me? Philip Snow - President: Yes, hi. David J. Chu - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. So based on current FX rates, should FX benefits start to moderate in the fourth quarter? Maurizio Nicolelli - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I think our FX benefit is reflected in our guidance going forward. You can see it's fairly stable as of today. To be quite honest, we only look out one quarter in terms of our guidance. So I think FX would be fairly stable over the next quarter based on our guidance. David J. Chu - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, got it. And of the roughly 1,600 new subscribers from the third quarter, how much was buy side versus sell side? Philip Snow - President: We typically haven't broken that out, but it was a very healthy mix between both. David J. Chu - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, thank you very much. Rachel R. Stern - Secretary, General Counsel & Senior Vice President- Strategic Resources : Our next question is from Bill Warmington at Wells Fargo. Bill? William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, everyone. So, Phil, back at the Investor Day in March, you talked about your goal of accelerating organic ASV growth, and this quarter you started to see it from 8.5% up to 8.9%. You talked about taking it up to the double-digit level. And I was going to ask if you have any thoughts on the timeframe for achieving the double-digit organic revenue growth. Philip Snow - President: I'd like it to happen as soon as possible, obviously, but I don't think I'm going to tell you when that's going to be. But I think we've got a great opportunity to get there sooner rather than later. William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, so I guess my point in the question is it's been flat for a couple of quarters. at a very strong level, but it has been flat. You're starting to see it pick up. Philip Snow - President: It has been picking up. William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Pardon? Philip Snow - President: It's been picking up pretty consistently. William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yes, I'm just saying the last couple quarters. Philip Snow - President: Yes, yes. William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And so this quarter showed another step up. And I guess the question is, does that continue over the next couple of quarters as well? Philip Snow - President: That's a great question and that's part of what you have to figure out. William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Then the comment on the FX, you had mentioned that there was a margin benefit. Is there a revenue benefit from the FX as well, either on the reported side or the ASV side? Maurizio Nicolelli - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : 98% of our revenues are billed in dollars. William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Correct. Okay, all right, thank you very much. Philip Snow - President: Thank you. Rachel R. Stern - Secretary, General Counsel & Senior Vice President- Strategic Resources : Our next question is from Toni Kaplan at Morgan Stanley. Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about the pricing model. I think the last time you spoke about it, it was about $24,000 for the first terminal and $12,000 for every additional. Is that still how we should be thinking about it, or is there a way to flesh out some of those different client types or different structures that we should be thinking about, maybe wealth management, et cetera? Philip Snow - President: Yes, that price point that you mentioned is \u2013 that's applicable for a certain segment of the market when we're bringing on new clients. Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes. Philip Snow - President: But yes, we have different pricing models for different types of users and different types of clients. Wealth is one where I think we've done a really good job of packaging different options for three different levels of the market. But I don't think we're going to talk about what exactly those price points are for all the different segments of the market on this call. But we do have different models, and it's something that we're continually evaluating in terms of what we should be doing, in terms of pricing and packaging. Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, great. And then when you look at your overall product portfolio, are there any specific areas that you'd like to ramp up more, either organically or through M&A? Philip Snow - President: All of them. We have three major areas that we're focused on now, not that we haven't been before, but in terms of how we've reorganized things. So we have a workstation solutions team, which is really focused on front office professionals. We have an analytics team which is really what you should think of in terms of our PA fixed income quant and risk products. And then we have our contents and technology solutions team, who are really focused on monetizing our content outside of our workstations in whatever way our clients want to consume it, whether it's a feed, on demand, through some sort of partnership. So we're heavily focused on all three areas, and we think we can get all of them into double digits. Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Philip Snow - President: Okay. Rachel R. Stern - Secretary, General Counsel & Senior Vice President- Strategic Resources : Our next question is from Dan Dolev at Jefferies. Dan? Dan Dolev - Jefferies LLC : Hi, Rachel. Thanks for taking my question. Of the 8.9% organic ASV growth, can you quantify specifically \u2013 and I'm sorry if someone already asked that, I didn't catch it. What percent or part of it was due to market share gains versus market growth? And then who are you gaining share from primarily? Thank you. Philip Snow - President: I think we're continually taking share from all of the major competitors, Dan, that you know of in the marketplace. So each quarter it differs a little bit in terms of who those names are and what types of clients, but we feel like we're doing very well on a competitive basis. And just to remind everyone, in terms of the overall market, we're still probably at 5% of that, so we view opportunity against all of our competitors. Dan Dolev - Jefferies LLC : So is it mostly the bigger guys, Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg? Philip Snow - President: Yes, typically it's Reuters, Bloomberg. It's S&P Cap IQ. Those are the three major competitors that we have, other firms that we compete with in more regional markets. Dan Dolev - Jefferies LLC : Got it. And then can you quantify the percent or proportion of growth, of ASV growth that's from share gains versus market growth approximately? Philip Snow - President: I don't think we have that number at our fingertips now. We don't track that very closely. Dan Dolev - Jefferies LLC : Got it. Okay, thanks again. I appreciate it. Philip Snow - President: Yes. Rachel R. Stern - Secretary, General Counsel & Senior Vice President- Strategic Resources : Our next question is from Andre Benjamin at Goldman Sachs. Andre? Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks for taking my question. I had a question. Could you maybe provide a little bit of color on how the fixed income product performed this quarter? And if you are seeing acceleration there, what's driving it? Philip Snow - President: Hey, Andre. This is Phil Snow. Yes, that fixed income product just continues to do exceptionally well. It's very, very strong in a couple of different areas. One is just selling to analysts that do a lot of credit analysis, and the other is on the Portfolio Analytics side of the equation. So it's doing great. We're continuing to reinvest in it, and we don't anticipate that slowing down. Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That was all I had. Philip Snow - President: Thank you. Rachel R. Stern - Secretary, General Counsel & Senior Vice President- Strategic Resources : Our next question is from Andrew Hummel at Oppenheimer. Andrew? Andy T. Hummel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question, just a follow-up to the fixed income product. I know you guys talked about at the Analyst Day possibly rolling out more of I guess fixed income trading platform. I'm just curious what inning you guys are in on that, whether it be with the development or if you've rolled out in the market yet, and just any way to think about the demand for that product from current clients in relation to the analytics platform. Thanks. Philip Snow - President: I would say if the question was fixed income trading, I think we're in the very, very early innings of thinking about that. We're more focused on the portfolio attribution and risk side of the equation. Andy T. Hummel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): All right, thanks. Rachel R. Stern - Secretary, General Counsel & Senior Vice President- Strategic Resources : At this time, we have no more questions. Thank you all for dialing into our call. We will talk to you again in September. Thanks. Operator *: And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now all disconnect.",

At this time, all participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session starts. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Rachel Stern, Senior Vice President, Strategic Resources and General Counsel. Ma\u2019am, you may begin. Rachel Stern : Thank you, operator. Good morning and thanks to all of you for participating today. Welcome to FactSet\u2019s fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. This conference call is being transcribed in real time by FactSet\u2019s CallStreet service and is being broadcast live via the Internet at FactSet.com. A replay of this call will also be available on our Web site. Our call will contain forward-looking statements reflecting management\u2019s expectations based on currently available information. Actual results may differ materially. More information about factors that could affect FactSet\u2019s business and financial results can be found in FactSet\u2019s filings with the SEC. Annual Subscription Value, or ASV, is a key metric for FactSet. Please recall that ASV is a snapshot view of client subscriptions and represents our forward-looking revenues for the next 12 months. Lastly, FactSet undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Joining me today are; Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer; Scott Miller, Director of Global Sales; and Maurizio Nicolelli, FactSet\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Now I\u2019d like to turn the discussion over to Maurizio Nicolelli, Chief Financial Officer. Maurizio Nicolelli : Thank you, Rachel and good morning everyone. Here is where we will focus our time for this call. First, I\u2019ll review the fourth quarter results. Second, I\u2019ll cover guidance for the upcoming first quarter. Third, Phil Snow will discuss our recent agreement to acquire Portware. Lastly, we\u2019ll close by addressing your questions. So let\u2019s proceed with our fourth quarter results. FactSet performed very well in the fourth quarter as we achieved record highs in all of our key metrics, which include ASV, revenues, client count, user count, and EPS. During the quarter, our organic ASV grew 36.9 million continuing our market share expansion. Our growth rate accelerated to 9.2%, up 30 basis points from the third quarter and up 190 basis points versus the prior year. In terms of geography, ASV from our U.S. operations totaled 715 million, while international operations accounted for 343 million or 32% of the total. Buy-side clients, which include off-platform data sales and the market metrics business accounted for 82.5% of ASV, while the remaining ASV was generated by our sell-side clients, which include M&A advisory, capital markets, and equity research businesses. Please note our results contain two discrete items; first, operating expenses included a 3 million pre-tax charge primarily from the vesting of performance-based equity instruments. Second, income tax expense includes a 2.3 million benefit from finalizing prior year tax returns and other discrete items. Excluding these two items, our adjusted operating margin grew to 33.9%, while our adjusted EPS rose 13% to $1.48. This quarter marks our 21st consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth. Let\u2019s now turn to free cash flow. We define free cash flow as cash generated from operations less capital spending. Over the last three months, we generated 73 million in free cash flow, an increase of 12% over the same period last year. Free cash flow increased during the quarter due to high levels of net income, lower income tax payments, and a reduction in deferred fees due to timing of when we invoice our clients. Our cash and investments balance was 182 million, down 500,000 during the quarter. This quarter, we spent 78 million on share repurchases. As of quarter end, 134 million remained available for future share repurchases. We\u2019ve also paid regular quarterly dividends of 18 million. Now, let me walk you through our P&L. Revenues grew in the fourth quarter to 261.8 million, up 9.1% organically over last year. Adjusted operating income, which excludes a 3 million pre-tax charge due to the vesting of performance-based equity instruments grew to 88.7 million and an increase of 11.7% over last year. Adjusted net income advanced 11.9% to 62 million and excludes the after-tax expense of 2.1 million from the vesting of performance-based equity instruments and income tax benefits of 2.3 million from finalizing prior year tax returns and other discrete items. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 13% to a $1.48. In the fourth quarter, our U.S. revenues rose to 176.5 million, which equates to 8% organic revenue growth compared to the same period last year. Non-U.S. revenues rose to 85.3 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, the international revenue growth rate was 11.6%. More specifically, revenues in the fourth quarter from Europe and Asia-Pac regions were 65.2 million and 20.1 million respectively. Excluding foreign currency effects, year-over-year growth rates were 10.4% in Europe and 15.5% in Asia-Pacific. Now, let's now review the revenue growth drivers this quarter. The organic ASV growth rate accelerated to 9.2% and was driven by broad-based global growth from both this buy and sell side. The growth rate from buy-side clients grew 50 basis points to 9 % during the fourth quarter. The growth rate from sell-side clients was 9.8%, a decline sequentially from the third quarter, but up 130 basis points from last year. Our net user count increased by 3,210, which is our highest ever increase in a single quarter. Net user count of FactSet terminals totaled 62,205 at quarter end, which represented a year-over-year growth rate of 14%. The fourth quarter typically includes new users from both this buy and sell side as our largest clients bring in their new higher classes. Sell-side growth accounted for a little more than half the user increase. Growth in the IPO and M&A marketplaces have also been a boost for our banking clients this year. During the year, FactSet released a new user interface with an emphasis on the ease-of-use and search. We believe this new UI also contributed to the net user increase. Also contributing to our growth, we have seen accelerated demand for our fixed income portfolio products, portfolio analytics suite of products, sales of equity attribution, and multi-asset class risk models. Our stable of value-add products in the equity and fixed income analytics suite boosted strong sales in the U.S., European, and Asia-Pac regions. Our solutions in the portfolio services space also continued to do extremely well, as clients look for areas to outsource services around daily integration, enrichment, quality control, and process monitoring. They are turning more and more to our managed services in this space. Selling content in both data feeds continues to be a strong and developing product line for us. We\u2019ve had success leveraging the distribution network of third-party providers. Large clients value our industry-leading content such as StreetAccount news , geographic revenue, and entity data, FactSet Fundamentals, FactSet Estimate, and FactSet Ownership. Finally, our research management solutions, what we call RMS which includes both our IRN and Code Red products continue to grow in the fourth quarter as clients now have choice between our hosted and local solutions. Now, let's take a look at the expense side. Total operating expenses were 176.1 million. Our adjusted operating margin was 33.9%, which excludes the 3 million pre-tax charge from vesting performance-based equity instruments. Cost of services, expressed as a percentage of revenues, increased by 230 basis points compared to the year-ago fourth quarter. This increase was driven by a higher compensation expense including stock-based compensation. Employee compensation expense grew as we expanded headcount of 11% year-over-year, primarily from our new college graduate hiring in consulting and software engineering and acquired employees in connection with the February 2015 Code Red acquisition. Stock-based compensation grew due to the vesting of performance-based equity instruments. SG&A expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues decreased by 180 basis points in the fourth quarter compared to the year-ago period due to lower compensation expense from employees performing SG&A roles and a reduction in occupancy costs, partially offset by higher stock-based compensation expense. At the end of our fiscal year, we had 7,360 employees, a year-over-year increase of 11%. We hired 409 net new employees this quarter, primarily within our software engineering and consulting classes. The fourth quarter effective tax rate was 27.7%, down from 30.4% a year ago driven by income tax benefits of 2.3 million from finalizing prior year tax returns and other discrete items. Excluding these income tax benefits, our current year annual effective tax rate was 30.3% down 10 basis points over last year. Now let's turn to guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Our guidance does not include results from the expected acquisition of Portware. We will update out guidance when the acquisition closes. We expect that revenues will range between 265 million and 269 million. Operating margin should range between 33% and 34%. The annual effective tax rate should range between 31% and 32%. This range also takes into account the expired Federal R&D tax credit and assumes it will not be re-enacted before November 30, 2015. We expect that diluted EPS will range between $1.46 and $1.48. This estimate accounts for the expired Federal R&D tax credit which has the effect of lowering each end of the range by $0.02 compared to the just completed fourth quarter. The midpoint of the range suggests 13% year-over-year growth after adjusting for the exploration of the R&D credit. Please note the R&D tax credit has expired only once in its 34-year history without being retroactively re-enacted to previous years. Should the R&D tax credit be re-enacted on or before November 30, 2015 diluted EPS would range between $1.51 and $1.53 in fact that would also recognize a benefit of $0.14 per share if the credit could be retroactively applied to previous periods. And now I would like to turn the discussion over to Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer. Phil Snow : Thank you, Maurizio and good morning everyone. My prepared remarks today will cover two topics. First, I'll cover the strategic rationale behind acquiring Portware given that this will be FactSet's largest acquisition. I will also touch upon our capital allocation strategy. Second, I will offer some thoughts about our 2015 results. Let\u2019s start with Portware, yesterday we entered into a definitive purchase agreement to acquire all of the outstanding membership interests of Portware for $265 million in cash, partially offset by expected income tax benefits with an estimated present value of $50 million. We plan to fund the acquisition with an expansion of our existing revolving credit facility. We expect it will close in late October or early November. From many perspectives I am very excited about the acquisition of Portware. Strategically Portware will be a platform to expand our presence in large global asset managers by becoming part of their trading ecosystem. We expect to combine our leading expertise and portfolio analytics with Portware's innovative suites of trade automation solutions and cross-sell the solutions at FactSet's blue-chip global buy-side client base. To be clear, we still need to do significant work over the next couple of years to execute our plans and capture market share that is meaningful to our overall growth rate. Importantly, we believe that eliminating different systems between middle and front offices, it's high on the wish list of our global asset manager clients. We can streamline our clients' workforce by capturing more of the trading lifecycle and integrating it into FactSet. I very much look forward to welcoming all the employees of Portware to the FactSet team. I can tell you that the high level of internal excitement and momentum to unifying our product, enhancing the workflow of clients and driving of the value of our joint offering. Regarding our capital allocation strategy little has really changed. We have been looking at many ways to expand our trading capabilities over the past few years during that time we developed a strong belief that buying a proven winner in the marketplace with the best path forward. We analyzed many opportunities and have been impressed by what we found at Portware. Our acquisition strategy has not changed since I have assumed the CEO role and I do not anticipate a significant shift in our strategy on this front. Regarding the size of the acquisitions and FactSet\u2019s leveraging of its balance sheet, I have a few thoughts I would like to share with investors. One, the additional $265 million invest to our balance sheet is more a function of record low interest rates rather than a strategic shift. Like most corporations we focused on returning capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividend payments in light of the low returns available on cash balances over the last few years. We believe that our return on capital far exceeds our cost of capital by a wide margin. We continue to ensure the luxury of great financial flexibility given annual free cash flow generation of $281 million. Second, the size of this acquisition is well correlated to the size of the opportunity for FactSet. FactSet has made amazing strides in growing organically, but at the same time I recognize along with our executive team that there were times when an acquisition rather than building a system internally is the best course of action to put us on a path to capture significant business on a global scale. Finally, we view the task of optimizing capital very seriously. Whether investing in existing operations, acquisitions or returning capital back to shareholders, maximizing our EPS accretion is what drives us. Excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets, we believe the Portware acquisition will be accretive to earnings right away and open up future market opportunity, in our core client base which will drive future growth. Now let me turn my attention to the just completed 2015 fiscal year. I'm proud of our many achievements and want to thank every FactSet employee for their hard work in driving up shareholder value. Our key metrics accelerated throughout the year and the accompanying growth rates reached three year highs. Our organic ASP growth rate accelerated 190 basis points to 9.2%. We crossed the billion dollar mark on ASV in February and ended the year at $1.06 billion. Clients and users reached record high including a record Q4 of the user editions. Free cash flow grew by 13.5% to a record $281 million. We returned $323 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Return on equity was 46% increasing our three year average returns of 41%. We continue to reinvest in our business, as we increased global headcount by 11% in order to fuel organic growth. We completed strategic acquisitions in the past 12 months including Code Red. EPS grew by 16% in 2015. Finally, we established a path to a large opportunity within our core client base by signing an agreement to acquire Portware. To summarize, we had a strong year and I believe we are well-positioned for future growth in fiscal 2016. We have been successful in expanding our market share against competing products, we've made tremendous progress accelerating all of our key metrics and we look forward to achieving our aggressive but achievable goals in 2016. Thank you and we are now ready for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session for today's conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ms. Manav Patnaik from Barclays Capital. Ma'am your line is now open. Greg Bardi : Hi this is actually Greg calling on for Manav. Just wanted to ask a little bit more about the cross-sell opportunity with Portware, and maybe along those lines, who is the typical Portware user for the buy-side client and are a lot of these guys already FactSet users? Phil Snow : Hi Greg, it's Phil Snow. So Portware is a great strategic fit for us. Many of the more recent wins have been at the large buy-side client user base which is one of our core areas as well. We see this as a great strategic fit. We have, as you know, great penetration within the middle office of our clients, and we have a good footprint with analysts, portfolio managers, and traders, and this really I think gives us a great opportunity to further penetrate the buy side trading user community. Greg Bardi : And then some of the articles I've read about Portware have been talking about their rapid growth on the FX side. Can you talk about your thoughts there, what if what FactSet currently offers to the FX side, and what you guys are thinking there? Phil Snow : We don\u2019t currently have a lot of FX capabilities, which is one of the exciting parts about this acquisition. What I can say is that our strategic focus, as you've seen has to become more of a multi-asset class solution for our clients, and we\u2019re excited about the fact that Portware is a multi-asset class solution and gives us more flexibility and opportunities in that area. Operator : Our next question comes from Ms. Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Ma'am your line is now open. Toni Kaplan : First, could you give us a sense of the growth in wealth management users during the quarter. Was that a key contributor to the 14%? Scott Miller : Hi Toni, it's Scott Miller. We don\u2019t break out growth rates by client or product segment, but we were very happy, we've been very happy with the growth in the wealth space, it's continuing to outperform our overall growth rate and we see great opportunities remaining in that space. Toni Kaplan : And then secondly, now that you've announced a large acquisition in Portware, how does that effect, I guess your appetite for future acquisitions and can you talk about what you view as sort of an optimal leverage level, especially given that rates are so low as you mentioned? Phil Snow : Hi Toni, it's Phil Snow. So I don\u2019t -- so as I mentioned in the comments, our strategy hasn\u2019t changed. Where it comes to M&A, we continue to look at a lot of different interesting opportunities that come across our desk, either in the content analytics or platform delivery area. This is our largest acquisition with the focus on a dollar basis, but as a percentage of FactSet\u2019s size at the time, we've made other acquisitions that are this large, so we feel like we still have a tremendous amount of flexibility. If we wanted to execute on something of a similar or larger size and we certainly have seen some things that have come across, which is nothing that we've been this excited about executing on. Toni Kaplan : And do you have the target leverage level or it is just whatever makes sense you will just evaluate it? Maurizio Nicolelli : We still have tremendous -- hi, it's Maurizio Nicolelli. We still have tremendous flexibility in our capital structure. We will have 300 million in debt when our EBITDA is far larger than that, and so with our capacity to continue to allocate capital to where it\u2019s best allocated whether it is a share repurchase dividend or acquisitions is still very much there, so there is no target level as of today. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Shlomo Rosenbaum. Sir, your line is now open. Shlomo Rosenbaum : See, how should we think about the growth of Portware? In the first quarter, the company had 40% year-over-year growth, is that kind of indicative of the way the company is growing? Is it continuing to accelerate from there, we are just trying to understand how we should think about this over I guess the next year or so? Phil Snow : I guess I will answer that, Shlomo, I'm not sure where that 40% comes from, but what I can say is that Portware has had a tremendous amount of recent success in the marketplace, and this is really driven by a significant shift in their strategy, so they have shifted towards creating really good analytics in automation with freeing up the trade and to spend their time in areas where they can have the most value. So, we really love the analytics component of the Portware offering, and we see that as a very good complement to FactSet and the portfolio suite of products that we've done so well with. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Two, I'll tell you, where I got that from. On their Web site, they put out in the first quarter that they have grown 40% year-over-year. That was something where I got that from, it seems that the strategy you're talking about is indicative of really good growth, and I was just wondering if there is something when you think about the 60 or so clients that they've got right now, how many clients of the close to 3,000 that you have do you think this kind of a platform could be potentially sold into? Maurizio Nicolelli : There is a lot of them I think, so FactSet\u2019s got a great buy-side client base, it is 80% of our ASV, that's about a 75% overlap with their client base. So, 75% of the Portware clients are already FactSet clients., so that other 25% represents cross-sell opportunity for other products, but the largest cross-sell opportunity is for Portware to penetrate the rest of the buy-side client base. Shlomo Rosenbaum : But what size of clients, I'm trying to get into what size of clients would be buying something like this, you talked about blue chip clients, is there a certain asset under management where someone will spend? Maurizio Nicolelli : You could -- so some of our very largest clients today on the buy-side use Portware, some of the very largest sovereigns globally use Portware. They also have good penetration within the hedge fund space. Shlomo Rosenbaum : And is this the straight out how the software priced, can you discuss that a little bit? Maurizio Nicolelli : That is something we can't discuss Shlomo. Operator : The next question comes from Mr. Alex Kramm of UBS. Sir, your line is now open. Alex Kramm : Just maybe going back to the base business for a second here, I mean obviously organic growth rates continue to accelerate really strong just may be can you talk to us about what you're seeing out there and your confidence level to get back to that or not to get to that 10% growth as you've outlined as a goal and I guess the two things that are known is on the buy-side increasingly we are hearing with all the volatility in markets asset managers are pushing up budget, AOM is down and on the sell-side, I think you highlighted M&A and smaller boutiques as an area of growth and it seems like that M&A cycle might be coming too so just wondering what you're seeing out there and how you're feeling in the context of getting back to 10% with that backdrop? Scott Miller : Hi Alex it is Scott Miller. I'll take a couple pieces of that, I think, clearly volatility in the market is something that we watch we talk to our clients a lot about it. The thing about volatility for us as well is it requires better data, and more analytics and better information in general which plays right into our sweet spot so with the volatility comes opportunity for us. We feel really good about the opportunities out there across both buy side and sell side, our growth has been very broad based across our regions and our client base. So we feel good about the opportunities going forward. Alex Kramm : And then I guess secondly, just going back to the acquisition and the strategy. I think you touched upon this a few times but when I think about FactSet I think a lot of people still think of you as like a desktop business that has to some degree a pretty strong value proposition and now it seems like you\u2019re going into some other parts and becoming maybe a little bit more of a broad based financial technology provider within this BMS I mean there is probably the other part of the value chain that you can now sale when you think about I don\u2019t know order management and other given parts that fit in between. So just wondering, should we be thinking about FactSet a little bit more the broad thin tech provider that might be going after some more competitive businesses or some more -- yes businesses that you might not have the same kind of modes that you have today or how would you defend that? Scott Miller : I think the easiest way to think about our business and the way that we think about it internally is we have very great -- we have great penetration within the middle office of our clients, the performance, risk, portfolio area. We also have really good deployments within the front offices of our buy-side and sell-side clients and we also have a business where we provide solutions outside of the work station. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re organized, that\u2019s how we think and we think there is a huge opportunities for us in all of those dimensions particularly within the largest clients in the market. Operator : The next question comes from Mr. David Chu of Merrill Lynch. Sir your line is now open. David Chu : I think the press release mentioned 41 million in ASV for Portware, is this the right way to think about annual revenue contribution in year one? Phil Snow : Yes. David Chu : Can you just kind of speak to the margin profile of the company? Phil Snow : We included the accretion, dilution analysis in the press release. The only other thing you can really add there is just from that EBITDA margin is right around 20% right now. David Chu : About 20%, okay, great, and then do you guys continue to do a good job lowering SG&A as a percentage of revenue, I just wanted to see how much more room you have there and kind of what you\u2019re doing to kind of deliver the leverage? Phil Snow : In general we look at -- we manage the business based on the operating margin overall. The difference between cost of service and SG&A is really a function of where we bring in employees. The majority of our employees that were brought in the fourth quarter were in cost of services from both our consulting and software engineering classes. But at the end of the day we\u2019re really looking at the total operating margin that we\u2019re managing to. Operator : Next question comes from Mr. Peter Heckmann of Avondale. Sir, your line is now open. Peter Heckmann : Just a couple of follow-up questions, Phil, when you talk about looking to continue to expand the asset classes for FactSet, and again it goes to a little bit more of the legacy view of FactSet and that is clearly evolving but you primarily consider to be an equity solution and you have been adding fixed income capabilities, and that type of capabilities. What type of investments do you think are needed to really develop a robust call it buy asset class solution and as the CEO do you still think of the company as managing the long-term towards flat operating margins and incremental profits in your platform or might this require some additional incremental investments that could pressure margins? Phil Snow : So, I\u2019ll start with the second part of that question first which is yes, the philosophy here hasn\u2019t changed. We want to drive double-digit EPS growth rate. Keep our margin flat and reinvest everything we can back in the business for our clients and our shareholders essentially. So every year we go to a robust investment process exercise where we look at all of the different opportunities available to us within different areas of the business. And this year again fixed income and multi-asset class is very prominent in the ideas and we continue to fund that we continue to overweight that versus some of our other areas. But there are lots of areas that we need to continue to invest in, in the business, it\u2019s not just strictly adding into fixed income and some other asset classes. Peter Heckmann : Okay. And then just a follow-up question, maybe this is better for Maurizio. But on the assets from eps.com was there any measurable level of ASV contribution with that small acquisition? And then number two is just can you comment on the pricing environment and perhaps quantify how much pricing is contributing to overall organic growth for fiscal \u201915? Phil Snow : So this is Phil Snow again. So for the eps.com acquisition, no, there wasn\u2019t any significant revenue that was part of that acquisition. It was more of a content acquisition and in terms of the pricing I think you can expect the same thing if I understood the question correctly the same as in previous years where that -- we had very low single-digits in terms of our pricing over the year. Operator : Next question comes from Mr. Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Sir, your line is now open. Keith Housum : First question for you on Portware, from a geographic perspective is there significant geographic overlap you guys have or opportunity to Portware or perhaps for you guys which is R&D or not? Phil Snow : I think the Portware, I don't have the numbers right in front of me, but this very good overlap with the global offices that we have which is great from an integration standpoint and I think there're like us their bulk of their revenues are probably in the Americas and they are starting to see a lot of success globally as well. So, I think this is very good overlap, there's good large clients and prospects in every region. Keith Housum : And on the core business, as we look at sort of the market volatility over the past few weeks, is there any signs from the customers that there's concerns about their hiring trends going for the rest of this calendar year? Scott Miller : Hi, Keith, it is Scott Miller. We haven't really seen any of that indication we clearly stay close to our clients throughout this volatility. It is felt still fairly healthy as we look at the sell-side graduating classes that we just saw were reasonably healthy, and attrition rates were nothing of know so, we haven't seen anything that alarms us in that space so far. Operator : Next question comes from Mr. Will Warmington of Wells Fargo. Sir, your line is now open. Will Warmington : So, a question for you on the geographic growth, I wanted to ask about strong international growth and you had mentioned strengthened Europe and also Asia, just wanted to ask specifically what kind of products you were seeing the most successful in there, whether it's wealth management, fixed income or the legacy desktop or one of the others? Scott Miller : Hi Bill it is Scott. It's pretty broad-based, there is the -- we've seen in across both sell-side and buy-side in Asia-Pac and EMEA. We structured our regions so that -- eight months ago to have international split in the EMEA, and Asia-Pac and so looking at across those two, it's been fairly broad-based in terms of where the growth is coming from. Will Warmington : And then the, on the employee count, I know that was up almost 11% but it sounded like a fair amount of that was coming from the acquisitions that have been done. If you excluded those acquisitions what would that more normalized headcount growth look like? Maurizio Nicolelli : The acquisition of Code Red only added 40 employees in total, so the large majority of the adds during the year are from new hirings that we've done. Will Warmington : Is that mostly offshore or is that onshore? Scott Miller : It's a healthy mix. Will Warmington : And then final question was just wanted to ask on Portware, whether there were any client concentrations we should be aware of? Scott Miller : No, I think they do have some large client deployments which is probably why we're so excited about this it's not particularly concentrated at the top if it's a risk question. Operator : Next question comes from Mr. Tim McHugh of William Blair & Company. Sir, your line is now open. Tim McHugh : Just on Portware. Can you talk about the, I guess medium term expectations for margins. I guess, just given the 20% EBITDA margin on the multiples that you paid, it seems rather high, so is that multiple a reflection of you think the margins will move towards the corporate average or is it about the growth potential more or so? Scott Miller : So, every acquisition, we look at a unique, as you would expect and we do a tremendous amount of due diligence and we think that it is the growth rate of the future opportunity, the strategic fit and the future margins that we projected make the price that we paid a great deal for FactSet shareholders. Tim McHugh : And maybe just a follow-up on that I guess this is we see competitors in your and I guess related space also paid fairly high multiples rather kind of financial data business is this -- is the pricing for acquisitions getting more and more competitive in the sector and I guess how is that influence then as you think about the strategy you talk about trying to expand the things you do within the broader financial kind of data sector? Scott Miller : So, we certainly noticed some froth over the last year or two as we've looked at strategic acquisitions, but I would not say that the froth played into our thinking in terms of the pricing for this acquisition. We feel like we paid a very fair value for the asset. Operator : Next question comes from Mr. Dan Dolev of Jefferies. Sir, your line is now open. Dan Dolev : Can you talk about -- so it looks like organic growth -- revenue growth in the U.S. is decelerated about 60 basis points, I know the competitor is tougher, but there is a bit of a bifurcation between the accelerating ASV and the decelerating organic growth. Can you talk a little bit about -- what's trending that and how we should think about the coming quarters, the run rate for organic growth in the U.S.? Thanks. Scott Miller : Dan it is Scott from my perspective, over the year we've seen acceleration across three regions, Americas is our most mature market and so the other regions are accelerating faster, but I feel, I'm very comfortable with the growth prospects for all other regions and I like what we see in the Americas. Dan Dolev : And then just one housekeeping question, it looks like one of the metrics is no longer disclosed more specifically the number of workstations, can you maybe discuss what's behind that if I missed it then sorry? Scott Miller : We do have the number of workstations in the press release. I think we were up 3,200 workstations during the quarter. Operator : Next question comes from Mr. Patrick O'Shaughnessy with the Raymond James. Sir, your line is now open. Patrick O'Shaughnessy: So first question is Symphony, the startup messaging service and technology platform is certainly got a lot of price just curious what your read is on that as a product and if there is any opportunity for FactSet to partner with Symphony in any way? Phil Snow : Hi, Patrick, it's Phil Snow. So as we announced we have joined the Symphony Foundation and we -- I think this is consistent with what we've said the past, we believe that open messaging -- an open messaging community is best for the entire marketplace. So we fully support that and that will be something that our users will be able to use. Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Got it, missed that. Thank you for pointing that out. The follow-up from me, obviously McGraw Hill bought SNL. During the quarter, they announced it and I think that acquisition really highlighted the dominance of SNL in some key verticals and I think particularly financial services and real estate, curious if there is any opportunity for FactSet to maybe more directly go after those verticals and encroach on a market opportunity that still seems pretty powerful? Phil Snow : Yes, it's a great question I mean they have built a great product. They go credibly deep in some sectors. We go deep as well. We don't go quite to that level of depth within particular industries and when we're evaluating our investments each year we think about that is one of our options, but we sit side-by-side today with SNL quite happily in a lot of our client bases, a lot of things that FactSet does that SNL can\u2019t provide. Operator : Next question comes from Mr. Glenn Greene from Oppenheimer. Sir, your line is now open. Glenn Greene : I just want to go back to the margin profile of Portware, is it just a function of it's at this point what sort of 40 million revenue run rate it just hasn't really scaled and that the incremental margins are very high, is that kind of how you think about it overtime? Phil Snow : If we think about it right now, it has approximately 20% margin, it will grow overtime as we expect the business to grow and get more in line with FactSet's margin going forward as we reinvest into the business also. Glenn Greene : And then strategically this is -- it's a little bit different than FactSet sort of typical acquisition obviously sort of more focused on sort of the trading and more data and analytics and algorithms, is that an increased focus that we could see sort of other acquisitions or internal developments toward this direction overtime as well? Phil Snow : We've been building out our own buy-side trading solution for some time. This really gives a lot of additional heft to it. We just didn't feel like we had the internal expertise to build for this particular workflow, but we continue -- for all of these adjacent workflows within our largest clients, we continue to evaluate the partner build or buy option for us. Glenn Greene : And then finally just on the very strong user growth in the quarter the 3,200 and I know it's seasonally a strong quarter but this was seemed better than normal seasonality, was there anything usual in the quarter one big client that had a lot of adds or anything like that? And is there any sort of like sequential concern going into 1Q that we get some fall-off? Scott Miller : Hi, Glenn, it's Scott. Nothing that specifically calls out there was very wide spread. Sell-side was a little bit higher in the overall number than buy-side was, not surprising. We do see good growth in that sell-side workstation this time of the year as the new-hire class has come in, but it really was just good growth all over the place and an estimate to our salesforce and client service group who are out there and they were doing a terrific job and it showed. Operator : Next question comes from Mr. Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Sir, your line is now open. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Maurizio, the acquisition is supposed to go from being $0.03 dilutive to becoming accretive in 12 months, how are the implication as you guys get to FactSet like operating margins in about 12 months? And I was just wondering is this a function of revenue growth or is there some kind of particular cost takeout that you're planning in terms of real estate integration or a main office integration really, I am just trying to gauge that usually the Company of this size it would be a revenue growth type of function, but I do want to make sure I am thinking about it properly? Maurizio Nicolelli : Hi, Shlomo, it's Maurizio. You have it correct. This is a function of revenue. It is very little cost taking out in this process. It really is all about revenue growth. Shlomo Rosenbaum : So it's really the significant solid revenue growth that's lifting the margins over here and that's kind of underpinning the valuation of the Company and the opportunity and every like that there is no way to be thinking about this? Maurizio Nicolelli : Right, it's providing the substance over the next 12 months. Scott Miller : Thanks every one. See you again next quarter. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Senior Vice President, Strategic Resources and General Counsel, Ms. Rachel Stern. You may now begin. Rachel Stern : Thank you, operator. Good morning and thanks to all of you for participating today. Welcome to FactSet\u2019s first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. This conference call is being transcribed in real time by FactSet\u2019s CallStreet service and is being broadcast live via the Internet at FactSet.com. A replay of this call will also be available on our website. Our call will contain forward-looking statements reflecting management\u2019s expectations based on currently available information. Actual results may differ materially. More information about factors that could affect FactSet\u2019s business and financial results can be found in FactSet\u2019s filings with the SEC. Annual Subscription Value, or ASV, is a key metric for FactSet. Please recall that ASV is a snapshot view of client subscriptions and represents our forward-looking revenues for the next 12 months. Lastly, FactSet undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Joining me today are; Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer; Scott Miller, Director of Global Sales; and Maurizio Nicolelli, FactSet\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. And now I\u2019d like to turn the discussion over to Phil. Phil Snow : Thank you, Rachel. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the call. For the ninth quarter in a row, we continued strong and escalating ASV growth. This consistent performance was further enhanced this quarter by the strategic acquisition of Portware, which enables us to expand our presence and provides impetus for new growth. Seeking to continue to return strong value to our shareholders we added to our share repurchase program. Our results sync with the long term objectives of FactSet. Creating growth, driving solid financial performance and providing significant capital returns to shareholders. Here are the three areas that I will cover; first our continued acceleration of ASV growth. Second, the closing of the Portware acquisition and third, the expansion of our share repurchase program. Let's begin with the first quarter ASV results. This quarter the organic ASV growth accelerated to 9.4%. Excluding FX and acquired ASV from Portware, ASV rose $12.1 million compared to $9.2 million in the prior yearend quarter -- prior year quarter. Total ASV excluding FX totaled $1.1 billion at November 30. We're pleased that the ASV growth rate has been on an upward trend every quarter over the last eight quarters rising 90 bps since November 2014 and 440 bps since November 2013. Drivers of this improvement have been broad based as the organic growth rates from our buy side and sell side businesses have improved to 9.3% and 10% respectively. Our buy side business includes traditional asset management clients, hedge funds and wealth managers off-platform data feed sales and the Portware and market metrics businesses. The sell side includes M&A advisory, capital markets and equity research professionals. Let's now go through the key contributors to our growth this quarter. The organic ASV growth rate acceleration to 9.4% was driven by growth on both the buy and the sell side. Buy side clients grew 30 basis points to 9.3%. Sell side growth was 10%, up 20 basis points from the just completed fourth quarter. Our annual client retention rate in terms of the number of actual clients increased to 95%, up from 93% a year ago. In addition, our client retention rate when expressed as a percentage of ASV continues to be greater than 95% of ASV. We saw solid growth in our core buy side client base, particularly in the Americas and Europe. Our buy side client base remains healthy as we continue to see clients consolidate on to our platform. Growth was consistently strong amongst traditional asset managers, hedge funds and wealth. Further contributing to buy side growth was the strong performance of our analytic suite. Our fixed income, equity and multi asset class risk attribution and performance offering, boosted sales in all regions. Our RMS or Research Management Solutions which include our IRN and Code Red products performed well in the quarter. Code Red, which we acquired in February of this year, has performed very well as a local solution to supplement our hosted IRN solution. Our CTS or Contact and Technology Solutions business further accelerated during the quarter. The CTS suite provides workflow solutions for our clients outside of our terminal business. This quarter CTS showed increased contribution from our core investment management business. Finally, net user count of FactSet terminals increased this quarter by 964 users and total 63,169 at quarter end. Overall users are up 14% year-over-year, reflecting the overall continued expansion of our footprint in both the buy and sell side markets. During the quarter we added Portware to our portfolio of products, which was funded by our existing revolving credit facility. Strategically this acquisition will expand our presence in large global asset managers by becoming part of their trading ecosystem. As a reminder, Portware clients are top tier buy side institutions and asset managers. We expect to combine our leading expertise and portfolio analytics with Portware's innovative suite of trade automation solutions and cross-sell the solution to FactSet's blue-chip global buy-side client base. Integration in the first 45 days is off to a strong start and we're excited to execute on the Portware pipeline and open up new opportunities for the future. Lastly at the regular quarterly meeting yesterday, our Board of Directors authorized the addition of $250 million to our share repurchase program. Today $342 million is available for future share repurchases and we're focused on returning capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividend payments in light of the low returns available on cash balances. In the current interest rate environment, we believe we have the right mix of debt and share repurchases. In addition to our share repurchase program, we paid regular quarterly dividends of $18 million. When aggregating regular quarterly dividends paid and shares repurchases, we've returned $318 million to shareholders over the past 12 months. In summary, I\u2019m very pleased with the quarter's performance. We continue to accelerate our growth rate. We closed the Portware acquisition, which we expect will add significant new growth opportunities for the future and we continue our commitment to meaningfully return capital to our shareholders. Now let me turn it over to Maurizio, who will give a more detailed look into our first quarter performance. Maurizio Nicolelli : Thank you, Phil and good morning to everyone on the call. As you heard from Phil, there has been great progress in growth and building for the future. Here is a breakdown of our strong results both from a revenue perspective as well as an operational view. Revenues grew in the first quarter to $270.5 million. Organic revenue, which excludes $6 million in revenues from acquisitions completed within the last 12 months and the effects of foreign currency grew 9% over last year. Our organic revenue growth rate in the first quarter was lower than our 9.4% organic ASV growth rate due to a significant amount of ASV closings late in the quarter and a purchase accounting adjustment to acquired revenues as a result of the Portware acquisition. Adjusted operating income, which excludes $690,000 of professional fee related to the Portware acquisition, grew to $88 million, an increase of 9.6% from the first quarter last year. Adjusted net income grew 8.2% to $60.4 million and adjusted diluted EPS grew 9.1% to $1.44. This quarter U.S. revenues rose to $182.2 million, excluding revenue acquired from the acquisitions of Code Red and Portware. Organic revenues in the U.S. were up 8.2% compared to the first quarter a year ago. Non-U.S revenues increased to $88.3 million. Revenues from our Europe and Asia Pacific regions for the first quarter were $67 million and $21.3 million respectively. Excluding foreign currency and acquired revenues from acquisition completed in the past 12 months, the international growth rate was 10.6%. This growth rate breaks down into 9.3% from Europe and 14.9% from Asia Pacific respectively. Now let\u2019s take a look at the expense side. Total operating expenses for the first quarter were $183.2 million. Our adjusted operating margin this quarter was 32.5%, which excludes professional fees related to the Portware acquisition. First quarter cost of services, expressed as a percentage of revenues, increased by 220 basis points compared to the year-ago period. The increase was driven by higher compensation and amortization of intangible assets. Employee compensation and expense grew as we expanded headcount 15% year-over-year from new hires and from acquired employees in connection with the Code Red and Portware acquisitions. The increase in amortization of intangible assets relates to the recent acquisition of Portware. SG&A expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues decreased by 140 basis points in the first quarter compared to the year-ago period due to lower compensation expense from employees performing SG&A roles and a reduction in occupancy costs, partially offset by higher professional fees related to the closing of the Portware acquisition. At the end of our first fiscal quarter we had over 7,900 employees, an increase of 8% in global headcount during the past three months. We hired 407 net new employees this quarter primarily from our sales and consulting recruiting classes in the U.S. and Europe and our content collection classes in Hyderabad and Manila. In addition, we added 166 employees from the Portware acquisition. The first quarter effective tax rate was 31.4% up 60 basis points over last year. The U.S. Federal R&D tax credit expired on December 31, 2014, and was not extended as of November 30, 2015, the end of FactSet\u2019s first quarter. Although the U.S. Congress recently advanced bills to retroactively enact the tax credit, these bills had not been signed at the law. Accordingly, FactSet did not recognize any income tax benefit from the R&D tax credit during the just completed first quarter. The current impact of the U.S. federal R&D tax credit to FactSet is estimated to be $0.19 in EPS per year. Had FactSet been able to recognize the full value of income tax benefits from the R&D tax credit in the first quarter of both fiscal 2016 and 2015, diluted EPS would have increased by $0.05 per share each quarter. If the U.S. federal R&D tax credit is reenacted by the end of our second quarter and can be retroactively applied to the period beginning January 1, 2015, and ending on December 31, 2016m FactSet would recognize an income tax benefit of $0.18 per share. Free cash flow during the last three months was $57 million, a decrease of $10 million from the same period last year. Our cash and investments balance was $203 million, up $21 million during the quarter. We define free cash flow as a cash generated from operations less capital spending. Free cash flow was down year-over-year due to increased capital expenditures of $10 million, primarily related to the build-out of our new New York City office space. Our DSOs were 32 days at the end of the first quarter compared to 33 days in the prior year period. Now let's turn to our guidance for Q2 of fiscal 2016. We expect revenues will range between $280 million and $286 million. Operating margin should range between 31% and 32%, which includes a 160 basis point reduction from the recent acquisition of Portware. We expect our annual effective tax rate to range between 28.5% and 29.5% and assumes the U.S. Federal R&D tax credit will be reenacted by the end of the second quarter and could be retroactively applied to the period between January 1, 2015 and ending on December 31, 2016. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $1.49 and $1.53. If the U.S. Federal R&D tax credit is not reenacted by February 29, 2016, each end of the EPS range would decrease by $0.05 per share. At FactSet we continue to focus on creating growth, driving solid financial performance and providing significant capital returns to shareholders. Our overall performance in the first quarter shows we are committed to positioning the company for the long term growth, expanding our market share against competing products and while increasing capital returns to shareholders. Thank you for joining our call this morning. We're now ready for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Sir, your line is now open. Joseph Foresi : Could you just give us some idea\u2026 Phil Snow : We didn't get the question, sorry. Operator : Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Good morning. Thank you. Can you hear me? Phil Snow : Yes, we can. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Thank you for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask a little bit the revenue and adjusted EPS came in the lower end of the updated guidance range, which was given in kind of the middle of quarter after you guys cleared the Portware acquisition. I was wondering if you could comment a little bit about the delta from the midpoint of the guidance range where that came from, was it due to change in the accounting in the Portware business? I know you mentioned something about the purchase accounting. Was there something different in kind of the core business if you can jump into that a little bit? Phil Snow : Sure, I would be happy to Shlomo. It's Phil Snow. Thank you for the question. For us really the most positive thing is the ASV acceleration, but I did want to go into a little bit more detail about a couple of things Maurizio mentioned in the script. So there are really two things that contributed to the lower revenue and EPS. One was that we closed Portware quicker than we thought we were going to and because of the purchasing accounting adjustment that contributed. And then secondly, as Maurizio pointed out, a huge percentage of our ASV or revenue this quarter got booked in November, the very last month. So both of those items combined having to about $1.1 million in revenue, which flowed down to EPS as well and that was really the main thing. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Can you talk a little bit about what the implied organic revenue growth is at both ends of the guidance for next quarter so kind of stripping out Portware and then also the ForEx? Maurizio Nicolelli : Yes Shlomo, this is Maurizio, if you look at our guidance, which is $280 million and $286 million, if you take the middle of that range, our organic growth rate is 9.5% which is right in line with ASV growth. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Great and I\u2019m going to let other people get in. I just wanted to sneak in one other one. Is there any seasonality to Portware's business we need to be aware of? Phil Snow : Thanks Shlomo its Phil. No, I don\u2019t think so. There is really no seasonality to their business. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Great. Thank you. Phil Snow : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next caller comes from Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Sir your line is now open. Joseph Foresi : Hello. Hi, can you hear me? Phil Snow : Yeah. Joseph Foresi : Am I cutting in and out? Phil Snow : We have you now. Joseph Foresi : Okay. Great. Just on the 30 new clients, can we get a sense of what the makeup is there? And has that deferred compared to other quarters? Scott Miller : Hi, it's Scott. It was pretty broad based. There wasn\u2019t anything dramatically different quarter on quarter. We did see the good uptick in some corporations, hedge funds and the wealth space, which is consistent with new client acquisition and also some of our core buy side clients in the U.S. as well. So it\u2019s fairly consistent. Joseph Foresi : Okay. And then on Portware, I think you said it's going to be accretive in 2017. Can you give us some sense of how the integration is going and where you\u2019re going to be able to kind of get the margin profile up to what you\u2019re looking for? Phil Snow : Sure. It's Phil Snow. Let me talk a little bit about the integration. So its early days for us. We're incredibly excited. We\u2019ve had overwhelmingly positive feedback from our clients on both sides. And there is just really great overlapping in terms of the culture and both the focus that we both have on multi-asset class and analytics. So we\u2019ve begun the integration. We\u2019ve integrated the company, the people that\u2019s gone well and there are a couple of projects that we have that we\u2019re excited about. I think the biggest opportunity for us is linking it to our portfolio analytics suite and the synergies that we see coming from that. Joseph Foresi : Okay. And then just finally as a follow-up to that, anything you want to point out from a margin perspective in the next couple of quarters including or excluding Portware? Thanks. Portware I\u2019m sorry. Maurizio Nicolelli : Hi Joe, it\u2019s Maurizio. If you look at our press release, we were $0.03 dilutive in the first 45 days that we owned Portware to our EPS/ If you look at our guidance for Q2, we'll be $0.03 dilutive for the next 90 days. And continuing, we project to get better all the way to Q1, where we believe in Q1 fiscal '17 it will be accretive to GAAP EPS and the way we really get there is growing the revenue base and also some of the purchase accounting expenses start to decline over the next two to three quarters. Joseph Foresi : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Heckmann from Avondale. Sir your line is now open. Peter Heckmann : Good morning, everyone. If you could -- can you comment on Portware about how many users that's bringing over and how much overlap you may have already had with the existing asset base? Phil Snow : Hi Peter, it\u2019s Phil Snow. We\u2019re not I think going to call out specifically the number of Portware users that we have and there is a high overlap with the existing FactSet client base. Peter Heckmann : High overlap, okay. And then as regard to growth and talking about that mapped to accretion in the first quarter of '17, how do you handle the growth at Portware in terms of looking at organic ASV? In terms of our calculation, should we use $41 million as much big year for acquired ASP and any growth from Portware will go into your organic calculation? Or should we assume in our forward estimates that Portware is growing at 10% or 15%? Phil Snow : I think you have it correct. $41 million is the opening ASV for Portware and then the organic growth for Portware will be included in the overall organic growth for the company. Peter Heckmann : Okay. Thanks. I'll get back in the queue. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm from UBS. Alex Kramm : Yeah, just on base business and I think earlier this year you were very confident to get to this 10% organic growth rate. Seems like you're getting ever closer at the same time I've asked this before, the same time it's getting a little bit tougher out there, the volatility environment is clearly we've seen two stocks in the last couple months. So just wondering how you're feeling about the outlook getting above this 10%. We're seeing maybe a little bit more pressure or if you have this visibility with some new clients coming on to really give you that confidence. Any color would be great. Phil Snow : Thanks Alex. This is Phil Snow. So I think Maurizio just guided that we're predicting that we continue to accelerate our ASV and that confidence just comes really from the broad suite of products that we have. It's not just individual new users that we're adding, but it's the whole suite of analytics and feed products that we can layer on top of that that presents such a good opportunity for FactSet. Alex Kramm : All right. It's fair enough and yes I guess to Maurizio's comment, I guess with the -- with Portware and the growth there, that certainly is going to help. Secondly then I think somebody asked about margin early. I don't think there was a real answer. When I look at your guidance, you basically took the margin guidance down by 200 basis points relative to the last few quarters, which you've guided there and Portware is I think 160 basis points you're calling out. So any color about what that -- if that -- what that delta is at 40 basis points or so there. Is there incrementally more spending that you need to do here to accelerate the base business or why is the much -- the core margin coming down it seems? Maurizio Nicolelli : Hi Alex, it's Maurizio. So if you look at our margin guidance, you're correct. It's 31% to 32% and we see Portware being diluted by 160 basis points. The middle of that range gets you to FactSet without Portware to about 30.1% for which you're correct, it's down from Q1. 33.1% is still within our range that we manage the company. We've historically had a range between 32.5% and 34% and we still are very confident that we're within that range. We'll have blips, a little higher or a little lower on a quarterly basis, but we're still within the range that we've historically managed the company. So we don't -- there is no significant item that's different from what we've had in the past. Alex Kramm : Okay. Great. And then it seems like people have been asking three. So one quick one. Can you just call out the corporate side? I think you mentioned something on corporate briefly. How important that is to your business and I am asking because it seems like NASDAQ is launching their new corporate product at the beginning of the year that seems to be getting a lot of traction. So just wondering if that's an important business to you if you see them as a competitor or if it's nothing to really care about I guess. Thank you. Scott Miller : All right. It's Scott. We like its taste. We like it's -- as we do our diversified client segment and diversified products. It's a space where we do direct sales and we have some partnerships as well. So it's a very healthy business for us and we like it. Alex Kramm : All right. Thanks again. Phil Snow : Thanks Alex. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Chu from Merrill Lynch. Sir, your line is now open. David Chu : Hi. Thank you. So you noted that there is a 160 basis point negative impact for Portware in the second quarter. So how of this is for amortization of intangibles versus Portware just being a lower margin business? Phil Snow : A big chunk of that is amortization of intangibles. We don't break that up. But I can tell you that it is a significant portion of that. David Chu : Okay. So is that something you can help us through kind of over time like how much in amortization of intangibles do you expect for the acquisition maybe not just for the second quarter, but just over the years? Phil Snow : David, so that number will be included -- so that analysis will be included in our 10-Q going forward. So you'll have fairly good amount of clarity on that. It's one where Portware needs to -- we need to grow the revenues to get to accretion even with the amortization by Q1 of 2017 and that's what we're really striving to. David Chu : Okay. Okay. Got it. And then it looks like CapEx accelerated a bit of a percentage of revenue in the quarter. How should we think about CapEx for the year? Maurizio Nicolelli : Our CapEx number will be higher this year because we have a number of build-outs at a few of our significant offices, particularly in New York, which we had over $8 million in CapEx this quarter. CapEx this year will range somewhere within the $40 million range because we\u2019ll have a significant amount of leaseholds in furniture in CapEx this year. David Chu : In the $40 million got it. And lastly, so I know your comments were not to go over how much Portware added to subscriber count, but -- so is Portware included in the user count or is it not? Maurizio Nicolelli : It\u2019s not included in the user count. The user count are traditional FactSet users on the workstation. What\u2019s not in there are web users, users of that Code Red product. So actually FactSet does have larger footprints in the industry, but what we\u2019ve typically reported is users of the FactSet workstation. David Chu : Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much. Maurizio Nicolelli : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim McHugh from William Blair. Your line is now open. Tim McHugh : Yes thanks. I guess could you just elaborate on I guess as you dug into it, why you think bookings were later in the quarter then I guess you expect it was normal. Was it the choppiness in the market or anything else you can point to? Phil Snow : It\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s one we\u2019re going to take a look at. Q1, that was a big revenue quarter for us to begin with and it\u2019s very hard to predict typically. So it is one of our choppier quarters, but we\u2019re going to go back and look at why it was so heavily weighted to November versus prior period. Tim McHugh : Okay. And then on margins, I guess as you think about this, right now I know you said you managed kind of in this range and excluding Portware you are in that range. But you're also getting a list from I guess currency from margin perspective, which gives you I guess a little extra budget to plough into some areas of the business. Is that something that's easily flexed if you don\u2019t have that currency benefit to margins? Just trying to understand I guess how you\u2019re using that and if you don\u2019t have that lift, how easily back in that extra spending I guess can just go away as well? Maurizio Nicolelli : Hi it\u2019s Maurizio. You\u2019re correct. On the $175 million of exposure we have the FX on a net basis. There is some benefit there. That benefit is part of that, keeps our margin ex-Portware in the 33% range, but it also helps us reinvest in the business. If you noticed in the last three months we added 407 net new employees globally to further drive the business forward to 10% and beyond from there. Tim McHugh : Okay. All right. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Sir your line is now open. I apologize. Our next call comes from Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs. Andre Benjamin : Thanks good morning. Phil Snow : Good morning. Andre Benjamin : I know you called out broad-based growth across the franchise. So I was wondering if you could provide a bit more detail on what sort of growth you\u2019re seeing for the private wealth management and fixed income desktops versus the traditional equity one. Maybe how much the user growth was in those buckets or any other color would be helpful? Scott Miller : Hey Andrew its Scott. The fixed income space continues to be going very well for us in conjunction with multi asset class. I know it\u2019s owned. We saw that through the quarter, through the Americas buy side, U.K. buy side. It was a good driver for us and the wealth space we still like it a lot. It\u2019s got great growth potential for us and we got some good stuff going on there. Andre Benjamin : And I know it\u2019s a relatively new phenomenon, but are you seeing any early signs of the turmoil in the high yield market impacting your selling efforts and if you\u2019re not seeing it yet, is there something that you don\u2019t expect to impact you at all or is it something that we should be watching for? Scott Miller : We\u2019re not directly seeing it. Indirectly it actually provides some opportunity for us because running analysis in that space plays right into our multi-asset class sweet spot. So in one sense, it\u2019s not terrible for us, but it\u2019s not directly affecting us\u2026 Andre Benjamin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclay. Sir your line is now open. Manav Patnaik : Guys, can you hear me? Scott Miller : Yes, we can. Manav Patnaik : Yeah. Okay. Hey good morning, gentlemen. So first question just to clarify on the organic growth for ASV, if I heard you right you said that it would just be the $41 million starting ASV that you would back out for the next three quarters I guess. And then any other growth coming from Portware you just included in your organic rate is that correct? Scott Miller : Correct. Manav Patnaik : And why is that I guess is just different from the way most of the other companies account for that? Just curious on your rationale for that. Scott Miller : We view anything after the acquisition date as organic revenue and that\u2019s been our historical practice for every acquisition, to be quite honest. Manav Patnaik : Okay. All right and then just on the Portware synergies, it sounds like most of it is going to be from a revenue perspective. So in the context of you saying that there already is a high overlap with your clients, can you help elaborate where those revenue synergies come from? Phil Snow : Hi, its Phil Snow, Manav. It\u2019s going to come from two places. One is, Portware now has an army of sales people to go out and we have all of these additional relationships that they didn\u2019t currently have. So we get great leverage from that and then it\u2019s really the integration of our two products. So we're laser focused on for at least the first couple of years on Portware executing and on it's already excellent business plan, but we\u2019re going to take opportunities to integrate content and pieces of analytics from FactSet to create other products, which will help accelerate our growth rate. Manav Patnaik : Okay. Got it. That\u2019s helpful and then last one for me just in the context of the new buyback program and you guys obviously on a net debt basis for the first time of the Portware deal, just can you help me understand how you guys think about leverage like how far -- how levered up can you or willing to be just in the context of the balance sheet flexibility? Maurizio Nicolelli : Right now we have $300 million on our balance sheet. Its right around -- it\u2019s below our EBITDA as a company on an annual basis. So to answer your question, we could add more debt if we needed to. It\u2019s a nice problem for us to have and it just gives us the capacity if something comes up that we feel we need to go borrow money to go get in the future. Manav Patnaik : Okay. All right, thanks a lot gentlemen. Maurizio Nicolelli : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Sir your line is now open. Toni Kaplan : Even excluding the 166 employees from Portware, your employee count grew about 13%. And in the past, I know you\u2019ve hired in line with sort of your expectations for growth. So I just wanted to know is your current strategy similar to that, in line with that and basically what your expectations are for future hiring? Phil Snow : Hi Toni, it\u2019s Phil Snow. Yes, I think over time you\u2019ll see that we\u2019re consistent in terms of hiring for -- in line with our growth. We did end up hiring more sales and consulting staff typically than we do in this quarter versus prior Q1, which we're really excited about the opportunity that exist in the marketplace with the product suite that we have today. Toni Kaplan : Got it. And I think in the earlier comments you mentioned that a lot of the hiring was from the new sales class. Just wondering is there a little bit longer ramp for those sales people as opposed to more experienced sales people or would you expect the ramp to be roughly around in line with average? Thanks. Scott Miller : Hi Toni, it\u2019s Scott, I see it in line with average. We've got a good, mature group of consultants that we move into the sales world. We will mix that with some outside hiring, but there is not a major shift in terms of that ramp time. We were a little bit opportunistic in bringing in some new consulting classes and we\u2019re happy with how that all looks. Toni Kaplan : Got it, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Appert from Piper Jaffray. Sir your line is now open. Peter Appert : Good morning. So Phil you called out I think you had Research Management Solutions, Portfolio Analytics as specific growth drivers in the quarter. I am hoping you can share with us the relative importance of those businesses as a component of revenues and what the growth dynamics of those specific product offerings in fact look like? Maurizio Nicolelli : Sure. Hi Peter. So the analytics product is, since we released the portfolio of analytic suite in the late 90s there has been a huge piece of FactSet success. So when we sell PA into our client that brings all kinds of other business with it. We\u2019ve made an evolution from being just an equity based solution to a true multi asset class solution for that space. And all of the investment that we made in fixed income now combined with equity, we're really starting to see the benefits of that and we have some other products that we're layering on top. So that we continue to invest heavily in that suite. We're really pleased with the performance of it and you\u2019ve been covering us for a long time. So you know that a little over five years ago, we invested more in our CTS product as moving from being just a custom solution for clients to more of a standardized suite of off-platform offerings. And we're beginning to see the benefits of that in our core investment management space. It\u2019s very broad based revenue that we get from that fee business. And we service a lot of workflows, two of the workflows that we do well with, CTS or the quad space, and feeding into performance systems as well. Peter Appert : Can you give us any quantification of how important those product offering have become as a percent of the total company? Maurizio Nicolelli : We don\u2019t call that out, but they are a big piece of the FactSet story. Peter Appert : Okay. And Phil you or Maurizio might have said something that got me thinking that perhaps in the context of the accelerated buybacks there, there might be a little bit less appetite for M&A. Am I reading that correctly or is that not correct? Phil Snow : No, no, not at all. Not at all. We are -- that\u2019s not correct. We look at our capital allocation as a dividend share repurchase and also M&A and M&A is important to us and if we see something that\u2019s going to be that we need to go get, that we'll allocate capital appropriately. Peter Appert : Got it. And last thing, anything Phil you would call out in terms of competitive dynamics that were interesting or noteworthy and I think I\u2019m asking this in the context that your performance is so far ahead of the rest of the industry in terms of unit growth and revenue growth just obviously begs the question of sustainability and what's happening out there that's helping drive this? Phil Snow : Yeah, I think we feel good about, how we're doing on a relative basis to our competitors. In my mind, I break it up into the bigs that we compete with for a lot of the desktop business. And then we compete very well with a lot of excellent products that service the analytics area for us, but we're -- I think the advantage that we have or one of the strengths that we have is we have this broad suite of products and we have a fantastic sales team to go out and execute on selling. And so we've got -- part of our advantage is the breadth of the offering that we have. Scott do you want to add anything to that? Scott Miller : Yes, I think from the competitive environment there hasn\u2019t been a dramatic change that we\u2019ve seen certainly in the last quarter. There has been some M&A activity obviously that always plays a little bit of disruption. So it doesn\u2019t hurt, but I think it's been fairly consistent story for us. We are winning a lot more than we're losing against. Peter Appert : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Sir your line is now open. Bill Warmington : Good morning, everyone. So a couple of questions for you. First, I was going to ask based on your discussions with your buy side and sell side clients, if you could just give us a sense for what their spending mindset is heading into 2016? Scott Miller : Hi Bill, it's Scott. It hasn\u2019t seemed to have dramatically shifted in the last two quarters from what we've seen. We survey our sales force and our consulting group to get this type of feedback and it hasn\u2019t seem to have dramatically shifted. There is no question about it that both buy side and sell side are still conscious of their costs. They\u2019re looking at ways that they can do things more efficiently and we think we played very well into that picture. And so we haven\u2019t seen a dramatic shift. We still feel good about where we're positioned to go and help them as they go forward. Bill Warmington : And so Scott, you're coming up to your one-year anniversary pretty soon and I was hoping you could comment on what kind of changes you\u2019ve made over the past year at FactSet in terms of sales force structure, CRM tools and performance measurement? Scott Miller : All of the above in a good way. I was fortunate to walk into a terrific sales force and client solutions group already. So I had some wonderful stuff to work with; great Management Team. We made some changes structurally early on to make sure that we were approaching the world the right way from a region perspective and a client segment perspective. So we think we\u2019re covering our clients in a very efficient way now. And we\u2019ve got some really neat initiatives going on across performance and productivity in conjunction with CRM tools and also some neat stuff going on in terms of new business acquisition, Up-sell initiatives and one of our key goals, which is to make sure that we maintain our client retention rate. So we've got initiatives going on across all of that. But I\u2019m very, very happy with the way things look and looking forward to the quarters ahead. Bill Warmington : Okay. And then one housekeeping question for you. On the ASV, the year-over-year ASV organic growth calculation, the 9.4% for the year, how much of the growth is coming -- of that growth is coming -- is organic growth coming out of Portware, if I phrase that correctly? Maurizio Nicolelli : Hi, Bill its Maurizio. So we've only owned it for 45 days. Bill Warmington : Right. Maurizio Nicolelli : But it\u2019s contributing very little right now. Bill Warmington : All right, well thank you very much. Maurizio Nicolelli : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Sir, your line is now open. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi thanks for squeezing me back in here again. I just wanted to ask a little bit about the margin potential from Portware vis-\u00e0-vis FactSet again, just the core business. Is this something that you see being in line with corporate average, above corporate average, not necessarily getting to corporate average? And then maybe comment a little bit on the near term investments that are required, the integration, for example, FactSet has industry-leading customer service. Is there necessity to invest in that with Portware to bring it up to FactSet levels? Phil Snow : Hi, it\u2019s Phil Snow. I'll address the second question there first, which is I think Portware has or I know they have an excellent implementation team. So these are -- these are large complex implementations and they\u2019ve got a fantastic team to go out and execute on that. So they don\u2019t need to be brought up to the FactSet service levels at all. We just need to continue to invest in that group as it grows. Maurizio Nicolelli : Hey Shlomo, it\u2019s Maurizio. Just on the margin question, so the goal now is to get Portware to accretion -- to be accretive to GAAP EPS by the first quarter of fiscal '17, which means they begin to be positive on their margin. And then over time, our expectation is that they will trend towards the FactSet margin as the overall company grows and gains leverage over a longer period of time. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. And then just -- was there any deferred revenue that had to get written down in the business at all? Maurizio Nicolelli : No. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. And then how should we think of share creep -- clearly the share count doesn't go back down as much as you buy back stock? Is there some way that we -- rule of thumb we should use or two thirds of the stock did you buyback or anything like that? Maurizio Nicolelli : I think if you look at the historical average of how much we bought back versus how much the actual weighted average shares number comes down would give you a good indication of the benefit that we received. Keep in mind, Q1 is always the lowest quarter for share repurchases of any -- of our fiscal years for the last four years. So this year was in line with that trend and we have $342 million in available funds to execute on the program and we intend to execute on it in the next 12 months. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm from UBS. Your line is now open. Alex Kramm : Hey, hey again. Thanks also for squeezing me in. A few follow-ups myself here. One maybe this was asked again, but on the guidance in particular as it relates to tax rate, little surprised you\u2019re now assuming that the R&D tax credit will be reenacted. I think historically you\u2019ve kind of guided differently and also street\u2019s numbers I think excluded it. So just what's your thinking here, like why the change? Maurizio Nicolelli : So we\u2019ve included it in our guidance, but we\u2019ve also said if it does come through, it will lower both ends of the range by $0.05. So it's to a certain extent consistent with what we\u2019ve said in the past. There has been a lot of talk within Congress on both chambers of the house about reenacting it and I think there is a probably a better than 50% probability if that will happen in our mind and so we've included it this time around. Alex Kramm : All right. That's exactly the answer I was looking for. Thank you. And then couple more, one on Portware I think somebody asked about seasonality earlier. For some reason I thought there might be a small component of volume based revenues. Is that true and if so, is it something we think about and we have to think about as material? Can you outline it all? Or am I completely wrong there? Phil Snow : I don't think you're completely wrong. I think part of the revenues are tied to volumes, yes. Alex Kramm : Okay. But can you point out how much and is it mostly equities or anything we need to pay attention to I guess is my question? Phil Snow : It's tied to equities, but it's fairly consistent over a long period of time and trading bonds would have to decrease significantly for it to affect their revenue stream. Alex Kramm : Okay. Great. And then just my last question, somebody asked about competition. You mentioned M&A proactively in the space. Maybe IDC you can comment on a little bit. Is that a real competitor to you? Where do you run into them and what you'll be thinking about them with the new ownership or how that might change your relationship with them at all? Thank you. Phil Snow : Hi. It's Phil Snow. So IDC is absolutely not a competitor of FactSet. IDC is a great partner of FactSet. So we don't view that acquisition as really being meaningful to FactSet's business. Alex Kramm : Excellent. Thank you very much. Phil Snow : Great. Thank you. Phil Snow : All right. Thanks everyone. We'll see you all again next quarter. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

Lastly, FactSet undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Joining me today are; Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer; Scott Miller, Director of Global Sales; and Maurizio Nicolelli, FactSet\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. And now I\u2019d like to turn the discussion over to Phil. Phil Snow : Thank you, Rachel. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to today\u2019s call. At FactSet, we\u2019re committed to bringing the world\u2019s best insight and information to investment professionals. Our historical and recent track record of success has been built on two foundations; one, we have a real passion for understanding our clients\u2019 needs and are driven to deliver an unparallel customer experience; and two, we invest our time and people into developing superior analytics, technology and content to meet those needs. And as a result, throughout our history, we\u2019ve been able to consistently produce significant growth for our company and value for our shareholders. This past quarter was no different. In a tough beginning to the markets this calendar year, we produced solid growth. We have increasingly diverse suite of enterprise and workstation solutions that enable us to weather a challenging time. In the second quarter, our organic growth ticked up to 9.5% from 9.4% in Q1, and excluding foreign exchange, ASV rose $29.8 million versus $25.4 million in the same quarter last year. ASV growth rate has been on an upward trend every quarter over the last nine quarters and rising 100 basis points since February of 2015. The buy-side and the sell-side both grew at 9.5% this quarter and the buy-side increased 20 basis points from 9.3% to 9.5%. And just to remind everyone, we define the buy-side as traditional asset management clients, hedge funds and wealth managers and we also include our CTS, Portware and market metrics businesses into that number. And on the sell-side it\u2019s defined as M&A, advisory, capital markets and equity research. Let's break down the key contributors to our growth in the second quarter. We had positive ASV changes related to broad-based growth globally from both the buy-side and the sell-side businesses, and we saw a solid growth in our core buy-side client base in all three of our regions; the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pac. And on the sell-side, the growth is primarily driven with our middle market segment. This year our annual price increase contributed $9 million in the Americas. And as we\u2019ve mentioned in the past, the number of clients affected by the price increase each second quarter has been declining because more and more of our clients have been experiencing a price increase at the time of renewal and renegotiation of their contracts with us. And as a result, price increases occurred throughout the year and are not a significant item in the second quarter as they had been in prior years. Portware in its first full quarter being owned by FactSet performed well, as we made strides in both integrating the group into the FactSet organization and executing on its strong pipeline of new opportunities, which we take advantage of cross-selling the Portware solution to FactSet\u2019s blue-chip global buy-side client base. CTS had an exceptionally good quarter. To remind everyone, our CTS suite provides FactSet content and analytics outside of the terminal products, and we had strong contribution this quarter from our core investment management client base, the CTS. Lastly, the continued strong performance of our analytic suite contributed the buy-side growth. Multi-asset class offering, performance, risk, quantitative analysis, production and managed services, all make up an excellent suite of analytics products that we can sell into our clients at the enterprise level. And this boosted sales in all regions within the investment management business. Our recent analytics road shows in all three regions gave over 150 clients a first look at the next generation of our portfolio analytics suite. These products are core to our buy-side clients and continue to be a large piece of what\u2019s driving that business. Moving forward, our expectation of continued growth is based upon two main drivers that have historically produced consistent results. First, demand for our value-added applications is strong. This includes analytics, CTS, Portware, and RMS, our research management solution suite. We are connecting more dots within our client base with solutions for an increasing number of workflows. In parallel, we are laser-focused on our core workstation business. Even in a challenging or tightening market, we view that we still have a relatively low share of front office users on both the buy-side and the sell-side, and over time, there is still tremendous opportunity to capture more users and portfolio management, research, banking, wealth and trading. We remain committed to understanding our clients\u2019 needs and continue to provide them superior solutions that help them make smarter decisions every day. The Portware acquisition is a great example, both with innovative suite of trade automation solutions coupled with our expertise and portfolio analytics, will enable us - will enable clients to streamline the operations and focus on key decisions. We continue to push innovation while succeeding our servicing current client needs by investing in our people and developing them to succeed. We are really proud to announce that FactSet was recognized for the eighth time in a row on Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For list. We view the investment in our employees is critical to providing the best service possible to our clients, to enable continued growth of our overall business. The investment industry is facing more challenging times. FactSet is a trusted partner for our clients, and we are uniquely positioned to give them the tools and support to weather the market volatility. At our heart, FactSet is a productivity tool. We make our clients\u2019 workflows more efficient by providing a broad range of enterprise solutions and providing excellent service. Our solid and expanding business enables us to reinvest and partner effectively with our clients to meet their needs for smarter investment decisions. And in doing so, we'll continue to drive organic revenue growth and return capital to our shareholders. Let me turn it over now to, Maurizio, who will give us some more detailed look into our second quarter performance. Maurizio Nicolelli : Thank you, Phil, and good morning to everyone on the call. As you heard from Phil, our client-centric solutions enabled our business to continue to excel during a choppy period in the markets. Here is a breakdown of our second quarter results, both from a revenue perspective, as well as from an operational view. Revenues grew in the second quarter to $281.8 million. Excluding revenues acquired from acquisitions completed within the last 12 months and the effects of foreign currency, organic revenues grew 9.5% over last year. During the just completed second quarter, U.S. revenues grew to $190 million. Excluding revenue acquired from recent acquisitions, organic revenues in the U.S. were up 9.4% compared to the year ago second quarter. Non-U.S. revenues increased to $92 million. Revenues from our Europe and Asia-Pacific region were $69 million and $23 million, respectively. Excluding foreign currency and acquired revenues from recent acquisitions completed in the last 12 months, the international growth rate was 9.6%. This growth rate breaks down into 7.3% from Europe and 17.6% from Asia-Pacific, respectively. As noted in the press release, beginning this quarter, we have changed our non-GAAP reporting by adjusting for deal-related amortization. Adjusted operating income and margin, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share will exclude both deal-related amortization and non-recurring items. This change is intended to better reflect the underlying economic performance of the business. A quarterly schedule reflecting this information retroactive to first quarter of fiscal 2015 had been included on page 10 of the press release. Included in our second quarter results were the following non-recurring items. First operating expenses include both a $2.4 million pre-tax charge from restructuring actions, as well as incremental $1.4 million charge for stock-based compensation expense related to a change in the vesting of performance-based stock options. Together, they increased operating expenses by $3.8 million. Secondly, the income tax expense includes a $7.3 million benefit related to the permanent reenactment of the U.S. Federal R&D income tax credit, which occurred in our just completed second quarter and was retroactive to January 1, 2015. Adjusted operating income, which excludes $3.8 million in non-recurring items and $4.1 million in deal-related amortization, grew to $93 million, an increase of 9% from the second quarter last year. Adjusted net income, which excludes non-recurring items and deal-related amortization, grew 10% to $66 million, while adjusted diluted EPS grew 12% to $1.59. Now let's take a look at the expense side. Total operating expenses for the second quarter were $197 million. Our adjusted operating margin this quarter was 33.1%, which excludes non-recurring items and deal-related amortization. Second quarter cost of services, expressed as a percentage of revenues, increased by 380 basis points compared to the year ago period. The increase was driven by higher compensation including stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. Employee compensation expense grew due to the non-recurring restructuring cost, the change in the vesting of performance-based stock options, our headcount expansion from new hires and the addition of Portware. The increase in amortization of intangible assets primarily related to the recent acquisition of Portware. SG&A expenses, expressed as a percentage of revenues, decreased by 160 basis points in the second quarter compared to the year ago period, due to lower compensation expense from employees performing SG&A roles and a reduction in global occupancy costs. At the end of our second fiscal quarter, we had 8,093 employees, an increase of 16% in global headcount during the past 12 months. We hired 160 net new employees this quarter, primarily from our engineering and consulting recruiting classes in the U.S. and Europe, and our content collection classes in Hyderabad and Manila. The second quarter effective tax rate was 20.2%, down from 24.1% a year ago due to a $7.3 million income tax benefit related to the permanent reenactment of the Federal R&D income tax credit. Excluding discrete benefits in both years, our effective tax rate was 28.8%, down 160 basis points over last year. Free cash flow during the last three months was $81 million, an increase of $39 million from the same period last year. This increase represents our highest ever second quarter of free cash flow in company history. Our cash in investments balance was $198 million, down $5.2 million during the quarter. We define free cash flow as cash generated from operations less capital spending. Free cash flow was up 90% year-over-year due to higher levels of net income, lower income tax payments and higher client receivable collections. Our DSOs were 33 days at the end of the second quarter compared to 36 days in the prior year period. During the second quarter, we repurchased 465,000 shares in the open market at an average price of $153 per share. Our diluted weighted average shares decreased by 527,000 shares as a result of our ongoing repurchase activity and a lower share price, reducing the dilution from existing share-based compensation. As Phil mentioned at the beginning of the call, throughout our history, we have been able to consistently produce significant growth for our company and value for our shareholders. Although the markets have been volatile, our business model has proven to be resilient and continues to outperform within our industry. Our client-centric approach and the first five offerings help us remain strong in weak and strong markets. Now let's turn to our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. We expect that revenues will range between $286 million and $289 million. GAAP operating margins should range between 31% and 32%, which includes a 120 basis point reduction from the operations of Portware. Adjusted operating margin should range between 32.5% and 33.5%. We expect our annual effective tax rate to range between 28.5% and 29.5%. GAAP EPS is expected to range between $1.54 and $1.58. Adjusted EPS is expected to range between $1.60 and $1.64. The midpoint of this range suggests an 11% year-over-year increase. In conclusion, the first half of 2016 was strong. Our growth rate accelerated to higher levels while we continued to invest on our future growth opportunities. Thank you for joining our call this morning. We are now ready for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] One moment please for the first question. Rachel Stern : Operator, I don't see any questionnaires in the queue currently. Can you please make sure that, that functionality is available to all of our listeners? Operator : Yes, it is available. But let me go ahead and double-check. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, there are no questions on queue. Rachel Stern : Operator, I'm getting some messages from the dialers on our call that the functionality is not working. They\u2019ve sent me emails saying that the functionality is not working. Can you please check that? Operator : Would you like me to open the line, Rachel? Rachel Stern : Yes, absolutely. Please. Operator : Okay. I'll open the lines. Just give me one quick second. Rachel Stern : So if you\u2019re a caller trying to ask a question, would you please keep trying? Operator : Rachel, all lines are now open. Rachel Stern : Operator, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s working. You should turn them off. Operator : Okay. Rachel Stern : Let me ask the callers again, if you are trying to ask a question, please can you hit the directions the operator gave you at the beginning of the call. Operator, I think we have a few questions now. Could you please introduce the first questions? Operator : Our first question comes from Mr. David Chu from Bank of America - I\u2019m sorry, Mr. Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. If you can just comment a little bit on what the ASV and revenue growth be if you excluded any incremental growth in the quarter from Portware, so we can get an idea if the business within Portware is accelerating/decelerating or staying the same? I think that would be helpful. Maurizio Nicolelli : Sure, John. Well, it\u2019s Maurizio. As you\u2019ve seen in our historical organic revenue or organic ASV calculation, we include the incremental changes after an acquisition but we do pullout from our calculation any of - the amount that we have that we acquired in ASV. Now we have not changed that calculation, so we have included the changes in Portware in the organic number. Keep in mind, they are not material at the end of the day. They are - Portware is less than 5% of overall ASV, but we don't break that out in our organic calculation. I will ask Phil to give us a little bit of color on how Portware is doing. Phil Snow : Yes, sure. Thanks Maurizio. Thanks for the question, Shlomo. Yes, so Portware is executing very well on its business plan. Just to remind everyone, when we made the acquisition, they had a very strong pipeline of large investment managers. So these are big sales. We continue to make big - good progress on the pipeline. And from the profitability standpoint, they are doing better than expected. So if you look at adjusted EPS over $0.02 accretive to our results, whereas if you look at on a GAAP basis, we'd be $0.02 dilutive, and that's a little bit of ahead of where we thought we'd be at this point. Shlomo Rosenbaum : So let me ask the question in different way. Is the business excluding Portware accelerating or decelerating? Phil Snow : Performing well. As we said on the call, we are executing well, as you could see in the results that the number of workstations was down compared to the second quarter of last year, but we are doing exceptionally well with the broad range of products that we sell to our clients, so the analytics suite, CTS, RMS, Portware. They are all contributing to our growth. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. And what impact - can you repeat again the FX impact on ASV in the quarter? I just missed that. Maurizio Nicolelli : More than 95% of our ASV is billed in U.S. dollars. There is an FX piece to it. There is a small portion of our ASV that's built in pounds and also small portion of it built in yen, but it was immaterial to the overall number. We do exclude that small piece from our organic growth rate calculation. Shlomo Rosenbaum : And then - I'll just leave at the last one. Can you talk a little bit about the trends in the business in the quarter? In other words, there definitely was chop in the quarter, I guess, in different times. And as you entered the quarter, how did it look versus exiting the quarter in terms of the environment in Europe? Scott Miller : Hey Shlomo, it's Scott speaking. Clearly market volatility was a theme for us. There is both, a good and a bad to that. The challenge with market volatility is that we do see typically a slight slowdown in the sales cycle in the close cycle, so we did see some pipeline pushed into the second half. In general, we saw a lot more opportunity than we saw challenges because the volatility opened up lots of conversations around our analytical suite of problem - solutions, data, a lots of conversations around our CTS product. So in general, we kept focus on the sales cycle like we had been going through the previous quarters, but we faced some of the challenges head-on. I was very happy with the way that we executed through the quarter. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. David Chu. Mr. Chu, you may now proceed. David Chu : Hi. Thank you. So in terms of the slightly slower subscriber growth in the quarter, was this primarily from the sell-side? It looks like the sell-side ASV growth slowed a little bit? Scott Miller : Hi David, it's Scott. It was a mix. We did see a little bit on the buy-side as well. It tended to be with our same-store sales, our current client base where we were upselling. What we did see was a nice uptick in new business conversations and new businesses closes. So there was a mix going on. Yes, there was some push but we saw an uptick in some of the closes as well. David Chu : Okay, great. And then in terms of just the macro. So, are you seeing firms cut spend in aggregate at this point? Scott Miller : Not dramatically different than we had seen in the previous quarters. We are - clearly as we\u2019ve said over the last couple of questions, market volatility gets people thinking and pausing a little bit but we haven't seen a dramatic shift in the spending. When you do see markets go the way they did, in many cases, there is a requirement for more analytics and more data. So we are approaching it from a proactive standpoint and we haven't really seen a dramatic shift in spending. Phil Snow : I'll add to that as well, like we look through volatility in the markets at FactSet, and whenever we have a tightening, it really gives our sales team, with the relationship that we have with our clients, an opportunity to sit down, discuss their total cost of ownership and really review what they are spending. So we have that great relationship with our clients and our sales people can really sometimes benefit from these types of market conditions. David Chu : Okay, great. And just lastly, is the 2Q run rate or amortization of deal-relating intangibles in 2Q, is that a decent run rate for the rest of the year? Maurizio Nicolelli : Correct. David Chu : Okay. Thank you guys. Maurizio Nicolelli : Yes. Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from the Mr. Alex Kramm of UBS. Alex Kramm : Yes, hi. Good morning. Yes, good morning. Sorry, I\u2019m at a conference. Hopefully you can hear me okay. First off, can you just talk about buy-side versus sell-side? It seems like the sell-side in these choppy environments tends to be a little bit quicker in cutting than the buy-side. So I think what the sell-side large firms, you have some minimums. So can you maybe talk through kind of like the volatility you can take before it actually starts hitting your business? And then on the buy-side, given the lag, do you get a little bit more incrementally concerned about the second half or nothing to worry at this point at this place? Thanks. Scott Miller : Hey Alex, it\u2019s Scott. Sell-side was mixed. There was a lot of M&A activity going on obviously in the last couple of quarters, and so we saw some really great conversations going on in that space. There was clearly pressure on areas like the trading floor which is lesser than exposure to us. In the research area, we've got some good stuff going on there as well. So it was mixed. Buy-side, yet there was a slowdown in some conversations but that was a push in pipeline into the second half, so we feel - we still feel really good about the second half. Phil Snow : Alex, it's Phil Snow. So there are pieces of our business that are tied more to cyclicality than others, and the sell-side business is definitely more heavily levered to headcount versus our buy-side business. As we made in our comments at the beginning, our buy-side business is becoming less levered to headcount and we have products that are very sticky at the enterprise level that if you went back five or 10 years ago, wasn\u2019t necessarily the case. Alex Kramm : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Then just one of the positives we continue to see here is that the ASV per user or per client is ticking up, and I think it made another jump this quarter or quarter-over-quarter. I know to some degree this is Portware, but I mean it\u2019s also reflection of cross-selling. I mean, is there an incremental push that you\u2019re doing right now, or is it just a noise that jump around the ASV per user? Phil Snow : It is noise. It\u2019s a very hard one to dig into, but I think if you just go back to the comments I made on the previous question, it could be very much related to that. Alex Kramm : Fair enough. And then, just lastly quick one. Can you just remind us how big hedge funds are within your buy-sides community considering that those seem to be struggling a little bit more start the year? Maurizio Nicolelli : We don\u2019t break out the number explicitly in terms of client sides, Alex. But I will say that we saw some really good activity in the hedge fund space in the quarter. Yes, there is pressure on that market. There often is when there is volatility, but we saw some great new business wins in that space. Alex Kramm : Much appreciate it. That\u2019s it for me. Take care. Phil Snow : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Peter Heckmann from Avondale. Sir, you may proceed. Peter Heckmann : Thank you. Good morning everyone. One observation and then a couple of questions. And I think before asking around the edges, but on a first half basis, this year user adds are down pretty materially from the first half of last fiscal year, and so the two question would be, one, what are we seeing there? Is this just the natural lumpiness, or are we seeing the push out or would you say that there were areas in the business that saw some offsets? And then number two is that, how should we think about the business as it becomes less directly dependent on users? I mean, you\u2019ve never said directly how much of the revenue is based on users. We've kind of estimated about a third, but it seems like it's even decreasing from that. Would that be more bundle enterprise licenses on the buy-side or more bundle deals that\u2019s creating situation where even if users aren\u2019t growing as fast, your penetration within clients is making up the difference? Phil Snow : Yes, I think that\u2019s - I mean, a good example is our CTS business. So with CTS, we can offer feeds of content or analytics or APIs where clients can get FactSet value outside of the workstation, and those types of solutions tend to be extremely sticky once they are in the clients. Peter Heckmann : And so could you remind me - did you provide any user count at all on Portware? Phil Snow : No, we did not. Peter Heckmann : And how that layering in the numbers? Phil Snow : That\u2019s not - we don't include Portware users in our user count. It\u2019s really kind of what you think of as the core FactSet workstation. And we also don't include users of our RMS suite, so we have three product lines in there. Two of them are locally deployed. One is code red. That traditionally is we sold more to the buy-side, hedge funds, big plan sponsors, and our partner solutions which is on the sell-side. We also have web solutions that we sell our clients and we typically have not broken those at either. So there are lots of other people using FactSet other than the number that we report in our press release. Peter Heckmann : Got it. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Maurizio Nicolelli : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Sir, you may begin. Toni Kaplan : Hi, thank you. You had strong hiring again this quarter, up about 14% excluding Portware. Was the hiring again focused on sales people and consultant and is there a certain any area that they are focused on, or is it just general like selling and training? Maurizio Nicolelli : The 160 net new employees that we had during the period really focused around our consulting and engineering classes in the second quarter, which is what we do every year, and also a piece of that hiring was also our content collection classes in Manila and Hyderabad. So it's really part of our second quarter employee headcount growth. Toni Kaplan : Okay. Yes, it was just up a lot year-over-year. So okay, that's fine. And then just could you give us an update on how you view your total addressable market in fixed income, whether it be in terms of dollars or number of clients or however it is that you look at it? Scott Miller : I mean we view the numbers as extremely big and I think in a lot of markets, we don't feel that we have more than 5% or 10% of the addressable market share. So we tend to think of the overall market as being around $25 billion, which gives us sort of less than 5% market share. Not all of that is really addressable, but if you add up the market share of our major competitors, that's really what the industry is spending. Toni Kaplan : Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim McHugh. You may proceed - from William Blair. You may proceed. Tim McHugh : Yes, thank you. First, I guess people have asked differently about the environment, so I might try one more just. You\u2019ve talked about wanting to get the 10% growth and obviously you\u2019ve been kind of slowly accelerating in the last year. Is this an environment conducive to that continuing as we think forward, or is it - in this environment would you say that you probably need a better environment to continue to see that to get to double-digit growth? Phil Snow : So typically the way we think about growth is just - we just want to do very well relative to our competitors in the marketplace. I think that's the way we typically think of it. We don't view our market share is necessarily expanding. We are really - it\u2019s about taking market share and we are just going to continue to execute as well as we can against our competitors. But we are not going to put out any numbers there in terms of what we think we are going to do in terms of sales growth beyond the revenue guidance that Maurizio gave for Q3. Scott Miller : Tim, it\u2019s Scott. On the sales side, the opportunities that we\u2019ve seen for a while now are still very much all there. We\u2019ve got some great stuff going on from new business and from upselling in current client base and none of that has moved. The market volatility because it's paused in some cases, yes, it has some impact on the direct workstation but the overall opportunities out there have not changed for us in many cases, they\u2019ve actually increased because of the market volatility. So we are still very confident with the business growth. Tim McHugh : And can I ask - I think this is - you came in kind of in the lower half of the guidance range which your history has given the visibility you usually at the upper half, and I think last quarter was the same thing and you said it was just kind of more backend loaded bookings. Is that true again this quarter? And if we've seen this for two quarters, is there a trend there, is there something about what products are selling in the environments that we should infer from that? Maurizio Nicolelli : Hi Tim, it's Maurizio. We actually did have a significant portion of our ASV recorded towards the January-February period during the quarter, so it lowered our - slightly lowered our revenue for the quarter, and we also have about $0.5 million deferred revenue adjustment from purchase accounting that still come into our revenue line from the Portware acquisition that lowers overall revenue. So when you take those two items, we are slightly lower than that where the consensus estimate was. Tim McHugh : Okay. And then just one math. Now that the R&D tax credit is permanent, I guess, if this 29% the right tax rate that we could use going forward? Is that how you think about I guess steady-state? Maurizio Nicolelli : 29% is right around steady-state. Our range is between 28.5% and 29.5% and 29% is really right in the middle of that range. Tim McHugh : All right, thanks. Operator : Thank you our next question is from Keith Housum from Northcoast Research. Sir you may proceed. Keith Housum : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate it. I guess two questions for you if you don't mind. First, what was the FX impact on the bottom line, I guess, on EPS for the quarter or year-over-year? Maurizio Nicolelli : FX did benefit us slightly during the quarter, but it was immaterial to our results at the end of the day. We did get a benefit from our pound and euro exposure, but just from the overall results, it was immaterial. Keith Housum : Okay. And then I think the last comment in your bullet in your press release regarding getting into the index business. I guess, if guys could elaborate a little bit more on what your aspirations are with that and where you see yourself playing and perhaps where you guys could go with that? Scott Miller : Hi Keith, it\u2019s Scott. So we are spending some great effort in the ETF space both from say thought leadership and a data and analytics perspective. One of the outcomes from that is for us to be looking at the index base as well. It's not core to our strategy going forward right now but it's something we find really interesting. We've had a number of our clients ask us about it and some partners who want to do some things with us in that space. So it's something that we are looking at. I put more emphasis on what we're doing in the ETF space as opposed to index. Phil Snow : Keith, it's Phil Snow. I agree with that. And the ETF effort that we have really is a function of the Revere acquisition that we made couple of years back. So Revere has an incredibly deep taxonomy to classify companies at a much deeper level than other products that are out there in the marketplace, and a lot of ETF providers have come to us to build universes of companies for them for a particular types of ETFs that they are creating and that's what you saw with State Street in the Innovative Technology ETF. Keith Housum : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. You may proceed. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is actually Greg [ph] calling on for Manav. Just wanted to ask about the international growth. Looked like Europe slowed down a bit, maybe some pressures from the bulge bracket banks, but APAC was really strong. So any color that you can provide there on those two markets? Scott Miller : Yes, Greg, I think your comments were right. We did see a slight slowdown across the EMEA. It was really in pockets. It was pretty broad-based, nothing that I would draw particular attention to. And Asia-Pac continues to be a great growth market for us. We saw some really good stuff going on in sort of our non-core markets in China and Korea and in areas like that we saw some good stuff going on. So we like what we see out of Asia-Pac. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then I just want to ask on what you're seeing in the M&A market and whether recent choppiness is providing any new opportunities and maybe an update on what you are seeing from a valuation perspective as well? Phil Snow : So on the M&A front, Manav, not much has changed for us there. We continue to focus on strategic acquisitions around unique content and adjacent workflows. But we\u2019re - and we continue to see quite a few opportunities that we are interested in. But there is nothing transformative that we are looking at, at this time. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And one more from me. Just any color you can provide on what the restructuring charge was - I guess, just what the restructuring charge was? Maurizio Nicolelli : Sure, it\u2019s Maurizio. So we went through and reviewed our large employee groups to realize some productivity gains in order to make us more efficient into the future. And so the $2.4 million charge really relates to just our overall restructuring process that we completed in Q2 and it's something that we go through every year to - every 12 to 24 months. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Mr. Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs. Sir, you may begin. Andre Benjamin : Thank you. Good morning. First question I had, I know you had mentioned that most of the growth in the sell-side was from the middle markets. So I was trying to understand what are your finding successful in that segment, and is it really more a function of just lower penetration or is there something special that they find that the value proposition for that business - that part of the market versus your larger customer? Scott Miller : It's a mix, Andre, of those two. So we are picking up market share in that space and we are also diversifying a little bit the user types and some of the different solutions, things like our RMS and our partner solutions are getting traction in that space and we are expanding beyond just the analyst user type in there as well. So it's mix to both of what you talked about. Andre Benjamin : And are you doing anything - I know you've been investing a lot in the data procurement services. Is there anything we should be aware of that you're trying to maybe leverage some of the data and change your economics or value proposition in terms of offsite more data that you\u2019re collecting fundamentally versus [indiscernible]? Phil Snow : We continue to invest heavily in content and that's where I think you saw some of the headcount growth coming from, and we just continue to pull more and more value into the workstation from a content standpoint. So having unique content and best of breed content is a big piece of FactSet\u2019s value proposition and we know that just standing still for that is really not an option for us. Scott Miller : And Andre, it\u2019s Scott. I would add to that. We are getting - we\u2019re doing more packaging of the content as well from a data feed perspective, specifically for the regulatory space and we saw some great traction on the back of that over the last couple of quarters. Andre Benjamin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Joseph Foresi. Sir, you may - one moment. Mike Reid : Okay. Hi, this is... Rachel Stern : Operator, I think we lost the question. Can you please ask the folks who had been in the queue to put their questions in again? Operator : Okay. [Operator Instructions] Rachel Stern : Yes, I think we had a question from Joe Foresi coming up. So when you see him in the queue - there we go. He should be the next questions. Operator, can you\u2026 Operator : Mr. Joe Foresi, you may now - yes, Joe Foresi, you may now proceed. Mike Reid : Can you hear me guys? Phil Snow : Yes, we can. Go ahead. Mike Reid : Okay, thanks. So this is Mike Reed on for Joe. I appreciate you taking the call. Just had a quick question about the 51 new clients. Is there any difference you're seeing in the make-up or is it generally the same as it's kind of been? Scott Miller : It\u2019s Scott, Mike. Not a dramatic shift. We did see some good wins in the wealth space, and particularly some good wins in the insurance space which was off the back of our multi-asset class and fixed income risk solutions. Those are probably the two that I would highlight. Other than that, it was fairly broad-based. We\u2019ve had a number of initiatives in terms of new business pipeline generation over the last couple of quarters and we are starting to see that come through quite well now. Mike Reid : Okay. And then just another one, it\u2019s sort of been asked about the macro environment. But do you or do you think you would see in the effects just in the general slowdown in the IPO cycle separate from, I guess, other macro concerns? Scott Miller : It's Scott again, Mike. I don't see it as a particular factor for us. The M&A activities has been decent. I don\u2019t see it as a particular factor now. Mike Reid : Okay. Great. Thanks guys. Scott Miller : Thank you. Phil Snow : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy from Raymond James. Sir, you may begin. Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy: Hi. So a couple of months ago there, the story out there, J.P. Morgan was apparently looking to replace several thousand terminals, Bloomberg terminals with Thomson Reuters. Curious if that was something that you're basically also trying to participate on? And then more broadly, do you see a trend at some of the major banks as they are currently focused on cost to try to rip out some of the Bloomberg some replace it with alternative lower price solutions? Phil Snow : Hi Patrick, it's Phil Snow. I would say generally when we are out there talking with the C-level executives at the bigger banks, there is definitely a focus on total cost of ownership and that could come from any type of vendor. So whenever somebody is paying a lot of money and they feel that they are not getting the most value out of that, they are going to look for alternatives, and that's - I think if you go back to one of the comments earlier on the call, in an environment like this it really gives us great opportunity to sit down with clients and look at their overall spend. Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy: Okay. And then specifically with J.P. Morgan. Is that something that business that you were going after or is that a product set that may be Thomson Reuters could fit better than what you guys could offer? Phil Snow : We got a good relationship with all the major banks and we've got some great conversations going on with all of them. Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy: All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Peter Appert from Piper Jaffray. Sir, you may proceed. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is actually Steven dialing for Peter. Thank you for taking my question. I just want to ask a little bit more about the password [ph] growth. In the quarter, we see a deceleration of the password [ph] growth. Is that a function of competitive dynamics or challenging comps, or is the user market environment getting more difficult? Scott Miller : Hi, it\u2019s Scott. I don't see it as a result of competitive at all. If anything, it was somewhat market-driven with the volatility in the market. Again we're not seeing it as a concern. The great thing about our business is that we\u2019ve got incredibly diversified portfolio of solutions out there that can offset any market condition downturns in workstation growth. We've also got some good plans in place to build up that workstation growth in the coming quarters as well, so not major concern. Unidentified Analyst : Great. And just another question. I was just wondering what kind of growth are you seeing [Technical Difficulty] revenue or just data feeds, and is there any significant differences in the profitability in non-terminal? Scott Miller : Thanks for the question. So traditionally we\u2019ve just not broken out that growth rate, but one good byproduct that collecting a lot of content for our terminal product is that we can then turn around in a lot of cases and monetize that with feeds. So I would say, yes, that is - there is some good profitability associated with our CTS business. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. Thanks. Scott Miller : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Mr. Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Sir, you may proceed. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, thank you for squeezing me back in. I just want to ask a little bit in terms of the competitive environment and specifically Thomson Reuters. It looks at least data from some of the data that I have that they might have actually increased workstations for the time sequentially since 2008, and I just want to know if there is a change that - you\u2019re noticing a change on their side in terms of even more aggressive pricing or anything like that? And then I have one other follow-up question after that. Scott Miller : Shlomo, it's Scott. We haven't - in the last quarter I haven't seen a dramatic change. There is lots going on in the competitive environment. I haven't seen any dramatic change in pricing strategy. No is the short answer. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. And what exactly is the insurance product sale? Scott Miller : It\u2019s our - it is not terribly different to our typical investment management say more emphasis is clearly on the fixed income space because of the assets that they typically have under managements. So it's the portfolio analytics, portfolio risk, sale our core product along with portfolio services, but a big focus on multi-asset class and fixed income. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Lindsey, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the FactSet Research Systems Inc. Third Quarter webcast. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Ms. Rachel Stern, Senior Vice President, Strategic Resources and General Counsel, you may begin your conference. Rachel Stern : Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thanks to all of you for participating today. Welcome to FactSet's third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. This conference call is being transcribed in real time by FactSet's CallStreet service and is being broadcast live via the Internet at factset.com. A replay of this call will also be available on our Web site. Our call will contain forward-looking statements reflecting management's expectations based on currently available information. Actual results may differ materially. More information about factors that could affect FactSet's business and financial results can be found in FactSet's filings with the SEC. Annual Subscription Value, or ASV, is a key metric for FactSet. Please recall that ASV is a snapshot view of client subscriptions, and represents our forward-looking revenues for the next 12 months. Lastly, FactSet undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Joining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer; Scott Miller, Director of Global Sales; and Maurizio Nicolelli, FactSet's Chief Financial Officer. And now I'd like to turn the discussion over to Phil. Phil Snow : Thanks, Rachel, and good morning everyone, and welcome to today's call. At our core, FactSet is client-centric. We've always been, and that's why we've been able to grow our business so successfully year-after-year. We partner with our clients to help them work smarter and more efficiently. And as client needs have changed, we have evolved our business to meet those needs, and this has helped us to fuel growth even in a challenging market. This evolution has produced new growth drivers, which are evident in our Q3 results. We had another exceptionally solid quarter, this quarter, organic ASV grew 9.3% from the prior year, while EPS increased to 12.3%. And this is a testament to our broadening suite of premium products and the strength of our business and service model. This quarter, we saw particularly strong contribution from our Analytics, CTS, and Portware businesses. First, Analytics, we continue to see strong demand for our multi-asset class analytic suite, which include solutions for risk, performance attribution, return analytics, quants, publishing, and portfolio services. And driving this demand is the ongoing convergence in the market towards multi-asset class investment strategies as clients see yields in a low-rate environment. Layered on top of this is the need to control for risk from a growing number of regulatory requirements. Second, we saw robust growth in our CTS business. We are laser-focused on delivering value to our clients in the way they want to consume it. We have a great workstation business, and many of our clients want to leverage that same value that they get through the workstation in other ways, and we are committed to providing those solutions. The CTS suite includes a growing number of standardized data feeds that complements and merit the data in the FactSet workstation, and there is an increased awareness in the market now around our CTS capabilities and data solutions that power a growing number of workflows for the middle and front office. Third, we saw ongoing growth in our Portware business. Portware maintained its strong track record of growth, client volume increased, as did new client and broker connections. And overall, the integration continues to go really well. We are executing on the healthy pipeline from the close of the acquisition in October, and we are beginning to see the positive effects related to cross-selling opportunities. Also contributing to growth this quarter was our annual price increase for clients in the EMEA and APAC regions. This year that contributed $4.2 million in ASV. Let me say a few words about workstation. The market volatility that we've seen since the beginning of the year has had an effect on our overall workstation growth, workstation still grew, which is a testament to the strength of the product. And this quarter we really had a lot of great wins on the workstation side, but that was offset by a higher than usual number of cancels. And those of you that have covered FactSet for a long time understand our workstation business has gone through multiple volatile periods and is well positioned to continue to grow as volatility subsides. Overall, our buy-side business, which includes traditional asset management clients, hedge funds, wealth managers, CTS, and Portware accelerated to 9.6%, up over a 100 basis points from the prior year period. Our sell-side, which includes M&A advisory capital markets and equity research declined to 8.1% growth, and you can attribute the slowdown on the sell-side to it being more heavily leveraged to workstations and headcount trends. As you also saw this quarter, we are exiting from the Market Metrics and Matrix Solution businesses, and as part of executing on our strategic plans, we have decided to exit from our non-core market research business that was focused on advisor-sold investments and the insurance space. As such, in May, we entered into a definite agreement to sell Market Metrics and Matrix Solutions to Asset International, a portfolio company of Genstar Capital. This transaction is consistent with our long-term strategic direction and demonstrates our commitments to deliver significant value to our shareholders. Our capital allocation continues to be aggressive as we deploy capital in the form of new product developments, acquisitions, dividends, and share repurchases in order to maximize shareholder value. Over the last 12 months, we have returned 344 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends, funded entirely by cash generated from operations. In conclusion, the third quarter adds to our continuing string of successful quarters. Over the years, regardless of the market cycle, FactSet's absolute and relative financial performance have been strong. At FactSet, we are well situated to serve a broad range of our clients' needs, given our ability to offer enterprise solutions across many user workflows backed with our industry-leading client service. Our future outlook remains optimistic, and our guidance for Q4 shows strong organic ASV growth, and similar to this quarter, EPS grew 300 basis points higher than ASP growth. Now, let me turn it over to Maurizio, who will give a more detailed look into our third quarter performance. Maurizio Nicolelli : Thank you, Philip, and good morning to everyone on the call. As you heard from Phil, we continued to outperform relative to the market during an uncertain market period, which is a reflection of our position in the marketplace and also the health of our business. So now let's review our third quarter results. Revenues grew in the third quarter to $287.5 million. Excluding the revenues acquired from acquisitions completed within the last 12 months and the effects of foreign currency, organic revenues grew 9% over last year. During the just-completed third quarter, U.S. revenues grew to $193 million. Excluding revenue acquired from recent acquisitions, organic revenues in the U.S. were up 8.5% compared to the year ago third quarter. Non-U.S. revenues increased to $94 million. Revenues from our Europe and Asia-Pac regions were $70 million and $24 million respectively. Excluding foreign currency and acquired revenues from acquisitions completed in the past 12 months, the international growth rate was 10.1%. This growth rate breaks down into 8.1% from Europe and 16.8% from Asia-Pacific respectively. Included in our third quarter results were the following non-recurring items. First, operating expenses included $1.4 million in professional fees, primarily related to the sale of the Market Metrics and Matrix business. Secondly, income tax expense includes a $3.2 million benefit related to finalizing prior year's tax returns and other discrete tax items. Adjusted operating income, which excludes $1.4 million in non-recurring professional fees and $4.1 million in deal-related amortization, grew to $95 million, an increase of 8% from the third quarter last year. Adjusted net income, which excludes non-recurring items and deal-related amortization, grew 10% to $68 million, while adjusted diluted EPS grew 12% to $1.64. Now let's take a look at operating expenses. Total operating expenses for the third quarter were $198 million. Our adjusted operating margin, which excludes non-recurring items and deal-related amortization was 33% this quarter, down 10 basis points from the second quarter. Third quarter cost of services expressed as a percentage of revenues increased by 370 basis points compared to the year ago period. The increase was driven by higher compensation, including stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. Employee compensation expense grew due to headcount expansion from new hires and the addition of Portware. The increase in amortization of intangible assets primarily relates to the acquisition of Portware less than 12 months ago. SG&A expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues decreased by 130 basis points in the third quarter compared to the year ago period due to lower compensation expense from employees performing SG&A roles partially offset by an increase in professional fees related to the sale of the Market Metrics and Matrix businesses. At the end of our third fiscal quarter, we had 8,100 employees. Excluding the employee added from the Portware acquisition, headcount has increased 14% during the past 12 months. The third quarter effective tax rate was 24.8%, down from 28.5% a year ago driven by the 3.2 million benefit from finalizing its previous years' tax returns and other discrete income tax items. Excluding discrete benefits in both years, our effective tax rate was 28.4%, down 170 basis points over last year. Free cash flow during the last three months was $89 million, a decrease of $10 million from the same period last year. The decrease was a result of higher client receivables, higher income tax payments, and an increase in capital expenditures driven by office expansions in New York, London, and Chicago. Our DSOs when excluding those receivables recorded as held-for-sale were 34 days at the end of the third quarter, compared to 33 days in the prior year period. Our cash and investments balance was $211 million, up $13 million during the quarter. We defined free cash flow as cash generated from operations less capital spending. During the third quarter, we repurchased 505,000 shares in the open market at an average price of $151 per share. Our diluted weighted average shares decreased by 347,000 shares as a result of our ongoing repurchase activity and a lower share price reducing the dilution from existing share-based compensation. Now, let's turn to our guidance for Q4 of fiscal 2016. Our guidance for the fourth quarter includes the results of the Market Metrics business for the full quarter. The transaction is expected to close in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2016. We will update guidance upon closing of the transaction. The Market Metrics business, which includes Matrix Solutions, had ASV of 37 million as of the end of the third quarter. The transaction is not expected to have a material impact to our fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 or our fiscal 2017 results, as we plan to use proceeds from the sale to repurchase shares under the existing share repurchase program. For our fiscal fourth quarter, we expect revenues will range between $292 million and $298 million. GAAP operating margins should range between 31% and 32%, while adjusted operating margin should range between 32.5% and 33.5%. We expect our annual effective tax rate to range between 28% and 29%. GAAP EPS is expected to range between $1.61 and $1.65, adjusted EPS is expected to range between $1.68 and $1.72. The midpoint of this range suggests a 13% year-over-year growth. In summary, we are proud to deliver solid ASV growth and double-digit EPS growth again. The mid-point of our guidance for the next quarter suggests this trend will continue. We continue to invest aggressively in our product, and people, as we believe, we are well-positioned to outperform the overall market today, and in the future. Thank you for joining our call this morning. We are now ready for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Peter Heckmann from Avondale. Your line is now open. Peter Heckmann : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Maurizio, on the ASV from the divested businesses, I believe you said $37 million combined for the two businesses. If that's correct, can you talk about the relative growth rate of ASV over the last year compared to the corporate average as well as margins compared to the corporate averages, so we can get a little bit finer point on what a post divestiture FactSet looks like? Maurizio Nicolelli : So we don't break out information for our specific segments like that. I will tell you that, just in terms of its growth rate and also its margins, it's slightly below where the overall FactSet rate is today. Peter Heckmann : Okay, great. That's helpful. And then, can you talk about -- are you seeing any impact or can you perceive any impact from the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule on the buy-side in terms of maybe their thought process of further pressure on fees, further move towards fee-based investments, and potentially passive investments that's reflecting on their thoughts about cost containment? Phil Snow : Hi, Peter, it's Phil Snow. So I can talk a little bit about the shift to passive investment, it's certainly something that we all know is going on in the market. We continue to build capabilities to meet our clients' needs in this area. Our portfolio suite of products is very well-suited to analyze any type of asset, whether it's an active or a passive investment. We have invested in this space with ETF.com, which you saw that we purchased recently; and last quarter, that data was used by State Streets to launch the first FactSet branded ETF leveraging that data, the FactSet Innovative Technology Index. So, it's a trend that we're aware of. We know that our clients are under cost pressure just from a macro trend, and part of this is being driven by the shift from active to passive investments. Peter Heckmann : That's helpful. I'll get back in the queue. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open. Joe Foresi : Hi, just kind of building on your prepared remarks, how would you describe the current environment for your product? And maybe you could talk a little bit about the areas where you are seeing obviously the biggest softness? Phil Snow : Hey, Joe, it's Phil Snow. So, as I just highlighted a little bit on the previous question, we definitely see continued uncertainty in the market related to economic and political reasons. Clients run into some cost pressures, but we do believe this is that type of environment that FactSet is very well-suited to partner with our clients to sit down with them and help them through these times. We've done it a few times already. It's not new to us. And what I'd like to stress today is that it's important to understand that within our product suite, there's been an ongoing shift in the weight of our business, away from pure workstation to a broader suite of offerings. So workstation is still a hugely important piece of our business. It's the core of our business. We continue to reinvest in that aggressively, but the sophistication of the value-added applications and solutions outside of the workstation has been growing. So I think you should think of us as a solutions provider with workstation being one of those components. And if you break down the FactSet suite of products that's not directly tied to workstation, there are quite a few now. So within the analytic suite itself, we have risk and performance solutions that can be applied at the enterprise level, we have our portfolio services products which allows for reconciliation of portfolios and calculation of derived analytics, we have a great publishing business that we sell primarily to the buy-side, we have a whole research management solutions piece of our business now, which is a combination of the Code Red acquisition partners. So we have a lot of users on the buy-side and the sell-side that are research analysts or portfolio managers that are using FactSet, but it's not in the actual user count number that we are providing you, which is more of our core workstation. Of course, we have our CTS business, we have Portware, we have some very strong web offerings like StreetAccounts. So there is a growing suite of products that we offer to our clients, and we are beginning to be able to sell those at the enterprise level. So that's -- I think you did see the workstation and client count count come down, but we're able to partner with our clients for these larger enterprise solutions and sell them a lot more solutions than we were five or ten years ago. Joe Foresi : Got it. Is there any way to get a sense of, either numerically or even quantitatively, how much of a pickup you say in the cancellation trends just so that we can compare it to client and user growth. I know it's not necessarily a number that you typically give. Phil Snow : Sure. Scott Miller : Joe, hi, it's Scott. I'd categorize it for you without getting into the detailed numbers. The pick-up was in what I think of as the non-controllable. It's firms merging, going out of business, and a user no longer there. We did see a pick-up in that part of the cancellations. The more controllable, where someone is actually moving away from us was sort of flat in terms of trend. So that was the notable, that the market headwinds hit, but we expected that. We've been clearly all watching the market headwinds collectively, and we knew that there was going to be more pressure in that space. Joe Foresi : Got it. And the last one, quickly for me, just any kind of initial thoughts on Brexit, and the EU, and its impact on your business. Thanks. Phil Snow : Hey, Joe, it's Phil Snow. So, for us, obviously it's adding to the uncertainty that's out there. But for us it's business as usual. We're going to continue to partner with our clients to help them through this period. The risk solutions that we have are very well-geared towards something like Brexit. And we also have this fantastic database called GeoRev, which allows you to really understand a firm's geographic exposure, not just where they're domiciled. And we've had a lot of inbound inquiries about that dataset. We've had them anyway, but there was a pick-up on that last week. And the weakening pound definitely doesn't hurt us because as you know, we bill in dollars in Europe, but we have an employee base there that, where the expenses are in pounds. Joe Foresi : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the lines of Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Your line is now open. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Thank you very much for taking my questions. Hey, Phil, you're just teasing us out there. You keep saying that you have much higher revenue that's not seat-count based, but you just won't give us the numbers that we're looking for in terms of what is it now, what was it five years ago so we get a better sense of that? Phil Snow : Right. Yes, so I'm sorry for teasing you. But there's something that we haven't broken out. And, today, we're continuing to report the same numbers that we have. I will tell you, Shlomo, that you'll be pleased to hear that we have a new audio conferencing service. So hopefully you can hear the response to this question. Shlomo Rosenbaum : So but maybe just help us qualitatively if not quantitatively, typically what I've seen in the past is that as seat count slows down you end up with higher revenue per seat, and it's really just an indicative of the seat count going down, and that usually portends an issue for FactSet's growth, either -- just a slowing of that growth. But it sounds like you're communicating is, is that we should not expect that to see that the same way this time because of the predominance -- or not predominance, but the preponderance of more of these non-seat-based products that you have? Phil Snow : Yes. I think that's a great way to think about it. If you go back ten years, and you think about how we were billing our clients, we would have base fees, we would have various database fees, and then we would add on workstations. So, the trend that you saw would be natural as clients were cancelling workstations on the margin. But you're right, in that, today, that we have these broader offerings. So if we're selling a fee that's a six-figure deal that's obviously going to raise the pro workstation metric if you just simply divide ASV by workstations. Shlomo Rosenbaum : So given the market environment and the growth rates in those other businesses, can you sustain that current -- the growth rate at current levels, given what you see in the market? Phil Snow : Well, I think Maurizio's given some Q4 guidance that indicates that we're positive about what we see in Q4, and you'll get some updated numbers on that once the Market Metrics acquisition -- or divestiture is completed. Shlomo Rosenbaum : All right. So then in terms of -- Maurizio, maybe I'll focus on you. So the high level implication, though, is that by taking Market Metrics out at a slower growth rate with a little bit lower margins is that we should get some addition by subtraction, right, because you should end up with a faster growing business with higher margins. In terms of the way to look at it, you're going to provide us like historical comps to look at it on a historical basis as well? Maurizio Nicolelli : So, we'll have an 8-K filing that will have some pro forma information, and that will have that information in it. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Before Rachel cuts me off, I'll ask one last one. Can you quantify the EPS benefit from pound depreciation that should be fairly significant for you guys? Maurizio Nicolelli : So, our overall exposure on FX is about 182 million and that's what we had in our 10-Q at the end of Q2. Approximately a third of that is pounds, and we're already hedged on 50% of that. There is a benefit to us, but keep in mind, if we manage our margin to a very tight range, whether FX goes with us or against us. So the expectation that there's going to be a significant change to the operating margin, I would not be expecting that. There may be a slight uptick from there, but I would not be forecasting that going forward. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Andre Benjamin : Thanks, good morning. Phil Snow : Andre. Andre Benjamin : Similar to go on the back of Shlomo's last line of questions, with the number of users and clients slowing the last four quarters, but ASV growth holding up much better as the number of solutions sold has strengthened, do you have any color on how you're thinking about, even in the guidance that you have provided, how those trends should continue? Should user count continue to moderate because of the factors we've seen in the market? But does the number go up? Or I'm trying to get a sense of the moving pieces, at least as far as your guidance is concerned. Scott Miller : Hi Andre, it's Scott. There's a natural reaction on user count based on market headwinds. We've seen it historically. You get sell-sides that in many cases are retrenching sort of back to their core businesses and that takes some regional parts of their businesses out altogether and you lose some workstations. But I'll reiterate Phil's comments, we have such a phenomenal toolkit of solutions now for our clients, and yes, workstation is very important and it's an important piece of our puzzle but it's just one piece. And what we see out there now is certainly with all the volatility that's going on and the uncertainty our clients are looking to us even more to help them be smarter about their jobs and solve their problems and it just opens up so many more opportunities for us. So we feel good about in general. Andre Benjamin : I know you mentioned multi-asset class products, and any color, in the past we talked specifically about fixed income in private wealth including the last Analyst Day, any update on how material those have become since we last really dug into it then and how they've been growing? Scott Miller : Probably the only one piece I'd add on to what we've talked about historically on the call, you know, multi-asset class is, is a really important piece for us and we're doing really well on that space. We have seen an uptick in just specifically the credit part of the market, we got some really neat solutions that originally we had devised for more of a multi-asset class approach that now on their own solve for the credit analyst very, very well and we've seen a pickup in that space. Andre Benjamin : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is now open. Manav Patnaik : Yes, good morning thank you. So first question, can you just reminder us of, you know, the lag behind when you lose, whether it's truly off the mergers or whatever it is, like how long does that take based on your contract structure to actually hit the ASV numbers? Scott Miller : Patnaik, this is Scott. It depends. We have some different contract terms that are out there depending on the client. I can tell you that what we saw this quarter or what we're seeing right now, we saw probably the bulk of what's in our vision this quarter and it's already hit we've seen it settle. So we're not projecting as much as the non-controllable cancellation coming through in the coming quarters. I don't know if that answers your question but it varies contract to contract but we feel that we saw the bulk of the headwind already hit us. Manav Patnaik : Okay, and then maybe just some more color around the buy side pressures and maybe what you're seeing there, I mean, I guess you don't need to tell us about the sell side. But I guess we keep hearing a lot of fund closing and redemptions and those kinds of thing. So, how do you envision that dynamic on your workstation business with the buy side versus these other non-workstation risk solution type areas? Scott Miller : It's Scott again, so I mentioned earlier that we did see more of the, what I consider the sort of non-controllable cancellations out there, the mergers and closures both hedge fund, buy side sell side obviously as well. It's not easy out there we know that AUM is under pressure, fees are under pressure, it's real. The reality is that the more the pressure comes on the more our clients are looking for solutions that help them with TCO, help them with performance, help them with better efficiency. And so we're actually having more conversations now around potential opportunities because our clients are under pressure and looking for more help. So it's really where we shine with our consultative support. So, yes, it's challenging out there but the number of opportunities that we are facing right now is very encouraging. Manav Patnaik : Okay. And I guess to tie that with your prior response to my question, so all the funds that have closed or announced closures -- so far that used your business; you said that's already baked into your numbers correct? Scott Miller : Yes, so typically again our contracts are somewhat different to some clients, but typically we have a 90-day cancellation clause, and so a lot of that was hitting in Q2 and so we saw the results of that in Q3. So the bulk of it, yes, I'm not saying there is no more cancellations coming, it's part of our business but the bulk of that uptick in that non-controllable portion we saw coming through towards end of Q2 and has hit in Q3. Manav Patnaik : Okay, fair enough, all right. And then just the last one, I mean, you said you're seeing a lot more opportunities, because of the current environment, and I guess the problem we always have is that every other market data player says the same thing. So, I mean, I guess maybe if you could help us just characterize the wins, losses, is this business that will lead you from taking share from someone or is this just stuff that nobody has ever used and it's a new business for you guys? Scott Miller : So, it's a bit of both. So, there is stuff that people have never used, it's some of our proprietary content that Phil talked about, our GeoRev and our Revere content for example, potentially moving from a in-house research management system to outsourcing to us. So, there is absolutely some new, but we are definitely picking up market share in many different areas. Our clients are doing more due diligence into their information technology, decision making, they're scrutinizing it even more on their side. There is disruption in the market out there in terms of certain offerings in the risk and analytics space and that opens the door for us as well. So, the number of conversations that we're having that are leading to opportunities are absolutely increasing. Manav Patnaik : Right. Well, thanks a lot. I appreciate the color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS. Your line is now open. Alex Kramm : Yes. Hey, good morning, everyone. Just coming back to the Brexit questions earlier, just a quick one here; did BREXIT at all influence your Q4 guidance? Is anything factored in? I know it's early days obviously, but I noticed that your EPS range for example was, I think, $0.06, I'm sorry, 6 million for the revenue, it's usually a little bit higher than what we've seen in the past, so just talk about how, if you've factored in anything already. Maurizio Nicolelli : Alex, it's Maurizio. No, we have not factored any uncertainty from Brexit in our guidance. Our guidance is fairly clean and it is, you're correct, it is a little bit of a wider range, it is just to give a little bit more variability to our guidance. Historically, our guidance of only 4 million on revenues was fairly tight compared to other public companies. So we made a conscious decision to just widen it. If you look at the midpoint of that revenue range, we're still growing revenues organically by 9%. Alex Kramm : Fair enough. Great. Thank you for the color. And then secondly, I think the fourth quarter typically is a, one of your most important quarters in terms of sell side, buy side, hiring classes coming in, any color on what you're seeing or hearing out there in terms of how kind of like that seasonal hiring pattern is progressing that we should be thinking about? Phil Snow : Alex, you'll know the hiring better than we will. So I should ask you the same question, but we're typically seeing obviously not a, no surprise, we are seeing some slowdown in grad hiring, we start to see that now. We start to ultimately take those orders now. So we're seeing a little bit of a slowdown there, but in general, you're right, fourth quarter is important, all of our quarters are important, but we see, again, we're feeling very good about our business, not only this quarter, but when we look mid to longer-term, we're feeling very, very good about the business. Alex Kramm : Great. And then just one last one, on Portware, you mentioned you're seeing some early success on cross-selling, anything you can elaborate there, like, who are you selling more to, where are the wins coming from? Thank you. Scott Miller : The wins, it's Scott; the wins are still in the fairly traditional places where Portware sells today. So it's in the buy side and have more volume and sophisticated trading requirements. So there hasn't been a dramatic shift in where the wins are coming. What's been really neat to see is our general sales force understanding the value proposition around Portware and FactSet integration and being able to position it well to that core client, but also outside of that core client, hedge funds, and different areas like that. So, we're really pleased with the integration from a sales perspective and obviously the integration from a product perspective is going very well. So we're really excited about it. Alex Kramm : Excellent. Thanks. That's it from me. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Appert from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Peter Appert : Thanks. Good morning. So, Phil, I'm wondering if the growth you're seeing in the feed business and some of the other non-workstation businesses has any implications for margins and. And then sort of related to that, whether you see a different level of price sensitivity for the feed business versus the workstation business? Phil Snow : That's a great question, Peter. So in terms of margins, I think what we're faced with FactSet is more ideas than we know what can do. So if we do have higher margins on the feed business, we're going to take that and either reinvest it in more solutions for CTS or other pieces of our business. So I think you can continue to see kind of the same sort of consistency in our margin and as just continuing to reinvest in a business. The CTS suite has evolved. We have invested a lot in that over the last five to 10 years. It was primarily a custom business and it's just been an ongoing campaign really to take all of the content that we have on our system, make it standardize, put more analytics around it and then tie it all together in a way where it makes it really easy for clients to consume. We are working with a lot more outside partners now on solutions to get our data into different third party systems. So it's really doing great. Peter Appert : I would imagine that the fee businesses, CTS business broadly would have to be stickier than traditional workstation business, right harder for barriers to exit for client hire. Is there any quantitative evidence to suggest that is true? Phil Snow : I think your interaction is right there. Once you get a feed into a client, it ends up propagating into a lot of different systems. So it becomes difficult for clients to unravel it sometimes. So it does make it sticky. So we have a lot of momentum in this business. It's one of the fastest growing areas that we have and we're able to sell new solutions to the clients as well as in some cases replace existing solutions. Peter Appert : And then I don't think I'm not sure Phil if you'd address this or not but I know this is sensitive topic but I'm just wondering it may be you have a little bit more pricing power for this business than you do in the workstation business? Phil Snow : What do you mean by that exactly? Peter Appert : If you have better ability to get pricing in the feed business when contracts come up for renewal then you do in a traditional workstation situation because they are potentially fewer alternatives for the client or more expense cost to change\u2026 Phil Snow : Yes, there is a lot of good products out there outside of the workstation just like there are through the workstation. So I think it's a pretty similar exercise for us. It's really sitting down with the client understanding their workflow and partnering with them and showing them that we cannot just provide a great data and solutions to them, it's also providing good service around it. Just consider it in the feed space as well. Peter Appert : Sure, understood. One last thing, Maurizio, yes I think you want us not to get too excited about currency as a source of upside to profitability and I'm just thinking that the moment in the Pound is so dramatic here, recently I'm not sure how you could spend the money quickly enough to offset that benefit. So any thought on that? Maurizio Nicolelli : Peter I said, there may be enough, I just didn't say there would be a significant uptick. It's not the day we walk - it won't affect the margin if the pound stays where it is today. I just didn't say it was going to be significant that's all. Peter Appert : Okay. And I'll get one last and then the Portware I think it's the same of the acquisition you would imply that maybe that was a - somewhat lower margin business and the existing FactSet business, it doesn't seem like it's dramatically moving the margin for you. Is Portware similar profitability to the existing business? Phil Snow : It builds into an operating margin similar to the overall FactSet business. As we grow the business quarter-by-quarter, it's getting closer and closer to where we would like it to be as compared to the FactSet business. Peter Appert : Got it. Thank you. Phil Snow : Thanks, Peter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Toni Kaplan : Hi, good morning. Can you give us any more color on through the overall portfolio strategy specifically with regard to selling Market Metrics? I know you purchased the business in 2010. So just wanted to see if there is sort of any change in strategic priorities since then or was there just something about the business that maybe didn't meet the initial expectations? Phil Snow : Hi Toni, it's Phil Snow. So when we acquired Market Metrics and Matrix great standalone businesses, we thought at the time there was potential to integrate it with the rest of the FactSet offering or suite. That just didn't happen overtime. So when we do acquisitions, I think we typically like to go through a one-plus-one equals more than two exercise and we are really on the buy side we are focused on making sure that we're filling in all the pieces of the investment lifecycle for our clients for that trade and building community between the buy side and the sell side with our research solutions. So that's really our primary focus on just that Market Metrics didn't really fit cleanly into that strategy. Toni Kaplan : Okay, great. And then are there certain areas of M&A that would be very attractive to you right now meaning any sort of capabilities that you would like to look at adding to the existing products at? Phil Snow : So we think our M&A strategy isn't going to differ too much from how it has historically. So if you look back at what we've done, we are typically looking for good workflow solutions that speak to the sort of the strategy that I just spoke about, as well as unique contents that we can leverage both through the workstation and through the feed business. So the acquisitions that we did of Revere and ETF have been exceptionally helpful to FactSet. We can continue to look out in the market for more opportunities like that. Toni Kaplan : Thanks a lot. Phil Snow : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Housum from Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. Keith Housum : Good morning, guys. Well, my questions have been asked; I guess the last one I have here is looking at the Portware business, you guys have been very complimentary in terms of how it has contributed to the business going forward, but if I look at it, it looks like it's been about $10 million of revenue a quarter for you guys. Is there a delay between when you guys will actually get a limit when you starting recognizing the revenue? I'm just trying to understand the growth trajectory of how it's growing in your watch so far. Maurizio Nicolelli : Actually we don't give guidance on -- information on what it's done historically. A $10 million difference is really the 41 million that we bought at acquisition back in September. That would be opening ASV number was 41 million. And that's what you see on the quarterly basis of 10 million. It's done well for us, but we just don't break out the growth for that one area. Keith Housum : Got you. Okay, I appreciate that. And just recently the Market Metrics sale again, is there any parts of your business or are you guys doing a broader analysis in terms of non-core assets and what you might have available for sale? Phil Snow : Hi, it's Phil Snow. So, no, we are not doing a broader analysis. We are happy with all of the assets that we have, and we are just going to continue with executing our strategy. Keith Housum : Great, thank you. Phil Snow : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Chu from Bank of America. Your line is now open. David Chu : Hey, good morning. In terms of the macro picture, I mean, how would you describe client budgets? Are you seeing a significant drop to the budgets? Phil Snow : I'd just say -- it's Phil Snow, just generally does then a lot of cost pressures. This is nothing new. This is thing we've known for years and years and years. And we've been continuing to execute in that environment. So I wouldn't say that it's any worse than it has been, and as both Scott and I have pointed out, as cost pressures come down on clients, regulatory fee pressure, it really opens the opportunity for us to sit down with the clients, have them lay out all of the different services that they get from other providers, and gives us an opportunity to help them, and because we are a trusted partner for our clients. We have been through this two or three times and each time it happens, we have more and more stepped off for them in these types of environments. David Chu : Okay. And then, last quarter it sounded like there were some impact on upselling to the existing clients, but that new business wins were been relatively healthy. How would you describe this quarter? Scott Miller : The new business was off a little bit from our expectations, again, not surprising, just with decision-making slowing a little bit with what's going on in the market. And what I think of is as the organic growth within our current client base, the growth side of that was very healthy. David Chu : Okay. And then lastly, in terms of uncontrollables, what specifically are you referring to, I mean, it sounds like, maybe there is some merger M&A type activity, but what else? Phil Snow : When a firm shuts down, when a user has to leave a firm, ultimately when there is no longer someone there to use our service. David Chu : Okay, got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Bill Warmington : Good morning, everyone. So, a couple of questions; the first on the Market Metrics, 165 million in proceeds, is that a net proceed number, net of taxes or do we have a cost basis to worry about? Maurizio Nicolelli : No, that's the growth sale purchase price. Bill Warmington : Could we get a sense for what the net is you're going to use for the buyback? Maurizio Nicolelli : So we've increased the buyback by 165 million. We haven't broken out what exactly that net number is, obviously, it's just not a net number. Bill Warmington : Okay. The other question I have is, we're hearing from some of the buy siders that Bloomberg has aggressively been going after the research management solutions space, specifically the Code Red clients and they've been now offering this RMS system as part of the Bloomberg subscription at no incremental cost, and so I wanted to ask whether that has had any impact on the client base, whether you've lost any clients, and if so, if it's brought about any change in terms of how you go to market with that product? Scott Miller : Hey, Bill. It's Scott. They've had that solution for long time baked into the terminal. We feel really good about our research management solutions in general, both buy side and sell side. It's been a very strategic part of our overall workflow strategy with our acquisition of Code Red and our own IRN and RMS solutions now are working very well together. We feel really good about our capabilities in the space and we're actually leading in some of the regulatory areas with our solutions to solve some of the Reg problems in this space as well. So we feel great about our RMS business. Phil Snow : Bill, I'll add on to that. It's Phil Snow that I believe this was the strongest quarter we've had from a Code Red standpoint, since the acquisition, it was a really strong quarter for us in the RMS space. Bill Warmington : Got it. All right, well, thank you very much. Phil Snow : All right. Thank you all for participating today and we hope to see a lot of you on Thursday of this week at Investor Day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Lindsey and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the FactSet Research Systems Inc. Fourth Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Ms. Rachel Stern, Senior Vice President, Strategic Resources and General Counsel, you may begin your conference. Rachel Stern : Thank you, operator. Good morning and thanks to all of you for participating today. Welcome to FactSet\u2019s fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. This conference call is being transcribed in real time by FactSet\u2019s CallStreet service and is being broadcast live via the Internet at factset.com. A replay of this call will also be available on our website. Our call will contain forward-looking statements reflecting management\u2019s expectations based on currently available information. Actual results may differ materially. More information about factors that could affect FactSet\u2019s business and financial results can be found in FactSet\u2019s filings with the SEC. Annual Subscription Value, or ASV, is a key metric for FactSet. Please recall that ASV is a snapshot view of client subscriptions and represents our forward-looking revenues for the next 12 months. Lastly, FactSet undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Joining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer; Scott Miller, Director of Global Sales; and Maurizio Nicolelli, FactSet\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. And now, I would like to turn the discussion over to Phil. Phil Snow : Thanks, Rachel and good morning everyone and welcome to the call. Our client-centric approach has always been a key foundation of our success at FactSet and we have noticed in the last quarter that pressures our clients have experienced have not abated. And this is really prompting us to move even closer to them to help them navigate in uncertain markets. As a result, we continue to build market share and grow ASV and earnings. This quarter, we continued our positive top line growth. Q4 \u201816 revenue was up 9.7%, with ASV up 8.8% organically and adjusted EPS up 11.9%. Over the last 12 months, we have returned $431 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends, an increase of 33.5% over the prior year. Our primary growth drivers for this quarter include the following. Our core workstation business was up over 2,000, representing 5.5% growth versus a year ago. Workstations grew across the buy-side and the sell-side and over a number of different client and user types. And on top of this expanding footprint, our value-added analytics and off-platform solutions all showed strong growth in the double-digits. Our robust portfolio analytics solutions have been the cornerstone of our growth in the middle office. And this year, FactSet was named the Best Data Analytics Provider by Waters Technology. We are seeing increased demand for total portfolio risk analytics and increased traction for our fixed income and multi-asset class performance and risk offerings. In addition, we continue to diversify and innovate. A great example is our portfolio services, which supports our clients in integrating, cleansing and building robust analytics on top of their data. This managed service is a great example of broadening our sources of revenue while responding to client needs. Content and Technology Solutions, or CTS, our off-platform data feeds business continued to accelerate this quarter. Clients are developing internal solutions to provide more customization and to help them target their customers and users more directly. Firms are coming to us to integrate unique content and analytics into their client portals, performance systems, CRMs, quant and regulatory workflows. Our strategic acquisition of Portware has provided a new stream of revenue and growth. We have seen notable wins in both the sovereign wealth and investment management space and we have also grown globally with the addition of new clients in Europe, North America and Asia. The integration is going well and we are excited about the new innovative solutions we are working on for our clients. Portware revenues have grown in double-digits since the acquisition and we are now breakeven on a GAAP EPS basis with Portware. Our research management solutions also had a strong quarter. Growth in our RMS suite is driven by the ongoing regulatory demand for transparency across an increasing number of workflows. We will continue to capitalize on marketplace trends, including the movement from active to passive. Our portfolio analytics suite, industry leading EPS data and deep industry taxonomy offer powerful solutions for passive investment workflows. FactSet Revere is a leading taxonomy that has designed unique and proprietary business industry classification systems. On September 12, FactSet reached another milestone with the launch of 4 iShares thematic ETFs by our index licensee partner, BlackRock. BlackRock has collaborated with iSTOXX FactSet to launch thematic indices. They are rules-based, systematic strategy indices built using FactSet proprietary data. An additional source of growth for FactSet is our partnerships. In Q4, we grew our strategic partnership with QUICK to deliver industry leading solutions to investment professionals in Japan and Asia. A newly formed joint sales initiative will focus on supporting and expanding the use of the QUICK FactSet workstation. As we close out a successful fiscal year 2016, here are some of the highlights for the year. We added 116 net new clients and 3,450 net new workstations across a broad set of firm and user types. We expanded our portfolio of multi-asset class value-added products, our offerings and analytics, CTS, research management and Portware all grew in the double-digits. We reinvested across all four pillars of our business, technology, content, analytics and service, adding over 1,000 employees in fiscal year \u201816. Our investment in product, coupled with the acquisition of Portware, now allows us to address an increasingly greater percentage of our clients\u2019 enterprise workflow. At FactSet, we strive to be the best partner for our clients. This strive to be the best includes our technology, which is the backbone behind our solutions. We have made good progress this year on the migration to our next generation technical architecture and clients are already seeing the benefit with significant improvements in speed and new product capabilities. As we go forward, we expect that you will continue to see us differentiate ourselves, building on the core, expanding our suite of enterprise solutions and partnering with our clients to solve their greatest challenges. Let me now turn it over to Maurizio who will give us a more detailed look into our fourth quarter performance. Maurizio Nicolelli : Thank you, Phil and hello to everyone on the call. As you heard from Phil, we continue to significantly grow ASV and EPS during the period in which our clients are experiencing an uncertain environment. Our position in the marketplace enables us to provide clients with meaningful solutions to increase efficiencies and consolidate on to the FactSet enterprise solution. Let\u2019s now go through our fourth quarter results. Revenues in fourth quarter were $287.3 million. Excluding acquired revenue from Portware, the effects of foreign currency and revenue related to the Market Metrics business in all periods presented, organic revenues grew 8.8% over last year. During the just completed fourth quarter, U.S. revenues grew to $190.4 million. Excluding revenue from the Portware acquisition and revenue related to the Market Metrics business, organic revenues in the U.S. were up 7.4% compared to the year ago fourth quarter. Non-U.S. revenues increased to $96.9 million. Revenues from our Europe and Asia-Pac regions were $71.5 million and $25.4 million respectively. Excluding foreign currency, acquired revenue from Portware and revenue related to the Market Metrics business, the international growth rate was 11.7%. This growth rate breaks down into 10% from Europe and 16.8% from Asia-Pacific respectively. Included in our fourth quarter results were the following nonrecurring items. First, operating expenses included $4.6 million in expenses related primarily to legal matters addressed during the quarter. Secondly, other income included a $112.5 million gain on the sale of the Market Metrics business. Adjusted operating income, which excludes $3.7 million of deal-related amortization and the $4.6 million of non-recurring items related primarily to legal matters, grew to $96.1 million, an increase of 6.2% from last year. Adjusted net income, which excludes the non-recurring legal matters deal related amortization and the gain of the sale of the market metrics business increased 8.5% to $68.6 million, while adjusted diluted EPS grew 11.9% to $1.69. Now, let\u2019s take a look at operating expenses. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter totaled $199.6 million. Our adjusted operating margin, which excludes non-recurring items and deal related amortization was 33.4% this quarter, up 40 basis points from the just completed third quarter. Fourth quarter cost of services expressed as a percentage of revenues increased by 210 basis points compared to the year ago period. The increase was driven by higher compensation and amortization of intangible assets. Employee compensation expense grew due to headcount expansion from new hires and the addition of Portware. The increase in amortization of intangible assets primarily relates to the acquisition of Portware less than 12 months ago. SG&A expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues was flat compared to the year ago fourth quarter. The non-recurring legal matter expenses and higher marketing costs were offset by lower compensation expense. Increased marketing costs were driven by incremental branding and advertising costs, while compensation costs decreased due to the sale of the market metrics business. At the end of the fourth fiscal quarter, we had 8,375 employees. Excluding employees added from the Portware acquisition and those lost in the sale of the market metrics business, headcount has increased 13.4% from the year ago period. The fourth quarter effective tax rate was 27.8%. Excluding income tax benefits, the fiscal 2016 annual effective tax rate was 28.3% compared to 30.3% in the year ago period. The 200 basis point decline was primarily driven from the re-enactment of the Federal R&D income tax credit earlier in the fiscal 2016 year. Free cash flow during the last three months was $57 million, a decrease of $16.3 million from the same period last year. The decrease was a result of higher income tax payment related to the gain on the sale of the market metrics business, partially offset by strong cash collections, which lowered client receivables. Our DSOs were 31 days at the end of the fourth quarter compared to 33 days in the prior year period. Our cash and investments balance was $253 million, up $41.5 million during the quarter. We define free cash flow as cash generated from operations less capital spending. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 258,000 shares in the open market at an average price of $166 per share. In addition, on July 1, 2016, we entered into an accelerated stock repurchase program to repurchase an additional $120 million of FactSet common stock. As a result of the ASR, we received approximately 600,000 shares of our common stock on that date, which was equal to 80% of the total number of shares of common stock expected to be repurchased under the ASR. The final settlement of the accelerated stock repurchase program is scheduled to occur in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Our diluted weighted average shares decreased by 516,000 shares, primarily as a result of our open market repurchase activity and the ASR program, partially offset by higher share price increasing from the dilution from outstanding share based equity awards. Now, let\u2019s turn to our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. For the fiscal \u2013 the first quarter, we expect that revenues will range between $286 million and $292 million. GAAP operating margin should range between 31% and 32%, while adjusted operating margins should range between 32.5% and 33.5%. We expect our annual effective tax rate to range between 28% and 29%. GAAP EPS is expected to range between $1.62 and $1.66. Adjusted EPS is expected to range between $1.68 and $1.72. The midpoint of this range suggests a 14.5% increase year-over-year growth. In summary, we are pleased with our fourth quarter performance as organic ASV was a strong 8.8%, while adjusted EPS grew 310 basis points higher than ASV at 11.9%. Looking at the first quarter, the midpoint of our guidance suggests 8.8% organic revenue growth and 14.5% adjusted EPS growth. We are pleased with our industry position and market opportunities as we help our clients navigate and consolidate on to FactSet during this difficult environment. As we continue to partner with our clients and invest aggressively in our product and people, we believe FactSet is well positioned to outperform the market. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call. We are now ready for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Your line is now open. Hamzah Mazari : Good morning. Thank you. I was wondering if you could give us an update on the competitive environment, any change you are seeing from the competition, whether it be more aggressive pricing or whether it would be new products or any bundling of services, any color around any change in the environment would be helpful? Scott Miller : Hi Hamzah, it\u2019s Scott Miller. We haven\u2019t seen significant shifts in the quarter. The themes that we have really seen over the last couple of quarters stayed true. It\u2019s \u2013 there is some challenges in the market out there and that gets competitors trying to figure out how to mitigate cancellations and things like that, so we have seen a little more activity. But the themes haven\u2019t really changed in the last couple of quarters. Hamzah Mazari : Okay, great. And just a follow-up question, is there any sense \u2013 could you give us a sense of how much of your business is sort of workflow related where you are connected into your client enterprise system and tends to be very sticky versus a business that\u2019s just primarily a desktop solution, any qualitative or quantitative color would be helpful? Thank you. Phil Snow : Hi Hamzah, it\u2019s Phil Snow. So we like to think that most of our product is sticky. Our users really love us. It does \u2013 the fee business definitely tends to be a little bit stickier over time once you have it in there. But our portfolio analytics workflow and everything that we do for our clients, all the way from research through portfolio management, now trading, performance and risk and client reporting, we cover all of those things for our clients. So it\u2019s the seamless connection of that workflow at the entire enterprise that makes FactSet such a compelling offering for our clients. It\u2019s not individual kind of types of users or workflows. It\u2019s the entire enterprise that\u2019s using our system now. Hamzah Mazari : Great. Thank you so much. Phil Snow : Thank you for the question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ashley Serrao from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Ashley Serrao : Good morning. So international growth continues to be strong, I was just hoping if you could talk about the types of clients that are driving incremental wins for you in the region and how pipelines are looking like today? Scott Miller : Hi Ashley, it\u2019s Scott Miller. The international business is growing very well. It tends to be fairly diverse as it is in the U.S., in the Americas, in general. In Asia-Pac, we are \u2013 we have good workstation growth, but also great growth in our multi-asset class risk and analytics. And our fee business is doing very well throughout Asia-Pac as well and that\u2019s echoed throughout EMEA. We get into some larger buy side markets like the UK market. We tend to see more coming in the portfolio analytics and spaces like that. But it\u2019s fairly broad and it\u2019s been consistent growth and we really like the international market. Ashley Serrao : Okay. And then maybe switching gears to the U.S. market, perhaps if you can just provide some color on the deceleration in growth here this quarter, I know it\u2019s still early in the quarter, but just in the context of continued hiring and the reinvestment of currency benefits back into the business, should we expect the return to shop in results over the coming year or how are you thinking about the U.S. side of the story? Scott Miller : The U.S. market, the story for us was two fold. We had a record growth in new client acquisitions, so we brought on a bunch of brand new clients, which was terrific and that was across predominantly buy side, hedge fund, middle market buy side and the wealth area, but it was mixed with an increased cancellation rate that was what I would call market related. So, it was clients going out of business, hedge funds going out of business, some of the smaller buy side where they have been shedding employees. So, that was really the story was it was great growth sales, mixed with increased market related cancellation. But in general, we feel good about the Americas. We have got some terrific wins in both the sell side and the buy side space. So, we feel good about the pipeline in the future. Ashley Serrao : Alright, thanks for taking my questions. Maurizio Nicolelli : And just to answer your question on currency, we saw a little bit of benefit during the quarter in that our adjusted operating margin trended towards the upper end of our range. Going forward, you will still see our operating margin be within the range as we continue to reinvest within the business. Ashley Serrao : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is now open. Greg Bardi : Hi, this is actually Greg calling on for Manav. Thanks for the details on the workstation growth. I think you said 5.5% in the fourth quarter. Just for context, would you be able to give some of those numbers going back a few quarters? Maurizio Nicolelli : Yes, those are public numbers. So, we can get you more detail later if you need it, but we report these numbers every quarter. Greg Bardi : Okay. And then just thinking about the growth deceleration and kind of ending up towards the bottom end of guidance, just wondering on the color between base business growth and new business growth, I think you had some color on the increased cancellations. So, what you are seeing there and is that all of seen in the fourth quarter or do we have further flow-through as we look into the first quarter of \u201817? Scott Miller : Hi. It\u2019s Scott, Greg. We definitely saw an increase in the quarter of the market-related cancellations in that buy side sector. It feels like the worst of it\u2019s over and it feels like we have come through and I would talk to the sales force and look at the pipeline and get a sense of what they are feeling out there and it feels like it\u2019s feeling healthier. Greg Bardi : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Chu with Bank of America. Your line is now open. David Chu : Hey, Scott. You just mentioned that the environment is starting to feel a little bit healthier. Can you just, I guess, describe what you are seeing? Scott Miller : Well, in general, our \u2013 we feel good about the product offering we have, the client base that we are going after. So, I am not sure where you want to see the detail. But in general, we feel good about the prospects that we have as we have throughout the year. David Chu : So, from maybe client cancellation perspective, do you expect that to moderate go forward? Scott Miller : I can\u2019t read the markets, but we feel good about \u2013 certainly feel good about the prospects and the business, the new business and the add-on potential that we have across our current client base is still feeling very good. So, I wish I could read the markets, I can\u2019t but I am feeling good about our overall prospects in general. Phil Snow : Okay. The thing to remember to is that we are relatively small compared to some of our competitors. We have an expanding product suite. And on a relative basis, we are doing exceptionally well. So, the way that we approach our clients in a tough market, it\u2019s to our benefit. So, we feel that by getting closer to them, by continuing to provide a greater expanding suite of solutions that even if they are feeling pressure that we are going \u2013 we can succeed. David Chu : Got it. And just one additional question, how would you describe non-terminal revenue growth in the quarter? I mean, is the pace of growth slightly moderate versus 3Q or was it largely in line? Phil Snow : It depends on the area. But as I mentioned in my opening, as it is Phil Snow, all each area grew in double-digits. Some pieces have been growing at 10%. Other pieces are closer to 20%. But that entire suite of add-on products is doing exceptionally well. And we are very pleased that we were able to add users this quarter, which expands our foundation. And if you look back at our history, as we expand our footprint, it really allows us to add on more and more of these value-added products over time. David Chu : Okay, got it. And just one last, I mean, would you say that Portware is the fastest growing piece of the non-terminal revenue segments? Maurizio Nicolelli : It\u2019s a very high growing piece of it, yes. David Chu : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Toni Kaplan : Thank you. Good morning. Phil Snow : Good morning, Toni. Toni Kaplan : Are you seeing any customers asking for coverage reductions to their subscriptions like dropping specific premium offerings or is it more just as you are mentioning the sort of cancels on these sort of smaller funds that are shutting in place? Phil Snow : The impact was more from those market-related cancellations. The positive impact of a more challenging market is we have more conversations with our clients and we have got to help them solve for not only to all the cost of ownership, but better workflow and better performance. So, we are having some really great conversations out there. But that \u2013 the piece of the cancellation was much more market related than anything else. Toni Kaplan : Got it. And then you have had really strong hiring in the full year of fiscal \u201816 even excluding Portware, I think sort of around that 13% level. And in the past, I think your strategy has been to hire to where you think growth is going to be. Should we expect that hiring continues at these levels or maybe slows to catch up with our wait for growth to catch up? Phil Snow : Hey, Toni, it\u2019s Phil Snow. So, I kind of speak to that a little bit. So, since we opened Centers of Excellence in Manila and Hyderabad, we have been able to expand the capabilities that we have there in terms of the types of work we do. So, we are beginning to do more product and engineering-related activities on top of the great content collection that we already do there. So, some of the growth in hiring you are seeing is from those low cost locations. And we have so many great investment ideas for our product that we are really bullish about being able to use these centers to develop more products for our clients. Whether or not we will see the same level of growth in those areas this year, we are not sure. It really just depends on how aggressive we want to be about building out more products in those locations. Toni Kaplan : Got it. And just one last one for me, Phil, you mentioned in the opening remarks about the ETF business. And so I was just hoping you could expand on the strategy going forward for passive business and what we should expect in the upcoming quarter? Phil Snow : Sure. I would be happy to do that. So, we have helped our clients with their passive workflows for sometime. The suite of products we have, particularly in analytics, with alpha-testing some of the risk capabilities in PA really allow clients to kind of research what would be a good strategy for ETF. And with the acquisition of ETF.com, we got the best-of-breed content out there for ETFs along with some great thought leadership. So, what we are finding now is that we can address a lot of different pieces of the ETF workflow. We can do ETF due diligence. We can help clients with ETF creation, ETF research. And of course, the PA suite allows you to compare, if you are an active manager, how are you doing versus passive or compare different passive strategies. We are also aggressively building out our ETF coverage in some of the holdings, but we are able to get those daily. We are really cleaning them. And that\u2019s a product set that we are very excited about. Coming up for the future, we are very focused on the U.S. holdings right now, but we have a plan to expand that to international coverage. So, we are firing on all cylinders. It\u2019s a good piece of our business and we see this shift going on in the marketplace. We feel uniquely positioned to help clients that either just want to do passive or want to do a combination of active and passive strategies. Toni Kaplan : Thanks a lot. Phil Snow : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is now open. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Were the wins in the quarter in the U.S. all takeaways and can you just give a little bit more color as to what kind of wins they were, I know you mentioned it before, but maybe just a little bit more detail? Scott Miller : The wins Shlomo, we saw them across a bunch of different client types end solutions. We had some terrific wins in the sell side space within research, both in terms of global banks and regional as well. We saw some really significant wins in the multi-asset class, analytics and risk space. And then from a user type perspective, wealth was very strong, saw some very good wins in that space. Our corporation sectors continue to do very well. And buy side research, we saw some great wins there too. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. And then if there were higher cancellations in the quarter, how come the retention levels that are reported remained the same? Maurizio Nicolelli : Hi Shlomo, this is Maurizio. It\u2019s really driven by the dollar base, so the cancellations are at the lower end of our total client base. So the dollars are smaller, so it still remains at the 95% level. Shlomo Rosenbaum : So the smaller ones are canceling a little bit higher level because whatever some of the business they are shedding business or going out of business, are you having higher retention of the larger clients, is that offsetting it? Scott Miller : Yes, that\u2019s a fair assessment. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. And hey Maurizio, would you guys borrow money or increase the debt levels to repurchase more stock than what you have been doing? Maurizio Nicolelli : We have \u2013 that\u2019s come up a lot in discussion. We have always shied away from doing so. We always want that capability to be able to have that ability to go borrow money if something significant comes along on the M&A front. So there is really no change in terms of our capital allocation right now. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. And just in terms of the wins that you saw in the U.S. and internationally, is there any competitor out there that was a little bit more lopsided and who you are taking business from? Scott Miller : Nothing that I would point out, Shlomo, it was fairly broad based. It was the typical competitors so that we go up against. But we definitely \u2013 we saw some strategic wins. I mentioned sell side research and the multi-asset class analytics. So there were some specific areas where we were really excited. But they were against the typical competitors we come up against. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from line of Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is open. Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy: I was hoping you can talk about mechanics of the Portware cross-sell, so you are selling to the same organization, but presumably different personnel at that organization, so kind of how do the mechanics work. And then on a related note, with the Thomson Reuters acquisition of a competitor to Portware, do you kind of see that as validation of your strategy? Phil Snow : Yes. This is Phil Snow. So I will address the second question first there. Yes, we do see it as a validation of our strategy. Our \u2013 the Portware piece of FactSet is really addressing the high end of the market. So we are in the very largest asset managers, sovereigns and also sophisticated hedge funds. So that\u2019s not a competitor that we have seen very much while Portware has been here and I think for many years prior to that. But I think it does point to the fact that it was an important piece of what we wanted to do. We just wanted to do it with a different client base at a different level. Scott Miller : Sorry, I was going to add on. Patrick, from a cross-sell perspective, I am really excited about it. We had anticipated that our general sales force would be able to identify opportunities for Portware and we could leverage certain Portware clients to cross-sell our analytical solutions as well. And we are seeing that happening. So we are really excited about it. Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy: Got it. Thank you. And then for my follow-up question, there was a tick down in your ASV per user this quarter and given some of the strength that we are seeing in Portware and some of your market data feeds, kind of curious what was underlying that decrease quarter-over-quarter? Phil Snow : As we have said in previous quarters, that\u2019s just not a metric. We even track ourselves, frankly. So it\u2019s \u2013 our business is so broad based with different things. I think if you are following us by ASV per user, that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s something that we don\u2019t track. Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy: Got it, okay. Thank you very much. Phil Snow : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Peter Appert : Phil at the Investor Day, I think you had promised that perhaps you would be trying to give a little more transparency in terms of revenue drivers on a go-forward basis, so I am wondering if you can give us any concrete numbers in terms of the desktop business versus the non-desktop business from a revenue perspective currently, so the current mix and the respective growth rates? Phil Snow : Yes. Peter thank you for the question. We were definitely anticipating that. So we continued to look at our business and really think about the best way to measure and segment it. We are still doing some work on that. So at this point, we are really just going to I think stick to what we have done historically. I think we have indicated some really high growth rates for some of our add-on products. But at this point, we are not really in the best position to break that out for you in any more detail. Peter Appert : Do you think, Phil that \u2013 so you are seeing slower growth in terms of terminal count, obviously offset at the moment by strength in the other businesses, on a go-forward basis, does that arithmetic continue to apply and I am trying to think about the sustainability of recent revenue growth? Phil Snow : So we still see Peter great opportunity in both our core workstation product and all of the other value-added products that we have developed and integrated. So we are \u2013 there is still a ton of market share out there for us. Our clients are definitely facing some headwinds, the core client base that FactSet does address, but our expansion into multi-asset analytics, multi-asset class analytics, the fact that we now have almost every point in the investment life cycle for our largest investment and it just ticked off. But even if they are slowing down hiring or even negative in hiring and assets are flowing between different assets types so from active to passive, we still feel very uniquely positioned moving forward given the level of reinvestment in the business to grow every area of our business. It\u2019s just going to differ quarter-to-quarter depending on what\u2019s going on. Peter Appert : Understood. One last thing, the legal charge, can you tell us what that was about? Maurizio Nicolelli : Sure. Peter, it\u2019s Maurizio. It\u2019s \u2013 we had a few legal matters that were specific to the period that we reserved for during the period, which is really items that will really pertain specifically to Q4 that were just non-recurring or out of the ordinary. Peter Appert : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is now open. Alex Kramm : Yes. Hi, good morning. Phil Snow : Good morning. Alex Kramm : Just coming back to a couple of things you have talked about, I think you talked about the competitive environment a little bit, I think in the past you have been a little bit more specific, so wondering if you could talk about SNL, Capital IQ a little bit, I mean they are going through a big integration, two organizations coming together, in the past you have taken advantage of those times, so anything you are doing there in particular, in engaging with clients and disrupting a little bit or nothing to point out? Scott Miller : Hi Alex, it\u2019s Scott. So my comment earlier that we haven\u2019t seen a dramatic shift is that we have sort of been seeing this over the last six months or so, what I called a few quarters ago, a disruption in the competitor space. It\u2019s still out there. We see it as an opportunity because it in many cases, gives us the chance to go and have additional conversations with our clients and it gives us a chance to go and showcase our solutions and prove our value until the cost of ownership and performance play that we have. Specific to S&P Capital IQ, it hasn\u2019t really changed dramatically in the quarter. We see them in the investment banking space. That\u2019s where we see them the most. And we have got terrific solutions in that space. So again not a big change in the competitor environment over the last quarters, it\u2019s been consistent over the last couple of quarters. Alex Kramm : Alright, great. And then just stepping back for a second here, I know this is a couple of quarters ago, but I remember when you were very excited about the environment and we are talking about getting back to double-digits ASV growth. I think you have kind of pulled back from that last quarter given the environment, but with everything else you are seeing there outside of the environment, are you \u2013 you think there is an opportunity to return to that kind of long-term outlook again or what do think something has changed to some kind of shelf life for the time being? Thank you. Maurizio Nicolelli : Great question. Thank you. So, yes, we feel the potential is out there for us, as I just mentioned. So, it really \u2013 there is a lot of things going on within our client base. They are definitely feeling decompression. But again, we feel uniquely positioned to work with clients and take advantage of what\u2019s going on in the market. So, we are not going to give out sort of future predictions about our growth rate, but FactSet is a great company. We have awesome people. We have great technology and product and we are really optimistic about the future. Alex Kramm : Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open. Joseph Foresi : Hi. Cancellations picked up in the quarter, but I think you said you expected stability from here. I guess I am wondering why the stability? Is it that you are replacing the business quicker than its leading or are there other catalysts? I am just wondering I know you talked to the sales force, but I am wondering what the puts and takes are there? Scott Miller : I will correct myself and say that I wasn\u2019t predicting stability. It\u2019s a choppy market out there. The positive aspects for us are what Phil had mentioned before. We have broad-based solutions, a broad-based client base and we have got \u2013 we have got the ongoing capability, which we have had over the previous quarters to go and sell into this market very well. Joseph Foresi : Okay. So, I mean is it a matter of \u2013 I guess, as a follow-up, is it a matter of replacing the loss business? Any specific industry, let\u2019s call it buy side, with some of your newer offerings, is that what your goal is there or is it a matter of there just being less cancellations in those end markets? Phil Snow : The broader opportunity for us moving forward is within our largest clients today. So, yes, as clients consolidate and we have a broader suite of offerings across different workflows and asset classes, the biggest opportunity for us as a firm is to go in and replace our competitors\u2019 products that are out there and address new workflows. If clients are building things themselves, which a lot of them are doing, that\u2019s not necessarily a replacement. It\u2019s just helping the client do things more efficiently and help things solve their problems, but the market that we are in really is one of replacing competitors. There is not a lot of workflows out there, now, where our clients want to pay 2x or 3x for duplicative services. So, that\u2019s \u2013 we fit in that environment for a while. And again, we feel really well positioned to succeed in that type of environment given who we are as a company and the culture we have and how we work with our clients. Joseph Foresi : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Glenn Greene : Thank you. Good morning. Just a couple of sort of follow-ups some things that have been alluded to, but just to be clear on the client attrition dynamic that you talked about. It sounds like it was very small clients, such so small that it would have a de minimis impact on ASV, which is \u2013 so it didn\u2019t have \u2013 the question is, did we see any meaningful impact on ASV from the client attrition or was it too small to factor in? Scott Miller : It was an impact. I am not sure meaningful is the right word for it. It was an increased impact than we have seen in the last couple of quarters. So, it was one of the reasons why we pulled back a bit was there was some increase in the number of market-related cancellations. Glenn Greene : Okay. And then Portware, I think you alluded to double-digit revenue growth and I think you framed it as GAAP breakeven. I mean by my math and hopefully you can corroborate this or is this Portware sort of running at a $50 million, $55 million sort of plus revenue rate and could you sort of help us with the adjusted margins, how to think about where they are now directionally? Maurizio Nicolelli : We don\u2019t give ASV by product line. Obviously, Portware started with $39 million and has done well in double-digit growth since we have purchased the company. On the adjusted margin, it still has a lower adjusted margin than FactSet, but it is becoming more and more profitable as each quarter goes along. It was breakeven to GAAP EPS this quarter and it was $0.04 accretive to adjusted EPS during the period. Glenn Greene : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just the final one, I think you alluded to the wealth management business doing, I think the quote was very strong and I think that\u2019s been going on for a while as it\u2019s sort of the newer channel for you, but maybe could you give help us frame the degree of growth and how meaningful it is to your business at this point again directionally? Scott Miller : Yes, like many of the markets that we are playing in, the addressable market is great for us. It\u2019s got lots of upside. We are relatively small and relatively in terms of some of the markets we play in. So, the upside potential is great. The wealth space, we are still focusing on the higher end of that market as we talked about in the past. Our solutions play wonderfully in there, because we can mix workstation with some analytics that play into the wealth space. Phil talked about ETF. It\u2019s an important driver in that space for us as well as they look at both active strategies and trying to solve for passive as well. So, we are really well positioned in that space and we like it a lot. Glenn Greene : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair. Your line is now open. Tim McHugh : Yes, thanks. I just want to ask about the headcount, the organic 13%. I know you said some of it\u2019s investing in your facilities, but I was hoping to get a little more color. I am trying to think about how much that is there how quick are you growing sale headcount versus kind of R&D customer support \u2013 trying to understand where the headcount increase is going? Phil Snow : So, I think we got most of that question. It came in a little choppy. Tim, I believe, you were asking about how we spread out the headcount? Tim McHugh : Yes. Phil Snow : So, we definitely \u2013 we have always reinvest in our sales force. Our sales force is a combination of hires right out of school as well as industry hires and that\u2019s such an important piece of our business that we have multiple classes a year that come in globally and those consultants that we hire go on to become salespeople. They go on to become subject matter experts, product developers and so on. So, we continue to hire there and we continue to hire in every aspect of our business. I would say that for product and engineering and content, it was probably more tilted towards the lower cost locations this year than in previous years. Tim McHugh : Okay, the sales headcount similar to the pace of overall headcount? Phil Snow : We don\u2019t break that out specifically, but we did reinvest well in the sales force last year. Tim McHugh : Okay. And my only other question is the cancellations I think you said it was mostly because of smaller people going into business. If you adjusted for that, is there any difference in the kind of the win loss versus competition as it relates to the cancellation rate during the quarter? Scott Miller : The win loss versus competition for us the way we track it was actually a little bit more positive in our favor than we have seen before. Tim McHugh : Okay, thank you. Scott Miller : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Andre Benjamin : Thanks and good morning. Phil Snow : Hey, Andre. Andre Benjamin : My first question I was just wondering if there has been any change to the length of the selling cycle as you go in and talk to a lot of these firms. And then I am thinking specifically about Europe, you have reported double-digit growth there. It\u2019s been a challenged financial environment. So, just wondering what\u2019s driving such strong growth there? And any color on desktop versus some of the other businesses that can be doing that? Phil Snow : There has been no dramatic shift in the \u2013 in who we are selling into in the European market and the types of solutions that are selling well there. There was a slight slowdown in the sales cycle in the UK when Brexit came out. People were sitting and sort of contemplating a little bit. We saw that and we see that picking up now. So, there was no dramatic change in the sales cycle. Our European business is doing great. Our international business in general is doing great and we see that continuing. Andre Benjamin : Okay. And then I know around the time of the [indiscernible] the same day you made announcement that you were going to be working with the Symphony Communications platform. I was just wondering where that stands. Is the tie-in complete? And if it is, are you seeing any impact of that on client wins or your dialogue with your clients? Phil Snow : Andre, it\u2019s Phil Snow. Yes, to follow-up on that, our development teams have been working very closely together since we last spoke, working on the integration, being able to get from FactSet to Symphony and vice versa. So we can\u2019t talk about when those APIs are going to be released. But the team has really accelerated its efforts. We are hearing that there is quite a bit of activity in the marketplace, but I wouldn\u2019t anticipate that it\u2019s going to have any meaningful impact on ASV or revenues for quite a while. Andre Benjamin : Okay, thank you. Phil Snow : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. Keith Housum : Great. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. Good morning. Just a broader question here, does this apply second quarter role, I think we have heard you guys talk about cancellations, based on your experience, are the cancellations coming from, is it more poor performance from the underlying funds or is it pressure from withdrawals and perhaps due to competitive pressure from the ETFs? Phil Snow : That\u2019s a great question. So we definitely, if you look at the net new fund flows, active versus passive, there has definitely been on out-flowing from active equity. So I would say that we have been feeling some of that pressure, particularly for the active managers that are underperforming. That\u2019s definitely one aspect of it. Keith Housum : Okay. And as you look at your R&D, especially in the ETF area, I guess how would you describe your efforts, are you in the first inning of a nine inning ballgame or how do you feel about your products that you have in development to offset, I guess what could very well be sustained periods of cancellations recent reports that are out there? Phil Snow : So we are aggressively investing, particularly on the content side, having the highest quality content in that area is important. We feel like we already do and we just want to broaden that gap between ourselves and our competitors. Keith Housum : So your ETF products would be more geared towards the buy side or the sell side? Phil Snow : They are more geared to the buy side. Keith Housum : Okay, thank you. Phil Snow : Sure. That\u2019s it. Thank you everyone and we will see you again next quarter. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Lastly, FactSet undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Joining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer and Maurizio Nicolelli, Chief Financial Officer. And now, I would like to turn the discussion over to Phil. Philip Snow : Thanks Rachel, good morning everyone and welcome to today's call. Overtime FactSet has proven to have an extraordinarily resilient business model. We believe we are able to remain successful because we evolve and innovate and we excel at client service and in partnering with our clients.  The first quarter was challenging this year but we executed well on both the top and bottom line. ASV during the quarter grew 7.9% organically to 1.17 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 18% to $1.75 well above our guidance of $1.68 to $1.72. Growth was sustained across all regions. We saw strength particularly in Asia Pac and EMEA with ASV from international operations growing 9.3% organically to $405 million. Our non-U.S. ASV now represents 34.6% of our total up from 32.6% a year ago.  We did continue to see some cost pressure within the client base and when compared to Q1 of last year we saw an uptick in firm closures. That being said our growth this quarter was broadly distributed across a number of segments and user workflows. Let me highlight a few areas. First just over a year into our acquisition Portware continues to shine. With advanced analytics and cutting edge technology we\u2019ve grown market share in the EMS space. Portware had a strong quarter with accelerated client trading volumes and the addition of new clients.  Second, our multi asset class analytic solutions keep gaining momentum. We closed several significant deals this quarter and we continue to see strong growth in the risk and portfolio services. This product segment is a focused area of investment and we expect to see further positive results of our efforts as we move through the fiscal year of 2017. As the investment community moves increasingly towards multi asset class instruments, our offerings are advancing to meet their needs.  Third, we saw a healthy deployment across wealth management in Q1. Our success in wealth stems from our ability to address the advanced portfolio analytics and multi asset class research and analysis needs of our wealth management clients serving the high and ultra high network investors. We are picking up market share and wealth by offering superior functionality while simultaneously helping firms lower their costs.  While we had a strong performance in Q1 we\u2019re not satisfied. Market pressures demand new solutions and this is exactly why we invest to capitalize on the new opportunities ahead. We continue to evolve our company to build out solutions across more client workflows and this quarter we did so through both innovation and acquisition. This quarter we released FDS Web, a web based version of the FactSet workstation. The significant investments we have made over the last few years in evolving our technology stack have made this release possible. FDS Web offers many of the same reports and features of the installed workstation that is readily and easily accessible over the web. There is more to come here, we\u2019re really excited about what this means for our clients in terms of speed, mobility, and opening up new users.  In addition we\u2019ve released several new enhancements to our FactSet Reviewer industry classification system which allows users to better monitor their exposure and understand their risk and performance. While innovation is critical to our evolution FactSet has been successfully using strategic acquisitions to grow our business further and provide more comprehensive solutions for our client\u2019s core workflows. The acquisition of CYMBA Technologies and Vermilion Software have extended our solutions across the enterprise workflow of our clients.  CYMBA is a provider of high performance multi asset class investment management solutions for front office fund management and trading teams. We welcome the CYMBA team at the end of September. Vermilion is a leading global provider of client reporting and communication software and services to the financial services industry. Client reporting is a rapidly growing area of the market as a regulatory requirements increase. Vermilion\u2019s flagship product, the Vermilion Reporting Suite is an enterprise solution that provides transparency through the entire client reporting process. We completed this acquisition in early November. While we anticipate that both CYMBA and Vermilion will expand our depth of involvement at our current clients, we are already seeing positive signs that these acquisitions will produce growth and the extension into new clients. In Q1 we saw the beginnings of revenue synergies as cross sell opportunities arose from our new acquisitions.  FactSet's mission is to solve our client\u2019s greatest challenges with the power of collaboration. In Q1 we sought and found new ways to do that and as we look ahead to Q2 we are confident in our opportunity to continue to grow ASV and to generate high levels of profitability and believe FactSet is well positioned to outperform the overall market. Let me now turn it over to Maurizio who will give a more detailed look into our first quarter performance as well as our guidance for Q2. Maurizio Nicolelli : Thank you Phil and hello to everyone on the call. In the first quarter we continued to grow ASV and EPS while investing for future growth through our M&A activities. Our ability to solve our clients\u2019 needs has been a core strength of FactSet over the years and continues to drive us forward. Let's now go through the first quarter results. Revenues in first quarter were $288 million. Excluding acquired revenue from the recent acquisitions, the effects of foreign currency and revenue related to the Market Metrics business in all periods presented, organic revenues grew 8.4% over the last year. During the just completed first quarter, U.S. revenues grew to $190.6 million. Excluding acquired revenues and revenue related to the sold Market Metrics business, organic revenues in the U.S. were up 7.4% compared to the year ago first quarter. Non-U.S. revenues increased to $97.5 million. Excluding foreign currency, acquired revenues and revenue related to the sold Market Metrics business, the international growth rate was 11%. This growth rate breaks down to 9.9% from Europe and 14.3% from Asia-Pacific respectively. Included in our first quarter results was a non-recurring expense totaling $954,000 resulting from the CYMBA and Vermilion acquisition. These expenses were for professional fees, local taxes paid, and also other acquisition related costs. Adjusted operating income grew to up 95 million excluding $3.8 million of intangible asset amortization and the $954,000 of non-recurring acquisition cost. Adjusted net income, which excludes the non-recurring acquisition related cost and intangible asset amortization increased 12% to $70.1 million, while adjusted diluted EPS grew 18% to $1.75. Now, let\u2019s take a look at operating expenses. Operating expenses for the first quarter totaled $197.7 million. Our adjusted operating margin, excluding $954,000 in acquisition cost and $3.8 million of intangible asset amortization was 33% this quarter, down 40 basis points from the just completed fourth quarter. The two acquisitions reduced our adjusted operating margin by 20 basis points during the first quarter.  First quarter cost of services expressed as a percentage of revenues increased by 180 basis points compared to the year ago period. The increase was driven by higher compensation and amortization of intangible assets. Employee compensation expense grew due to headcount expansion in India and the Philippines and the addition of Vermilion and CYMBA employees. The increase in amortization of intangible assets primarily relates to the two acquisitions during the first quarter. SG&A expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues was down 80 basis points compared to the year ago first quarter. The decline was the result of lower compensation expenses partially offset by higher marketing expenses and increased local tax cost. Employee compensation is lower due to the sale of the Market Metrics business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Marketing costs increased due to higher branding and advertising campaigns, while local tax cost rose due to the two acquisitions during the quarter.  At the end of our first fiscal quarter, we had 8,713 employees. Excluding employees added from the CYMBA and Vermilion acquisitions and employees in the sold Market Metrics business, headcount increased 10.5% from a year ago. Effective September 1, 2016 we realigned certain assets of our global operations from FactSet Research Systems, Inc our U.S. parent company to FactSet UK Limited our UK operating company to better position us to serve our growing client base outside the United States.  This realignment allows us to implement strategic corporate objectives while achieving significant operations and financial efficiencies. This realignment is structured to compliment our increasing global growth and reach. The realignment was not announced in September as we were actively implementing the change internally and also with our international client base. As a result of the realignment and the reenactment of the Federal R&D Income Tax credit our effective tax rate declined 550 basis points to 25.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to 31.4% in the prior year period. Free cash flow during the last three months was $39 million, a decrease of $18 million from the same period last year. We defined free cash flow as cash generated from operations less capital spending. The $18 million decrease was the result of higher client receivables and the timing of U.S. payroll processed during the period. Our DSOs worked 34 days at the end of the first quarter compared to 32 days in the prior year period. As part of the realignment the majority of our international clients are now invoiced through our UK entity. This change delayed payments from some clients and drove up client receivables less than 60 days outstanding.  The timing of when U.S. salaries were paid in November 2016 compared to the prior year period also lowered our free cash flow. Our cash and investments balance was a 194 million down 58 million during the quarter. Our diluted weighted average shares decreased by 572,000 shares primarily as a result of our open market repurchase activity and the completion of our accelerated share repurchase program. During the first quarter we repurchased 505,000 shares of FactSet common stock under our existing share repurchase program and at an average price of $157 per share. In addition final settlement of our previously disclosed ASR program occurred during the first quarter.  Now let\u2019s turn to our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. For the fiscal second quarter we expect revenues will range between 293 million and 298 million. Please note that we typically deploy our annual price increase every January. ASV from our annual price increase is projected to be 10 million compared to 9.4 million a year ago.  GAAP operating margin should range between 31% and 32% while adjusted operating margin should range between 32.5% and 33.5%. We expect our annual effective tax rate to range between 25.5% and 26.5%. GAAP EPS is expected to range between $1.70 and $1.74. Adjusted EPS is expected to range between $1.78 and $1.82. The midpoint of this range suggests a 13% year-over-year adjusted EPS growth increase.  In summary we are pleased to see our business perform well in this difficult market environment. Our first quarter performance metrics including 8% organic ASV growth and 18% adjusted EPS growth highlight the strength of our business model. In looking forward to the second quarter, the midpoint of our guidance suggests 7% organic revenue growth and 13% adjusted EPS growth. As we navigate through this market environment we are confident in our opportunity to grow ASV and generate high levels of profitability. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call, we are now ready for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald, your line is now open. Joseph Foresi : Hi, I think you talked about some of the strengths in your opening remarks but could you just give us an update on some of the areas that are weak and have you seen any changes there? Philip Snow : Sure Joe, hi it's Phil Snow. So as I mentioned we are seeing growth and strength and wealth. We\u2019re also seeing great momentum in our analytics business. I would say if I was to highlight one area that was weaker versus the same quarter last year it would be banking but I do want to remind everyone that Q1 is traditionally light at the banking that\u2019s access is our clients rationalizing headcount going into the end of the year. Within banking we did see some pricing pressure focusing on headcount and costs and we are seeing capital IQ and ethanol bundling their products in some cases. Clients are not happy about that and the good thing is they are coming to us and asking us how we can help but that would be the one area I would highlight in terms of weakness. Joseph Foresi : Okay, and then on the margin profile I know you gave some quarterly guidance for next quarter but what\u2019s the long term outlook there, has that changed at all and obviously you\u2019ve talked about some dilution with some recent acquisitions? Maurizio Nicolelli : Hey Joe, it is Maurizio. So we continue to manage our adjusted operating margin to right around 32.5% to 33.5% and that is consistent with the last five quarters. If I was to look out over the next two to three quarters I think we would be very consistent with that range and then going forward we would see something similar to that, potentially maybe some leverage but one, two, three years out. Joseph Foresi : Got it, okay and then the last one from me on the free cash flow side and the tax rates. From a free cash flow front do you expect that to sort of normalize over the next couple of quarters and how should we think about the new tax rate, how long will that last, thanks? Maurizio Nicolelli : Yes, so free cash flow was down 18 million this quarter. It was really driven by the change in the realignment to our FactSet UK. Now clients are being billed and invoiced and contracted through the UK and that created some delays in client payments. We really see that as very temporary and normalizing in the next three months going forward. On the tax rate, the tax rate now has the new normal for our tax rate now is our range of 25.5% to 26.5% and we don\u2019t see that materially changing during the rest of the fiscal year. Joseph Foresi : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Your line is now open. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, good morning. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Just I want to ask you a couple of housekeeping items and then just get a little bit more into the acquisitions. Around the fee -- the revenue guidance what is the organic growth implied in the revenue guidance either at the midpoint or the two ends, could you help me with that Maurizio? Maurizio Nicolelli : Okay, the midpoint on our revenue guidance is right around 7% going forward. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, and then are you able to parse out how much in the ASV on the table, the very last table in the press release how much of that was Portware versus the two acquisitions that were completed this quarter. Maurizio Nicolelli : So the two acquisitions added 15 million in ASV during the quarter and that is acquired revenue. Portware is now embedded within our overall ASV number and we don\u2019t break that out. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, got it. And then just a little more detail on the acquisitions, it seems like the Vermilion business fits into your publishing business, something that you highlighted a number of years ago at an Analyst Day, just strength in pushing publishing. Is there -- are there holes that were in your existing business, can you talk about how they parsed that out? And then again on CYMBA, you highlighted a little bit of the order management system, can you just give a description of what exactly the business does, when I go to the website it just seems like there's a whole host of things that they do for what seems to be -- the business doesn't have that many employees? Philip Snow : Sure, hey Shlomo, this is Phil Snow. So let me look at Vermilion first for you. The Vermilion is really a very elegant, best in class enterprise client reporting solution. The portfolio of publishing solution that FactSet has today really takes the portfolio and audit reports. We create custom reports for our clients that way. This is a broader solution that allows our clients to input other types of data and it is much more flexible in terms of the types of reports that it can create. So it is a very nice compliment to what we have today. I would think of it a little bit like the code red versus the FactSet IRM solution. We are putting those two together, it just means we can stock more -- more solutions for our clients particularly in the client service workflow part of the entire investment lifecycle which we are seeing increased traction on. In terms of CYMBA we are really excited about that. It really provides a missing piece that we had with the combination of FactSet and Portware together. So it has order management capabilities. The other thing that it has is very good pre and post trade compliance rules that were in engine essentially. So, we think that the combination of over at CYMBA and the FactSet workstation really fill out the entire investment lifecycle for us. So you are right in that, it is a small group of employees but it fills a critical missing piece for us that we could have built but this was just a way to fast forward that and we are really excited about the long-term opportunity. And they have an excellent solution. I think they suffered a little bit from what any small company does in some spaces that if you go in and you try this out what could be a better product to a client but you are a small company. You are a very large investment manager. They are going to wonder are you going to be around in the long-term so now that CYMBA is part of FactSet, a well established player then we can cros sell it but we are really bullish about what it means for us in terms of the upside there. Shlomo Rosenbaum : On their own were these companies growing at growth rates that were in excess of FactSet\u2019s growth rates? Philip Snow : Definitely. Shlomo Rosenbaum : And then I am going to leave off at this at least for now. The sales environment in general, the markets have moved up a lot after the presidential elections. Are you seeing any of that translate into improved behavior from your clients in terms of purchasing patterns or is it really that\u2019s not really translating into that? Philip Snow : It\u2019s hard to predict honestly and if it will I think we\u2019ll see the affects of that later. It\u2019s not something that given our sales cycle I think we would see immediately. We did see some decisions getting pushed out a little bit further over the last few months and we\u2019re hoping that our close rate will improve. But we can't make any solid predictions on that. Certainly it doesn\u2019t hurt. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Alright, thank you very much. Philip Snow : Alright, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays, your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is actually Greg calling on for Manav. I just wanted to ask about your user count growth in the first quarter which looks pretty good relative to last couple of 1Qs. First off can you confirm that that\u2019s all organic and then maybe some color around the breakdown between base business growth, competitive wins, and then some of the closures you have been seeing? Philip Snow : There is a lot in there Greg, I\u2019ll start with yes, it was all organic users that grew. I\u2019ll go back to the comments on wealth, we saw some really nice closes in Europe and Asia with some private banking deployment. So those were pretty large closures. Can you remind me of the other three questions that you asked? Unidentified Analyst : Yes, I was just asking on the breakdown between base business growth, so additions with the existing customers and then you know how much impact you are seeing from closures from some of the smaller accounts that you\u2019ve talked about? Philip Snow : Sure, so when we look at this Q1 versus last Q1 there was an uptick in firm closures which affected the relative number. We did see when you look at users no longer with firm which typically means they\u2019re moving somewhere else or potentially they are getting laid off, there was a small uptick there. But I\u2019d like to steer you back to what we said many times which is we firmly believe that our largest opportunity really is within the biggest clients that we already have today. So we love to get new names but it is by no far the biggest piece of our business every quarter nor is it the biggest long-term opportunity we have. So we\u2019re really focused on having an enterprise solution for our clients and capturing that entire investment lifecycle of the trade. So when you go into FactSet now with the acquisitions and the innovation that we\u2019ve developed you can go from research to portfolio management to trading to analytics to client reporting that if I was you it is what I would be focused on. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thanks and then I guess I want to ask about the pending fiduciary standards, rules and what you are hearing from your customers there and if there are any solutions that are -- or offerings that you provide to help there, I don\u2019t know if Vermilion sits in there but any color you can provide? Philip Snow : We\u2019re investigating into that. We are focused on regulatory as something that is important for us. We recognize it is a big opportunity, maybe that\u2019s one we can follow up with you later. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, that\u2019s it for me. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley, your line is now open. Toni Kaplan : Hi, good morning. I was wondering if you can provide some additional color on just the dynamics going on the buyer side. I know you just mentioned the -- some closures and some headcount reductions but basically just in terms of you mentioned the largest opportunity being with your existing buy side or biggest clients how is the progress going on cross selling there and just what\u2019s going on with buy side would be helpful? Philip Snow : Sure, okay and just on this -- so I\u2019ll touch on a couple of things, one is just going back to the enterprise conversation with our clients, we are spending more time with our largest clients mapping out their information technology landscape, looking at all of this solution that they have to offer or that they need help with. And we're finding that clients are very interested in talking to us with these new acquisitions that we have done to begin thinking about more holistic solutions for them. I would say it is early days on the cross selling story, but it is something that we're entirely focused on. Toni Kaplan : Great, and also in the past you have spoken about potentially providing some additional disclosure around workstation versus non-workstation or even just what percent fees make up, do you have any further thoughts on what you might provide and when you might consider providing it? Philip Snow : We are still evaluating that Toni and with the recent acquisitions that we have done we are just taking the time that we need to make sure that if we are going to change how we report that we do it in the best possible way and it is something that we can stick to for the future. Toni Kaplan : Understood and on just gross margins, they have come down a little bit over the last couple of quarters just, is not attributable to the acquisitions or are there other factors that could be driving that expense number? Maurizio Nicolelli : So far -- hi, Toni it is Maurizio. It was hard acquisition. Also a majority of our new hiring goes into cost of services so driving that that percentage is slightly higher. But at the end of the day we have really just managed the company at the operating margin level. Toni Kaplan : Okay, excellent and then one just last quick one, just after the geographic realignment should we expect that your British pound exposure will increase or no because you will still be dealing in U.S. dollars and it will just be more on the expense side, appreciate all the time, thank you? Maurizio Nicolelli : Yes, our invoicing declines has not changed. We still have well in the north of 95% of our clients being billed in U.S. dollars going forward. The realignment did not affect clients that way. Toni Kaplan : Excellent, thanks again guys. Maurizio Nicolelli : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Chu with Bank of America, your line is now open. David Chu : Thanks. Phil you mentioned strength in analytics but maybe you can describe non-terminal revenue growth across the four major products and I think last quarter you mentioned double-digit growth across your core products and just wanted to see if that was consistent this quarter? Philip Snow : We haven\u2019t broken it out with that level of granularity this quarter. When you look at Q1, I did mention that analytics had a very good quarter. And again it is traditionally not our biggest quarter so I wouldn\u2019t -- we don\u2019t really look at Q1 as -- from a data standpoint or something like that. It gives us that much clarity on those growth rates. David Chu : Okay, and then in terms of the sell side slow down, is this coming from a concentrated number of days or are you seeing it across the board? Philip Snow : That is a good question. I think we're seeing generally pressure across the sell side in both the bigger firms and the middle market firms. David Chu : Got it, okay, thanks and just lastly, so if the new fiduciary rules around wealth management are implemented, just your thoughts on maybe the potential impact? Philip Snow : Yes, that's one that we will get back to you on again. We had that question earlier on the call. David Chu : Okay, sorry about that. Philip Snow : No problems, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Peter Appert : Thanks, so Phil earlier you highlighted favorable peer gains and you talked about CapIQ maybe some customer dissatisfaction, can you just expand little bit more on what you are seeing in terms of the competitive market place, it seems like both Bloomberg and Thompson maybe have stalled a little bit here, do you see some momentum from a share perspective? Philip Snow : So, I do, hey Peter thank you for the question. So, we are confident that we're outperforming on a relative basis in most segments of the market. So, I think you are right in sort of highlighting that the other firms are struggling. We are looking at different segments and we are very focused on who is our competitor in a particular segment.  We view such a massive opportunity for us in the marketplace. We are just over a billion dollars and we know that the addressable market share for us is at least ten times that today. So we are just focused on what we can do the best with specific workflows against all of these discreet competitors. But I think you're correct in saying that if you look at all of their performance instead of what we\u2019re hearing that it is a challenging environment and we feel that we're the best positioned to execute on it now and for the future. Peter Appert : Great, thank you. So with 6% terminal growth a little bit of pricing it might imply that the desktop business is growing pretty much in line from these overall revenue performance which will then suggest that the analytics enterprise business is probably growing similar way, is that a fair assessment. Philip Snow : We have so many different types of user workflows we might have 20 different types of clients that use FactSet and you know we don't price our product the same way that some of our competitors do. So it\u2019s very difficult I think for you to look in and sort of draw a meaningful conclusions on that. In some cases if we have a very large wealth deployment the average price for that wealth deployment might be significantly lower than if you added a portfolio manager for example even a medium size institutional asset manager. Peter Appert : Okay and then lastly for Maurizio the headcount has grown consistently a little bit faster than ASV growth for FactSet in recent years, that is a phenomenon we should expect to continue are there margin implications around that? Maurizio Nicolelli : Right, so if you look at headcount growth ex doing the acquisitions and the Market Metrics being sold, our growth is around 10.5% but our growth in headcount has been higher in India and the Philippines where our cost of an employee is much less. So even though you see our employee growth being higher than revenue growth, from a dollar perspective its right inline slightly behind revenue growth. Peter Appert : Got it. Thank you guys. Philip Snow : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Warren Gardiner from Evercore, your line is now open. Warren Gardiner : Great, thank you. So on portfolio analytics I think you guys touched on a little bit but it sounds like strong growth again. Can you just give us any color on the winds there, it sounds like there may be more switches from other providers and kind of new users who didn\u2019t have the capability previously, can you just kind of confirm or talk about that a little bit? Philip Snow : Sure, hi it is Phil Snow. So, when we talk about our multi asset class risk product we\u2019re talking about an enterprise solution there for our clients in the risk area. So we\u2019re in competition sometimes with MSCI in that space with BlackRock with a whole bunch of different niche competitors as we filled out the fixed income and more asset classes in there its opened our abilities to do more than just equity risk for our clients. And it\u2019s something that a lot of our clients are focused on in this environment.  So we continue to invest there, we got a lot more that we\u2019re going to be doing that\u2019s coming out throughout the year as I mentioned in my comments earlier. It\u2019s an area of our business that we know is exceptionally important for our clients and one of the trends that we\u2019re noticing in a marketplace, when I talk to heads of performance at a lot of the big buy side shops they want to see consistency in the data that they\u2019re using for risk and performance and for portfolio analytics not just in the middle office but all the way through to the front office. And that\u2019s something that we believe at FactSet we\u2019re incredibly well poised to execute on and the opportunity for us that\u2019s in the front office we believe is huge. And by focusing on this area which is our core competency we can then build that out overtime. Warren Gardiner : Okay thanks and what about just sort of the wins you are getting, are you finding that they are switching from other providers or like sort of people...? Philip Snow : Yeah in many cases they\u2019ll be switching from other providers. So I mean there are some out there that haven\u2019t been invested in and are not getting better and that\u2019s just something that we are pouring it\u2019s on a gas. And we\u2019ve got some great partners in that space as well that get more leverage by including their functionality on our system. So we\u2019re not just building everything we\u2019re sort of creating this ecosystem that makes it easy for other analytics providers to integrate into FactSet and it is what we did originally, right. We were earlier the Switzerland of market data and fundamental estimate data and now we are sort of getting into this environment where we can be that for a client when it comes to risk and analytics. Warren Gardiner : Great, thank you and then I guess I just apologize if I missed it, I mean could you just talk a little bit about how the fees business did during the quarter? Philip Snow : The fees business did ok. Part of our fees business is leveraged to our strategic partnerships and alliances group so that's when we monetize data outside of FactSet. I am on side of investment management and banking. And there was a lumpy loss this quarter that is a lumpy business. We have big wins and we have big gains of big losses sometimes. And the fact that Q1 is traditionally a smaller quarter for us there was one of those in there this quarter which dampened the fees growth. But I would say the fees growth within the core institutional Asset Management and banking business was very healthy. Warren Gardiner : Great, thanks a lot Philip Snow : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Heckmann, Avondale. Your line is now open. Peter Heckmann : Good morning everyone, I think most of my questions have been answered but just had a few follow-ups. Noting that web-based version of the workstation, where are you targeting that, is that for smaller firms or the retail market and will that have a lower price point and reduced functionality than the full workstation? Philip Snow : Yes, that is a great question. So, not necessarily. If we are solving the exact same workflow for the same type of clients it is the same value. We would price it the same way but there have been some users over the years that have essentially said just for ease of use purposes and even for costs they require a web based version. A good example of that is senior bankers so, in banking we have always been very well penetrated in investment banking and research and we have been told if we developed a web based product that that would be the best way essentially to get on to the desk of senior bankers.  There are a lot of hedge funds out there that much prefer a web based product. Private equity firms, there's a lot of opportunity and if you really want a more elegant mobile environment web is the way to go. And even for our caller user base, the speed of the product is faster, navigating it is easier. We believe there's going to be a lot of good effects as we continue to build out more functionality in the web based version. And all of this is possible because we made a massive investment in our technology stack over the last five years going from mainframes to this more distributed Linux architecture. It's one of the really positive things that has come about as part of the effort. Peter Heckmann : That's helpful. Thanks and then you noted a little bit higher trading volume, equity trading volume impacted in the period post-election, was that enough to add a million or two of revenue or not so much? Philip Snow : Yeah, it was -- it definitely helped when you look at both where and how we transfer that product it's a combination of license fees, professional fees, and trading volumes so it is the minimum. But the fact that the trading volumes were up over the last couple of months definitely helped. Peter Heckmann : Okay and then just one housekeeping question, Maurizio what was the exact acquired revenue in the quarter, apologize if the question is already answered? Maurizio Nicolelli : Yeah, the total was 15 million. Peter Heckmann : That was the ASV, what was the actual revenue in the quarter itself? Maurizio Nicolelli : Revenue included in the 288 million was less than 1 million. So it had a minimal effect. Peter Heckmann : Alright, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair and Company. Your line is now open. Tim McHugh : Yes, thanks. Just maybe a couple of financial type questions, one I guess given ASV growth of 8% in the quarter why is 7% organic revenue growth, usually there's a little tighter connection with 7% being your guidance for Q2, sorry? Maurizio Nicolelli : So we -- so our ASV and revenue projection is that midpoint is right around 7% and that's what we're projecting today. There's a range there which is higher and lower but essentially what we are projecting today is right around that 7% organic growth number. Tim McHugh : Right, okay. And I guess and then tax wise I get that it has obviously come down and given some of the changes you made to the extent you have had a the time I guess or a capability to look at destination based tax systems and some of the proposals that are being discussed in Washington, how would those impact you to the extent you thought through those things and how you have kind of structured the business going forward here? Philip Snow : So we have broken out the business between U.S. and international. Our UK entity is responsible for our international business now going forward both operationally and financially. We still tax almost 70% of our income here in the U.S. so if a tax legislation comes out and it lowers the tax rates here in the U.S. that will be just an incremental benefit to FactSet. But overall we made this change in order to better serve our client base internationally and we don\u2019t see going backwards on that strategy in the future. Tim McHugh : Okay, alright, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie Capital, your line is now open. Hamzah Mazari : Good morning, thank you. Phil you had mentioned earlier in the call CapIQ and SNL bundling their product and clients asking you for help. Just any color around what your response is, is it a price driven response, is it a value driven response, any color as to how you are tackling that dynamic? Philip Snow : Sure, it\u2019s a great question. So I mean SNL has a very sticky product. I think you are probably aware of that and we get asked repeatedly if we will build something like that. It will probably be a heavy lift for us and if we would have figured out where it is we wanted to focus our resources that might not be the highest priority or the biggest opportunity. But if we can figure out a way to do that we certainly would consider it. I think they consider FactSet to be a better long-term partner and have a better product. They are not going to be happy about sort of being forced into something so, we will get asked on occasions for pricing reduction. We\u2019re just seeing generally in banking not just with that but there is a very heavy focus on cost. We just go back to trying to be a good partner for our clients, making good decisions for the long-term, and responding to them the best way that we can. Hamzah Mazari : Great, and just a follow up on your ETF product could you just give us a sense of how investor should think about the net impact of higher inflows into passive investing, obviously you have an ETF product but I am not sure what the critical mass of that product is and then so that\u2019s why I am just asking around the net impact to your business of higher movement into passive investing? Thank you. Philip Snow : Sure, I mean that\u2019s a great question. So the ETF product itself has very detailed analytics around particularly EPS. Their holdings is best in class. It is a nice compliment to what FactSet has today. This shift from active to passive certainly doesn\u2019t help underperforming active managers as the fees are much lower on the passive side. But what FactSet has is we are a workflow solution, so whether you are active or passive we have analytics and portfolio analytics and reporting capabilities to help you. So we have the same solutions that we can sell to active managers that we can sell to passive managers and in a lot of cases some of our biggest clients will have strategies around both although have a hybrid kind of a smart data type approach. So, we\u2019re not just focused specifically on ETF, we\u2019re focused on the entire workflow and where we can help that. Hamzah Mazari : Great, thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Bill Warmington : Good morning everyone. The question I been getting this morning is one around the organic ASV growth and basically the question is where is it bottomed and what does it take to get it to reaccelerate. And you mentioned a couple of things already in terms of cost pressure, firm closures. When do recycle through that and start to see the reacceleration? Philip Snow : If we knew we\u2019d love to tell you but we don\u2019t. We are focused on the opportunity right in front of us. So we have a great suite of products. Like I said we have great partnerships with our biggest clients and we feel that just versus our competitors we have a huge advantage. We have an excellent product, we have a great service team. We have a partnership with them, they trust us and we are just focused on executing the best we can every quarter and we\u2019re really optimistic about our long-term opportunity. Bill Warmington : So, a question on cost pressures that you have mentioned a couple of times, they seem like they have been part of the picture now since the financial crisis and my question is what\u2019s changed, what's been driving the increased client focus and you highlighted the sell side a couple of times I want to know if you are also seeing that on the buy side? Philip Snow : Sure its related to the last question on the buy side, the active managers are feeling pressure from the lower fees that passive managers are charging. So if you are an underperforming active manager you\u2019ve got to think about ways to sort of reduce cost. So we do see in overtime you know we\u2019ll see some consolidation I believe on the buy side. And our focus on enterprise solutions and not being so highly leveraged to the workstation overtime is the best strategy that we think we have as a company. And we\u2019re -- part of this is we\u2019re a real technology company. We have technology solutions, we have solutions that help our clients be more efficient, and with focus on giving them the full breadth offerings that we have. Even if the number of workstations goes down in the entire industry I\u2019m just going to remind everyone FactSet has a small percentage of what\u2019s out there so our biggest competitors and we estimate have at least 300,000 terminals each forget about all the other niche players. So we\u2019re focused on a multi prong strategy, getting more users particularly in the front office and then building out enterprise solutions to service the entire client. Bill Warmington : Then our last question on the wealth management side you guys have a nice product that\u2019s been taking share the high and the ultra high network side of the market and my question is can you take that product down market at some point and because obviously there are a lot more players in the lower end of the market? Philip Snow : So, it would be nice to be able to offer both for clients that service both. I\u2019ll point to the technology investment that we\u2019ve made with FactSet Web. Previously it would have been difficult for us to do that but with our next gen technology environment we will be able to scale more easily, do things faster. It\u2019s going to allow us to go after that segment if we wanted to and have it be a profitable thing for FactSet to do. Bill Warmington : Well, thank you very much. Philip Snow : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Housum from Northcoast Research your line is now open. Keith Housum : Great, thanks, I appreciate the opportunity to ask questions. Look at the web version that you guys mentioned earlier, the desktop just a few moments ago. You have been offering for your customers to have one or the other or they be able to have both at no cost or both of their additional cost? Philip Snow : They could definitely have one or the other, that we\u2019re still evaluating the best go to market strategy it\u2019s just been released. What\u2019s in there today is real time news and quotes, research, some great company analytics, some industry reports. We\u2019re still putting in there some of our other applications like universal screening, the new version of PA we have which is PA3 that\u2019s getting rolled out as we speak so as we fill out the suite we\u2019ll have a better hand to feel on that in the coming quarters. Keith Housum : Got you and then just a historical question for you. You know since the past 8 quarters your new user growth has been actually you know pretty good and obviously one of your strategies is to get deeper into your customers and especially be able to charge more for those, how long does it generally take from time when you acquire user to perhaps when you able to the next iteration or kick into the next battle of used to create more revenue to the bottom-line for you guys. Philip Snow : That really depends on the client. What we have found overtime is when we close a client that we\u2019re able to build a relationship and layer on analytics and fees and so on. It is pretty rare that someone comes in and gets everything all at once but there are some re-variables there in terms of the types of clients and so it\u2019s hard to give you a really easy answer. Keith Housum : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andre Benjamin of Goldman Sachs, your line is now open. Andre Benjamin : Thank you and good morning. Can you hear me, I am on a cell phone here. Philip Snow : Yes we can hear you fine Andre. Andre Benjamin : Great, thanks. So my first question, any expectations on the web product, are there any expectations for the impact to growth or margins from the release of this, I am thinking on either the cost to the investment side and then is there any benefit to pushing existing clients on to the web based product or is this simply you making sure that you have solutions for the full spectrum of customer? Philip Snow : Yes I wouldn\u2019t expect a massive impact right away and it may will be that there are some clients that are excited about going on to the web based product. Its early days, it\u2019s just been released. We have closed an exciting client with that, it\u2019s something that I use every day. I really like using it so I am really optimistic about what it means for us in the long-term. Andre Benjamin : Got it and last quarter you mentioned an unusual number of cancellations just due to consolidations and some other industry issues, just wondering was there any notable trend or how has that continued this quarter or has it gone more back to normal? Philip Snow : So we did say as I mentioned earlier we did see a little bit of an uptick on the firm closures versus the same quarter last year. But I want to take it back again to where the biggest opportunity and most of our revenue is in most of our growth opportunity. It\u2019s not with sort of the smaller names that we\u2019re closing, small wealth managers, small hedge funds, it\u2019s really the bigger clients we are focused. Andre Benjamin : Okay, thank you. Philip Snow : Thanks Andre. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer, your line is now open. Glenn Greene : Thank you, two questions the first one, going back to the user growth which now look pretty strong in the quarter. You eluded to wealth management, so I was just wondering what proportion directionally wealth management was of the user growth and I think you also sort of eluded to lower pricing point on the wealth management so maybe that helps us reconcile somewhat the ASV acceleration. Can you help sort of help me think through that, what proportion of the growth from wealth management and the relative pricing? Philip Snow : We don\u2019t break it out but it certainly was the biggest contributor to the total and we have a number of different packages for the wealth market and they are typically given the size of the deployments and the use case a lower price point and what we would charge in institutional asset manager or hedge fund. So you\u2019re right it\u2019s a lower price workstation than the traditional FactSet workstation. Glenn Greene : Any range of sort of the differential enterprising, anywhere to think about that? Philip Snow : The offering can range from sort of the low thousands all the way up to 10,000 in some cases for wealth in our fully loaded investment management workstation with portfolio and analytics could be multiples of that in some cases. Glenn Greene : Okay and then a different question but, the topic of corporate tax reform with the new administration obviously a big topic for the market right now but with your realignment that you just announced and the benefit of the lower tax rate you\u2019re getting but really my question I guess at this point is what proportion of your profitability now is in the U.S. and would potentially benefit from lower corporate tax rate because of the new Trump administration? Maurizio Nicolelli : So right, this is Maurizio, so right now ASV internationally is 34.6% of the overall total. Our income that\u2019s been taxed overseas is right around 30% to 31% now based on this realignment. Prior to that we were below 20%. So what we\u2019ve done here is really realign our structure operationally and also our financial structure to better match our international operations. So which means that almost 70% of our income is no tax at the U.S. tax rate currently. Philip Snow : If the tax rate changes it goes down there is a benefit to FactSet going forward. Glenn Greene : Got it, that\u2019s all I needed. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel, your line is now open. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, thanks for indulging me in a follow up. Phil, I want to just ask you about CYMBA and the order management system, my kind of checks with clients are that one of the issues FactSet has had on the trading floor was getting over the lack of an order management system. How credible is the system that you bought and how much of a difference do you think it makes in terms of being able to sell on to the trading floor? Philip Snow : It's a great product, very focused on the UK market. You highlighted that it's a small company but we were really impressed with the management team, the technology they have built. It's a long-term way but again it was a question of are we going to build it or should we buy something that we believe was a really good product. So I think the longer term opportunity for us when you think about the synergies is with portfolio, management, trading, the front office. FactSet has been in the front office for some time with portfolio managers at U.P.A. but if we can also compliment that with a portfolio management system or the management system and execution management system in the front office. We believe that that represents a really large opportunity for us just in terms of market share and help tie the enterprise story together really nicely. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay thanks. Philip Snow : And we're happy to offer you a demonstration of the product whenever you like. Shlomo Rosenbaum : I'll take you up on that. Philip Snow : Alright great. Philip Snow : Okay, thank you all very much and we'll see you again next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similarly entitled measures report by other companies. Joining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer and Maurizio Nicolelli, Chief Financial Officer. I would now like to turn the discussion over to Phil. Phil Snow : Thanks Rima, good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on our call today. You just heard from Rima Hyder who is our new head of Investor Relations and Rima is going to serve as the primary liaison with FactSet shareholders and the investment community and we are really happy that Hyder joined the FactSet team. I know you are all going to really enjoy working with her. At FactSet we partner with our client to solve their greatest challenges. And over the last year we have added significant building blocks through both innovation and acquisition to serve even more critical work flows for the investment community. The market is continually looking for ways to better manage risk and be more efficient and FactSet is perfectly suited to help. In parallel to enhancing our core work stations we have rapidly evolved our products suite to provide new solutions for our clients and to do it in new ways. We are really excited that across the enterprise our clients are now able to move on FactSet through the investment life cycle from research to portfolio management to trading to analytics and to client reporting. Let me now give you a quick overview of our quarterly results. Our organic revenues grew 7% year-over-year, ASV during the second quarter grew organically at 6.5%. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 14% to a $1.81 higher than the mid-point of where we guided to last quarter. Our adjusted operating margin at 33% was at the mid-point of our guidance range. While we did see positive results, the organic ASV and revenue growth was below what we saw last year. Our results were impacted by the cost pressure across the financial industry driven in part by the shift from active to passive investments. This quarter we saw an increase in sales offset by a higher number of cancellations from the same quarter a year ago. We had a broad portfolio of wins across markets segment and geographies and including our price increase in the Americas, our organic ASV grew $16 million over the last three months. We saw great traction from million acquisition and exciting new wins in the wealth management business. It is difficult to predict if headwinds will lessen overtime, but what we do now is that FactSet has a resilient business model of one that has previously executed well in a tough market. As you can see in our slide presentation, our business can be cyclical and organic ASV growth rates have fluctuated over the years, but that\u2019s been a constant theme of growth. This growth combined with our commitment to return value to shareholders has greatly benefited our investors over the years. We continue to see a strong growth in the Asia-Pac and EMEA regions which is now represent the higher 35% of our overall ASV. The international markets have been a growth driver and for us at times a good hedge to the market conditions in the U.S. Our recent acquisitions provide us with a greater footprint in Europe and opens up more market share for us in the Asia-Pac region. We have definitely not satisfied with our current growth levels, you've heard me said before that there is a growing opportunity with our existing clients as we broaden our suite of offerings across different work flows and asset classes. Our recent acquisitions play a key role in unlocking more that opportunity. Last quarter, I spoke about seeing a healthy deployment across our wealth business, and how it's an area of growth that affects us. In January, we announced our intent to acquire interactive data managed solutions or IDMS. IDMS is a leading managed solutions and portal provider for the wealth management industry. This acquisition when completed will add significant scale and scope to our wealth business in the Americas and EMEA and with access to current footprint in Asia-Pac, it also gives us an exciting opportunity to expand our wealth business in that region. Just last week, we acquired BISAM Technologies, a leading provider of portfolio performance in attribution, multi-asset risk, GIPS composites management and reporting. B-One, BISAM\u2019s award-winning platform is an outstanding compliment of both FactSet's portfolio analytics suite and client reporting solutions. The acquisition of BISAM is aligned with our strategy to better serve the critical workflows in the entire portfolio lifecycle. At FactSet, we are at the perfect intersections of technology and finance which fuels on our thinking on product innovation. The world's more open than it's ever been and both volume and access to information are now at unprecedented levels. We see clients willing to outsource and move more workflows to cloud base solution. With a significant investment and upgrades to our technology stack combined with our content and analytics, we are now able to offer new ways for clients to leverage the power of FactSet. In summary, FactSet has a resilient business model and best-in-class products with very strong client service. This powerful combination sets us apart from our competitors. We know how to innovate and engineer the most efficient tools for the financial industry and at the same time we continue to maintain financial discipline through cost controls, a lower effective tax rate and an accretive share repurchase program allowing us to return value for our shareholders. Over the last six years to-date the average cash returned to our shareholders is 94% of free cash flow. Looking ahead to the second half of 2017 we're focused on the integration of our recent acquisitions and are excited about the opportunity to cross-sell a broad suite of solutions into our blue chip client base. Let me now turn the call over to Maurizio to talk about the second quarter financial results and third quarter outlook. Maurizio? Maurizio Nicolelli : Thank you, Phil, and good morning to everyone on the call. In the second quarter we continued to grow ASV and EPS and delivered solid results within our guidance range. As Phil stated we are investing in our future growth with the goal of offering our clients complete enterprise solutions for their investment portfolio lifecycle. Let's now go through the second quarter results, GAAP revenues in the second quarter increased 4.5% to 294 million and 7% to 282 million on organic basis versus the second quarter of 2016. GAAP revenues from the second quarter of 2016 included the Market Metrics business which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2016. Organic ASV increased 6.5% year-over-year and 16 million from our first quarter of fiscal '17. This increase was primarily driven by price increases of 9.5 million and new sales opportunities offset by cancellations. U.S. revenues grew a 192 million, organic revenues in the U.S. were up 6% compared to the year ago second quarter. International revenues increased to a 103 million, on an organic basis the international growth rate was 9%. International business continues to perform well and as Phil already stated it continues to be a growing part of our overall ASV. Moving down the income statement, let's take a look at our operating expenses. Operating expenses for the second quarter totaled 203 million, an increase of 3% year-over-year. Second quarter cost of services expressed as a percentage of revenues increased slightly by 70 basis points compared to the year ago period. The increase was driven by higher compensation due to base salary changes after the annual review cycle, incremental hires in our centers of excellence in India and the Philippines, and acquisitions from CYMBA and Vermilion offset by lower data costs related to the sale of Market Metrics. SG&A expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues were down a 160 basis points compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the decrease was primarily as a result of lower employee compensation due to the sale of the Market Metrics business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and higher rent expense from new office locations. Our adjusted operating margin excluding 1 million in acquisition cost for professional fees from the recently announced BISAM and IDMS transactions, and 4 million of intangible asset amortization was flat at 33% this quarter versus the second quarter of 2016. Adjustment operating income grew 4.5% to 97 million excluding 4 million of intangible asset amortization and the 1.4 million of non-recurring acquisition costs. Adjusted net income which excludes non-recurring acquisition related costs, intangible asset amortization and the working capital adjustment to the Market Metrics disposition increased 9% to 72 million while adjusted diluted EPS grew 14% to $1.81. Free cash flow for our second quarter was $71 million, a decrease of approximately $10 million from the same period last year. We define free cash flow as cash generated from operations less capital spending. The $10 million decrease was the result of higher client receivables. Our DSOs were 40 days at the end of the second quarter compared to 34 days in the prior year period. The increase in days is driven by our recent acquisitions the timing of client payments and lower number of business days in February 2017. It's important to note that two-thirds of the accounts receivable balance increase was from billings outstanding 60 days or less. You may have noticed in the press release we issued this morning that we changed our definition for client and user account. Our client count definition now captures clients with ASV greater than $10,000 versus the previous threshold of 24,000. This lower threshold allows us to capture smaller clients such as family offices and smaller hedge funds as well as more data feed clients. As our business evolve and we look to align our metrics internally and externally and enhance our disclosures we felt we needed to update how we account for clients. Our net client count increased by 143 clients this quarter to over 4,400. Our net user count increased approximately 1,500 users to over 85,000. The new user count definition accounts for users from workstations previously not captured due to certain product bundling and also users of the street account web product. The increase was driven by workstation deployments across wealth management as well as displacement of key competitors' at large institutional clients. We have provided you with schedules of historical client and user counts under the old and new definition on the back of our press release. We re-purchased approximately 480,000 shares for $181 million during the second quarter under our existing share re-purchase program. As Phil stated, we have continued to return value to our shareholders. Over the last 12 months we have returned over $485 million to stockholders in the form of share re-purchases and dividends. Recently our Board of Directors approved a $300 million expansion to the existing share re-purchase program, including this expansion approximately $337 million is currently available for future share re-purchases. In our third quarter we entered into a new credit agreement and borrowed 575 million at favorable rates to pay for the BISAM acquisition and our existing -- and repay our existing debt of 365 million. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders and maintain a balanced capital allocation framework. Now let's turn to guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. For the fiscal third quarter we expect our GAAP revenues to be in the range of 301 million and 307 million. BISAM is expected to add approximately $6 million to third quarter revenues. The midpoint of our organic revenue guidance is 6%. The proposed IDMS acquisition is not included in these numbers as it is expected to close later in our fiscal third quarter. We plan to update our third quarter guidance once IDMS is closed. Our GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 30% and 31% which includes a 90 basis points reduction from BISAM. Adjusted operating margin is expected to be in the range of 32% and 33% which includes a 30 basis points reduction from BISAM. The annual effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 25% and 26%. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.68 and $1.74, and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.80 and $1.86. The midpoint of the adjusted diluted EPS range represents 12% growth over the prior year. In summary, we're pleased to see our solid performance in the current marketing conditions. Our continuing growth this quarter highlights the strength of our business model and we remain confident in our ability of return value to our shareholders. Thank you for your participation in today's call. We are now ready for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instruction] Your first question is from Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Bill Warmington : So, you mentioned in your comments the impact that you are seeing from the shift from active to passive, and I mean it's well known in industry this is something that\u2019s been going on for a number of years. And so my question is, are seeing something in terms of a tipping point in terms of cost or headcount or something else that is starting to impact the industry and I am asking also in terms of how we should model out the rest of 2017 in terms of ASV growth? Phil Snow : That\u2019s a great question Bill, thank you. So it is an ongoing trend, I would say that what we are observing is that trend is more pronounced in the Americas than we are seeing in the EMEA and Asia-Pac region and you see that reflected in our growth rates. So we anticipate that it will continue to had in this directions for little while, what I would say is that we have a broader suite of solutions that we had historically to help mitigates some of that. First of all, we have a multi-asset class system now, so we have lot of client using us for fixed income capabilities, and a lot of our products we've throughout analytics and research and our mass [ph] is very well stood it to passive investors as well as active investors. So it's a trend that we're aware of. It's definitely putting cost pressure particularly on the Americas investment management inside of the business. But it's one that with our recent acquisition and innovation we feel like we are in a good position to address. Bill Warmington : And for my follow up question, on the BISAM acquisition, how does that fit in to FactSet strategically? Because FactSet has historically been a distributor of third quarter party models, [indiscernible] Northfield, Axioma and it would seem that BISAM would in some ways compete with this firms, so that\u2019s the question. Phil Snow : Yes, so actually it doesn\u2019t really compete with them. BISAM is really a performance system, so it gives a client lock down returns for the official performance that they're reporting to their clients and the market. BISAM did a very small acquisition of a firm called Cognity. So it does have some risk capabilities in it, but it's primarily a performance system. It's something that FactSet has looked to build for a long time. We were making some progress but when the opportunity to go out and get the market leader -- to add it to the power of our portfolio analysis product, we were very excited by that and I can tell you that the reaction from our clients has been exceptionally positive. I'm out here in San Francisco this week with the team and a lot of the sales people out here have been telling me that their clients have actually been sending them congratulations emails and can't wait to have a meeting. Operator : The next question is from Anjaneya Singh from Credit Suisse. Anjaneya Singh : First off, I was wondering if you can speak to the portfolio, ones you referenced earlier Phil. Any sense of the geography, client profile, buy-side versus sell-side versus what we've been seeing recently from you guys, and as you look to improve your growth profile what is it that we need to see for that to happen is it the market environment needing to improve or stabilize a little bit or is it something your acquisitions and solutions needing to gain greater scale? Phil Snow : I'll go over a few things here, so on a regional basis we've reported, we did very well in Asia-Pac, that continues to be a strong region for us, we're very focused on it. EMEA came in strong and we were little bit weaker in the Americas. In terms of client types, we did exceptionally well again this quarter with well end-client sponsors [ph]. From our product suite standpoint the analytics suite had a very good quarter, and what I do want to highlight, I mentioned it in my earlier comments is we actually sold more products this Q2 then we did last Q2. The pressure that we saw was in the existing clients, the cost pressures that they're facing. So we're seeing consolidation of funds and on the desktop, it's becoming sort of a market share gain where somebody that had a couple of services historically is now being forced to choose between one or the other and we did see more users leaving the firm. So we have a strong pipeline, our sales team that's out there executing very well, but we are facing this headwind of cancellations within clients. I would say and I've said this before that, part of our largest opportunity really is in our blue chip client base. So when you look at FactSet's Top 100 clients, that's a large percentage of our ASV. These are long standing clients, they're not going anywhere and with the recent acquisitions that we have, we have a real opportunity to cross-sell what we bought and as we integrate it, unlock even more opportunity for those clients moving forward. So that's one of the things that we're very focused on and we don't necessarily need to see the markets turned around for us to grow faster. We're -- our thesis is that we can do that by executing well on the strategy that we've laid out to the firm. Anjaneya Singh : And one for Maurizio, that's similar, Maurizio if you had to parse out it down year-over-year margins implied in your guidance adjusting for a BISAM, what would you say are the biggest drivers here perhaps how much is due to your product suite changes versus ASV deceleration and what do we need to see for the margin performance to sort of stabilize year-over-year and perhaps improve? Maurizio Nicolelli : So, when we look at the margins of FactSet, pre the most recent acquisitions, it is very comparable to our margins historically. And so what we need to see is, we need to continue to grow these ASV from these acquisitions and embed these into our product suite so that we can push up the margin overall from the cost that -- or from the base that we acquired from each one of these acquisitions. We have done that with [indiscernible] and quarter-by-quarter the margin of that business has gotten more and more towards the FactSet overall margin. But we need to continue doing that as we purchased a number of companies over the last six months. And so in doing that that gets our margin back to historical levels and then as we grow ASV in the coming years that\u2019s when we will see more leverage in our margin. Operator : The next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Phil, can you talk a little bit more about what BISAM does that you guys were not already doing, it seems that you had a pretty decent or very robust platform in light of the portfolio attribution stuff. And can you also comment on like how fast the companies where growing, a little bit more just specificity from Maurizio on the margin profiles of the businesses. Phil Snow : So yes, the main difference with the performance system is that the returns are locked down historically and then you get a degree of accuracy out of multiple basis points for official client reporting. PA does that in some cases but the real power of PA for our clients really with the flexibility in the system, the ability to do Ad Hoc analysis within the middle office. And some client reporting, this really does takes it to another level. So BISAM is a firm that we would run into all the time within our largest clients, in fact most of the BISAM clients are already FactSet clients, and connecting the two systems together and adding the risk capabilities that we have and the publishing solutions that really just creates a powerhouse suite for us, for our clients in the performance area. And it was a missing piece, it's one that we've know about four or five years and just not had the ability internally to build to the quality of something that BISAM has been doing from much longer. Shlomo Rosenbaum : And how fast were they growing? Maurizio Nicolelli : So the growth rate BISAM is higher than the rest of FactSet, it's in double digit growth rates historically and that\u2019s the trend going forward for BISAM. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Can I sneak one in, Maurizio, can you give the organic growth rate at both ends of the guidance range? Is it five to seven getting you to six or is there little bit more specificity? Maurizio Nicolelli : No, that\u2019s essentially the range is right at between 5% and 7%. And that\u2019s why I gave the middle of that range of 6%. That\u2019s right in the middle of that range. Operator : The next question is from Peter Appert from Piper Jaffray. Peter Appert : So Phil, you have done a hand full of larger transactions here in last couple of year in M&A market. So I am wondering if maybe your attitude towards M&A has changed, has it become more important to the growth story and what's missing in the portfolio now that you would like to have? Phil Snow : Great question. No, it's not importance of the growth story, we have been very intentional about going out and finding some pieces for the investment management workflow that we decided it would be easiest to acquire and integrate than build ourselves. So [indiscernible], CYMBA, Vermilion and BISAM them all represents what we considered to be good workflows for us to integrate with the already fantastic FactSet products. So we are not out in the market looking for tons of acquisitions to grow, that\u2019s not it, and with its latest acquisition of BISAM now we feel very well positions so that investment lifecycle, what we talked about on the call earlier. So that\u2019s -- our focus now is going to be shifting to the integration and cross-selling of these acquisitions, we are not going -- if the right asset comes up and it is something we are interested in, we'll be opportunistic, but we are not going to go out and continue at this pace. Peter Appert : Got it, thank you. And then Maurizio, maybe I am reading too much into this, but I think in response to earlier question about trends in margin, you suggested that one points at the completion of the integration of the acquired properties is completed, we could expect to see some leverage in margins, does that suggest that your view has changed a little bit, because I think historically you have talked about keeping margins essentially flat on a go forward basis. Would the objective now be to try to move the margins up some overtime? Maurizio Nicolelli : So what I was alluding to was, our margin has been affected by these acquisitions and it has been -- it's trended slightly lower from each of the acquisitions. The goal is to get that margin of these acquisitions back to the historical FactSet margin, and then over the coming years as we continue to grow the business, we would expect some greater leverage within our margin going forward as we scale the business. Peter Appert : So for the company in total, you would look for some improvement in margin overtime. A part from just --. Maurizio Nicolelli : Overtime. Peter Appert : Okay. So not just return -- sorry to be so specific on this, but not just to return to where you were historically but to get back to where you were and then perhaps to grow it from that level? Maurizio Nicolelli : Correct, in the coming years, correct. Peter Appert : Understood, okay. And then just one last thing -- sorry the -- Phil, is it possible to quantify the scale of the opportunity you see in some of the other asset classes that you are getting involved in? Phil Snow : I would just say overall, we view the addressable market for us with the products we have today at 10 times the revenues of FactSet. And as we continue to integrate and build out more capabilities that potential market share could or potential market could increase. So we view, there is tons of stuff in front of us that we can go out and exceed on, not just in terms of suites in the industry, but in terms of off platform solutions and enterprise solutions. Operator : And the next question is from Peter Heckmann from Avondale. Peter Heckmann : My question is on IDMS, it seems one could infer from your commentary so far that the acquisition is relatively small, but it appears based on our research that it could be double the -- more than double the revenue BISAM, can you help us bracket that? I know that deals not closed yet, but certainly we would expect it to close that in the next 30 days. I would like to include in model, so could you bracket some of the potential revenue addition margin and then bracket the purchase price? Maurizio Nicolelli : Peter, it's Maurizio. Unfortunately, we can't give that information just yet because it's not closed. As soon as it closes, when we send out the press release on the closing of the acquisition, we will include our guidance updates and include the information that you are looking for. Peter Heckmann : Okay. I'll try a different one [Multiple Speakers]. You changed the methodology on the metrics for clients and users, could you give us the numbers on the old methodology for one final quarter, so we can kind of compare it to what we are forecasting? Maurizio Nicolelli : Yes, so the metrics on the old methodology on their users and clients are very similar to the increases historically in both of those categories. There is not a significant change in the quarter under the old methodology and again we made this change so that externally -- we're portraying the business very closely to how we're measuring the business internally. Operator : The next question is from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is actually Greg calling on from Manav. Just wondering as you broaden the suite of products that you are offering to the clients; from a commercial perspective does the conversation go more to an enterprise type model versus proceed or how you guys are thinking about that? Phil Snow : Yes, that's a great question Greg, it's something we're looking very closely at and you bring up the good point. I think the way that we want to and in some ways have been charging our clients is really the value that they're receiving from our service. So if that's an enterprise solution, whether it's a suite, that's the way we're beginning to think about it. And as we broadened our suite our products not just with CPS and analytics, but with these acquisitions we're beginning to take a much closer look at that and we're becoming less levered to the workstation number that you've been used to seeing from us. Unidentified Analyst : Fair enough. And then maybe you can give an update on the FactSet web rollout, I think you rolled it out last quarter and traction there, and what you're hearing from clients? Phil Snow : It's early days, we're hearing positive things, the new technology that we have really provides a more intuitive user experience on the web product. We're still converting some of our more advanced applications, we expect our flagship screening product to be in there very shortly with some really nice default reports for clients that we didn't have in the older version. We'll be moving PA into the web version soon. So all the work we've done for PA3, and there is a lot of investor mangers they're getting to use will be over there. So I think once we get the bulk of acquisition in there, we'll begin to see a broader uptake for the web product. Operator : The next question is from Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie. Hamzah Mazari : Maybe if you could just frame for us how much less mature is your European business versus both Asia and the U.S. and any potential regulatory changes in that landscape that could impact you, either positive or negative? Phil Snow : So, I think we do see more upside in those regions just based on some of the trends I already mentioned, as well as they are less mature markets for us. Majority of the acquisitions that we've done recently also have a good footprint in Europe that allows us to cross-sell these existing FactSet suites, and many of the acquisitions don\u2019t have any presence in Asia, they did not have the scale essentially to go out there. So we got offices all over the Asia-Pac region, and that's going to provide us a great opportunity to cross-sell those products with the existing FactSet footprint. On the regulatory side that is definitely an opportunity for us, that we're already capitalizing on that in some ways in Europe. We have a lot of solutions outside of the workstation where we package our content and analytics in a way that solves various regulatory requirements like Solvency II. We're getting a lot of interest around method and what we're doing there. We have solutions within the Portware [ph] application and does allow clients to solve product methods. So we look at regulatory as a growing opportunity for us and we will look facing more focus on. Hamzah Mazari : Great and just a follow up question you referenced acquisitions versus build yourself sort of the credit offering in doing some of these deals. Could you maybe frame for us what does the competitive environment look like on the workflow side? We are very familiar on the desktop side and what's going on there. But are you competing with one or two big guys, is it mostly customers doing this in house themselves? Who do you view as sort of your biggest competitor on the workflow side? And maybe there is just several, but any color around that would be great. Thank you. Phil Snow : I think those are very good questions. I think the way I would like to answer that is one of the themes that we are really hearing from our clients is that they want to see more consistent data across their enterprise. So the data that they are using in the middle office in the portfolio managers and traders will be using in the front office really the great thirst within our userbase to see consistent data. So that\u2019s really what's been driving a lot of our activity here and as we integrate the data and get the content flowing between the systems we are going to be able to satisfy that need for our clients. Operator : The next question is from Warren Gardiner from Evercore. Warren Gardiner : On the method two comments, it sounds like your client base was kind of moving to press a bit more, can you just kind of give some more color on the opportunity that you kind of see arising there either in terms of new your products or market share gains? Phil Snow : It\u2019s a great question. So we are still looking at that, we can solve different pieces of it. It is a large opportunity and knowing that\u2019s where a level the cost pressure is coming from and the client base it\u2019s that they are -- it's not just a shift from active to passive, but it's the need to spend more on regulatory solutions. So it's really the opportunity is packaging a lot of the content we have in small ways for the clients creating analytics. We have got a lot of building blocks but we are still in the process of putting all that together. So it's too early for me to really give you a sense of what the true opportunity is there. Warren Gardiner : And is there anything we should maybe think about in terms of how the buyer side kind of currently pays you right now? Maybe this is more serve on the Portware [ph] side, but is that, we should kind of consider as that regulation comes into force and I guess specifically with respect to maybe unbundling or things like that? Maurizio Nicolelli : No, we don\u2019t see any significant change there to be quite honest. Operator : The next question is from Glenn Greene from Oppenheimer. Glenn Greene : I wanted to go back to the cancellations phenomenon just wanted to get a sense as this sort of the same dynamic you have been talking about for a couple of quarters and is it accelerating? And also you have sort of alluded to the importance of your Top 100 client, could you contrast the cancellation trends you are seeing in the Top 100 clients versus I guess non-Top 100 clients? Phil Snow : Yes, we can't provide you that level of detail, but I would say this comps pressure is ongoing. I wouldn\u2019t say that its necessarily accelerating. I mean it's just a combination of point merging, layoffs, uses no longer with firms and some of the areas that FactSet serves, and a certain amount of cost pressure as clients consolidate sometimes what we'll do is we'll have long term contracts with the clients, but you know its cost pressure on the existing business essentially as we move forward. Glenn Greene : And I assumed this sort of explains the deceleration and the domestic ASV growth communicable, looks like it was down order of magnitude of 150 basis points. And it looks -- sounds like your pricing that usually put in place this quarter was pretty status quo versus the year ago. Phil Snow : Yes, so I would say net new business, just in terms of the smaller points that we added a lot and the price increase was consistently last year. The difference that you saw was in the existing client base. One thing I will point out is that traditionally, we included our SP&A or Strategic Partnerships and Alliances revenue with our investment management revenue. And that\u2019s a very lumpy business, very often seven figure deals, and there are a couple of things that happened in this quarter that were part of that. So that\u2019s some of the drag that you are seeing on the IM business. Glenn Greene : And it sounded like from some of your commentary, the wealth management solution continues the trend at a pretty robust clip, so there is no drag there, if anything that [Multiple Speakers]. Phil Snow : It did really well. So in the uptick that you saw in receipts for us this quarter, there were a couple of really exciting wealth wins and a very large win on the sell side of the global banking and research group. Glenn Greene : That\u2019s great. Thanks a lot. Operator : The next question is from Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Joseph Foresi : Is the global syntax index and attempt to get into the indexing market and do you see opportunities there? Phil Snow : I think what you have -- great question Joe. This is really just a continuation of really partnering this firms out there to help them with -- build indices and BCFs with our reviewer [ph] contents. So we have got fantastically detailed taxonomy, industry classification and a lot of firms and leveraging that in that way. So we partner, I think with a firm over in Asia for this one. Joseph Foresi : Okay, and anyway to quantify the new opportunities in the portfolio versus yield, even a ballpark would be great, are the new opportunities 25% of the portfolio, are they 50% just trying to get some idea there? Thanks. Phil Snow : Can you -- I didn\u2019t quite understand the question, can you restate that? Joseph Foresi : So, it's sounds like you are kind of mixing your portfolio here, you have got some stuff that\u2019s kind of not doing so well, the active management, the BISAM maybe in the investor banking, but then you got a number of things that are doing well, including multi-asset class, wealth management internationally. So I am just trying to get a feel for what percentage of your portfolio you think is doing very well, some of the new opportunities that you highlighted versus some of the standard stuff that you have provided in the past that maybe isn\u2019t doing as well, is it a quarter of the portfolio, it is half of the portfolio, just trying to get a sense there? Phil Snow : So you mentioned a lot of different dimensions there, there is geography, there is client side, there is workflow. I mean we see great opportunities throughout the whole portfolio. It's a little bit different each quarter, but we are still growing. We are doing well in investment management, we're just not growing as fast as we did the last three quarters. But we see a way for us to kind of reaccelerate that with all of the great product that we have in the integration that we going to do. Joseph Foresi : Okay thanks. Operator : The next question is from Alex Kramm from UBS. Alex Kramm : Sorry if this came up in the prepared remark, but I think this is for Maurizio, if I look at my model, it's seems like the employee count actually came down quarter-over-quarter, maybe just confirm if I have this right, and if this is correct, I mean what does this suggest in terms of what you are doing or what you are seeing out there, if you are reacting with some cuts internally here? So maybe just flush it out please. Maurizio Nicolelli : Yes, so when you look at headcount between Q1 -- I am assuming you are affirming to Q1 to Q2? Alex Kramm : Exactly. Maurizio Nicolelli : So we were down about 121 employees in our headcount, just quarter-to-quarter and that was over 90% driven by attrition in [indiscernible]. If you look at our headcount here between the U.S. and Europe it was very stable. So, we had attrition in these locations, but we also had some new employee class as that started. So we were stable in headcount when you look at the U.S. and Europe. Alex Kramm : And then just secondly, sorry to come back to the whole pressure discussions you had, you obviously gave a lot of color here, just to make sure I understand this right or maybe if should add a little bit, when you're talking about pressure, it is really a discussion mostly around the desktops side of the business or are you seeing selling pressure and cost consciousness also on some of the other things that you're doing away from the desktop I guess what I'm trying to say it, are you seeing the same kind of double-digit growth in the non-desktop business and is that really -- as a business shifts more towards those enterprise workflow solutions, we should feel more comfortable about the growth rate than if you were just a desktop player? Phil Snow : Alex it's Phil, thanks for the question. So I would say if you aggregated our -- the acquisitions that we've done, as well as our CCS and our analytics business, that certainly is growing faster than the desktop business and its pressure on kind of the users of that fund and we're going to -- I think that's where the industry is heading, we're going to see more clients try to do more with enterprise solutions and less people. Operator : The next question is from Tim McHugh from William Blair. Stephen Sheldon : It's Stephen Sheldon in for Tim. You talked about some displacement in competitors within your larger client base, and some of that sounds like its driven by consolidation. So can you maybe talk about what you're seeing in terms of what's driving the decision between how they're consolidating vendor spend? Maurizio Nicolelli : Can you -- I didn't understand the question, can you [Multiple Speakers]. Stephen Sheldon : Well, so if they're consolidating towards you guys, I guess why would you win, and if they're moving away, I guess just in a broad sense why -- if someone is consolidating and moving away from you, what's the reason that you might lose in those situations? [Multiple Speakers] Maurizio Nicolelli : Yes, FactSet wins for a lot of different reasons, it's technology, content, analytics and service. Overall clients really do want to partner with us, they really trust FactSet. We've built very good relationships with our clients, the quality of our content is exceptionally high, the flexibility of our workstation is good, so clients can really customize their workflow to the way they want to do it and our consultants and our client facing staff are really the best in the market essentially, it's out there helping the client. So the long run we know we have the best people and we have a great product and we're very bullish about the future. In some cases we may not have all the pieces today that a client needs when they're consolidating and either for contractual reasons or other reasons we won't win this time, but we're really bullish that we'll win in the long run. Stephen Sheldon : And then one more, I want to ask about leverage and specifically what level of debt to EBITDA you'd be comfortable with kind of going to if you continue to see attractive M&A opportunities? Maurizio Nicolelli : The level of debt that we have on our books is less than 1.5 times our EBITDA and so there's significant amount of capacity if the right asset comes along that we need to go purchase. So, we've added -- we have 575 million of debt on our balance sheet, right around the cost of capital of 200 basis points. So it's very economical for us to have that debt on our books and to continue our buyback program going forward. But it just highlights that we have the capacity going forward if the right acquisition comes along. Operator : The next question is from Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs. Andre Benjamin : I guess my first question is the thought on the brand campaign, what you said in the press release was launch earlier this month. Just wondering what drove you to launch the campaign, how it compares to prior efforts and expected impacts on margins and revenues over the longer term. Phil Snow : Yes, it has been a while since we refreshed the brand. Every company goes through these cycles. We hired a fantastic, head of marketing just over a year ago. And she went and did a bunch of research for us in the market place and what we really discovered is there was a bigger awareness gap in the market in terms of FactSet's capability. Even some of our bigger clients were really not fully informed about what we've done from the multi-asset class or feed standpoint. So we are at the beginning of this. I wouldn\u2019t expect it to affect our margins in any way, but we got a really great response just in terms of media impressions from the kick off that we had a couple of weeks ago. Andre Benjamin : And I guess the other question I wanted to ask in terms of financial deregulations I know it's hard to say, but have you had any conversations with any clients, if that were to go through about how they're thinking about that would impact their spending on FactSet's solutions or I guess if asked differently, is there anything incremental we should expect to see from you if the administrative does start to deregulate the financial industry. Phil Snow : I think there is an opportunity in either directions. So if clients are forced to do more regulatory solutions we feel like we have great products to help them there and if there is less of a burden regulatory that means that there will be more money for our clients to spend on things like FactSet. Andre Benjamin : I was just saying, if there was any specific product, but understood. Phil Snow : Well I can give you one, so if the fiduciary rule goes through, which is I think one we got last quarter. We've got fantastic tools to people to evaluate ETFs versus mutual funds. And for the compliance and documentation part of that we have fantastic research management solutions, our code red solutions and our internal research nodes are very well suited for any regulatory solution that requires a good auditorium. Operator : The next question is from Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy from Raymond James. Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, first question in terms of debt that you have been taking out to finance some of these acquisitions and presumably you will take out little bit more for IDMS, is there any appetite there to determine or are you comfortable maintaining the credit facility? Maurizio Nicolelli : We are comfortable right now maintaining the credit facility going forward given where the cost of capital is today. Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy: And then follow up question, I know this came up on the call a couple of quarters ago, but I am not sure I totally understood the explanation. Can you walk me through the apparent disconnect between your commentary on elevated cancellations and the fact that your client retention rate remains very stable at 95% of ASV? Maurizio Nicolelli : Sure, this is Maurizio. So the calculation in our retention rate is really based on the last 12 months of clients that have cancelled and that ASV that is cancelled. Keep in mind when clients cancel, there are at the lower end of FactSet, all of our Top 100 clients don\u2019t cancelled FactSet altogether. So with the ASV from cancelled clients in that calculation is from client that cancel FactSet a 100%, so that number is small compared to the overall total. It doesn\u2019t capture existing client cancelation, and so that\u2019s where you see the different between the two. Operator : Last question is from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Patrick in for Toni. Phil, I believe you mentioned you think FactSet's market opportunity could amount to as much as 10 times your current share, can you give us a bit more color on the largest pieces of that opportunity either by user, product, workflow or geography? Phil Snow : Sure, so I would say geographically, it's a pretty evenly split. When you look at some of our largest competitive which I am sure you are aware of you just have to look through really the research workflow, who the competitors all there, portfolio management and trading those are analytics space investment banking. So it's a well-known set of competitors and we think about the solutions that we have today, how much market share they have. That\u2019s one way that we think about it. And the other thing that we are doing, you've heard me talk about the CTS business before I content and technology solutions, that\u2019s a rapidly evolving suite of products which allows our clients to do very interesting things outside of the workstation and within their enterprise. So with some of the technology advances that we have had with our NextGen project, we are now actually able to unbundle if we wanted to certain pieces of the products and allow clients to use that within specific workflows with that building. So we are very bullish on that, there is a lot of other offerings within that suite, but that is an area of our business which will actually open up even more market share as we move forward. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks Phil. And then just a quick follow up, do you feel any cost cutting pressures are less serious in wealth management? And then given there are many instances asset managers and financial advisors are frequently under the same roof, I am wondering if you have been able to bundle products enterprise wide contracts? Phil Snow : So we are seeing -- that\u2019s a relatively newer market for us, we are seeing less cost pressure there from an existing point. So I think it's more of a Greenfield opportunity. And we -- it has been a lower price solution than our institutional asset management solution which has allowed us to get market share and we are beginning now to do much larger deals with the technology advances that we have made and I think you'll see with IDMS, it opens up even more opportunity for us across the entire wealth spectrum. So what we'll have now are solutions that we can provide the wealth market all the way from the top end down to clients that need thousands of users, we are very excited about that, I think that\u2019s going to be good opportunity for the company. Unidentified Analyst : Appreciate the color. Thanks Phil. Operator : That was our last question at this time. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks. Phil Snow : Thank you everyone. We look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Phil Snow : Thanks Rima, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us on our call today. We delivered third quarter results in line with our guidance and continued to grow ASV in a challenging environment. These market conditions are exactly why we've been on the steady trajectory to build out our enterprise solutions through innovation, acquisition, and partnership. Our clients need greater efficiencies and more of a unified ecosystem for their data and analytics, and we are fully engaged in a strategy to build end-to-end solutions across critical areas of the portfolio lifecycle.  And as we move beyond the workstation to becoming more of a work flow company, the portfolio of lifecycle strategy expands the scope of FactSet solutions to create integrated work flows. As you can see on the slide, we think of the portfolio lifecycle in three main areas. Research, portfolio management and trading, and analytics. And in each of these areas, FactSet has a robust suite of products for our clients. And you can clearly see where our recent acquisitions fit into these areas. We believe the integration of these acquisitions and our continued product innovation will enable us to achieve higher growth.  Let me now give you an overview of our third quarter results. Organic revenues and organic ASV grew 6% year-over-year, adjusted diluted EPS increased 13% to $1.85 at the high end of our guidance range, and adjusted operating margin was 32%. Like last quarter, our results were impacted by cost pressures within the industry as clients seek to lower their total cost of ownership. And as I just stated, we see this is an opportunity to partner with our clients and help them leverage technology to optimize costs. The cross-sell momentum across the portfolio lifecycle is picking up with multiple wins this quarter and a number of strategic opportunities in the pipeline. This quarter, we did see an increase in new business with solid wins from plan sponsors, hedge funds, and wealth managers, and our analytics and CTS suites performed very well along with strong sales from Portware, offsetting the positive factors and in line with the theme from the second quarter of cancellations from firm consolidations and failures.  Our international business grew organically by 8% fueled by growth in Asia Pacific. With our recent acquisitions of BISAM and IDMS, which we\u2019ve now renamed FDSG, we have increased our international footprint particularly in Europe. International ASV now represents 37% of our total, and Asia Pacific grew almost 11% over the last quarter and Europe grew at 7%.  FactSet continues to focus on innovation. Year after year, we win awards for our software. Last year when we won best research provider, Inside Market Data said we were by far the industry leader, and in naming us best analytics provider they said portfolio analytics was always a best-in-class product. This year at the Inside Market Data and Inside Reference Data Awards, FactSet won the Best Market Data award for the first time replacing one of our largest competitors which had won the category every year since the awards were launched in 2003. FactSet this year again was recognized as best analytics provider.  As we saw this quarter, we once again had strong growth from both our analytic suite as well as our CTS business. Both of these product suites have consistently grown in double digits over the last few years. And as we look to provide you with more metrics, the CTS business is one that is relatively easy for us to carve out and can give you more perspective on what's driving our growth. CTS now represents approximately 10% of our revenue and the success of this off platform business has taken us beyond the workstation model. A big piece of CTS today are our end-of-day and intraday feeds to power applications and solutions directly within a client's environment. However, our recent large investment in technology now provides us with the natural stage where client can build their own solutions and leverage third party applications and data within a hosted FactSet open environment.  Wealth is another area that has consistently shown strong growth for us over the last number of years. The FDSG acquisition allows us to capitalize on the shift toward technology-enabled advice for all wealth segments. Investors are demanding digital tools that help to make investment decisions and provide flexible ways to interact with their advisors. Additionally, the regulatory requirements in this sector are a focus for clients. In combination with our analytics product and our unique content, we have the ability to provide our clients with powerful yet cost effective information for their investment portfolios along with servicing key work flows from regulatory document creation to distribution.  As I stated last quarter, we are focused on integrating our recent acquisitions and ensuring that we can offer our clients a broad suite of solutions within the FactSet ecosystem. The integration efforts are going well and we've made significant improvements to date. These acquisitions along with our infrastructure upgrades provide FactSet with scale and drive cost efficiencies in the longer term providing us with an opportunity to expand margins. We remain committed to organic growth, and reacceleration of ASV is still the highest priority for us. At the same time, we continue to return value to shareholders. Over the last 12 months, we've returned over $458 million to stockholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. We've recently increased our dividend by 12%. This increase marks the 12th consecutive year with increased dividends highlighting our continued commitment to our shareholders. We continue to invest in product development in high growth areas such as analytics; wealth trading, and our data feed business as we grow our work flow solutions. We believe we have a solid sales strategy in place under our new sales leadership to capitalize on the current market trends and increase our growth rate. As we look to the last quarter of the fiscal year for us, we remain confident with the opportunities we see to meet our targets and ability to capitalize on the market trends.  Let me now turn the call over to Maurizio to talk about our third quarter financial results and fourth quarter outlook. Maurizio Nicolelli : Thank you, Phil, and good morning to everyone on the call. In the third quarter, we continued to grow ASV and EPS and maintained adjusted operating margins within our guidance range. Before we get into the details of the quarterly results, I want to point out that our quarter-over-quarter comparisons were impacted by one-time costs of $4.4 million, primarily related to our recent acquisitions. Additionally, starting with this quarter, we will have a deferred revenue fair value adjustment from purchase accounting related to the recent acquisitions. This adjustment, totaling $2.5 million impacts our GAAP revenues and has been excluded from our adjusted results.  Let's now go through the third quarter results in more detail. GAAP revenues in the third quarter increased 9% to $312 million and 6% to $294 million on an organic basis versus the third quarter of 2016. When adding back with deferred revenue fair value adjustment, revenues were approximately $315 million at the higher end of guidance. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to our adjusted metrics in the back of earnings release and slide presentation. Looking at our segment revenue. US revenues grew 5% organically with most of this increase primarily coming from our analytics and data feeds products. International revenues increased 8% on an organic basis with strong performance from our Asia Pacific region. ASV increased to $1.28 billion at the end of our third quarter. Starting with this quarter, we are excluding professional services fees from our as reported ASV metric as these service fees are not subscription based. They were previously included in ASV. Our recent acquisitions in particular BISAM and FDSG have given rise to higher professional services fees. Professional service fees billed during the last 12 months totaled over $16 million. Had we included professional service fees, our as reported ASV would have been $1.3 billion.  Organic ASV increased 6% year-over-year and approximately $10 million since the last quarter. This increase was primarily driven by international client price increases of $5 million and new sales partially offset by cancellations.  Moving down the income statement, let's take a look at our operating expenses. Operating expenses for the third quarter totaled $225 million, an increase of 30% year-over-year primarily driven by our recent acquisitions. Third quarter cost of services expressed as a percentage of revenues increased slightly by 360 basis points compared to the year ago period. The increase was driven by higher compensation cost, depreciation and amortization expense and data costs. Higher competition costs were due to base salary changes and incremental hires in our centers of excellence in India and the Philippines, as well as our recent acquisitions.  SG&A expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues were down 60 basis points compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2016, the decrease was primarily a result of lower employee compensation due to the sale of the Market Metrics business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, partially offset by acquisition related costs. Our GAAP operating margin decreased 300 basis points year-over-year to 28%, primarily due to the acquisition related cost and the deferred revenue adjustment. Our adjusted operating margin was 32% which was at the higher end of guidance. Our current year annual effective tax rate was 25.5%, a decrease from 28.4% a year ago, primarily due to FactSet's global operational realignment effective September 1, 2016. Adjusted EPS grew 13% to $1.85 at the high end of our guidance.  Free cash flow which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending for our third quarter was $84 million, a decrease of approximately $4 million from the same period last year. The decrease was the result of a lower tax benefit from a reduction in stock option exercises and timing of vendor payments, partially offset by an improvement in cash collections. Excluding recent acquisitions, our DSOs decreased from 40 days at February 28 to 38 days at May 31. The BISAM and FDSG acquisitions also impacted our client count this quarter. The third quarter client counts stands at 4,692 up 225 from our second quarter. This increase includes 117 clients from these acquisitions. As Phil stated, the integrations are going well and we have made good progress in combining product and sales teams. Both BISAM and FDSG were accretive to adjusted EPS by $0.01 and $0.03 respectively for the third quarter. In fact, FDSG is ahead of our initial expectations as we guided you to $0.03 for the remainder of the fiscal year 2017. BISAM is in line with our initial guidance of $0.02 accretion for the remainder of fiscal 2017. BISAM added $25 million to ASV this quarter and FDSG added $63 million. Both amounts exclude non subscription related ASV.  Moving on to our share repurchase program. We repurchased 300,000 shares for $48 million during the third quarter under our existing share repurchase program. We remained committed to returning capital to shareholders and maintaining a balanced capital allocation framework.  Now let's turn to guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. For the fiscal fourth quarter we expect our GAAP revenues to be in the range of $321 million and $328 million. The midpoint of our organic revenue 5guidance is 5.5%. Our GAAP operating margin is expected in the range of 28% and 29%. Adjusted operating margin is expected to remain in the range of 31% and 32%. Similar to last quarter, the annual effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 25% and 26%. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.67 and $1.73. And adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.86 and $1.92. The midpoint of the adjusted diluted EPS range represents 12% growth over the prior year. In summary, we remain confident in our ability to return value to our shareholders. We are focused on top line growth as well as our cost structure. We believe in the long run, that there is leverage in our business model as we integrate our recent acquisitions and realize cost synergies going forward.  Thank you for your participation in today's call. We are now ready for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Tim McHugh from William Blair. Stephen Sheldon : Hi. Good morning. It's Stephen Sheldon on for Tim. I appreciate you are taking our questions. I guess with the strong contributions from off platform and premium products, can you give us some more color on for the traditional workstation growth? I guess particularly in the US. Phil Snow : Yes. Hi, Stephen. This is Phil Snow. Yes, so we know we definitely continue to invest in our call workstation product. It's one of our flagship offerings obviously but we are experiencing pricing pressure in the market as things become more competitive and we are out there competing for the same dollars with some of the larger providers that are out there. So as you saw in our numbers, we are growing our terminals which I think is a positive but part of what you are seeing there is that the pricing pressure for those is higher than it was historically and we are offsetting that with selling more of our value added products as well as the companies that we've acquired through M&A over the last couple of years. Stephen Sheldon : Okay. And then just a quick follow up. I guess organically if we stripped out recent acquisitions, how would margins have trended year-over-year? Maurizio Nicolelli : So, margins would have been comparable year-over-year. If these acquisitions that we have done over the past six months have dropped our adjusted operating margin down to 31.9%, but if we hadn't done those or if you exclude those we would be right around the historical metric. Operator : Your next question is from Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Bill Warmington : Good morning, everyone. So question for you on MiFID II just to ask about how will that impacting the business yet and some thoughts about how that potentially impacts a business? Phil Snow : Hey, Bill. It's Phil Snow. So we actually see MiFID II was an opportunity for us. We see regulatory as an area that we have a lot of assets that we could point in that direction. MiFID II for one example with specific solution that we\u2019ve developed is we have a partnership with the firm called ONEaccess which allowed us to integrate their suite of tools to track and value research products and services. These tools are getting integrated with our RMS suites, which includes Code Red and internal research notes, and that's going to enable users to look at corporate access events, create a research valuation framework, and carryout quantitative broker vote. So that's just one solution that we have for MiFID II which has a lot of components to it. Another one is with the Portware acquisition, we\u2019ve developed a solution for best execution which is something that's part of MiFID II as well. Bill Warmington : Got it. And then a couple of housekeeping items. You had mentioned on the guidance and in the prepared remarks in terms of coming in for this past quarter at $312 million and the guidance being $311 million to $317 million, and if you had adjusted for the fair value, it would have come in more around $315 million. The guidance for Q4, $321 million to $328 million, should we think -- should we be including the fair value adjustment in those numbers or that number is excluding that $2.5 million fair value adjustment? How should we think about that? Maurizio Nicolelli : Hi, Bill. It's Maurizio. That revenue guidance is our GAAP revenue guidance. It includes deferred revenue fair value adjustment in it. Bill Warmington : Got it. So it has the impact of the fair value adjustments, it does not have the revenue -- the deferred revenue. Maurizio Nicolelli : It includes -- it includes the impact of the deferred revenue fair value adjustment. It is a GAAP number. Operator : Your next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hey, thank you for taking my questions. Just a follow up on Bill's question. The guidance for the current -- the quarter just reported, was that contemplating a deferred revenue adjustment in there or not because there was commentary about coming out in the middle of the range, if you would add that back above was that something that -- was the guidance assuming that you are not going to have to write anything off and therefore that's the right way of looking at it? Just trying to understand the context there. Maurizio Nicolelli : So we went through, hi, Shlomo, it's Maurizio, so went through our purchase accounting valuation process after the acquisition closed. And when we went through that process, the deferred revenue fair value adjustment came in larger than what we had expected. And so that's why you see this -- the $312 million is at the lower end of the guidance range. And so that's why we've been very upfront with everyone on how much that adjustment was during the period. Shlomo Rosenbaum : So just -- is it -- was it supposed to be -- were you expecting -- was it $2.5 million or you are expecting $1 million - $1.5 million, just trying to -- is the commentary that it really was exactly in the middle of the range of what you are expecting or not? Maurizio Nicolelli : We were expecting to be lower and to be right around the middle of the range. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Just Phil going back to some commentary you made about opportunity for leverage in the business model to realize cost synergies and things like that, is it a comment saying, hey, we are going to get back to the margins we had before? Is this the comment saying, hey, there\u2019s margin upside from what we had before? Phil Snow : I think Maurizio and I are primarily focused on getting the acquisitions integrated well and getting back to the margins that we had pre the recent M&A activity. I think we are -- as I mentioned in my note we are just very focused on top line growth is the most important factor for us. So if we do feel like we've made all the necessary investments to drive the high growth areas for us, that does give us an opportunity to expand margins later, that\u2019s something I think we'll be evaluating as we work through the next 12 months. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, good. And then the professional service is getting excluded from the ASV. Can you walk us through exactly what are you doing in the professional services? And how much visibility do you have to that in any given quarter? Sounds like right now it's looking around $4 million in revenue. Is it something that when you give us the guidance on a day like today you have pretty good visibility into that or how should we think of that? Maurizio Nicolelli : So Shlomo, it is Maurizio. Professional services revenue is really the implementation, a piece on the -- really the last three acquisitions that we made, Vermilion, BISAM, and FDSG. And so that is really revenue that is built in the implementation phase that is amortized over the life of the contract. And so we've incorporated that into our revenue guidance, but we have excluded it from ASV because it's really not subscription based revenue. And so, to be upfront and to be very transparent, we've given you both numbers. We've given you what the ASV number is and also how much of the last 12 months a professional service fees have been billed to our clients. Operator : The next question is from Peter Appert from Piper Jaffray. Peter Appert : Thanks. Phil can you talk a little bit about your comfort with the current business mix? Any white spaces left in terms of things that you feel you need to fill in? Phil Snow : We feel very good about the progress we made over the last two years to fill out the portfolio lifecycle. So that slide we showed where we can go from research to portfolio management and trading to analytics, we feel that we get all of that connected, we are making really good progress. That gives us much more opportunity particularly in the larger institutional asset management client where we are seeing some of the cost pressures. Similarly, with wealth, the FDSG acquisition allows us now to go from end-to-end. Previously we were really attacking the ultrahigh net worth and high net worth part of the market, this now connects us with the affluent. S0 we feel that entire $2 billion market that sort of how we evaluate is now something that we can go after. And then lastly with CTS which I described we are really thinking about investing more in there, opening up platform and as clients look to do more things across their enterprise, that just gives us a whole host of different options in terms of unlocking more value within our clients where that building things themselves. So I think all three of those things combined with our really strong co work station, product as well as our established analytic suite. And we feel like we got lot of great options across the portfolio of products we have. Regulatory is another area which I mentioned is early days for us. But we do have a team of people that are focused on that. So I think as we move forward that's another area you'll be hearing us talk more about. Peter Appert : So regulatory could be a focus from an M&A standpoint but otherwise what I would interpret your comments to be that a pace of M&A activity will be less going forward? Phil Snow : We are certainly not as active as we have been in the last 24 months. So I think regulatory is an interesting area. We are always on the look for unique content with what we have now there is lots of ways for us to leverage unique content. But the current focus for us is really on integrating the assets that we have acquired over the last 24 months. Peter Appert : Okay. Can I just sneak in one more? On the margin leverage question and getting back to prior margins, Maurizio, do you envision that being something they can happen over the course of maybe the next four quarters? Maurizio Nicolelli : I think that's really -- that's really 4 to 8 quarters out I would say as we go into end integrate these acquisitions I'd say it's probably year or two out. Operator : The next question is from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : Hi, good morning. Phil you mentioned that the CTS business is only about 10% of revenue. Just given how quickly feeds are growing versus the traditional workstation business? I was little bit surprised that's not higher. So basically how should we reconcile that and how large do you expect the CTS business to ultimately get to? Phil Snow : It's large market. I think it's pretty well published why a number of our competitors having the space. Our offering Tony has been pointed historically at very much sort of the quant market that was a big market for us. So quant consuming and if they feed for us to do analytic, a lot of clients building application, feeding data into performance system, so we see it is a large opportunity for us. For a company of FactSet size, it does take time for those percentages to move. But we certainly are excited about that area and we are going to continue to invest more in it. Toni Kaplan : Okay, great. And then can you talk a little bit about the competitive landscape? Are you running up against new competitors as you expand your product capabilities and also especially changing geographies as well? And anything to note on your positioning and how aggressive the market is right now? Phil Snow : So I think the competitive landscape hasn't changed that much. As we move into areas and our competitors move into areas we kind of bump up against competitors in new ways. But it's primarily sort of the larger competitors that we've always think competing against. And a lot of niche analytics providers that we compete with our analytic suites. And I wouldn't say it so much competition but we are now I think competing with our clients for the money that they spend to build things. That sort of a new area for us. And CTS is one piece of that. When we look at the competitive landscape, FactSet traditionally is really going to win just in terms of the strength of our analytics, the quality of our content, the flexibility of our platform and the service levels that we provide. And where we are losing now where it sort of we are trading blows with people is when clients are consolidating and those pieces that we don't have. In some cases we are going to lose some or all of our business. However, as we stitch together some of the things we talked about today, that's going to provide a great opportunity for us moving forward. Toni Kaplan : Okay. Great. And just one last quick one. It looks like sale side improved over last quarter in terms of the growth rate. I think ASV growth rate, anything to call out in terms of strength there that would be helpful. Thanks. Phil Snow : Nothing in particular that's definitely a more volatile piece of our business than the buy side. So we are often large deals kind of swing things one way or the other. We do really well with our desktop products with junior bankers and we are beginning to see more penetration with our CTS product within the sale side. Traditionally that's something that we've really just had more success with on the buy side and with redistribution partner. Operator : Your next question is from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Manav Patnaik : Yes, thank you. Good morning. My first question is around the wealth management business. Clearly, it sounds like a nice opportunity for you guys. I was hoping you could just elaborate on whether this opportunity is more than just sort of your workstation penetration opportunity? And like you gave us CTS at 10% of the business, any help on what wealth size is today at FactSet? Phil Snow : So FDSG which is the acquisition we did, does have a number of terminals but primarily that business is really just creating very elegant portals for large banks, large retail bank. So that sort of -- they've got digital product and that's definitely a trend that we are going to see in the wealth market. So what excited us so much about the acquisition was combining that with our co workstation and analytics product which serves the high end of the market very well but as trends changed we try to get to more people having the digital solution is very helpful. And we can't-- thanks for asking on the size of wealth market. We can't give you that number today but hopefully we are showing some movement here for you guys so you can get a better understanding. And I think Maurizio and I are getting closer over the next couple of quarters to being able to break things down for you at a more granular level. Manav Patnaik : Okay. That's helpful to know. And then just in terms of -- you mentioned analytics a bunch of times, fixed income always been a focus for you guys, any color on -- you had some of the fixed income asset, straight hands more recently, if those are the kind of things that maybe you guys have or would look at or maybe they are at the realm where you guys are targeting. Phil Snow : I missed the second half about --sorry could you -- Manav Patnaik : Just in terms of -- you know the like -- I am referring to your book in the index businesses that just got sold. And I guess my question is your focus on fixed income and analytics particularly, is it different than that size of the book or just curious on your appetite for the M&A or expansion plans there? Phil Snow : Yes. So our strategy really has been to integrate the benchmark providers. On the analytic side, I think we've exceptionally strong fixed income analytics for our own product. And there is interest in some cases from partners that are out there for us to help power some of that for them. So we are having some of those conversations. But we are really focused on our analytic suite and essentially being able to create an integrated solution for client that want to use multiple component. And just in terms of creating benchmark, our focus has been more on the ETF creation. So there has been multiple examples of that in press release that we've put out there that demonstrate that we got the capabilities to do that if we wanted to. Operator : Your next question is from Ato Garrett from Deutsche Bank. Ato Garrett : Hi, good morning. Looking forward to the fourth quarter revenue guidance or you gave us what the organic ASV growth would be at the midpoint. Wondering can you give us what the ASV contribution expectation is from the acquisitions you have closed recently. Maurizio Nicolelli : We don't -- hi, this is Maurizio; we don't give guidance on how much projected ASV would be from the acquisitions. So we don't -- that's not on the guidance that we give. Ato Garrett : Okay. Fair enough. Then looking at -- again going forward just thinking about a free cash flow and some of the acquisitions you've made the impact we've seen on margins, and just thinking about what that might do. Should we still see free cash flow conversion like above 100% of net income or we have a different expectations for free cash flow in the fourth quarter going forward? Maurizio Nicolelli : I think free cash flow should range right around what we've done in the last 12 to 24 months. And I don't see free cash flow significantly changing. We still generate a significant amount of free cash flow and at time over last 12 months basis above net income. So I don't see that changing. We are still a very cash generated business. Ato Garrett : Okay, great. And then one last one on the competitive environment. I think we saw some paperwork getting filed about another desktop provider in Nordics region that might be going public or is getting some external interest for bids. I am wondering if you see that as the -- if that was to be picked up by any of your larger competitors or they might have an impact on some of your international growth which has been -- you have driven some strong results this quarter. Just what your thoughts might be if that's a product that you don't really compete with or if it just too small to really be too relevant. Phil Snow : Yes. I think the product that you are talking about. We see in the Scandinavian region. My understanding is it's a good product. But if that got applied by someone else in the market, I don't think that would have any material impact on our European business at all. Operator : The next question is from Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie. Kayvan Rahbar : Hi, this is Kayvan Rahbar filling in for Hamzah. Can you give us a sense as you guys are transitioning from desktop business from a work flow business due to capital requirements for the business changed; if the work flows oriented business gets to be the vast majority of the portfolio? Maurizio Nicolelli : No. So it's Maurizio. Listen, our capital requirement doesn't change. It's still within our overall structure. And so that were not significantly changed one way or the other our capital investments or capital needs. Operator : Your next question is from Glenn Greene from Oppenheimer. Glenn Greene : Thanks. Good morning. Question for Phil. I guess broadly just about sales activity what you are seeing. You talked about cross-sell momentum picking up. You alluded to better activity within a product solution analytics. Could you just give us a little bit more color on the part of the businesses -- parts of the businesses that you are actually seeing momentum in and is there anyway to frame, it's obviously you are sort of going through somewhat of transition in your business but is there sort of faster growing part of your business, how those are growing and what proportion of the business they may represent that maybe offsetting some of the slower growth in the work stationing business. Phil Snow : Yes. I think we've -- and we've talked about it a lot. So there is just geographically, clearly from our comments today Asia Pac has been an area that's done very well. Within the larger clients, when we are selling analytics and CTS it's going into the risk and performance team and in lot of cases into the front office or building solutions for the front office. Across -- we've a very broad suite of products and we service a lot of different clients. So we did very well again this quarter with wealth managers, with insurance companies, with hedge funds, corporates has been good for us, plan sponsors were picking up momentum. The one area that we've seen the most pressure is in our core institutional asset management clients as they are under severe cost pressure. They are focused on expense management, hiring is down and we see the flows from active to passive. So our strategy, the portfolio lifecycle strategy is most going to help those clients. So we think that we are in pretty good shape. Gregory Francfort : Yes. So it's a good segue way to my follow up question. So the client pressures that you alluded to that you have been talking about for a few quarters. Is there anyway to frame it? Has it gotten better, worse or is it relatively stable? How would you characterize it? Phil Snow : I think it's relatively stable. I think the trends that we've seen in terms of the asset flows and the move from domestic, international which might be one that's helping us in the wealth business. And just generally speaking the desire to see increased transparency through regulation. Those are trends that may have going on for a while and it's hard to imagine them abating in the next couple of quarters. So that's our thesis and we have a strategy essentially to capitalize on it. Operator : Your next question is from David Chu from Bank of America. David Chu : Hi, thanks. So if cancellations are stable, is it fair to assume that gross adds have weaken a bit like the recent quarters? Phil Snow : Gross adds have been very consistent with what we saw the same quarter a year ago for both Q3 and Q2. In fact, in Q2 it was a little bit higher. So in both this quarter and the quarter previous we saw a material uptick in cancellations and through consolidation or through complete client failure. That's -- those of the headwinds we are facing. We've got a great product suite, we've got a great sales team with selling as much or more product than we did last year. But they are just a few things that are out of control. So we have to offset that by selling more. David Chu : Okay. So it actually does sound like cancellations are like upticking versus being stable. Is that fair? Phil Snow : I would say it was similar to last quarter but compared to a year ago definitely more yes. David Chu : Okay. And this is a follow up. I know you gave unique client count for the two recent acquisitions. Can you provide a unique like subscriber count? Maurizio Nicolelli : So we haven't gone to that level so obviously BISAM does not have this user count because their type of service. And on the FDSG side, we have not incorporated that into our user count as a lot of their users are at the lower tier of the market and it would have distorted just the overall user count for us going forward. Operator : Your next question is from Alex Kramm from UBS. Alex Kramm : Okay, good morning. I guess just coming back to some of the things that you were saying clearly you are transitioning to work flow kind of firm and that's growing much, much faster than their core terminal business. I guess where are we in that balance at this point? When can the work flow strong growth actually kind of start offsetting the pressures on the terminal side? I guess it's around about way of asking do you think ASV growth organically is kind of bottomed or do you feel like it's going to get worse before it gets better? Phil Snow : Yes. There is no way to predict whether or not ASV growth will continue to decelerate. I think Maurizio's guidance or our guidance is a little bit down from where it is this quarter just in terms of the growth rate. It's going to be -- getting these assets integrated, Alex, is a multi quarter and/or multiyear thing. So I think it's not something that's going to happen overnight. But we got great suites of products to sell for all of the different kind of areas we talked about today. I think that by itself is going to help us with our growth rate. Getting the more connected over the next year or two will take it to another level. Alex Kramm : Okay. And now that's fair. And then thus maybe just as a follow up to that. Two things that maybe minor things here but like one on the repurchasing Maurizio like that was fairly slow quarter and then also on the organic hiring, I think those growth rate I think it was 5% year-over-year, those have come down over the last couple of quarters. So I guess just thinking about those two things separately. You are not buying back as much, you are not hiring as much like what is it that mean for the near term outlook as you see it considering how weak the stock has been and as you want to capitalize on kind of opportunities from hiring perspective. Maurizio Nicolelli : Okay. So let me take both questions separately. So first on the buyback during the third quarter. Keep in mind we used existing cash flows to purchase FDSG. So we had -- we lowered -- we had the slightly lower quarter in terms of buying back shares during the period. We are still committed to our buyback program and there are still plenty of funds within the buyback program. It's available to us to go buyback shares in the fourth quarter and also in fiscal 2018. On your second question, just -- so let me just -- can you go back to your second question [Multiple Speakers] Alex Kramm : Yes, no, sorry, yes, I probably should have asked those separately but I wanted to stick to two questions. So, no, other side was just the hire -- that the hiring has slowed right. So the question is, is that because you don't see the opportunities out there because I think historically the hiring have supported the growth? So where does that fit in that the growth rate comes down on the hiring. Maurizio Nicolelli : So keep in mind our third quarter we don't -- we have very little new hiring classes in the third quarter. So what you are really going to see now is our high end classes increase headcount in the fourth quarter both in the US and Europe and also in both India and the Philippines. So you will see that growth rate come back in the fourth quarter. It's a little bit more timing than anything else in terms of the growth rate on our headcount side. Operator : Your next question is from Keith Housum from Northcoast Research. Keith Housum : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And it refers to recent changes on sales leadership. Is there any -- I know it's kind of early here in the change but is there anything we can point to in terms of changes that are being made that perhaps will help drive the additional growth into the future? Phil Snow : Thanks for the question. So it's early days. The transition has been very smooth. John Wiseman is FactSet veteran, he has been here -- he is actually on his second tour at FactSet. He has been here 13 years. I worked with him that entire time and great thing about John is he has deep relationships across the entire organization as well as globally. He was running our global SPA team, Strategic Partnership and Alliances. So he had exposure to some very large opportunities and orchestrated some of the most complicated deal that we have most complex with very large client and has great experience with both the on platform as well as the CTS business. So I think John is going to bring an additional level of focus particularly to our larger account and structure our group around that which should be really helpful with our portfolio lifecycle strategy. Keith Housum : Great. And then so you've talked often in the past by trying to get the revenue growth to 10%. And you've also talked about how it's going to be difficult to do in a current environment. Is there a need to change your long-term 10% gross margin, growth in the revenue side based on what maybe long-term challenges you have in the institutional management side? Phil Snow : Yes. I think we are just focused on getting back to accelerating our growth rate; double digits would be great to get to. Whether or not we are going to get there in the next couple of quarter is hard to imagine that happening. But I think in the long term we definitely see the opportunity for us to grow at higher rate. Operator : Your next question is from Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Mike Reid : Hi. This is Mike Reid on for Joe. Thanks for taking our questions. I just wanted to clarify that the 237 new users that was from the 108 organic client additions, is that right? Maurizio Nicolelli : Yes, it's from -- it's not totally derived just from the 108 net new clients. It's from the whole client base. Mike Reid : Okay. So is that kind of two to one number than signify the loss of user across clients or there are other dynamics there. Maurizio Nicolelli : And there is other dynamics there right so if you are a new data feed client you are not going to be included in the user count. So you can have client that come on board, that spend more than $10,000 threshold limit that are not purchasing their traditional work station. Mike Reid : Okay. Thanks for the color on that. And then could you give us a little bit detail on any momentum building for the FactSet web rollout? Phil Snow : So it's still very early days there. I think I mentioned that on the last quarter. We got a new version of our universal screening engine which is getting integrated, the PA3 product we have with the portfolio Analytics 3 which is getting great momentum now across our co workstations that's going to be integrated into the web. So we've got some nice wins but it's not material -- it's not material driver of our growth right now. Operator : The last question is from Peter Heckmann from D A Davidson. Peter Heckmann : Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. My questions were primarily housekeeping Maurizio. So when we forecast beyond your current quarter guidance, the three most recent acquisitions adds about $103 million in ASV which you are saying there is an additional roughly $11 million to $12 million in professional services work that was included in the revenue from those but it's not included in the ASV, is that correct? Maurizio Nicolelli : Correct. You got it. Peter Heckmann : Okay, great. And then one quick question. What would be the percentage of revenue that's now denominated in foreign currencies with these acquisitions? And could you give us the top three? Maurizio Nicolelli : So in terms of foreign currency, it is more than 90% of our revenues are billed in US dollar still even with these recent acquisitions. And so that really has not changed and in terms of the denomination, the biggest one will be Yen and then followed by the Pound and EURO and they are very close to be quite honest in terms of mix. But those are the top three. Peter Heckmann : Okay. So maybe they approach to roughly 3% of revenue each -- they get you about 9% of revenue income denominated in foreign currency and that would be consistent with your comments that 90% is denominated in US. Maurizio Nicolelli : Correct. Phil Snow : Great. Thank you, everyone. And see you all next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Before we begin, I would like to point out that the slides we will reference during the course of this presentation can be accessed via the webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at factset.com. These slides will be posted on our website at the conclusion of this call. A replay of today\u2019s call will be available via phone and on our website. The conference call is being transcribed in real-time by FactSet\u2019s CallStreet service and is being broadcast live at FactSet.com. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions to investors. To be fair to everyone, please limit yourself to one question plus a follow-up. Before we discuss our results, I encourage all listeners to review the legal notice on Slide 2, which explains the risks of forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, please refer to our Form 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, the reconciliation to the most directly comparably GAAP measures are in the appendix to the presentation and in our earnings release issued earlier today. This non-GAAP information should be considered supplemental in nature and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similarly entitled measures reported by other companies. Joining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer; and Maurizio Nicolelli, Chief Financial Officer. I would now like to turn the call over to Phil. Phil Snow : Thanks, Rima. Good morning to everyone in the U.S. and good afternoon to those joining us here in the UK. As we close out fiscal 2017, I just want to take a moment to highlight this year\u2019s accomplishments and really thank the FactSet employees around the world who have worked hard to achieve our strong results in a challenging market. Fiscal 2017 was a solid year of accomplishments for us as we continued to pivot from being a workstation towards being a workflow company. In Q4, we delivered revenue and adjusted EPS at the high-end of our guidance range and above consensus estimates. And throughout 2017, we continued to diversify our suite of products through strategic acquisitions and product investment. This year\u2019s acquisitions have allowed us to fill critical gaps within our portfolio lifecycle strategy. We have made significant progress in integrating these acquisitions, and this work remains a key focus for us in fiscal year 2018. Additionally, as part of our project NexGen, we have created a stronger FactSet technology infrastructure and delivery platform, and we have released many updates to our key products and increased the number of applications available in FDS Web. We added over 500 net new clients and almost 5,000 users during our fiscal year with the majority of the client increase coming organically. Our clients value our longstanding relationships and the breadth and depth of solutions we bring to them. Cross-selling within our diverse product suite continued this quarter as evidenced by some of our key client wins in both our traditional business with national bank investments as well as a result of our acquisitions with Danske Bank and Banco Santander Totta. These wins highlight our transition from a workstation to a workflow company. Lastly, our best-in-class products won many industry awards this year. FactSet, Vermilion, and Portware received awards in 9 industry competitions to-date in 2017, including best market data award for the first time. We are thrilled that our commitment to fresh ideas and innovation in response to client needs is recognized widely in our industry. Now, turning to our fourth quarter results; organic revenues and organic ASV both grew at 6% year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 12% to $1.90 at the high end of our guidance range. Adjusted operating margin was 31%, which is in the range we expected. We are pleased that we added more ASV this quarter versus the same quarter last year. The fourth quarter increase of $32 million in ASV was driven by growth across the majority of our key workflows, including analytics, investment banking, and CTS. Our broker-dealer and institutional asset management clients provided us with the highest gains this quarter versus the prior year. Our strategy of going deeper with clients through cross-selling and up-selling is going well as evidenced by higher year-over-year sales to existing clients. Offsetting these wins were client cancellations, but the number of cancellations decreased this quarter versus the prior year. Our international business performed well in the fourth quarter driven by institutional asset managers in Asia-Pac. International ASV grew organically by 8% fueled by growth in Asia-Pacific. International ASV now represents over 37% of our total ASV. Asia-Pac grew almost 13% and Europe ASV grew 6%. As we look towards our fiscal 2018, we continue to focus on integrating our acquisitions. We have made great progress integrating products and platforms across FactSet, Portware, Vermilion, and BISAM. Portware clients can now receive FactSet Data Feeds through APIs. We consolidated data centers to achieve cost savings for the company and the integration efforts under FDSG have also been accretive both to operating margin and EPS. On the analytics front, we are seeing many data and technology synergies between PA, BISAM, and Vermilion. Data continuity, a high priority for clients between FactSet and BISAM strengthens our positions with those clients. In summary, our integration efforts have opened up tremendous up-selling and cross-selling opportunities within the client base. This strategy delivered results in our fourth quarter. MiFID II is going to become effective in January of 2018 in Europe and that\u2019s getting more and more attention and we are monitoring the regulations and working with clients to provide solutions. FactSet launched a regulatory solutions team this year and we have a suite of offerings organic and partnered that we believe cover clients\u2019 MiFID II needs throughout the portfolio lifecycle. No single vendor has all the solutions for MiFID II and we believe clients will continue to multi-source for the near-term and they are telling us that they want to work with FactSet. We don\u2019t know fully the impact these regulations may have on the health of the financial industry and whether this change will lead to further consolidation, but we are working closely with our clients to understand how this could affect them in the long run. In conclusion, we remain committed to returning value to our shareholders as evidenced by our balanced capital allocation. In fiscal 2017, we returned over $340 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We are pleased with our quarter and full year results. As we capitalize on the businesses we acquired, we are starting to see the synergies and an increase in cross-selling momentum. We believe we are well-positioned to launch new products in 2017 and 2018 in all strategic business areas. We remain optimistic about continuing to grow ASV and leveraging our scale to drive margin expansion. Let me now turn the call over to Maurizio to talk about our fourth quarter 2017 financial results and first quarter 2018 outlook. Maurizio Nicolelli : Thank you, Phil and good morning and good afternoon to everyone on the call. In our fourth quarter, we delivered revenue and adjusted EPS at the high-end of our guidance range. We maintained our ASV growth at approximately 6% and our adjusted operating margin at 31.2% was within our guidance range. Adjusted EPS of $1.90 was at the high-end of our guidance. Before we get into the details of the quarterly results, I want to point out that our GAAP quarter-over-quarter comparisons were impacted by restructuring actions initiated by the company. These actions are part of our efforts to realize more synergies from recent acquisitions and leverage the scale of our business. You will see the impact of these throughout our results. Additionally, our fiscal fourth quarter of 2016 had a one-time gain from the sale of the Market Metrics business. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to our adjusted metrics in the back of our earnings release and slide presentation. Let\u2019s now go through the fourth quarter results in more detail. GAAP revenues in the fourth quarter increased 14% to $327 million and 6% to $301 million on an organic basis versus the fourth quarter of 2016. Looking at our segment revenue, U.S. revenues grew 6% organically, primarily as a result of wins from our workstations, analytics, and data feeds products. International revenues increased 8% on an organic basis, with strong performance from the Asia-Pac region. ASV increased to $1.32 billion at the end of our fourth quarter. As a reminder, we exclude professional services fees from our as reported ASV metric as they are non-subscription based. These professional fees were previously included in the as reported ASV metric until our fiscal second quarter. Our recent acquisitions, in particular BISAM and FDSG have given rise to higher professional services fees. Professional services fees billed during the past 12 months totaled $17 million. Organic ASV increased 6% year-over-year and approximately $32 million since the end of our third quarter. This increase was primarily driven by increased sales to existing clients partially offset by cancellations. Moving down the income statement, let\u2019s take a look at our operating expenses. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter totaled $244 million, an increase of 22% year-over-year primarily driven by our recent acquisitions, the previously mentioned restructuring actions, and also modifications to certain share-based compensation grants. Fourth quarter cost of services expressed as a percentage of revenues increased 620 basis points compared with the year ago period. The increase was driven by higher compensation costs, depreciation and amortization expense and data costs. Higher compensation costs were due to the recent acquisitions, base salary changes and incremental hires in our centers of excellence located in India and the Philippines. SG&A expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues were down 80 basis points compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The decrease was primarily a result of the continued shift in our employee base from SG&A to cost of services and a non-recurring charge related to legal matters in the prior year period. Our GAAP operating margin decreased 530 basis points year-over-year to 25% primarily due to the previously mentioned restructuring charges and modifications to certain share-based compensation grants. Our current year annual effective tax rate was 25.3%, a decrease from 28.3% a year ago primarily due to FactSet\u2019s global operational realignment effective September 1, 2016. Adjusted EPS grew 12% to $1.90 at the high-end of our guidance. Free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending for our fourth quarter, was $89 million, an increase of approximately $32 million from the same period last year. The increase was due to higher net income, a lower effective tax rate and lower capital expenditures and timing of certain payments. Excluding recent acquisitions, our DSOs decreased from 38 days at May 31 to 37 days at August 31. We ended the year with increased client and user counts. During the fourth quarter, our client count increased by 115 resulting in over 4,700 clients. The user count also increased by almost 3,000 users to over 88,000 users. For the full year, client count has increased 13%, while users increased 6%. Most of the client count increase was organic. As Phil stated, the integrations are going well and we have made good progress in combining products and sales teams. Both BISAM and FDSG were accretive to adjusted EPS by $0.01 and also $0.05 respectively for the fourth quarter. In fact, FDSG is ahead of our expectations as we had guided you to $0.03 for fiscal 2017 at the time of the acquisition. BISAM is in line with our initial guidance of $0.02 accretion for fiscal 2017. Moving on to our share repurchase program. We repurchased 270,000 shares for $44 million during the fourth quarter under our existing share repurchase program. As of August 31, 2017, approximately $244 million remained for future share repurchases under the share repurchase program. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders and maintaining a balanced capital allocation framework. Now, let\u2019s turn to our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. For the fiscal first quarter, we expect GAAP revenues to be in the range of $327 million and $333 million. The midpoint of our organic revenue guidance is 6%. Our GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 28% and 29%. Adjusted operating margin is expected to remain in the range of 31% to 32%. Similar to last year, the annual effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 25% and 26%. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.75 and $1.81 and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.93 and $1.99. The midpoint of the adjusted diluted EPS range represents 12% growth over the prior year. The annual effective tax rate and GAAP diluted and adjusted EPS guidance do not include the expected impact from adopting the accounting standard update to FASB\u2019s ASC 718, which changes the way companies are required to account for stock-based compensation. This accounting standard update will be effective for FactSet beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. If this update was adopted in fiscal 2017, we would have recognized a $0.26 benefit favorable EPS benefit from the windfall tax benefits associated with stock option exercises. Due to the volatility in tax expense, the new accounting standard update creates, it is difficult for us to predict the quarterly impact, but we believe the full year 2018 impact will be comparable to 2017. In summary, we are pleased to end our fiscal 2017 in a strong position in this challenging market. We look forward to executing on our strategy to grow top line and return value to shareholders. We believe in the long-term that there is leverage in our business model and an opportunity to optimize our cost structure. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call. We are now ready for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Anj Singh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Anj Singh : Thanks for taking my questions. First off on organic growth, the improvement that we saw this quarter, could you speak to the factors that drove the growth above what you folks were expecting at the midpoint when you provided guidance initially? And then perhaps the factors that drive your outlook for organic growth to moderate slightly at the midpoint for 1Q? Thanks. Phil Snow : Sure. Hi, it\u2019s Phil Snow. So, we are very happy with the Q4 results. I think it\u2019s a very positive sign that we added more ASV in this Q4 than we did the same quarter a year ago. We have got definitely a good uplift from banking this quarter. So, I think the seasonal hires that we saw in banking were a little bit higher than we expected and that definitely drove a lot of the workstation uses that you saw come in. The performance in the Americas team was good and we definitely saw some resiliency there versus what we have seen in previous quarters. Asia-Pac did exceptionally well. The CTS products that we called out on the last quarter did better than it did Q4 a year ago and the analytics just continued to deliver solid results for us. I think those are kind of the main factors. Anj Singh : Okay, got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then a follow-up question for Maurizio with regard to leverage levels, I realized it\u2019s still well below most of your peers and it ticked down slightly versus last quarter, and your buyback activity is also well off pace versus last year. So despite the recent weakness in shares, we didn\u2019t see buybacks tick up. So, just trying to get a sense of whether there is a desire to get leverage levels down to levels that they have been at historically or just any other thoughts around that? Thank you. Maurizio Nicolelli : So our share buyback program, we purchased over 250 million shares over the last 12 months. Its right around what we had planned on for the year and it translated into repurchasing 1.55 million shares during the last 12 months. We are committed to our share repurchase program, and we don\u2019t see a change in our capital allocation process or plan going forward for the next 12 months. Anj Singh : Okay, understood. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from David Chu with Bank of America. Your line is open. DavidChu: Hi, thanks. So, if I look back at fiscal \u201917, the organic ASV growth slowed a bit, but the subscriber base actually grew. So, just trying to determine the delta, is this more attributable to like lower revenue per user or maybe some slowing of the non-terminal products? Phil Snow : Hi, David. I think it\u2019s more the former honestly. So, we are continuing to grow our user base, which we are extremely happy about. Whenever we do that, it gives us an opportunity to continue to cross-sell and up-sell those users. But what you saw is good uptick in investment banking workstations, high number of wealth workstations, and typically those are priced lower than sort of core institutional asset management workstations. DavidChu: Got it. Okay, great. And just thinking about the margin profile, I know fiscal \u201817 was impacted by the acquisition, but can you just discuss kind of spending patterns overall and just wanted to see if it\u2019s consistent in terms of spend to drive innovation, has it been pretty consistent or would you say you are increasing spend in fiscal \u201817 relative to \u201816? Phil Snow : Yes, we continue to invest in the product. We have always done that. We are definitely at a lower point in terms of our margins. But as you pointed out, that\u2019s absolutely a result of the acquisitions. And the margin that we are at now is at the low end of the guidance that we have issued for the next quarter. So, we are definitely planning to get some margin expansion in FY \u201818. I don\u2019t think we are going to get back to historical levels within the full year, but we are definitely going to make some progress. DavidChu: Got it. Okay, thank you very much. Phil Snow : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Keith Housum : Good morning. As we look at the potential implications of MiFID, can you just remind us the mix of buy versus sell side in Europe? And I guess anymore color you can provide on what you guys have learned over the past quarter on any implications that MiFID may have on just the overall environment throughout Europe? Phil Snow : So, the mix in buy side ASV versus sell side ASV in Europe? Keith Housum : Yes. Phil Snow : Yes. So, I think that\u2019s probably pretty consistent with what it is globally. So, the sell side ASV for us is less than 20% right now. So, we are not \u2013 as I stated on previous calls, I think we view MiFID as more of an opportunity to us than a threat. It potentially could put some pressure on sell side research users, but on the other side we have got a very heavy buy side research base, which could benefit from it and the regulatory team that we have setup now is really getting focused on what it is we have to sell. We have got some good offerings in terms of the research unbundling solutions. We have got our research management suite or our RMS suite and we are partnering with ONEaccess and Liquidnet in that area and then we are working within the Portware area to make sure that we have solutions, the best execution. So, those are the two that we are working on now, but we are certainly evaluating everything that MiFID is going to include and where we can help our clients. Keith Housum : Great. If I could just follow-up on that, it sounds like the environment this quarter wasn\u2019t quite as challenging as I guess the prior quarter. Is that a correct assumption? Phil Snow : I think it\u2019s still challenging. Some of the trends that we have noticed in terms of Brexit, it\u2019s one thing, the continued shift from active to passive clients focusing on that total cost of ownership. I think what you are seeing is some of the benefits of the acquisitions we have done and our sales force getting more up to speed on what we have cross-selling and sort of an operating in a new environment. Keith Housum : Great. Thank you. Phil Snow : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Ato Garrett with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Ato Garrett : Good afternoon. So, just looking through some of the figures, it looks like your ASV per client actually grew pretty nicely there. I am wondering is that primarily the result of just the cross-sell efforts that you called out in your prepared remarks where you are seeing some new trends with your new client base taking on larger amounts of ASV initially? Phil Snow : That\u2019s not a metric that we track ASV per client. So, if it did go up, that\u2019s positive. And Maurizio, you want to add anything to that? Maurizio Nicolelli : It\u2019s a \u2013 when we look at the ASV growth during the period, it\u2019s really driven by our premium products, our fee business. That\u2019s really driving the growth at the end of the day. Looking at ASV divided by the total number of clients, it\u2019s very difficult to look and to evaluate the company that way. Ato Garrett : Got it. Okay. And also just looking at the \u2013 you guys made a number of acquisitions recently particularly looking at FDSG and BISAM, just thinking about your product portfolio as it stands now. Do you think there is an area that you are really focused on making investments in? Are you pretty satisfied with where you are currently? Phil Snow : You mean in terms of more M&A activity? Ato Garrett : Yes, that is a particular area of focus that you are doing a non-M&A based investment whether that is going to be in the CTS business or something else? Phil Snow : Okay, great question. Yes, so we are investing in lots of areas of our business. I would say within the analytics area and this is true for every area that we have done acquisitions we are going to continue to invest heavily in making sure we get the integration done as quickly as possible. So, within our analytics area that means connecting analytics, BISAM and Vermilion together. In our portfolio management and trading workflows, there has been a tremendous progress on integrating Portware with CYMBA with the traditional FactSet workstation. And what you are going to begin to see now after 2 years of that is real product beginning to come to market in FY \u201818 and we are very excited about that. Ato Garrett : Great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Bill Warmington : Good morning, everyone. Phil Snow : Hi, Bill. Bill Warmington : So, I wanted to ask a question about how we should think about the FactSet financial model going forward. It used to be double-digit revenue growth, no margin expansion, 200 basis points of leverage from share repurchases to get to double-digit EPS growth. Now, the industry is more mature, the company\u2019s revenue base is larger and more diversified. Should we think about the new model as mid single-digit organic revenue growth and then maybe margin expansion and buybacks to get us to double-digit EPS growth, how should we look at that? Phil Snow : I will answer that very simply with we are primarily focused on top line growth and we are a growth company and we are maniacally focused on getting the right product mix in there so that we can drive the top line. So, we would love to get back to double-digit growth. We can never sort of tell you when we are going to get there, but our plan is not to be happy with mid single-digits. That being said, we have consistently delivered double-digit EPS growth to the market that\u2019s because we manage our company very well. We are going to continue to do that as well. Bill Warmington : Got it. And then back at the last Investor Day in June last year, we talked about providing some revenue detail possibly in the five categories of analytics, content and technology solutions, Portware, research management solutions, workstations, what do you think about that the timing will be on that? Is that still a goal? Phil Snow : It seems like it\u2019s taken forever for you. Believe it or not, we have made tremendous progress internally, working on this, measuring it. We just need a little bit of time to bund it in to make sure that we have got things measured exceptionally well and we are getting close to having the right kind of workflows and products organized internally. So, we are hoping to provide you more detail shortly, but we don\u2019t want to do it before we are ready. Bill Warmington : Okay, alright. Well, thank you very much. Appreciate the insight. Phil Snow : Sure, yes. Operator : Your next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Toni Kaplan : Hey, good morning guys. Phil Snow : Hi, Toni. Toni Kaplan : Have you seen any positive impacts from the increased demand from Quant investing? Has that driven any growth in the business? And then also just on the growth side in terms of cross-selling you have mentioned it a couple of times on the call like how should we think about like how much opportunity is left across the client base from cross-selling? Thanks. Phil Snow : Okay, good question. Yes, so we have always sold to Quant. And we have done that primarily through our analytics suite. So, we have got some great products like alpha testing and obviously all of the risk models that we have on the system, but we also do that through feed. So, a lot of Quants like to just get the data themselves into their own environment and model off that. So, a lot of what you are seeing in terms of our CTS business, that\u2019s a big piece of that is with the Quants and we are making tremendous investment there to figure out a way to get more alternative data to the Quants in a more sophisticated way. So, that\u2019s a big focus for us in FY \u201818 and we will be able to talk more about that later, but that has been a big piece of our growth historically and we plan to continue to service the needs of the Quants moving forward. And can you remind me the second question that you have? Toni Kaplan : Just how we should think about the cross-selling opportunity like how much is left, how much you have already sort of done? And I know it\u2019s \u2013 yes, go ahead. Phil Snow : It\u2019s massive. So, when we look at how our ASV is distributed like many companies within our top clients, we have a matrix which wouldn\u2019t surprise you where we sort of modeled out for all of our top clients who has each of the 5 or 6 pieces that we have and what\u2019s the opportunity. So, I would characterize this as being at the very beginning of that journey frankly. And as we solved the problem for the bigger clients, we are going to be able to \u2013 I think create simpler versions of that that we can push down market, more efficiently to our entire client base. Toni Kaplan : Okay, got it. And just lastly, could you just give some additional color on their restructuring charges I didn\u2019t really catch what that was related to? Maurizio Nicolelli : So, Toni, this is Maurizio. So, we are constantly reviewing our cost structure internally to really identify efficiencies, especially after doing four acquisitions over the last 12 months. And so in doing so, it ended up \u2013 we ended up having a restructuring process during the fourth quarter and it\u2019s really related to employees at the end of the day. Toni Kaplan : Excellent. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim McHugh with William Blair & Company. Your line is open. TimMcHugh: Thanks. First, I guess just a follow-up on one of the earlier comments about I think you have made a qualitative comment that you hope to see margin improvement. In 2018, is that relative to I guess the fourth quarter number or I guess can you be anymore specific in kind of quantifying what you are comparing it to and I guess what \u2013 how much progress you would hope to make across? Maurizio Nicolelli : Sure. This is Maurizio. So, our guidance for margin was 31% to 32% for our adjusted margin and we came in right around 31.2%, which we believe is it\u2019s fairly the bottom in terms of our margin. We came in at the bottom of the range that we guided to. It\u2019s our belief as we leverage these companies that we have purchased and as we grow the business that there is a potential for improvement to margin during fiscal \u201818 and Phil also previously alluded that we do believe that there is improvement there. And our guidance range for the quarter \u2013 for first quarter is 31% to 32%, but we believe that our margin during the period to be doesn\u2019t have to be at the bottom of that range. We do see gradual increase in our margin during the fiscal year not back to the original FactSet margin a few years ago, I think that will take us a little bit more time to get there, but we do see expansion in our margin during the fiscal year. TimMcHugh: Generally talking about within that range, so you are making the comment I guess the 31% to 32%. Maurizio Nicolelli : Yes. So, I am just making the comment in that range during the first quarter. TimMcHugh: Okay. And just numbers question to follow-up on that as well. The deferred revenue write-off, how much is that still in the first quarter and does that continue much beyond the first quarter related to these acquisitions? Maurizio Nicolelli : So, that\u2019s fairly significant. That\u2019s really related to large amount of deferred revenue adjustment related to FDSG and BISAM. First quarter is very comparable to the fourth quarter and that will be with us for the next 3 years, gradually declining over that period, but it will be with us. TimMcHugh: Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open. Manav Patnaik : Yes, hi. How are you guys doing? Just on the margin comment again, can you just help buy side to think about the FX impact in the last year, so it\u2019s been nice benefit of course? So, can you just give us some color on how much is a headwind or tailwind whatever it is today? Maurizio Nicolelli : Sure, Manav. This is Maurizio. So, FX has been a benefit to us in the previous periods. It\u2019s because we built so much in U.S. dollar. It\u2019s been very good to us. We have always managed our margin around FX. We have never affected the margin from FX and we don\u2019t plan to see that going forward. Should FX become a bigger detriment to us we have the ability to adjust our cost base to still manage to where we want to be in terms of margins going forward. Manav Patnaik : Okay, got it. So, still in that 31%, 32%, got it. And then you guys talked about earlier on the number of I guess cancels slowing down this quarter. I was just hoping you could maybe give a little bit more color on your end on what you are seeing that\u2019s driving that? Is there maybe just a little bit of some sort of seasonality involved, because just from where we are sitting, it feels like longer term the pressures in headcount should continue, but I was just curious what you guys are seeing? Phil Snow : Yes. What I can tell you is that the \u2013 we had less clients completely cancelled, which typically for us means somebody is going out of business. I think it\u2019s very rare that \u2013 or is it\u2019s that somebody is when they completely cancel, they just switched over to someone else role of the workflows and then just the client cancellations from the existing client base that\u2019s pretty comparable to what it was year-over-year. So, I think the biggest uptick we saw there are the biggest benefit we got was less firms cancelling completely. Manav Patnaik : Got it. And then just last one for me, either one of your competitors last quarter talked about a pretty significant investment in their internal systems and so forth to stay compliant with MiFID. And I was just curious if there is any of that that you guys think to do? Phil Snow : No, we don\u2019t need to do that. No, it\u2019s not at all planned right now. Manav Patnaik : Alright. Thanks for that, guys. Phil Snow : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. Joseph Foresi : Hi. As you continue to make the shift in your business, I was wondering could you frame for us what the catalyst or new drivers of the shift would be as opposed to just sort of seats and sustainability of your client? Phil Snow : You mean in terms of the product mix, Joe? Joseph Foresi : Yes. I am looking for sort of maybe giving you an opportunity to reframe what the catalyst will look like going forward? Phil Snow : Sure. So, I mean it\u2019s multifaceted when we think about our business in terms of selling workflows, on the analytics side which has been a huge driver of our growth over the last 10 or 20 years. The integration of BISAM and Vermilion for that suite is really going to open up more opportunities for us at larger clients to solve more problems for them in the performance and risk space. And I would say in portfolio management and trading, the integration of Portware and CYMBA with the FactSet workstation and us having the ability to enter orders and execute orders for more clients with FactSet. That really I think opens up a lot of new opportunity for us in the front office, but what it also does is it links together the research workflow and the analytics workflow that we have had historically. So that I think are \u2013 those are some of the things and I would say the other thing that we are really focused on is making sure that clients consume value from FactSet the way that they want to. So, previously that was really just through the workstation. Historically, we created feeds on a custom basis for clients that wanted a little bit of stuff that we had, but now we are pretty agnostic whether you not want a feed or you want an API from us, you want it through the workstation, the web, mobile, us being able to offer that flexibility to our clients and work with them, I think is a good differentiator for our company. Joseph Foresi : Got it. And then my follow-up on the margins, can we get more color on the specific drivers of margin improvement in FY \u201818 and what should we be watching forward there? What are your levers that you can pull to get the margins going in the right direction? Thanks. Maurizio Nicolelli : Our biggest margin opportunity as we grow the business is really to leverage the overall workforce and also the acquisitions that we have gone over the last 12 months. As we integrate these acquisitions, there is opportunity for us to better leverage ourselves in terms of the overall infrastructure and increased margin going forward throughout the fiscal year. Joseph Foresi : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open. Alex Kramm : Just I appreciate the \u2013 I guess the deferral of waiting for more data to talk about the terminal and non-terminal business. So, I guess we will stay tuned. But I think historically or recently you still talked about how the terminal business is growing relative to the other parts of the business or on the flipside rather how the other parts of the business are growing, I think you said well in the double-digits. Any quantitative or qualitative comments you can make on that part of the business, is it slowing, is it accelerating, is it still double-digits? Anything would be helpful. Phil Snow : Yes. I think in aggregate it\u2019s in the double-digit range. You saw the earlier question around our workstation account growing. So I think that\u2019s probably year-over-year in the 6% to 7% range, but I would say that the ASV attributed to the workstations over the year was less than that just because they were lower priced workstations and kind of the transfer of value to the higher add-on products. So, still very healthy. Alex Kramm : Okay, thank you. And then just for Maurizio, just a quick one here, thanks for the tax impacts from share-based comp you outlined. Can you give a little bit more detail around that from a seasonal perspective? I think for a lot of companies given some of the timing of grants etcetera that can be very lumpy. So, when you look at 2017, was the tax rate lot different throughout the \u2013 throughout the year or any quarters you would point out in particular so we can model better? Maurizio Nicolelli : So, it\u2019s lumpy throughout the year. So, I can\u2019t tell you when, it\u2019s really dependent upon employee exercises, when there is more or less exercises is really what drives that benefit. The one thing I could tell you is we gave you last year\u2019s number, so that you can better model 2018 and we do believe 2018 will be representative comparable to 2017, but to do it on a quarterly basis when it\u2019s really dependent upon employee exercises, it\u2019s very difficult to tell you that. Alex Kramm : So, you don\u2019t think there is a typical seasonal patterns to exercises you would call out? Maurizio Nicolelli : I would not, it really depends on employee exercises and the increase of the stock price at the end of day that really drives employee exercises. Alex Kramm : Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Your line is open. Hamzah Mazari : Thank you. Good morning. The first question is just around execution risk. You are integrating all of these workflow assets. Maybe just give us a sense of how investors should think about execution risk? Is it low, medium, high just any sense of that? Phil Snow : These are smaller companies and we have a dedicated team within FactSet that\u2019s focused on the integration and we have a very senior kind of team on the operations and technology side that have been at FactSet a long time to work with the acquisitions. And I would say that we are all \u2013 the acquisitions that we have done just in terms of culture and working together has been outstanding. So I think we are really optimistic about our ability to execute on that. We have done a ton of work already in terms of getting all the corporate systems integrated \u2013 integrating the teams with each other. We have done a lot of work on the data centers already to get FDSG and Portware sort of into a FactSet environment. We are pumping data into the acquisitions from FactSet. So, we are well on our way. Hamzah Mazari : Great. And just a follow-up question, longer term as you transitioned to more of a workflow company, are there any structural changes that happened in your employee base or sales force, I know you mentioned a shift toward cost of service and that just maybe content generation with where you are today. But longer term, is this the employee base or incentives change as you become more of a workflow business? Phil Snow : We will definitely make some adjustments as we have through our history will evolve, but there is going to be no material change. Hamzah Mazari : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Peter Appert : Good morning, everyone. You may have touched on this already, but just wanted to get your view on this from a product pricing perspective specifically some of your competitors are moving from the pay per password or workstation model to an enterprise licensing model. Do you foresee this as a possible model for FactSet? Phil Snow : Yes, absolutely. It\u2019s a possible model. We have a lot of contracts today with our clients and many of them have a tremendous number of workstations and already have a lot of add-on products. So, as we move to being a workflow company, we are really thinking about okay, just pricing the value of what we are delivering to the clients and again being agnostic to how they get it. So, it will be a transition, but I think you will see us moving further in that direction. Peter Appert : Great, thank you. Phil Snow : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is open. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, good morning and thank you very much for taking my questions. I want to circle back and a couple questions that were asked before. Hey, Phil, just on the lower cancellations year-over-year, are you feeling more of a stabilization in the industry in the base that you are selling into or does it feel like an anomaly. I am just trying to get a sense from you guys, is it just what are you seeing in the industry at large? Phil Snow : It\u2019s a great question. I think as I alluded to earlier we are still seeing some of the trends that we have highlighted on previous calls. The number of cancellations that we see from sort of small clients going out of business and new clients coming on that\u2019s typically on the long-tail. So, we are really just focused on up-selling our existing client base. I think that\u2019s the primary way that we are going to drive ASV. And as I alluded to earlier, I think it\u2019s just \u2013 this is a reflection of the quality of our sales team and the quality of the product mix we have and that we have more to offer our clients now. Shlomo Rosenbaum : So, you feel it\u2019s more of your team adjusting to the end-markets versus any change really into end markets, is that the way to think of it? Phil Snow : I think that\u2019s probably the best way to characterize it. We did see more losses from hedge funds this Q4 than we did previous Q4. So, we are seeing a healthy uptick. We are seeing better performance out of kind of the institutional asset management space and very steady growth in the wealth space. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Got it. And then just going back to a comment that you \u2013 that I think I don\u2019t know if it was you or Maurizio made in terms of long-term optimizing the cost structure. Just is there anything beyond getting the acquisitions back to not impacting the margin of the business or is there really over time you expect that there should be a gradual float up of the margin just as you go ahead and get scale on the business. So, I am trying to understand is, normally it\u2019s been like 30, there was a period of time, there was like 33% to 34% EBIT margins anything above that you invested to drive growth. Is there the potential to float up to 34% to 35%, 35% to 36% or is that not what you are talking about? Maurizio Nicolelli : Yes, Shlomo, it\u2019s Maurizio. So, our current goal is to get our margin back to how you classify 33% to 34% and that will take us 12 to 24 months at minimum to get there. It is our desire to get each of the acquisitions at the FactSet historical margin going forward. And if you look back at the Portware acquisition of 2 years ago, Portware now is very close to the FactSet overall margin whereby when we first purchased them, they had a very, very low margin. And so we are taking the same process today to the most recent acquisitions to get us back to the 33%, 34% that you alluded to for now. Shlomo Rosenbaum : So, was that what the comment was made about over that kind of 12 to 24 months, is that the way we should be thinking about that, but not beyond them? Maurizio Nicolelli : I would \u2013 so, currently that is our plan. And over time as we grow the overall business, we do believe there is more leverage beyond that, but that\u2019s not our \u2013 right now, we are really focused on the acquisitions and getting those acquisitions back to the historical FactSet margin. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Operator : There are no further questions queued up at this time. I turn the call back over to Phil Snow. Phil Snow : Well, thanks everyone for joining us on the call today. If you have additional questions, please call Rima in our Investor Relations department and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator that ends today\u2019s call. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Rima Hyder, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Rima Hyder : Thank you, Jamie and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FactSet\u2019s first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I'd like to point out that the slides we will reference during the course of this presentation can be accessed via the website on the Investor Relations section of our website at factset.com. These slides will be posted on our website at the conclusion of this call. A replay of today\u2019s call will be available via phone and on our website. The conference call is being transcribed in real-time by FactSet\u2019s CallStreet Service and is being broadcast live at FactSet.com. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions from investors. To be fair to everyone, please limit yourself to one question plus a follow-up. Before we discuss our results, I encourage all listeners to review the legal notice on Slide 2, which explains the risks of forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, please refer to our Form 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, the reconciliation to the most directly comparably GAAP measures are in the appendix to the presentation and in our earnings release issued this morning. This non-GAAP information should be considered supplemental in nature and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similarly entitled measures reported by other companies. Joining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer; and Maurizio Nicolelli, Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to now turn the discussion over to Phil. Phil Snow : Thanks, Rima and good morning, everyone and welcome to today's call. At FactSet, we're rapidly responding to the dynamics of market change. Our platform content, award-winning analytics and service, position us well to partner with our clients and to provide innovative workflow solutions to meet the challenges facing our industry head on. The first quarter is generally a lighter quarter for us versus the rest of the year and is really not a good indicator for the full year. We gave you annual guidance this quarter and the midpoint of this guidance indicates higher growth in ASV than you are seeing in our first quarter. And looking out at the remainder of the first half, we feel much better about Q2 ASV than we did for Q2 the same time last year. A quick note on annual guidance and why we made this change. As our business evolves, we've taken a look at our key metrics and the information we provide you and we believe annual guidance more closely aligns the focus of the investment community with the goals of our company. The move to annual guidance has received core shareholder support and Maurizio will provide you more detail during his comments. Let's take a quick look at first quarter results. We saw the continuation of themes from prior quarters, the shift from active to passive, focus on total cost of ownership and ongoing consolidation in the industry. Against this backdrop, we grew organic revenues at 6% and organic ASV at 5% year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 17% to $2.04 and adjusted operating margin was 31.7%, which was within the range we expected. We acknowledge the deceleration in the ASV growth rate this quarter and are laser focused on executing on our strategy to reaccelerate. We saw quite a bit of churn with increased add-on sales and the addition of new clients being offset by cancellations. The increase in ASV this quarter was driven by Analytics in CTS. Within Analytics, we saw strong contribution from risk, portfolio reporting, portfolio of services and fixed income. CTS had a strong quarter with continued momentum around our expanding suite of standard data feeds. Wealth was also a solid performer this quarter. Within the Analytics product, we enhanced our multi-asset class risk offering, adding a linear factor risk model to our existing Monte Carlo model. Clients can now integrate equity, fixed income, alternatives, private assets and currency factors to gain a full transparent view of risk distribution at the portfolio, factor and asset levels, using a Monte Carlo or a linear approach. This increases our competitive positioning in the market and makes us stickier with clients already using our Analytics suite. Turning to our international business. International ASV grew organically by 7%, fueled by growth in the Asia-Pac region. International ASV now represents over 37% of our total ASV. Asia-Pac grew almost 13% with increased analytics and workstation sales to asset managers. Europe ASV grew 5%. Our European segment, which includes both Europe and the Middle East has been impacted by the regulatory environment and political events resulting in delayed purchasing decisions. In terms of integration, we continue to make great progress across products and platforms for all of our acquisitions. FactSet Digital Solutions is progressing ahead of schedule resulting in cost synergies. BISAM product integration is in line with expectations and our integration efforts have opened up tremendous up-selling and cross-selling opportunities with our clients and we see these opportunities today in the pipeline for fiscal 2018 and beyond. Quick note on MiFID II. MiFID II, as we all know is scheduled to take effect in January in Europe, and research is one area where both buy-side and sell-side clients have seen significant change requirements as a result of the MiFID II inducement rules. This has meant pricing models and business practices have had to adapt significantly. We're seeing a substantial interest in our research on bundling solutions, which is part of the opportunity for us, but more importantly, allows our clients to leverage our technology solutions for MiFID II compliance. As far as the sell-side research impact is concerned, sell-side research users are less than 10% of the total users on FactSet. So, we really expect a negative impact from MiFID II to be minimal. In conclusion, as we look to the second quarter and beyond, we believe we have both a healthy sales and product pipeline, giving us the confidence we can achieve a higher topline growth rate as well as delivering double-digit earnings growth and value to our shareholders as we've done consistently for years. Let me now turn it over to Maurizio to talk about our first quarter 2018 financial results and annual 2018 outlook. Maurizio Nicolelli : Thank you, Phil, and good morning to everyone on the call. Before we get into the details of the quarterly results, I want to point out that our GAAP quarter-over-quarter comparisons were impacted by restructuring actions initiated by the company. These actions are a part of our efforts to realize more synergies from the recent acquisitions and leverage the scale of our business. You will see the impact of these actions throughout our results. Additionally, our results also include a positive impact from the adoption of FASB\u2019s ASC 718, which changes the way companies account for employee share-based payment transactions. We told you last quarter that this accounting standard update would be effective for us starting with our fiscal 2018. Let's now go through the first quarter results in more detail. GAAP Revenues in the first quarter increased 14% to 329 million, and 6% to 304 million on an organic basis versus the first quarter of 2017. Looking at our segment revenue, U.S. revenues grew 5% organically primarily as a result of wins from analytics and data feeds products. International revenues increased 7% on an organic basis with strong performance from the Asia pacific region. ASV increased to 1.32 billion at the end of our first quarter. A year ago, we had higher ASV in our first quarter, primarily due to higher trading volumes from our Portware EMS business. Organic ASV increased 5% year-over-year and approximately 1 million since the end of our fourth quarter. This increase was primarily driven by increased sales to existing and new clients, partially offset by higher cancellations. Let\u2019s now take a look at our operating expenses. Operating expenses for the first quarter totaled 240 million, an increase of 21% year-over-year, primarily driven by our recent acquisitions, and the previously mentioned restructuring actions. First quarter cost of services, expressed as a percentage of revenues, increased by 490 basis points compared to the year-ago period. The increase was driven by higher compensation costs, depreciation and amortization expense, and data costs. Higher compensation costs were due to the recent acquisitions, base salary changes and incremental hires in our centers of excellence located in India and the Philippines. SG&A expenses, expressed as a percentage of revenues, were down 60 basis points compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The decrease was primarily the result of foreign exchange hedges and prior year acquisition related costs, partially offset by the current year restructuring actions. Our GAAP operating margin decreased 430 basis points year-over-year to 27.1%, primarily due to the previously mentioned restructuring charges. Adjusted operating margin of 31.7% was lower than last year\u2019s margin of 33%, primarily due to the acquisitions but an improvement from the fourth quarter of 2017 by 50 basis points. We expect to improve our adjusted operating margin as we get through fiscal 2018. Our first quarter effective tax rate was 18.3%, a decrease from 25.9% a year ago, primarily due to a benefit of the aforementioned accounting standard update. Adjusted EPS grew 17% to $2.04. This includes a $0.09 benefit from the accounting standard update. Without this benefit, adjusted diluted EPS would have been $1.95, up 11% versus prior year. Free cash flow, as we define, we define as cash generated from operations, less capital spending, for our first quarter was 55 million, an increase of approximately 17 million or 43% from the same period last year. The increase was due to higher net income, a lower effective tax rate and reduced capital expenditures and timing of certain payments. Excluding recent acquisitions, our DSOs decreased from 37 days at August 31st to 36 days at November 30th. We continued to increase our client count this quarter. Client count increased by 65 resulting in over 4,800 clients. In contrast user count decreased by 253 users to over 88,000 users. The decrease in user count was primarily driven by StreetAccount users which carry a lower ASV versus the average workstation ASV. Moving on to our share repurchase program. We've repurchased 165,000 shares for $31 million during the first quarter under our existing share repurchase program. As of November 30, 2017, approximately $213 million remained for future share purchases under the share repurchase program. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders and maintaining a balanced capital allocation framework. Now, let's turn to our guidance for fiscal 2018. Starting with this quarter, we will discontinue quarterly guidance and provide you with annual guidance. We plan to update you each quarter on the annual guidance we have issued today. We are also introducing ASV guidance for fiscal 2018. Our high and low end of ASV guidance range is predicated on a number of factors. One, stable market conditions. Two, our ability to integrate the acquisitions and offer our clients a true Enterprise solution, and three, continuous product innovation to strengthen our offerings. Organic ASV is expected to increase in the range of $65 million and $85 million over fiscal 2017 implying a growth rate in the range of 4.9% to 6.5%. GAAP revenues are expected to be in the range of $1.34 billion and $1.36 billion. GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 28.5% and 30%. Adjusted operating margin is expected to be in the range of 31% and 32.5%. The annual effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 21% and 22.5%. The tax guidance does account for the stock-based compensation accounting standard update but does not take into account any potential impact from the pending U.S. corporate tax reform bill. We expect that a lowering of the U.S. corporate income tax rate will have a favorable impact on our annual effective tax rate. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $7.60 and $7.80. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $8.25 and $8.45. The midpoint of the adjusted EPS range represents over 14% growth compared to the prior year. Adjusted diluted EPS for the fiscal 2018 includes an estimated $0.26 impact from the stock-based compensation accounting standard update. As Phil said, the first quarter is not an indicator of our full year performance and we have a healthy sales pipeline that we need to execute on to achieve our full year results. We remain confident in our sales strategy; integration plans and product innovation will allow us to grow this year. Thank you for your participation in today's call. We're now ready for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Bill Warmington : Good morning, everyone. So, first question, I wanted to ask was on the ASV growth. You'd mentioned that you were expecting an improvement from first quarter and you've given a range of 4.9% to 6.5%. And I wanted to ask about what gives you the confidence that you are at or near the bottom of the ASV growth and what's going to drive that acceleration for the rest of the year? Phil Snow : Hey, Bill its Phil Snow. Thanks for the question. So, we have pretty good visibility into Q2 and we obviously keep track of that year-over-year, so when we look at how much ASV we've actually booked at this point in Q2 versus the same time last year, it's definitely ahead of that. We have good visibility on our annual price increase, which we expect to execute on and get a little bit more than we did last year. So, all of those things I think kind of lead us to believe that we'll see a reacceleration in Q2 We could possibly get back to the levels that we exited Q4 at of last fiscal year and then we'll just have to execute exceptionally well in the second half to accelerate. But we're confident in our salesforce, as Maurizio stated, and from the acquisitions we've done, it does take time to integrate and to develop new product. But I can tell you that in terms of new product coming to market, I feel much better about our position this year than a lot of the previous years. So we're going to be able to see some things come out that are going to really help our sales teams sell individual solutions as well as the portfolio of lifecycle. So all of those things for us add up to us being confident in the guidance that we gave you for the fiscal year and our thesis for reaccelerating. Bill Warmington : And then for my follow-up question on the 2018 EPS guidance $8.25 to $8.45, I wanted to ask if the U.S. corporate tax reform bill does go through at 21% as expected, what would that EPS look like? Maurizio Nicolelli : So we're still -- Bill, this is Maurizio. So, we're still waiting for the final bill to be put into law. But let me give you a little bit of context. Bill Warmington : I know you wouldn't -- I know you wouldn\u2019t be able to wait. Maurizio Nicolelli : So, if you look at pre-tax income or for FactSet, approximately 40% of that is overseas, so taxed overseas predominantly in the U.K. at around a 17% tax rate. The other 60% is U.S. and that U.S. tax rate today is 35%. If the tax law goes through, that becomes 21% on that piece of pre-tax income and for us, if the law is effective as of January 01, 2018, we'll have a bit of a hybrid tax year this year, whereby the first four months of the fiscal year will be at the old statutory rate in the U.S. and the other eight months will be at the new statutory rate. And then for fiscal '18, we will see the full benefit going forward. So, if you take in those percentages and that mix, you can get to somewhat of a benefit that FactSet will realize going forward. Bill Warmington : Got it. Very helpful. Thank you very much. Maurizio Nicolelli : Potentially. It's not signed yet. Bill Warmington : Thank you very much. Maurizio Nicolelli : Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from Anj Singh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Anj Singh : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First off, I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on the delay in purchasing decisions you referenced? I supposed it's not surprising in light of some of the commentary from a competitor of yours, but just trying to get a sense of how much of this is weighing in your fiscal '18 is the outlook? Is this material? Or is this really getting offset by some of the momentum that you're seeing in your business? Phil Snow : So, I think -- correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you're referring to Europe where we're seeing sort of a delay and a slowdown in purchasing decisions from clients over there as they sort of waiting for it to come out in January. So Europe is an important part of our business. But we have as I mentioned a lot of exciting solutions we can offer around MiFID II and a lot of great product coming to market. So, we're not -- we don't think it's going to have a material impact on the rest of the business. We think we can definitely overcome that. Anj Singh : Okay. Got it. And a follow-up for Maurizio, on the margins, it's nice to see that they've bottomed at 4Q as you'd spoken to last quarter. So just curious where are you getting the lift from? Is it more on the FDSG and the cost side? Or is it more on the buy same side of let\u2019s say higher revenue contribution from these deals? Just any color there, thanks. Maurizio Nicolelli : Yeah, it's a little bit of both. One, FDSG is executing very well on cost synergies, and we're starting to see that uplift in our operating margin and we're starting to see a bit of an uplift on the buy-same side also and that's more revenue-driven. So, it's a little bit of a mix of both and the way we are looking at the operating margin, we see -- we are projecting a steady increase, little by little by each quarter to get back to our historical rates. Anj Singh : Okay. Okay. Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. George Tong : Hi, thanks good morning. Your ASV per customer growth this quarter was relatively flat. Can you discuss your initiatives and progress in selling more solutions per client given your expanded offering of workflows? Phil Snow : Yeah, absolutely. So, hi, George this is Phil. I'll start with our very largest client. So, we've actually created a specialized team now within sales called our strategic client group which focuses on our very largest accounts and we've had some very good conversations with them about our entire offering, talking about our product roadmap, really using them as lighthouse accounts to sort of also help guide us in terms of what they would like to see as a group in terms of integration. So, our strategy is resonating with them. Our salesforce\u2019s and our executive team is beginning to have conversations at a higher and higher level in these firms, and I think our solutions combined with the flexibility of our platform and the strength of our content lead us to -- feel that we can really do well within these larger accounts, and as we build-out solutions for them, cascade that down through the rest of the client base. George Tong : Very helpful. And then, as a follow-up, can you \u2013 I know you touched on this earlier, but elaborate on what you're hearing from clients on the expected impact of MiFID, specifically around spending and headcount trends and how much of an impact from MiFID do you think was reflected in results this quarter and how do you expect that impact to evolve over the next two to four quarters? Phil Snow : So, for us, as I stated, I think the impact we're seeing in Europe is just in delayed purchase decisions. The impact on our business in terms of our research offering, I think is positive. So, as I indicated, less than 10% of our users are sell-side research users. In fact, that user-base has actually been growing healthy over the last 12 months. We've been adding users in sell-side research and taking market share there. So \u2013 and we have very few clients now, I think, that pay us in soft dollars. So, net-net, we view it as a positive. The negative for us right now is, I think, the uncertainty within the client base, particularly in Europe, about how this is going to affect them and they're taking a little bit more of a cautious approach. George Tong : Very helpful. Thank you. Phil Snow : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Toni Kaplan : Thank you. Good morning. Phil, I think you mentioned and correct me if I'm wrong, that you were seeing additional demand for unbundled solutions. What specifically? Is that data feeds and is that at the expense of workstations? I just wanted to understand that comment a little bit better. Phil Snow : Sure. So, as you know, we've developed a very good off platform business driven by us transitioning to being a content company and the latest wave of that really is a standardizing the feeds that we have out there so that clients can consume a lot of them and have them tied very closely to each other, which is one of FactSet's core strengths. So, we're thinking about or we are executing on a strategy to be more flexible with our clients, so a good example would be, if you wanted an API into one of our Analytics engines, we're having conversations with clients and partners around that and are pretty close to releasing something that would allow a client that wanted to do something that traditionally they've needed to do in the FactSet Workstation within a different environment that they are constructing. So, we don't view this at all as cannibalistic. We actually view it as accretive. Our clients are telling us they still want to use many components of the FactSet Workstation, but us being open in terms of our approach and providing flexibility will get us to be an Enterprise solution. We don't live in a world now where everybody needs a terminal in front of them of some sort or other and we think this is a big competitive advantage for us versus some of our bigger competitors. Another great example is something we call FactSet Views, so you can actually take any component of the FactSet Workstation if you wanted to, and deploy that within a different environment by itself. So that's another example of unbundling. So, the two I just mentioned are views of API, and we're just thinking about this in a lot of different dimensions now as we see our industry evolve. Toni Kaplan : Got it. And then, I know you mentioned that you're expecting to get normal pricing this year. I think typically in the past; the gross price increases I believe are about 3%. Is that sort of where you're expecting to be at this year? That would be helpful. Thanks. Maurizio Nicolelli : Hey, Toni, it's Maurizio. Yes, exactly, it's 3% on those clients that are eligible within their contracts to get the price increase for the year. And that's the U.S. Toni Kaplan : Thanks a lot. Yep. Thanks. Maurizio Nicolelli : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. Your line is open. Hamzah Mazari : Good morning. Thank you. The first question is just, if you could just broadly characterize just the end markets. We had talked about stabilization in the end market, but it feels like client cancellations were up a bit. Maybe just any color. Is the client cancellation an impact of buy-side consolidation or this is just normal churn in the business? Just any sense of what you're seeing there in terms of the end market? Phil Snow : Yeah. I'd say we saw a little bit more churn this Q1 than we did last Q1. We sold more products and we added more clients, but on the flip side, we saw more smaller firms go out of business and so on, so that offset each other. So, the trend that we've been talking about now for a couple of years in terms of active to passive, total cost of ownership and so on, they're still with us. I think we're executing well in this environment and a lot of the churn you see is really up in smaller accounts. It's typically hedge funds or smaller asset managers that are underperforming versus passive strategies. Hamzah Mazari : Got you. And just a follow-up, you had referenced a potential change in your pricing model longer-term to an enterprise-wide system from seat-based. Maybe any thoughts in terms of timing of that and then sort of anything we should expect in terms of disruption there? Is that going to be a pretty seamless process? Any big picture color there would be helpful. Phil Snow : So, we're taking a very careful look at our pricing. We've had a few different pricing models at FactSet over the last couple of decades and it\u2019s been a very flexible pricing model, but to scale our business, we think we need to simplify that a little bit more for our salesforce and the clients. So, we're really getting down to the atomic level on some of the workstation packages we have as well as add-ons and that will in turn build up to an enterprise pricing model over time. But I would not expect us to be out in the next quarter or two. I would expect to see the impact of this over a longer time period. Now, we are talking with some of our larger clients that have big deployments with FactSet already about enterprise pricing for those are probably going to be a little bit more custom as we build up this more structured scalable model. Hamzah Mazari : Great. Thank you. Phil Snow : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open. Manav Patnaik : Yeah, hi. Good morning. The first question I wanted to just hash out a bit more is your assumptions of stable market conditions in your guidance and maybe even a little bit more narrowly, it sounds like with the MiFID impact I think on the sell-side you're seeing assumptions are just deferred, I guess, deal signing as opposed to maybe any headcount reductions something, I just want to clarify that. And I guess, it seems like you\u2019re not assuming any impact on the buy-side from the MiFID stuff because it does add more P&L pressure to them, right? Phil Snow : Yeah. So, I think I'm just going to go back to the previous statements. The feedback that we're getting from our team in Europe is that decisions are getting delayed, which is causing some of the impact, but I wouldn't focus too much on MiFID II as it relates to FactSet. I think our broader opportunity is outside of that. It's something that we'll navigate through and that we're very focused on creating solutions for. One thing we've done over the last two quarters is really filled out our regulatory team, so we've hired quite a few experts from the marketplace in terms of risk, legal, compliance to really think about as new regulations come out how we can create more solutions for our clients, so we see this as a Greenfield opportunity for us as a company and in terms of our exposure to MiFID II right now, we think we've got a good balance there. So, as I mentioned, we've got good penetration in sell-side research. We're taking market share, if buy-side clients decide to bring more of the research in-house, we feel that we have, I mean, that's one of our strongest segments is buy-side research. We're set to really capitalize on that if they feel they want to do more of that and consume less of it from the sell-side. Manav Patnaik : Okay. Got it. And then Maurizio just on the tax color you gave us, that was helpful but just to follow-up on that. I mean, I guess there are no, I'm sure like you take the R&D tax credit. I'm sure you use some other credits around. Are any of those lost or will it just simply be that reduced number you sort of gave us that math to? Maurizio Nicolelli : So, from what we have read, the R&D still will be a benefit to FactSet, which is significant for us. There are a number of a few other minor items that will go against us in this new plan, but it seems that for the most part, it's fairly clean but again, we have to thoroughly go through, but that's what we have seen so far. So, the largest one is the R&D, we believe that is included so we will still get that benefit. There's some minor items that will hurt us a little bit potentially. Manav Patnaik : Okay. Got it. Thanks a lot, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is open. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, good morning, thank you for taking my questions. Hey, Phil, you talked a little bit about increased churn in the quarter and the one thing that's in the press release that's heightened increased churn on StreetAccount subscriptions. Is it particularly StreetAccount, or is it more across the base or what exactly is going on with StreetAccount that you'd have more cancellations there versus some of the other products you're having? Phil Snow : So that's a good question, Shlomo. For those of you that don't know the history, when we acquired StreetAccount they have an excellent standalone web product and that's one of the few kind of web products that FactSet kept. We also did a massive push to integrate StreetAccount within our workstation it's in a big piece of our client base. So, even though the individual licenses are down for the web-only product, the adoption of StreetAccount within our client base is actually very high. The usage of it is way higher than it was last year, as we continue to invest in the product. These are typically very low-priced seats relative to the traditional FactSet workstation. In fact, in Q1, we saw a positive ASV from StreetAccount web, so it's likely that we lost some users at a lower price point and added users back at a higher price point, so I really wouldn't read too much into that. The other thing that we used to have was a dedicated salesforce selling StreetAccount web products and that team has now been integrated into the broader FactSet salesforce. That may also have had somewhat of an impact there, but it's not material in terms of ASV, in terms of how it's affecting us either way. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Thank you. And then could you just maybe delve in a little bit more to the ASV deceleration? It seems that you had an acceleration last quarter, deceleration this quarter. Is it just it's a lighter sales quarter in general or could you just give us a little sense, is there something changing in the end markets that is moving quarter-to-quarter? Is last quarter the anomaly? Is this quarter the anomaly? We're clearly just trying to gauge the trends verses what you're seeing in the ground. Phil Snow : Sure, it's good. So yeah, if you look back, Q1 for us is traditionally our lightest quarter. It's not a good indicator of the full-year. In fact, our salesforce is really more gold on hats rather than quarters and as I spoke earlier we feel much better about Q2, which is a much bigger quarter for us than Q1 every year than we did at the same time last year, so in terms of the half versus last year, we feel good about that and we fully expect to for our growth rate to accelerate in Q2. Shlomo Rosenbaum : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open. Alex Kramm : Hi, good morning, everyone. Just wanted to come back to the ASV guidance for this year and the visibility that you have. I think you answered earlier that obviously you have a lot of visibility in the second quarter and you feel good about that. But if I think back, I think when you do new signings often when you displace a competitor you'll get that term away for free for a year so you should have a little bit of visibility even beyond the second quarter. So, do you have a number or any sort of anything that you can share with us, how much of the ASV for the full-year is already kind of baked in beyond the second quarter? Phil Snow : Yeah, I'm not sure where you got your give a terminal away for a free and charge for it later, so yeah, we typically have very good visibility out 90 days. It is a little bit harder to predict the full-year, just sort of given what could or could not happen in the marketplace, so we gave you a good range for the year. We feel very good about that range and we're confident in our salesforce and strategy and if we get good up-tick with some of the new products that we're coming out with, I think we're hoping to be at the midpoint or above that for the year. Alex Kramm Okay, fair enough, and then maybe just on the cost side, employee count jumped a lot year-over-year. I know that a lot of that is the acquisitions, but can you talk about maybe Maurizio about the expectation for employee count from here throughout the year considering that I think part of the margins the way it was synergies with these integrations. Thank you. Maurizio Nicolelli : Yeah, so if you, this is Maurizio. So, if you look at our headcount growth over the last 12 months, it\u2019s been fairly significant but at 8% plus but if you really look -- if you peel out the acquisitions, headcount grew 2.6% during the period and the next 12 months we see something very similar. We'll be gauging headcount growth very similar to ASV growth, probably at the lower end in terms of ASV growth, so if we have ASV growth somewhere in the 5% range, we will have headcount growth somewhere lower than that in line with the last 12 months. Alex Kramm : So, we shouldn't expect employee count to actually drop considering that you probably have overcapacity right now? Maurizio Nicolelli : I wouldn't say we have overcapacity. I think it will be in line with ASV growth or slightly below it. And then what we have done historically. Alex Kramm : All right. Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. Mike Reid : Hi, guys this is Mike Reid on for Joe. I appreciate you taking our question. Can you give us some more detail on the restructuring charges taken and maybe when and where we could see the associated benefits? Maurizio Nicolelli : Yeah, so it's Maurizio. So, we had sizable restructuring efforts both in Q4 and in Q1, it's really related to two things. One, us reviewing the overall cost base of the company and trying to streamline it and becoming more efficient and then also reviewing our acquisitions and seeing where there's opportunity to remove costs going forward. I think you've seen quite a bit over the last couple of quarters. I think you'll still see some of that going forward but at a much lower \u2013 at a lower rate than what you've seen this quarter and the previous quarter. Mike Reid : Okay. Thanks. And then on the remaining benefit from the accounting change to be seen this year, do you think that will probably be spread evenly over the remainder of the year, will there be any seasonality to that or can you not tell at this point? Maurizio Nicolelli : It's difficult to tell because it's really driven off when employees exercise. If you look at the benefit that we have included in the year, in our projections it's very similar to last year. But it's very difficult to determine which quarter will have more or less and it's another reason why we went to annual guidance, because we believe the number that we have out there for the annual is right around what we believe will be for the year and I think that's the reason why we've gone with annual guidance because it helps us better gauge it and also give the best estimate that we can give. Mike Reid : Okay. Yeah. That makes sense. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from David Chu with Bank of America. Your line is open. David Chu : Hi. Thank you. So, can you just give us an update on how non-terminal revenue performed in the quarter? Just wanted to see if collectively they're still growing double-digits and if you're seeing any changes to the trend versus recent quarters? Phil Snow : So, hi, David it's Phil. If you're referring to the CTS business, yeah, it's definitely growing in double-digits and had an exceptionally strong Q1 and looks to be having a good Q2. David Chu : Yeah, I mean speaking more broadly to kind of everything that's non-terminal, so Analytics, CTS, Portware, like RMS, collectively is that growing double-digits? Phil Snow : I don't know if we've done the full math on that this quarter but I would say not given that we're growing at around 5%. The Analytics suite was a big contributor to the quarter. We sold a lot of Analytics product. Portware we closed a couple of institutional clients, big clients but it does take time for the transactional revenue and Portware to build up when you sign the new clients. So, we're really encouraged that we continue to close more of those. And we also closed our first FactSet EMS clients in the quarter. So FactSet EMS is a more configurable \u2013 or sorry, a less configurable version of Portware meaning that it's not a fully customized solution. What we've created there is something that's scalable, that the general salesforce can go out and sell. It's easier to support and the implementation time is severely reduced from the larger sort of custom Enterprise solution for Portware, so that's definitely an exciting product that we're anticipating over time will have a good impact for us. David Chu : Okay. Thanks. And in terms of a follow-up, so ASV for the sell-side continues to weaken despite strong deal-related activity. So, can you just describe what you're seeing more broadly? Phil Snow : On the sell-side? David Chu : Yeah, on the sell-side. Phil Snow : So, I think we're continuing to see pressure that we're seeing on the buy-side just in terms of total cost of ownership. We've seen good penetration of the FactSet terminal and we do face some competitive pressure there in terms of one of our clients, one of our competitors going out and essentially bundling a lot of their solutions together and essentially forcing clients to take more product than typically they would want. David Chu : Okay. Thank you very much. Phil Snow : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Kevin Barker : Hi, Phil and Maurizio. This is Kevin talking for Peter Appert. How are you guys doing? Phil Snow : Good. Maurizio Nicolelli : Great. Go for it. Kevin Barker : So, a lot of your competitors are moving from paperwork station or paper password pricing models to an Enterprise one. Any updates from your last quarter earnings call on your progress moving towards this model, if you wish platforms and products might inherit that pricing model if you do choose to implement them into your product? Phil Snow : Yeah, so I think I answered that in some amount of detail already on this call. So, when we think about Enterprise pricing for our very largest clients, we've got solutions going from research, portfolio management and trading through to analytics. So, once we have all of those into components that are easy to roll up into an Enterprise pricing model, we can do that. So, it's going to take a little bit of time. We do think in the meantime though that for some of the acquisitions that we've done, we can go in and create new packages for analytics, for PMT, for research as we step towards true enterprise pricing. Kevin Barker : Okay. Thank you. Phil Snow : Sure. Kevin Barker : And my second question is regarding some competitive dynamics in the marketplace. Are there any changes that you're seeing in the marketplace that might add pressure to your topline next quarter, three quarters? Phil Snow : Not really. I think it's the same competitors that you would expect for us and within different segments of our business, we compete with different firms out there and by and large we view it all as opportunity for FactSet. We were very confident in our strategy. We're confident in our salesforce and we believe that our approach in terms of working with our clients and the flexibility of our platform make us the long-term winner. Kevin Barker : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ato Garrett with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Ato Garrett : Good morning. I have another question relating to full-year guidance on ASV. You said that you feel pretty strongly about the pipeline and what things look like in 2Q. Then previously you said that you really weren't happy with mid-single-digits growth for ASV. I'm just trying to get a sense of, is this a new normal for the business looking at that ASV growth at about 6% or do you think there's ways to really push above it as we think about where the business is and where the end markets are and the pressure associated with it? Phil Snow : Yeah, I definitely think there's ways to push above it. So, we can't control the end markets, but what we can control is the product that we produce and how we partner with our clients. So, all of the work we've done over the last couple of years in terms of the acquisition, getting them integrated, creating new product that's really beginning to come to market now, and I think that combined with our open platform really gives us the thesis we need to get back to high single-digits and hopefully eventually double-digit growth. Ato Garrett : Okay. But that \u2013 certainly with the given guidance that doesn't seem like something on the horizon for this year, if I'm understanding, but long term\u2026? Phil Snow : No. Not \u2013 based on the guidance, no. We're hoping to reaccelerate. We think we have a good plan to do that but again it's hard to tell three quarters out for us exactly. Ato Garrett : Okay. Great. And then you mentioned that MiFID you see as really as an opportunity going forward and recently, you announced you admit you had a partnership to look at, multi-asset class, best execution. So just thinking about your existing product portfolio as it relates to MiFID, do you feel that's pretty robust or are you going to be looking to make more partnerships so you can offer a complete solution to clients for MiFID compliance? Phil Snow : Yeah. We're really, I think, at the beginnings of it. So, we have a good solution for research, in terms of research unbundling. Some of that's our own product. Some of it's in partnership with Liquidnet and ONEaccess. For our Portfolio Management and Trading capabilities, we have stuff that's MiFID compliant for best execution and the new product that we'll be bringing to market will also be MiFID compliant. Ato Garrett : Great. Thank you. Phil Snow : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Peter Heckmann with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Peter Heckmann : Good morning, everyone. Wanted to follow-up on the content or data streams business. Prior to you entering that market there were a number of scale providers, and so I'm just trying to get a better idea what's the competitive advantage there? Is it better delivery, cleaner data, better pricing? What's allowing you to gain share from some of the incumbents? Phil Snow : So, I would say the main advantage we have with our data feed business has to do with the concordance of data. So, one of the things FactSet does exceptionally well is take all kinds of structured and unstructured content and link it together for our workstation and what we've been able to do is take that underlying entity data map and expose that to clients so all of our feeds will link to that. So of course, you could get all of these feeds from different people, but one of FactSet's competitive advantages and value-adds has always been the integration of data. It's how we started our company and that's really what we're focused on in terms of delivering feeds to the marketplace. So, if you're a quant or any type of user, you want to know the connections between the datasets to look for alpha and to gain intelligence, and that's what we're doing in our feed business and as we accelerate the on-boarding of alternative datasets, which we're focused on, we plan to apply that same methodology that we always have, so that as well as the community of users on FactSet for us spell a real advantage in this area. Peter Heckmann : Okay. That's helpful. And then, given your success there, should we expect to see FactSet rolling out more evaluated pricing-type solutions, potentially some proprietary ones? Phil Snow : We're not currently focused on that. Some of the underlying ingredients for that we don't own ourselves, so we're focused on other types of data at the moment. Peter Heckmann : Thank you. Phil Snow : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim McHugh with William Blair & Company. Your line is open. Tim McHugh : Hi. Yes, thanks. First, I just thought earlier there was a comment about pricing and I thought you said you hoped to capture more than you did even last year, but then I thought later you said you're pushing to the same rate increase. So, could you just, kind of, I guess, clarify or elaborate on, is the pricing any different than you were pushing previously? Maurizio Nicolelli : No, so it's very similar to last year. It's Maurizio, by the way. It's very similar to last year, 3% on clients that are eligible to get a price increase going forward. And so, when we look at the price increase this year given that our client base has grown, we're seeing a bit of growth in that price increase overall in total ASV for Q2. It's really a function of the business just being bigger than 12 months ago. Tim McHugh : Okay. So, percentage wise no different? Maurizio Nicolelli : Correct. Tim McHugh : That's fair. All right. All right. And on margins, the other maybe clarifying comment. I think you talked about kind of hoping to sequentially improve margins from here, but if I look at the guide kind of your fiscal Q1 was right at the middle of the range you gave for the year, which implies up and downsize as to where you are at in Q1. So, can you, I guess, square those two things? Why the lower end of the guide there if you expect sequential improvement/ Phil Snow : The guide is a range. Right? It's going to have a low end and a high end. We are modeling and projecting the company to increase gradually on a quarter-by- quarter basis and at the top end of that range is 32.5% and our goal is to get to the upper end of that range as we progress through the rest of the fiscal year. Tim McHugh : Are there any particular factors other than I imagine obviously revenue growth rates, but would make you include kind of or make you think about the risk of lower sequential trends? Phil Snow : There's always risk, right? Just like in our ASV guidance, our ASV guides at 65 million to 85 million. Right? There is risk on both ends and so in our margin guidance, again, it's risk on both sides of the guidance. The 31% would be affected if for some reason we slowed in revenue or we had to increase our expenses for some unforeseen reason. Operator : Your next question comes from Glenn Greene from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Glenn Greene : Thank you. Just a couple of follow-ups. I wanted to first, Phil on the MiFID topic. You're sort of framing it as a sort of a limited impact because the sell-sides, I think you said 10% of your seats. I just want to get a little bit more color in your thinking around why there wouldn't be perhaps a buy-side impact as there's perhaps going to be shrinking their budgets and why that wouldn't be a concern for you? Phil Snow : So sure. If they're shrinking their budgets, it means they have less money to spend with firms like FactSet and our competitors, so obviously that would be one factor that would put pressure on us and it will just be up to us to execute on if they're lowering their research budgets to penetrate those firms in other ways. So, it\u2019s a net-net I think we've got a very distributed portfolio of solutions. Research is one area for us, but a huge piece of our business is Portfolio Management and Trading, Analytics. We have our off-platform business now our wealth business. I think we're bullish on our overall chances and MiFID II is something that everyone is navigating through and we're focused on it as a company. Glenn Greene : Okay. And then you talked about churn which has been sort of an ongoing issue over various quarters. I just wanted to sort of frame it. Is it sort of comparable to what it\u2019s been the last few quarters, did it get somewhat worse, maybe contrast the buy and sell-side? Obviously, heard your comments on StreetAccounts, but was wondering if it was broader than that? Phil Snow : So it was a little bit more pronounced than Q1 of last year but again, Q1 is a small quarter, so I would say that it was just there were a few more cancellations than we saw in Q1 of last year, but we offset that with more add-on business, so and the stuff that's really sticking with our clients is our value-added analytics things that I think -- as we move forward we'll be stickier within the client base than our traditional FactSet workstation. Operator : Your last question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Keith Housum : Good morning, gentlemen. Maurizio, just a question for you on tax reform and I appreciate the color on the annual impact. Is there also going to be a one-time impact in terms of bringing back some of those earnings either deemed or actual? And could that have an impact on your cash flow going forward the rest of the year? Maurizio Nicolelli : So, there's a pole tax from what we've read that we would have to pay on earnings and cash and investments overseas. That is payable over eight years if we choose to pay it over eight years and again, this is all that we have read. We haven't seen the final law, so I don't think that will have a material effect on our cash flow. Keep in mind if that does get enacted then there's quite a bit of cash that FactSet has overseas that can come back to the U.S. that becomes more available to us. Keith Housum : Okay. Great. And then foreign exchange is, obviously, been moving quite a bit over the past year. What impact on EPS are you guys baked in there for I guess the change that we've seen in FX so far, this year? Maurizio Nicolelli : So, FX during the first quarter had minimal impact. It was actually a slight benefit to us because we have some very favorable hedges in place. Going forward, there's a slight detriment to our overall cost base but still very manageable, just within our overall cost structure, so we don't see a material impact even as rates have gone against us a bit over the last three to six months. Keith Housum : Great. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Phil Snow for closing remarks. Phil Snow : So, thanks, everyone for joining us on our call. If you didn't see it, we mentioned in our press release that we plan to have an Investor Day on April 17th in New York and the details of this event will be released in early calendar 2018, so we hope to see many of you there and if you have additional questions, please call Rima Hyder and we look forward to seeing you again next quarter. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Joining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer; and Maurizio Nicolelli, Chief Financial Officer. Now, I'd like to turn the discussion over to Phil. Phil Snow : Thank you, Rima. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call today. This past quarter, we executed well on our product and growth strategy. And while we\u2019re pleased with the results, we continue to be aware of the difficult market and the cost pressures our clients face. We remain focused on executing on our plans for fiscal year '18 and expect to end the year within our ASV guidance range. Turning to second quarter results, we saw new wins across our product portfolio in the U.S., Europe and Asia. We grew organic revenues and organic ASV at 6% year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 17% to $2.12 boosted by the U.S. tax reform. While the tax reform increased our tax rate this quarter due to one-time items, overall, we expect additional cash savings for the rest of the fiscal year and we continue to evaluate our plans to utilize the additional cash in fiscal year '18 and beyond. In our press release this morning, we announced our plans to increase our share repurchase program by $300 million taking advantage of the $100 million in cash that we plan to repatriate from overseas. We also plan to invest a portion of cash savings into both our product and sales efforts. This will have an impact on our full year adjusted operating margin and we believe we will end the year closer to the middle of our guidance range for adjusted operating margin. This quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 31.4%, slightly lower than our first quarter and last year as it was impacted by higher FX costs which Maurizio will go into, into more detail. Now let\u2019s get into the drivers of ASV. The increase in ASV this quarter was primarily driven by analytics, CTS and portfolio management and trading. Analytics added more than 50% of the net increase in ASV this quarter. Within analytics we saw strong contribution from portfolio analytics, risk, fixed income and portfolio services. The product enhancements of our multi-asset class risk offering in the first half of FY 2018 allowed us to increase our competitive positioning in the market and secure important global wins. CTS had another strong quarter continuing to grow in double digits year-over-year. The FactSet data feeds business contributed globally with major sales across asset managers and hedge funds. The demand for data feeds continues to be driven by a renewed rise in quantitative research across more of our client base. We have plans to capitalize on this shift by extending our data feeds business allowing more investment professionals from around the world to connect with smarter data, and there\u2019s more to come on this new initiative in the coming weeks and at our upcoming Investor Day next month. This quarter, we saw an uptick in ASV from new business and offsetting these wins we saw cancellations but to a lesser degree than the prior year. Most of the cancellations were due either to firm closures or consolidation of services leading to redundancies. With this, client cancels driven by firm closures were on par with last year. We also saw less churn in the existing client base year-over-year. And while cancellations decreased this quarter, we believe they will remain a recurring theme through the second half of the year. Turning to our Americas and international businesses. Our U.S. organic ASV growth rate was 5% fueled by sales of analytics and CTS, primarily to institutional asset managers. International ASV grew organically by 7% as a result of growth in the Asia Pacific region. International ASV now represents 38% of our total ASV. Asia Pac grew over 13 and Europe grew 5%. In Asia Pac, we saw an increase in new business to asset managers with our analytics products, in particular our risk products. Our European segment, which includes both Europe and the Middle East, delivered solid results in the second quarter of 2018 versus the same period in 2017 following a weak first quarter of 2018. Some of the major wins in Europe were from fixed income products where we displaced our main competitors. Additionally, we saw a recurring theme of successes from risk analytics products. We continue to make good progress integrating the products and platforms across all of our acquisitions. These efforts have begun to open up tremendous up-selling and cross-selling opportunities. For example, the powerful combination of Cognity\u2019s risk engine which is part of the BISAM acquisition and our existing multi-asset class risk offering drove a key win at Alberta Investment Management, one of Canada\u2019s largest institutional investment managers this quarter. In the second quarter, we made progress against another important milestone in our portfolio of lifecycle strategy by linking official performance returns generated from the BISAM B-One engine into our portfolio analytics suite. This strengthens an important link between front and middle office users within our buy-side clients. And we continue to make good progress integrating CYMBA, our order management system with Portware, our execution management system building our broader OEMS functionality. In conclusion, going into the second half of the year, we continue to push for higher growth and to deepen our relationships with clients. We\u2019re excited with the breadth of our product suits and the ability to provide an increasing number of workflow and content solutions to the investment community. While we are laser focused on our growth strategy, we remain committed to returning value to our shareholders demonstrated by the increase in our buyback program. Over the last five years and including year-to-date and fiscal '18, we\u2019ve returned $2 billion to our shareholders with share repurchases and dividends. Let me now turn the call over to Maurizio to talk about our second quarter financial results and the revised 2018 annual outlook. Maurizio Nicolelli : Thank you, Phil, and good morning to everyone on the call. As you saw in our press release this morning, we changed our EPS and tax guidance as a result of the U.S. tax reform. We also increased our share repurchase program by 300 million as we plan to bring back 100 million in cash from overseas. I will go through these in more detail in a few minutes. Let\u2019s now go through the second quarter results. GAAP revenues in the second quarter increased 14% to 335 million, and 6% to 310 million on an organic basis versus the second quarter of 2017. Looking at our segment revenue, U.S. revenues grew 5% organically and international revenues increased 7% on an organic basis with strong performance from the Asia Pac region. This growth comes primarily as a result of higher sales from our analytics and data feeds products. ASV increased to 1.35 billion at the end of our second quarter. Organic ASV increased 6% year-over-year and over 25 million at the end of our first quarter. This increase was primarily driven by higher cross sales and new business, partially offset by cancellations. Additionally, this quarter we also implemented our annual Americas price increase which added about 10 million to ASV. This was slightly higher than our price increase last year. Let\u2019s now take a look at our operating expenses. Operating expenses for the second quarter totaled 240 million, an increase of 18% year-over-year, primarily driven by the acquisitions of BISAM and FDSG which were purchased in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Our GAAP operating margin decreased 270 basis points year-over-year to 28.5% primarily due to the previously mentioned higher acquisition costs and a negative impact from foreign currency. Adjusted operating margin of 31.4% was lower than last year\u2019s margin of 33.1%. Without the negative impact of FX this quarter, adjusted operating margin would have been 31.7%. Second quarter cost of services expressed as a percentage of revenues increased by 400 basis points compared with the year-ago period. The increase was driven by higher employee costs, data cost and amortization of intangible assets, primarily driven by the BISAM and FDSG acquisitions. Higher employee costs were due to merit increases in the last 12 months, increased hiring and the impact of foreign currency. SG&A expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues were down 130 basis points compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The decrease was primarily the result of foreign exchange hedging gains and higher revenues while holding SG&A expenses constant. Moving on to the tax rate. The U.S. tax reform had various impacts on our effective tax rate this quarter. The federal corporate tax rate was lowered to 21% from 35% which favorably impacted our tax rate. However, there were certain one-time charges that offset this benefit and elevated our overall quarterly tax rate. Keep in mind that our fiscal year end is August 31st, so the change to the federal corporate tax rate result in a blended federal statutory tax rate for fiscal year 2018. Our second quarter effective tax rate was 42.4%, an increase from 25.5% a year ago primarily due to the one-time tax expense items related to the U.S. tax reform. These one-time items totaled 23 million were primarily related to the toll tax that we have to pay on unremitted foreign earnings and a tax expense associated with our deferred tax asset revaluation. Excluding these one-time expense items, but including the stock compensation accounting standard update, our current annual effective tax rate is 17.6%. GAAP EPS decreased to $1.33 this quarter versus $1.68 in the second quarter of 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to the one-time tax charges I just mentioned. Excluding these one-time tax charges and other items, adjusted EPS grew 17% to $2.12. Free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations, less capital spending, for our second quarter was 86 million, an increase of approximately 15 million or 20% from the same period last year. The increase was due to higher net income, a lower effective tax rate, reduced capital expenditures and timing of certain payments.  Moving on to our share repurchase program, we repurchased 420,000 shares for 82 million during the second quarter under our existing share repurchase program. We also expanded our share repurchase program by another 300 million. Including this expansion, approximately 431 million remains for future share repurchases. We intend to spend between 325 million and 375 million over the next 12 months on our share repurchases. This increase of approximately 100 million to the annual spend on share repurchases is due to the planned repartition of foreign earnings. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders and maintaining a balanced capital allocation framework. Now let's turn to guidance for fiscal 2018. We are confirming the guidance that we gave you in the first quarter for organic ASV, revenue and adjusted operating margin. Our annual effective tax rate and EPS guidance is updated due to the tax reform and we are also updating our GAAP operating margin for fiscal 2018. Our GAAP operating margin is now expected to be in the range of 27.5% to 29%. Our full year outlook for 2018 was impacted by higher than expected year-to-date nonrecurring expenses. As a result of the tax reform and the lowering of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate, FactSet\u2019s annual effective tax rate is now expected to be in the range of 18% and 19.5%. This rate excludes the one-time tax items that I previously mentioned but includes the impact from the stock-based compensation accounting change. GAAP diluted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $6.95 and $7.15. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $8.35 and $8.55. The updated guidance includes the impact of the U.S. tax reform. The midpoint of the adjusted EPS range represents 16% growth over the prior year. As we enter the second half of the year, we are confident that we will continue to take market share and provide value to our shareholders and clients. Thank you for your participation in today's call. We're now ready for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Bill Warmington : Good morning, everyone. Phil Snow : Good morning. Bill Warmington : So in your opening remarks you talked about a number of wins and I wanted to know if you could talk a little bit about the acceleration that you saw on the buy-side ASV specifically and how much of that is being driven by the lower buy-side churn versus Q1 and how much is actually being driven by new product sales or something else? Phil Snow : Yes. Hi, Bill. It\u2019s Phil Snow. It\u2019s a combination of both. I think the most exciting thing for us really is the continued adoption of our value-added product suite. So as I mentioned in my opening remarks, the analytics suite added well over a half of this quarter\u2019s incremental ASV and that product suite contributed to the specific win that I mentioned in Canada and a whole host of other wins. A lot of that is fueled by the fact that in the first quarter, we released three risk models. So we put a lot of work into that and that is definitely helping along with all the other great products that are within analytics. And when we look at cancellations from last year within the existing client base, there were a lot less of them than there were last year. So that definitely helped with sort of $10 million increase that you saw in this Q2 versus the same quarter a year ago. Bill Warmington : And for a follow up, I wanted to ask about the competitive landscape. There have been a number of developments over the past few months and I want to see if you were having \u2013 if you were seeing any impact from Blackstone's investment in Thomson Reuters, Capital IQ SNL's enterprise pricing strategy? And then kind of throwing this one in there in terms of S&P\u2019s acquisition of Kensho in the sense that they\u2019re trying to accelerate the A.I. use across the business lines including the Capital IQ and SNL? Phil Snow : Yes. So I would say the competitive landscape for us really haven\u2019t changed that much from previous quarters and Blackstone's acquisition of TR is recent. I\u2019m not even sure the transaction\u2019s completed yet. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to really affect sort of how we operate in the market on our success and taking market share from all of our competitors. Bill Warmington : All right. And then the final one on the Kensho purchase in terms of the increased use of A.I. and whether that is something -- Phil Snow : So I\u2019m not sure what their plans are there. Obviously that\u2019s an important theme in the marketplace. We have our own strategy there internally. We spent a lot of time focused on machine learning and A.I. Gene Fernandez who just joined us as CTO from JPMorgan four months ago, this is an area that he is very well versed and then we have some of our own plans essentially to use those sort of techniques as well as data science to really look at the workflows of our clients and continue to improve our product suite. Operator : Your next question comes from Peter Heckmann with Davidson. Please go ahead. Peter Heckmann : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to confirm on the offset from the lower tax rate, it appears that the net increase in your guidance is less than what we would have calculated purely from the 300 basis point reduction to the tax rate. And so it sounds as if the offset is increased investments that are pressuring margins down to more the middle end of the range of your non-GAAP operating margin guidance for the year, so more like 31.5 to 32. Is that the primary offset? Maurizio Nicolelli : Peter, it\u2019s Maurizio. Let me walk you through exactly that calculation. So the benefit to FactSet on an annualized basis from the lower tax rate is approximately $0.40 to adjusted EPS. Because we\u2019re really getting a three quarter benefit for the year, that drops to $0.30. And what you see in the guidance is an uptick on both sides of the range by $0.10. So that $0.20 difference is really broken down proportionally, fairly equally to three categories. One is the incremental investment that we\u2019ve made in the product and sales that Phil alluded to earlier. Two, it\u2019s the stronger pound and euro versus the dollar that we\u2019re experiencing right now in our P&L. And then three is a higher weighted average share count because the stock price has risen significantly making prior option grants that much more dilutive overall to our weighted average shares calculation. Peter Heckmann : That\u2019s helpful. And then as a follow up, within your guidance, are you including the stated 325 to 375 of share repurchases over the next two quarters? Maurizio Nicolelli : So that is our spend on share repurchase for the next 12 months. So a piece of that is in our guidance going forward but not the full amount. Peter Heckmann : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll get back in the queue. Operator : Your next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. George Tong : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. ASV growth organically accelerated to 5.8% in the quarter. Can you elaborate on how cross selling activity, new business and cancellations performed relative to expectations and whether you expect organic growth in ASV to accelerate over the next two quarters? Phil Snow : So we\u2019re very pleased with what we did in Q2. I think we have already sort of laid out in our opening remarks what drove that. And we\u2019re expecting to come in the range of what we said for annual guidance for ASV which was $65 million to $85 million for the entire year. George Tong : Got it. And as you looked at the trajectory throughout the quarter, do you see a path of acceleration over the next several quarters similar to the pace of acceleration you saw going from fiscal 1Q to fiscal 2Q? Phil Snow : So we gave you the range there. It is hard to predict. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, it\u2019s still a tough market out there. So we\u2019ve \u2013 us accelerating is going to require executing well, getting some key wins like we did in Q2. But what I can tell you is our pipeline on a growth basis is the biggest its ever been, but we are dealing with a challenging market. George Tong : Got it. I\u2019ll jump back in the queue. Thank you. Phil Snow : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. Joseph Foresi : Hi. I was wondering how should we think about the trajectory of margins for the rest of the year and long term. And what\u2019s the biggest swing factor there? Phil Snow : Joe, it\u2019s Phil Snow. So we\u2019re expecting to come in, in the middle of the range between what we guided for the year which was 31% to 32.5%. We have decided to invest a little bit more back in the product just given what happened with tax reform. And so our longest term guidance that we gave I would expect that to get pushed out a little bit, but we\u2019re going to talk more about that at Investor Day next month. Joseph Foresi : Got it, okay. And then on the demand for analytics, is that more cross-selling or is that a mix of new clients and cross-sell? Maybe you could just dig into that a little bit more because I wanted to just try to weigh that versus sort of your earlier comments around the demand backdrop. Thanks. Phil Snow : So a lot of it is cross-selling. A lot of our growth really does come from up-selling the existing client base and the acquisitions that we\u2019ve done, a lot of which were in the analytics space have helped there. So the deal that we did up with AIMCo in Canada was a direct result of getting the acquisition of Cognity combined with our own multi-asset class product. But that particular sale was a new client. So that was a significant win versus the cross selling that we see within the existing client base. So it\u2019s a nice combination of both. Joseph Foresi : Thank you. Phil Snow : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Phil, can you \u2013 I know it\u2019s not a big quarter in terms of adding users but it was an interesting dynamic where you had your client count increase more than your user count and I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit about the market dynamics there? And then I have another question after that. Phil Snow : Sure. So the client counts \u2013 the majority of the clients are going to be smaller clients. Our user count now includes both FactSet Workstation as well as StreetAccount users. And I think just decomposing that a little bit, there were a couple of hundred or more FactSet Workstation adds this quarter versus some losses in the StreetAccount. So that\u2019s sort of what \u2013 how that broke out. But I guess what I\u2019ll go back to is what we\u2019ve been talking about now for at least a year which is the shift from Workstation to workflow. So when we\u2019re out there in the market and we\u2019re providing solutions to clients, Workstation is one KPI but I think it\u2019s one that should not be focused on as much historically from an analysis standpoint and I think that\u2019s clear from this quarter\u2019s results. We added at least $25 million in ASV but you\u2019re seeing just a small number of workstations there. So it\u2019s the solutions and the workflows that we\u2019re selling to our clients that are accelerating our growth. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Got it. That\u2019s fair. Are you going to talk more on the Analyst Day about how much of the business is no longer Workstation related, kind of give us a sense of that? Phil Snow : So you\u2019ll have to show up to find out. I know you\u2019ll be there. But we are definitely going to be providing more transparency on the different pieces of our business and give you a little bit more guidance there in terms of how to think about the different groups. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Thank you. If you don\u2019t mind my just squeezing in, what are you investing in particularly? You talked about product and the margin is going to not be necessarily as high but it looks like you see an opportunity right now in a timely basis to be investing in the products. Can you give us just a little bit more detail on that? And after that, I\u2019ll get back in the queue. Phil Snow : Yes, sure. So we\u2019re just pouring more gas on the things that are growing faster, so analytics is one example and CTS which is our data feeds business, we\u2019re making a big investment and building out the next generation of that. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Thank you. Phil Snow : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Glenn Greene : Thanks. Good morning. Just a couple of questions. I was wondering, Phil, if you could just give us an update on what you\u2019ve seen as it relates to MiFID? Obviously, it won\u2019t affect anyone. It doesn\u2019t seem to have a huge impact on your business but maybe just a little bit of color on what you\u2019re seeing in the market? Phil Snow : So my comments really haven\u2019t changed from last quarter. The European business did better this Q2 than it did in Q2 of FY '17, so we\u2019re showing positive momentum there and we\u2019re continuing to build out more solutions with our regulatory group to address MiFID and other regulatory solutions. Glenn Greene : Okay. And then just on the \u2013 for Maurizio, the margins decelerated a bit in the quarter. I think last quarter you had talked about them sequentially increasing throughout the year. Maybe you took the opportunity late in the quarter to invest but maybe just some commentary on why the margins sort of went back the wrong way? Maurizio Nicolelli : So our adjusted margin was 31.7% in Q1. It dipped to 31.4%. That 30 basis point reduction was really FX generated. And if you look at Q3 that effect is less than what we saw in Q2. But that\u2019s what really drove the margin to 31.4. And as Phil alluded to, it\u2019s our projection that the margin will come in somewhere within the middle of the range that we gave out for guidance. Glenn Greene : Okay, so nothing unusual other than the FX and you didn\u2019t do \u2013 you didn\u2019t take the opportunity to incrementally invest late in the quarter at this point? Maurizio Nicolelli : No. The majority of what Phil is talking about is really \u2013 is coming up in Q3 and Q4. Glenn Greene : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Toni Kaplan : \u2026be on the block soon. Would that type of asset be complementary to your portfolio and --? Phil Snow : Toni, we didn\u2019t hear the beginning of your question. You were cut off. Toni Kaplan : Sure. Recently news reports mention that Tradeweb might be on the block soon. And so would that type of asset be complementary to your portfolio? And putting that one aside, what type of acquisitions are most attractive to you right now? Phil Snow : So we\u2019re not going to talk about specific acquisitions on this call, but our strategy for M&A hasn\u2019t changed. We continue to evaluate interesting workflow and content tuck-in acquisitions. And as both Maurizio and I have said, we have the capacity on our balance sheet to do something bigger if the right asset presents itself. Toni Kaplan : Okay, great. And then your employee count was up about 9% in the quarter and if I just sort of take a step back, your organic ASV is sort of in the mid-single digits. It is growing but is that also pressuring margins basically like when we think further out, should we \u2013 is it that you\u2019re hiring in low-cost locations, is it the additions from the acquisitions and employee count or how should we think about sort of a sustainable employee count growth rate versus top line? Thanks. Maurizio Nicolelli : Hi, Toni. It\u2019s Maurizio. So the employee count grew 9% on a year-over-year basis but that includes employees from the acquisitions of both BISAM and FDSG. If you strip that out, our employee count grew just north of 4% and a large part of that are employees that are in India and in the Philippines which are at a lower cost inherently. So that\u2019s not a significant pressure on us today from a higher headcount number. Operator : Your next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. Maybe just another question on your comment around workstations versus workflow KPIs, maybe can you just help explain why client retention keeps dropping but you sound like the market is pretty good to you guys. So what\u2019s the disconnect there? Phil Snow : So the client retention I think \u2013 the majority of our ASV really is bundled into the existing clients and the larger clients that we\u2019ve had for a long time and that we\u2019re cross-selling. So I think it\u2019s really just a function of us losing on a net basis much smaller clients on the tail. Manav Patnaik : Okay. Phil Snow : But again when you look at \u2013 sorry, so when you look at each of our quarters essentially and you think about sort of what\u2019s shifting the ASV, the vast majority of it is really always a function of the existing clients. It\u2019s not heavily influenced by \u2013 typically by lost clients. Manav Patnaik : Okay. And then just on your enterprise selling efforts, I was just wondering like so when you go to your client I guess, is this an enterprise-wide agreement or do you still \u2013 and just maybe a little bit more color basically on how that contract is structured now with the added services that you\u2019ve collected over the years? Phil Snow : We\u2019ve had long-term agreements with our clients for a very long time. If you\u2019re a smaller client \u2013 you\u2019re a small hedge fund or a family office, you might come on with a one year contract that renews every year. But for a lot of our larger clients now we\u2019re negotiating longer-term agreements with them which could be three to five years in length that could include a whole range of different services. Manav Patnaik : Got it. Thanks, guys. Phil Snow : Sure. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Kayvon Rahbar : Hi. This is Kayvon Rahbar filling in for Hamzah. Can you give us a sense on your sales force productivity, how is it trending? Is there any room for improvement? Phil Snow : So that\u2019s not something we track in terms of the metric that we could sort of talk about on this call. We\u2019ve got a large, very talented sales force that has a wide set of capabilities. And historically the cost of the sales force as a percentage of our revenues has remained fairly constant. Kayvon Rahbar : Okay. Thank you. Phil Snow : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Peter Appert : Thank you. So Phil or Maurizio, is there any structural difference between the workstation and the feeds business in terms of the profitability dynamic? I\u2019m thinking that maybe there\u2019s some efficiencies in selling feeds in terms of bigger sales that could make that a more profitable business if I move the needle in terms of margin. Is that accurate? Phil Snow : Yes, so the feeds business is a great business. A lot of our success has been it because it\u2019s a byproduct of the content that we collect ourselves and we\u2019re becoming more and more efficient at selling feeds. The CTS team has done a tremendous job standardizing a lot of the feeds that we have. So that I think is partly why you\u2019re seeing such a great adoption of our feeds business is that it\u2019s become standardized. We\u2019re marketing it more effectively and our sales force is becoming more expert in selling it just in general. But you raise a good point there. It\u2019s a high margin business and it\u2019s one that we continue to think is going to be a revenue driver for us. Peter Appert : Are the feeds users \u2013 what\u2019s the overlap between feeds clients and workstation clients? Phil Snow : It\u2019s low but it depends on the shop. So they may be \u2013 we may be servicing a large shop with both a feeds and a workstation. We sell a lot of feeds to quants. So a lot of FactSet\u2019s feeds business goes to quantitative investors who will take our content and put it into their own internal quant systems. But those same quant users might also be using FactSet\u2019s really excellent suite of quant products to do another piece of their process. And in some cases, they\u2019ll just be using one or the other. Peter Appert : Got it. But is there an expectation and as the feeds business grows as a percent of revenue, if that can be a driver of higher margin or is that not a realistic expectation? Phil Snow : I think it\u2019s not a bad thesis. If it became a bigger piece of FactSet, today\u2019s its 10% and growing nicely. But as it gets larger I think that it definitely could help our margin. Operator : Your next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could give us a sense, it sounds like the incremental boost in the buyback is a result of the repatriation. Is there any way to think about the structural benefit from the tax reform and what incremental cash flow associated with that, will that be deployed to buyback or acquisitions or how should we think about that longer term? Maurizio Nicolelli : So our capital allocation process really has not changed. We\u2019re still very opportunistic on the M&A front. If we\u2019re not doing M&A, then we\u2019re reinvesting back to shareholders in the dividend and stock repurchase. The dividend has been growing very nicely on a year-over-year basis, but we don\u2019t see any significant change to that in terms of growth to the dividend. So it\u2019s really at the large majority of our free cash flow, we\u2019re not doing M&A. Right now it\u2019s most accretive for us to go buy back stock. And so that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing that incremental 100 million from being able to bring back cash from overseas that we\u2019re earning interest on at a very low basis point returning. Kevin McVeigh : Great. And then just as a follow up, is there any way to think about \u2013 it sounds like a third of that reinvestment is designed to boost the organic growth. Any thoughts on what it could mean incrementally for the organic growth in terms of the margin reinvestment that you outlined? Maurizio Nicolelli : So when we think about that additional investment, we\u2019re really trying to push forward ASV growth and maintain or grow within our guidance. It\u2019s really pushing our ASV growth within our guidance and we\u2019re really \u2013 our growth right now for this year is really within that guidance number. Kevin McVeigh : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from David Chu with Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Chu : Great. Thank you. So similar to last quarter, can you just provide an update on ASV that has been booked to-date in the current quarter? Phil Snow : Can you repeat the question? David Chu : Just wanted to see if we can get an update on ASV that has been booked to-date in the current quarter. Phil Snow : No. We don\u2019t disclose that. David Chu : Okay. Oh, no. Just you provided that level of color last quarter, so I just wanted to see if we can get that. So on margins \u2013 so, Maurizio, when do you think we can get back to legacy levels at this point, so maybe the 33% to 34% range. Maurizio Nicolelli : Yes, I guess I would go back to what Phil said earlier. I think the timeframe has pushed out a little bit. And we\u2019re still focused on it, but it has been pushed out a little bit longer than what we had initially thought. And we\u2019re going to give a little bit more guidance at Investor Day in a few weeks. David Chu : Okay, got it. And then just lastly wanted to confirm, you\u2019re unhedged to all currencies but the rupee at this point? Maurizio Nicolelli : We are unhedged to all currencies ex-rupee and Philippines peso. David Chu : All right. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim McHugh with William Blair. Please go ahead. Tim McHugh : Thanks. Just on the FX impact on margins, did you say that the impact is less I guess going into the third quarter now? And just trying to understand given currency trends, what type of impact you expect at this point for the full year and relative to prior expectations, and then 3Q versus 2Q? Maurizio Nicolelli : Yes. So if you look at Q3 versus Q2; in Q2, we had a \u2013 it affected our margin by about 30 basis points. When we look at current rates and our exposure in Q3, that negative has come down somewhat. So it\u2019s less of an effect in Q3 versus Q2. If you look at it on a full year basis, it will be a negative effect just overall for the full fiscal year. Tim McHugh : Okay. And so the reinvestment to \u2013 I guess given the numbers you gave, it seems like that\u2019s like 20 basis points to the full year number if it\u2019s kind of one third of the $0.20. Is that in the right ballpark for that number? Maurizio Nicolelli : Approximately. Between 20 and 30 basis points. Correct. Tim McHugh : Okay. And then last question. Just another numbers one. The analytics business driving roughly half of the incremental ASV. Can you \u2013 since we don\u2019t know the size of that business, I guess how does that compare? Has that been true or close to true the last couple of quarters? Is that significantly different than you\u2019ve been seeing? Phil Snow : Well, the first quarter\u2019s always a very small quarter. I think the right thing to do is to show up at Investor Day and we\u2019ll be providing some more color at that time. Tim McHugh : Okay. Thanks. Phil Snow : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. Keith Housum : Good morning, guys. As we think about the analytics business, it sounds like you obviously had a good quarter. Is there a feeling regards momentum at your back here in that segment, it sounds like this is an area that\u2019s done better for you over the past year or so. And just to talk about just the current environment and the pipeline in the segment, how you\u2019re thinking about that? Phil Snow : So the analytics business has been a growth driver of FactSet\u2019s business for the last two decades, honestly. It\u2019s beginning with portfolio analysis equity product. So this is really \u2013 it\u2019s evolved now to sort of have seven or eight business lines within it as well as all of the acquisitions that we\u2019ve done. Not all of them, but BISAM, Vermilion, and so on. So it\u2019s a great business. It\u2019s one of our stickiest products. And very often, it drives a lot of our sales and brings other products with it. So this is not a new trend. We\u2019re just beginning to talk about it in a little bit more of a granular way than we have historically. Keith Housum : All right. Thank you. And then Maurizio, can you remind us about your thought process regarding your debt levels in a rising interest rate environment? Maurizio Nicolelli : Yes, so currently we have 575 million in debt. Our cost of capital is just right around 300 basis points. At that level, it\u2019s still very accretive for us to continue to invest our free cash flow to buy back stock. As the Fed increases interest rates, we continue to reevaluate it. But as of right now, it\u2019s still very accretive for us to still go buy back stock and lower our share count. Keith Housum : Great. And then do you guys have any derivatives to protect the interest rates where it\u2019s at now or no? Maurizio Nicolelli : Currently, we don\u2019t have hedges on the interest rate. No. Keith Housum : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your last question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead. Alex Kramm : Yes. Hi. Good morning. Just a couple of cleanups here. First of all, on Portware, I think historically, you\u2019ve talked about the fact that there\u2019s some parts of the business that is trading, volume related. And clearly year-to-date, we\u2019ve seen spike in volume. So just curious how much that added in the quarter? And then also, Maurizio, how does it impact ASV, because February in particular was very strong and that\u2019s when your quarter ends? So how do you use that variable component there in your ASV number? Phil Snow : So this is Phil. I\u2019ll answer the first part of the question, which is we historically have not broken out the transaction revenue part of Portware. Maurizio Nicolelli : And so Alex \u2013 it\u2019s Maurizio. So in our ASV calculation, we look at transaction revenues over the last 12 months and that\u2019s what we include in ASV. So we\u2019ll look at the last 12 months activity and that\u2019s our ASV number for the client for transactional revenue for ASV. Alex Kramm : All right. So one month doesn\u2019t really drive anything up in a big way. Okay, good. And then just secondly, just coming back to the tax rate in a minute. I think I got it now. But you gave a lot of different numbers here. If I think about the next fiscal year, I know that\u2019s still a couple of quarters away, but it sounds like your tax rate going forward, if we assume the same kind of stock base comp levels should be around like 17%, 17.5%. Did I hear that correctly, like on a go-forward basis? Maurizio Nicolelli : Yes. So this year is a blended year because we really only get eight months out of the 12 months of benefit. But if you look at fiscal '19, you would see an incremental \u2013 approximately 200 basis points decline in the existing tax rate going forward for the full year benefit in 2019. Alex Kramm : Yes. Excellent. And maybe since I\u2019m the last one, just very quickly since somebody brought up MiFID II as well. When we talk to clients over there, we\u2019re hearing that increasingly, companies are taking this as an opportunity to review their budgets and look at their spend more holistically. Are you seeing any of that already out of Europe, or still something that we should be looking for as people kind of think about their total spend? Phil Snow : Yes, so we\u2019ve not seen any impact yet. Obviously, we check in with our business leaders over there. And I think so far, the trends for us in Europe remain the same as they have been. So we\u2019re hopefully anticipating that in the second half we\u2019ll have a stronger Q3 and Q4 in Europe as we did in Q2. Alex Kramm : Excellent. Thank you very much. Phil Snow : Thank you. So thanks everyone for joining us on the call today. As we noted in our press release, we are hosting an Investor Day on April 17th in New York City. Details on how to register for this event are in our earnings release and on our Web site. We hope to see many of you at the event. And if you have additional questions, please call Rima Hyder. We look forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator, that ends today\u2019s call. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Joining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer; and Maurizio Nicolelli, Chief Financial Officer. And now, I'd like to turn the discussion over to Phil Snow. Phil Snow : Thanks, Rima. Good morning to everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today. As we\u2019re near the close of our fiscal year, we are pleased with our achievements and remain committed to executing on our growth strategy and returning value to shareholders. In September, we\u2019ll celebrate 40 years as a company, and while a lot has changed, the one thing that has remained constant is the strong collaboration with our clients. We have developed some of the best-in-class solutions in our industry and become an integral part of our clients\u2019 daily investment process. This quarter, we saw strong revenue and EPS growth, and although we saw a dip in our organic ASV growth rate, we believe we have a solid Q4 pipeline that will allow us to close our fiscal 2018 within our guidance range. Turning to third quarter results, we grew organic revenue at 6% and ASV at over 5%. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 18% to $2.18 boosted by the U.S. tax reform and our share repurchase program. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 31%, a slight decrease from last year and last quarter; however, we are very focused on achieving our medium-term goals of increasing operating margin by 100 basis points per year over the next two years. This quarter, we took actions to streamline parts of our organization and to optimize costs, and we believe these actions in combination with our continuing efforts to integrate our acquisitions paved the path forward to margin expansion. We increased ASV by $9 million in the last three months. The increase was primarily driven by analytics, CTS, wealth, and our annual price increase to our international clients. Our cross-selling efforts drove many of the wins this quarter. Analytics added more than 50% of the net increase in ASV this quarter, and we highlighted our risk offering at our Investor Day as a key driver within analytics. This quarter was no different with a number of multi-asset class risk wins. CTS had another strong quarter maintaining a high growth trajectory year-over-year and we\u2019re really excited about the Open FactSet Marketplace which launched in April. This new platform offers both core financial and alternative datasets. Examples are ESG, satellite, and sentiment data to address the growing demand for more integrated content across our client base. We\u2019re seeing particularly strong interest from the quants within hedge funds as well as traditional asset managers. Our wealth management business also performed well this quarter with workstation deployments across top tier clients displacing our main competitors. Much of our client count and workstation increase this quarter is coming from the wealth business. We\u2019ve executed well against our strategy of broadening our wealth solutions and capturing wins with large clients. We also saw cancellations this quarter but at a decreased rate compared to the same quarter last year. Most of the cancellations were due to firm closures and firm consolidations, a recurring theme in the industry. However, this quarter versus last year, we saw a reduction in cancellations from firm consolidations. For the last two quarters, we\u2019ve seen a reduction in cancellations but we still believe that the cost pressures in the industry have not abated. We performed well this quarter with our client retention rate increasing to 90%. Turning to our geographic breakdown, our Americas organic ASV growth was 4%, driven by analytics and CTS products, primarily sold to institutional asset managers. Outside of the Americas, ASV grew organically by 7% with Asia-Pac growing over 13% and Europe growing at 5%. In Asia-Pac, we gained new clients and increased sales to existing clients particularly in Singapore and Australia. In analytics, both fixed income and equity products and CTS were the main contributors. We also opened a new office in Shanghai which strengthens our position in the growing Chinese market. EMEA had a stronger Q3 than last year. In addition to the price increase, we had major wins in Europe with analytics, CTS, and an increase in workstation sales. The UK and Nordic regions performed particularly well this quarter. We had a good win in Europe with an integrated BISAM portfolio analysis solution, a great example of our portfolio lifecycle strategy to cross-sell and up-sell our broader suite of products. In conclusion, we believe we remain on track to achieve our annual and medium-term goals as laid out at Investor Day. We\u2019ve got good visibility as we start our final quarter for fiscal 2018 and feel positive about our pipeline. Our integration efforts continue to enhance our product offering and the up-selling and cross-selling of these products helped secure some important wins this quarter, and we continue to return value to our shareholders through our balanced capital allocation framework. We increased our quarterly dividend for the 13th year in a row raising it by 14% and we bought back $122 million in shares this quarter increasing the pace of our buyback program as we improved our cash collections. Let me now turn the call over to Maurizio to talk in more detail about our financial results. Maurizio Nicolelli : Thank you, Phil, and good morning to everyone on the call. As Phil said, we believe we are on track to close out our fiscal 2018 in our guidance range. We made good progress versus our goals this past quarter. Also, this quarter\u2019s results are impacted by certain one-time charges related to restructuring actions that we undertook this past quarter. Let\u2019s now go through our third quarter results. GAAP revenues in the third quarter increased 9% to 340 million and 6% to 333 million on an organic basis versus the third quarter of 2017. Looking at our segment revenue, U.S. revenues grew 5% organically and international revenues increased 7% on an organic basis. This growth comes primarily as a result of higher sales from our international price increase, analytics, data feed products, and an increase in workstation sales. ASV increased to 1.36 billion at the end of our third quarter. Organic ASV increased 5% year-over-year and 9 million since the end of our second quarter. This increase was primarily driven by higher analytics, CTS, and wealth management sales. Additionally, this quarter we also implemented our annual international price increase, which added 4.5 million to ASV. This increase was comparable with our increase last year. Let us now take a look at our operating expenses. Operating expenses for the third quarter totaled 247 million, an increase of 10% year-over-year, primarily driven by restructuring charges and certain one-time administrative expenses. Our GAAP operating margin decreased 70 basis points year-over-year to 27.4%, primarily due to the previously mentioned restructuring charges, a negative impact from foreign currency, higher data costs, and incremental legal fees. Adjusted operating margin of 31% was lower than last year\u2019s margin of 31.9%. Without the negative impact of FX this quarter, adjusted operating margin would have been 31.4%. Third quarter cost of services expressed as a percentage of revenues increased by 170 basis points compared to the year-ago period. The increase was driven by the restructuring costs, additional employee compensation and higher data costs. Higher employee costs were due to merit increases in the last 12 months, increased hiring and the impact of foreign currency. SG&A expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues were down 100 basis points compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The decrease was primarily the result of FX hedging gains, our revenue growth rate outpacing the growth of employee compensation which was flat and holding other SG&A expenses such as rent, office and professional fees constant. These decreases were partially offset by current year restructuring costs. Our client and workstation accounts were both up this quarter versus our fiscal second quarter of 2018. In the past three months, we added 80 new clients and 860 new users in both cases, primarily as a result of our wealth management solutions. We now have close to 5,000 clients and over 89,000 workstation users. Moving on to the tax rate, our quarterly effective tax rate was 16.5% compared with 23.2% a year ago, primarily due to the U.S. tax reform that we discussed last quarter. GAAP EPS increased 15% to $1.91 this quarter versus $1.66 in the third quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to the lower tax rate from the U.S. tax reform. Excluding intangible asset amortization, the deferred revenue fair value adjustment and other non-reoccurring items, adjusted EPS grew 18% to $2.18 this quarter. Free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending, for our third quarter was 120 million, an increase of approximately 35 million or 42% over the same period last year. The increase was due to a significant improvement in cash collections, a lower effective tax rate, timing of prepayments and reduced capital expenditures. Our DSO decreased to 39 days at the end of our third quarter versus 42 days a year ago. Moving on to our share repurchase program, we repurchased 620,000 shares for 122 million during the third quarter under our existing share repurchase program. We were opportunistic in buying back shares and were able to accelerate our pace of buybacks with the increase in our free cash flow. And as Phil already mentioned, we increased our dividend once again this quarter by 14% to $0.64 per share per quarter. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders and maintaining a balanced capital allocation framework. Now let's turn to our guidance for fiscal 2018. The only changes to our fiscal 2018 guidance are minor adjustments to GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS. GAAP diluted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $6.92 and $7.17. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $8.37 and $8.62. The midpoint of the adjusted EPS range represents 16% growth over the prior year. Our ranges were refined during the quarter based on our latest expectations for how we expect to close the full fiscal 2018 year. We have also enhanced our disclosure by providing a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP EPS in the back of the press release. With one quarter to go we expect to execute on our annual goals for fiscal 2018. The sales teams are gearing up for our fourth quarter which is our busiest quarter in terms of sales activities. Our fourth quarter pipeline reflects this increased activity. With our broad suite of products, client retention is up this quarter and we believe we can continue to gain more clients and more market share. Thank you for your participation in today's call. We're now ready for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. George Tong : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Organic ASV growth in the quarter decelerated to 5.3% despite easier comps in the year-ago period. Can you provide some context behind the deceleration and discuss how the pipeline is evolving? Phil Snow : Sure. Hi, George. It\u2019s Phil Snow. So Q3-over-Q3, we added approximately the same amount of ASV as we did last year. And just to remind everyone, we really think of our sales cycle in half. Traditionally, the Q2 and Q4 quarters have been much bigger for FactSet over the years, and this year is no different. So, as Maurizio just mentioned, we\u2019re gearing up for our fourth quarter. We believe we have a pretty strong pipeline for Q4. We have good visibility into the pipeline, and we have some large deals that we\u2019re really excited about. George Tong : Got it. And then as a follow up, ASV per customer modestly contracted in the quarter. Can you elaborate on the factors that contributed to the decline and when you expect cross-selling initiatives to help drive positive growth in ASV per customer? Maurizio Nicolelli : So that\u2019s really not something we track. We have a broad range of customers that pay us anything from a few thousand dollars a year if they\u2019re a street account user to a lot more than that. We did add 80 clients net for the quarter. Many of those clients were smaller wealth shops as well as corporate clients, so the slight decrease might have been attributed to that, so typically we\u2019re going to be adding new clients on the long tail essentially, so that\u2019s I think what you\u2019re seeing this quarter. George Tong : Got it. Thank you. Maurizio Nicolelli : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. Mike Reid : Hi. This is Mike Reid on for Joe. Thanks for taking the question. The first one I guess with the Shanghai office opening, can you talk a little bit more about the environment in China and maybe some of the drivers and challenges there? Phil Snow : Yes, so the China market\u2019s really an exciting new market for us. We\u2019ve been servicing it out of Hong Kong for some time, but there are many great advantages to being in China, one of them we believe is that we\u2019re going to be able to setup infrastructure in a way where the speed of the product within Mainland China is going to be faster than it has been historically, and that\u2019s obviously a big deal for clients. So where we\u2019re having success in China and a lot of the Asia-Pac region is with our more advanced analytics products. That\u2019s really where we\u2019re competing. We\u2019ve got a great team out there. I was actually out there to help open the office a week or two ago and got to meet some clients in China, so at least from where we sit, it\u2019s really a Greenfield opportunity and one that we\u2019re excited about. Mike Reid : Okay, thanks. And then ASV growth by segment, was that fairly similar to some of the growth numbers you\u2019ve showed for FY '17 at Investor Day or is that improved or slowed in any areas? Maurizio Nicolelli : It takes time to move these numbers. I would say it was very similar. The CTS growth rate continues to do very well, close to the 20% that we looked at. I would say that there\u2019s really good momentum behind analytics and wealth, and the research and PMT segment is still growing in low-single digits and where we\u2019re seeing the majority of the market pressure. Mike Reid : All right. Thank you. Maurizio Nicolelli : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Glenn Greene : Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to follow up with that prior question. So on the research and portfolio management side, you still are seeing kind of modest growth. I was just trying to kind of triangulate the sort of deceleration in aggregate ASV with sort of the newer solutions sound like they are all doing well, but the overall deceleration in ASV may be infer that the core research workstation business may be decelerated a bit. Phil Snow : Yes, we\u2019re definitely seeing more pressure there. We continue to broaden our footprint but the success that we\u2019re having really is as we\u2019ve talked about historically moving from workstation to workflow with a really big emphasis on our analytics and our platform solutions. Glenn Greene : Okay. And then Maurizio on the margin side, and you just sound like you are very confident in still getting the 100 basis points a year of margin expansion. Margins sort of disappointed a little bit this quarter, and it sounds like you\u2019re taking I guess some incremental restructuring actions. Maybe you could help us sort of quantify the potential benefit from those restructuring actions and probably more importantly why you\u2019re still confident in getting the 100 basis points a year? Maurizio Nicolelli : Yes, so this quarter you saw a slight decrease, about 40 basis points from Q2, and so that\u2019s a little bit from us reinvesting in certain areas of our product which we discussed last quarter. Going forward, we\u2019re confident about bringing back the margin or increasing the margin. It\u2019s really driven by the restructuring that we put in place in Q4, which will help us with [indiscernible] item to really bring back the margin -- to bring it back 100 basis points higher going forward into fiscal 2019. Glenn Greene : So there weren\u2019t any incremental restructuring actions. These were the prior ones that you had announced back in the fourth quarter. Maurizio Nicolelli : No. We\u2019ve recently put through a restructuring effort to optimize some of our costs, which is really headcount at the end of the day, and we put that through in early June and so we\u2019ll start to see that benefit in Q4 and then we\u2019ll see the full benefit come through in fiscal '19. Glenn Greene : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Hamzah Mazari : Good morning. Thank you. The first question is just around active to passive flows and sort of the impact to your business. I don\u2019t know if you could update us on what you\u2019re seeing there and how you\u2019re positioned longer term? Phil Snow : Hi, Hamzah. It\u2019s Phil. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re seeing anything that different in terms of the flows and some of the pressure that\u2019s putting on our clients from a cost basis. One thing that we\u2019re excited about which really I think fits with FactSet very well is the resurgence of quant in the market. So a lot of the active managers I think are becoming more quantitative in their approach. The pendulum has swung back in that direction. We have a strong suite of products within analytics that service the quants. And with the launch of the Open FactSet Marketplace, as I mentioned in my comments, we\u2019re seeing a lot of initial interest from the quants with the datasets that we\u2019re putting up, that\u2019s not the only segment of the market we\u2019re going after but that\u2019s the one who we\u2019re beginning with. Hamzah Mazari : Okay, great. And just a follow up for Maurizio. I know you announced sort of moving on at the end of December. Any thoughts there and then sort of how you\u2019re thinking about the search process? And I enjoyed working with you, Maurizio. Thank you. Phil Snow : Hamzah, it\u2019s Phil Snow. So we\u2019ve been actively obviously looking for a replacement for Maurizio. He\u2019s done a fantastic job for FactSet over the years. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s excited about his next chapter and we are making good progress with the search and we\u2019ll have hopefully an update for you on that shortly. Maurizio Nicolelli : And it\u2019s been a pleasure working with you also. Hamzah Mazari : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from David Chu with Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Chu : Hi. Thank you. So in the past few quarters there was mention about margins improving sequentially over the course of fiscal '18. It sounds like ex the FX, margins were flat quarter-over-quarter in 3Q. So what\u2019s changed here? I would assume that you\u2019re adding back or excluding the restructuring charges to get to adjusted EBIT. So just some color on what\u2019s changed over the last few quarters? Phil Snow : Hi, David. It\u2019s Phil Snow. So one of the things that we talked about on our last call was taking some of the benefit we got from an improved tax rate to invest in a couple of areas for the company. So that\u2019s short term. We\u2019ve had a lot of success with our risk offering over the last few quarters and these are multi-asset class risk solutions that are typically sold at the enterprise level for our clients and that requires quite a bit of effort from an implementation standpoint. So we made an investment there in the analytics group to staff so that we could go ahead and close that business effectively and continue to do so. And we did actively look at a few market segments of FactSet across our employee base globally where we felt there were some pressures from a salary standpoint and we made some adjustments in a few cities. So that was a short-term effort. I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing. What Maurizio talked about in terms of our optimization efforts you\u2019re going to begin to see the effect of that we believe in Q4 and moving into FY '19. David Chu : Okay, great. And so should we expect like margin expansion to accelerate over the course of fiscal '19 or would it be somewhat like even over the course of the year? Maurizio Nicolelli : David, I think you should foresee a gradual increase to margin to get to 100 basis points higher going forward. David Chu : Great. Thank you. And just lastly, why is your EPS guide so wide when we only have one quarter to go? Maurizio Nicolelli : There\u2019s still some variability within our EPS guidance and we really wanted to home into a certain extent with the last quarter coming up and we also have additional disclosures in the back of the press release to go from non-GAAP to GAAP which enabled us to be a little bit more precise in our guidance going forward. David Chu : Okay. Thank you very much. Maurizio Nicolelli : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Toni Kaplan : Thanks. Phil you mentioned strong 4Q pipeline. Just wanted to get a sense of the main drivers there. How are the summer classes for the banks versus last year? Like buy side was a little bit weaker this year but is there something that you\u2019re seeing there that might be better in fourth quarter or was there something maybe very specifically timing related this quarter? Just anything in regards to the pipeline would be helpful. Thanks. Phil Snow : Sure. Yes, the hiring classes for the bank is always a big piece of Q4, so we can never get perfect visibility into that but I think we\u2019re feeling pretty good about it. And again, the sales team I think has become better and better about really managing the pipeline on a weighted basis and gives us more confidence in a number that we see in there. So I think the drivers are not going to change that much. You\u2019re going to see CTS, you\u2019re going to see analytics, we expect the wealth business to continue to do well. It\u2019s I think a similar story to this quarter just much more heavily weighted in Q4 than Q3 as usual. Toni Kaplan : Okay, great. And I know that recently you\u2019ve said you haven\u2019t really seen impacts from MiFID II in terms of your international price increases, but just wanted to get an update on how MiFID II is playing out if you are seeing any sort of impacts in the business, that would be helpful? Phil Snow : We\u2019re not right now. So we did significantly better in EMEA this Q3 than the same quarter last year and our price increase went through really very smoothly. So we\u2019re not seeing anything yet that\u2019s really affecting us from previous years. Toni Kaplan : Great. Thank you. Phil Snow : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Thank you for taking my questions. Phil, just want to ask you a question in terms of kind of the metrics versus what\u2019s really going on inside the company. It looks like the ASV growth kind of slowed sequentially but you talked to a strong pipeline. Internally, based on your guide and the stuff that you can\u2019t necessarily share with the street, are you feeling that the business is picking up momentum, losing momentum or kind of same as what it was last quarter? Phil Snow : The way I will answer that is I think we feel really good about the product offering that we have for the marketplace. We\u2019ve done some good acquisitions. The integration of those acquisitions is really beginning to produce product that we feel is going to have an impact moving forward. The Open FactSet Marketplace that we\u2019ve released we think is going to help accelerate the CTS growth even further. So I\u2019d say there\u2019s a lot of excitement within the sales team about what we have to offer and our ability to grow faster. But there are still market pressures out there. The backdrop is not changing. It\u2019s challenging. Clients do have cost pressures and that\u2019s the environment we\u2019re selling into. But just in terms of what we have to offer and the problems we can solve for our clients I feel as good as I\u2019ve ever felt at FactSet and that was something that we stated at Investor Day. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. And then this one\u2019s for Maurizio. What can you talk to about the 4 million of accelerated vesting? What was that all about? Maurizio Nicolelli : The 4 million of accelerated vesting -- Shlomo Rosenbaum : To get back to the adjusted EPS, so if you look through some of the numbers over there, like there was accelerated vesting that was added back? Maurizio Nicolelli : So the 4 million you\u2019re talking about is the total charges in the back of the press release, 4.4 million. And the majority of that is the restructuring charge that we took. More than half of it was restructuring. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. So if I\u2019m looking at the adjusted net income and I guess this other nonrecurring items at 4.7 that you\u2019re referring to? Maurizio Nicolelli : Correct. Shlomo Rosenbaum : And you\u2019re seeing that the stock-based compensation acceleration is a minority part of that. Maurizio Nicolelli : Correct. Shlomo Rosenbaum : And can you just disclose like what the acceleration was about? Was there something \u2013 is that normal that we don\u2019t usually pay attention to it? Maurizio Nicolelli : It\u2019s normal as part of the restructuring charge and it\u2019s something that we\u2019ve had in the past also which is just part of the overall number. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. So that\u2019s triggered by the restructuring charge. Maurizio Nicolelli : Correct. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, now I get it. Thank you very much. Maurizio Nicolelli : Okay. Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from Peter Heckmann with Davidson. Please go ahead. Peter Heckmann : Hi, everyone. I was looking at some of the new regs coming out of the SEC, specifically the new N-PORT, N-CEN regs and it looks like investment management record a significant amount of additional data around risk and portfolio concentration as well as position holding. Do you see that as any benefit potentially to back that or conversely would there be some additional costs that you need to expend to get to full functionality? Phil Snow : Hi, Peter. It\u2019s Phil Snow. So we have more of an emphasis on regulatory solutions than we\u2019ve had historically. We have a very talented group that\u2019s looking at all of these regulations that are coming out. And we have a very good product, the Solvency II and I think N-PORT is one that we\u2019re also very focused on. So regulation is going to put pressure on our clients from a cost standpoint and something they\u2019re going to have to spend money on, but we think that\u2019s an opportunity for us to deliver good solutions to our clients to help them with that. Peter Heckmann : Got it, okay. And then just a quick follow up. There\u2019s been some discussion about some of the tax provisions that are serving to claw back some of the corporate tax cuts, especially those companies that have significant international operations. Can you just talk about a preliminary range that you think about the effective tax rate for next year? Maurizio Nicolelli : We\u2019ll be providing that guidance come September for fiscal 2019. The only thing I can tell you is that on the tax reform bill we only got two-thirds of the benefit this year because it was enacted on January 1st. There\u2019s a little bit more benefit to FactSet in fiscal '19 but we\u2019ll come out with that full year guidance in September. Peter Heckmann : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead. Alex Kramm : Hello, everyone. Just a couple of things to follow up on that were discussed earlier. On the restructuring program, maybe you can give us a little bit more color on a couple of things like \u2013 first of all, like why now \u2013 why did you feel like you needed to do something right now? And then also I think you guys generally are regarded as having best-in-class sales. So doing restructuring at this time, should I be worried about the sales effort and the service or you don\u2019t feel like it is going to inhibit growth in any way? Phil Snow : Hi, Alex. It\u2019s Phil Snow. So I wouldn\u2019t be worried about that. We were really just looking I think internally at some of our lower ROI investments and just making sure that we had our best resources focused on the highest return on investment opportunities for the company. So a lot of what you saw was across all groups at FactSet. So it wasn\u2019t like we were singling out sales by any means. So it\u2019s really just an optimization. You\u2019ve seen some of the benefit of that coming through next quarter we believe. But we have a very talented sales force. What I would say on the sales side is that we\u2019re \u2013 a couple of things that we\u2019ve been doing is really focusing on some of our larger accounts. We\u2019ve had a big effort to focus on those this year and we expect to see some real improvement in the larger accounts coming through next year. And we\u2019re really looking at our sales force and making sure that we\u2019ve got a higher proportion of our investment going to the products like analytics and CTS that are growing faster. So that\u2019s a bit of an evolution but we think over time that\u2019s really going to help out. Alex Kramm : Okay, thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then just coming back to the pipeline just so I hear you correctly. So last year I think in the fourth quarter you did 32 million of organic sales. So when you compare the pipeline to that now, how would you characterize it because I think you said the 3Q was kind of in line with last year? So would you say 4Q pipeline is going to align with what you saw last year or any incremental color would be great? Phil Snow : There\u2019s going to be a range there. So it is our biggest quarter by a long shot and we have some larger deals in there. So a lot of it how we do relative to last year is really going to be a function of those bigger deals closing in Q4. Alex Kramm : All right, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Bill Warmington : Good morning, everyone. Phil Snow : Hi, Bill. Bill Warmington : So first question on wealth management. In the past your push into wealth management has been focused mostly on the high end of the market, typically 500 million in AUM and above. But now as you complete your migration from a large mainframe environment to more of a distributed server architecture, it would seem to open up an opportunity to really go down market after the smaller midsized wealth managers. So my question is what\u2019s your strategy for going down market and what\u2019s the timing of that likely to be? Phil Snow : Hi, Bill. It\u2019s Phil. So when we did the acquisition of IDMS in Frankfurt, that really opened up a broader segment of the wealth market to us. The other thing that is opening up a great opportunity for us is the FactSet Web products. So we released the Web products and we\u2019ve made a lot of enhancements recently to that product specifically for the wealth market. So it\u2019s being received exceptionally well. We\u2019re getting a lot of feedback from our clients about what they want to see in there. And you\u2019re absolutely right. Now that we\u2019ve gone to a more distributed architecture, it allows us to deploy a lot more desks at a lower price point and have it be much more profitable for the company. So this is a segment that we\u2019re very excited about and we wouldn\u2019t have broken it out separately if we didn\u2019t think it was something that we would capitalize on moving forward. Bill Warmington : And then on the FactSet marketplace, just wanted to ask about the revenue model there and specifically whether it\u2019s incremental revenue from the client or whether that\u2019s included in the subscription? And then the value proposition for the data provider and then whether you\u2019ve \u2013 what kind of initial uptake you\u2019ve seen from clients? Phil Snow : Great questions. So we released the Open FactSet Marketplace this quarter with a number of alternative data providers. The business model really is a royalty-based model, so the vale proposition for the data provider is they get to put their content up into the FactSet ecosystem where they get access to institutional clients. We also do a really good job of concording [ph] data. That\u2019s one of our core competencies as a company. So tying their datasets to our datasets and to other datasets there, that\u2019s a real pain point for clients. So we\u2019re taking that pain point away. And those two things are why so many alternative data providers and data providers are interested in being part of the FactSet ecosystem. So what you\u2019ll see over time is that we\u2019ll get royalties from these alternative data providers as they put their data up onto the FactSet system. So we\u2019ve got an enormously positive response from the market. There\u2019s lot of providers that want to be in the ecosystem. I would not expect to see a meaningful uptick in revenue for a little bit of time because it is going to take time to get these things out into the marketplace and to trial them. So we weren\u2019t expecting a large impact this fiscal year but we do expect some positive impact to our growth rate from the Open FactSet Marketplace as CTS accelerates next year. Bill Warmington : Got it. Thank you very much for the insight. Phil Snow : Sure. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead. Gregory Bardi : Hi. This is Greg actually calling on for Manav. Just wanted to ask about the AI space. You\u2019re seeing S&P make a pretty proactive move with Kensho and even companies like Moody\u2019s have taken minority stake. So just wondering how you\u2019re thinking about investments in the AI space? Phil Snow : Hi, Greg. It\u2019s Phil. So we do have a team here that focuses on machine learning and AI. Traditionally they have been very focused on our content collection efforts. I think there\u2019s still a lot more we can do there to use machine learning to automate more of our content collection and just get more data onto our system. And Gene Fernandez who joined us back in November from JPMorgan, he has been taking a look at that group. I think we\u2019ve made a couple of additional hires. So we\u2019re looking very closely at what internal processes we can leverage ML and AI for and what client workflows can we do the same with. So it\u2019s a work in progress but something that we are focused on. Gregory Bardi : Okay, that makes sense. And then maybe on what you\u2019re seeing in the marketplace during this period of transition for Thomson Reuters\u2019 F&R business as a way to close the Blackstone deal. Similar to other consolidation in this space are you seeing opportunities during this period of transition or how should we think about that? Phil Snow : No, I wouldn\u2019t say that the competitive environment has changed that much. So we\u2019ve been competing against Thomson for a long time and there\u2019s really no change in terms of where we\u2019re seeing them in the marketplace and how we\u2019re doing. Gregory Bardi : Okay, fair enough. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Peter Appert : Thanks. So Phil or Maurizio, can you give us a number on the growth rates for the research PM business versus the newer initiatives in private wealth, CTS, analytics? Phil Snow : Peter, it\u2019s Phil. I think at Investor Day we said that we would break out those numbers once a year. So you can expect to get an update from us in Q4. But as I already stated on the call, the processes have not changed materially from when we presented to you a few months ago. Peter Appert : Got it. How about margin differential? Is there a significant differential in profitability in the various product offerings? Maurizio Nicolelli : Peter, it\u2019s Maurizio. There\u2019s going to be slight differences between the different offerings. There\u2019s so much of FactSet\u2019s expense that is shared to all of those different groups that it becomes a little bit more of a theoretical exercise for us at the end of the day. But there are some differences there that are up and down but they\u2019re very comparable. Peter Appert : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your last question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. Keith Housum : Good morning, guys. Thanks for getting me in here. Phil, a question for you about the pipeline. If I look back at the second quarter transcript, you said the pipeline was the best it\u2019s ever been and it sounds like the pipeline is good again this quarter. Is the pipeline \u2013 is that period to close, is that getting longer based on the market conditions and I guess what gives you the confidence that the strong pipeline would be able to turn around and close here in the fourth quarter? Phil Snow : Yes, so I don\u2019t think anything has changed from Q2 in terms of the gross pipeline. So the number of opportunities we have in there is the largest it\u2019s ever been from an ASV standpoint. But I would say as we move more to workflow and we move more to enterprise solution, particularly within analytics, there is a little bit of a longer sales cycle there for selling multi-asset class risk solution versus just going out and selling another FactSet with PA on top of it. So it really depends on the solution. But as we move to larger deals with our clients, the sale cycle for those things that are really going to impact the top line maybe taking a little bit longer. Keith Housum : Okay, I appreciate it. And then Maurizio, just coming back to your op margins again and I apologize if you answered this already. But in terms of the acquisitions and the integrations there, would you say the added integration is proceeding as planned or has there been any hiccups or not being able to capture the operating margins that you\u2019re hoping for? Maurizio Nicolelli : I think we\u2019re progressing on increasing our margin for both FDSG and BISAM which really are the ones that we really need to execute on over a two-year period since we purchased them. And we\u2019re one year in but we have made a good amount of progress but there\u2019s more to be done there and that will really help us get to our 100 basis point increase for fiscal '19. Keith Housum : Great. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Phil Snow, I turn the call back over to you. Phil Snow : Thanks again everyone for joining us on our call today. If you have additional questions, please call Rima Hyder. We look forward to talking to you all next quarter. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Joining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer; and Maurizio Nicolelli, Senior Vice President Finance; and FactSet\u2019s new Chief Financial Officer, Helen Shan. And now, I'd like to turn the discussion over to Phil. Phil Snow : Thanks, Rima. Good morning to everyone in the U.S. and good afternoon to those joining us here in the UK. We ended fiscal '18 on many high notes and are very proud of all the accomplishments that our employees around the globe have contributed to this year. FactSet celebrated 40 years early this month. Much has changed since 1978 when we started with two employees to now over 9,500 employees in 24 countries. What remains consistent is our pledge to our clients to be the standard for world-class solutions, the promise to our employees to be the career destination for the best and brightest and the commitment to our shareholders to continue to return value. Very few companies can claim 38 years of consecutive revenue growth and 22 years of adjusted diluted EPS growth. FactSet has achieved these milestones by setting the global standard for how financial data is delivered, integrated and consumed by the investment community. Throughout 2018, we continue to diversify our suite of solutions through the integration of our acquisitions and new product investments. This resulted in a number of new landmark achievements opening up new markets to us. We deepened our relationship with many existing clients and we added approximately 400 net new clients and over 3,000 users during our fiscal year. We won a deal to provide solutions to over 15,000 advisors at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, one of the largest wealth managers in the world and a testament to the strength of our growing wealth offering. We enhanced our multi-asset class risk models leading to several wins and strengthening our position in the analytics market. And lastly, we expanded our CTS business and launched a new platform to address the growing demand for alternative data. This quarter, we reported a new high watermark for organic ASV at 39 million. Organic ASV growth came in at 5.7%, an improvement from 5.3% in the third quarter. A quick note on ASV. In the past, we have excluded the change in professional services from our change in ASV. However, it is an important component of our sales goals. The sales force is incentivized both on change in ASV and the change in professional services and to be consistent internally and externally going forward when we give guidance or refer to our top line growth rate, we will referring to ASV plus professional services. Professional services are relatively new area of growth for us and while it\u2019s still small, it grew at over 20% in fiscal 2018. Including professional services, our growth rate came in at 5.9%. Earlier this year at Investor Day, we provided you with our ASV breakout with growth rates for our various workflow solutions. Towards the end of the year, we realigned a few pieces within these workflows. The biggest change is that a portion of portfolio management and trading now sits under analytics. We believe this alignment is better suited for delivering a comprehensive solution for the portfolio lifecycle. Moving on to other key metrics, organic revenue grew over 5% and adjusted operating margin for the fourth quarter and full year came in at 31.3%, a 30-basis point improvement from our third quarter. Our actions to streamline parts of our organization and optimize costs gave us some benefit this quarter but we expect additional benefits in fiscal '19. We remain focused on increasing margin in 2019 and plan to deliver a 100-basis point margin increase. This fiscal year, adjusted diluted EPS increased 16% to $2.20, boosted in part by the U.S. tax reform. The $39 million increase in ASV this quarter was across all our workflow solutions. In research, the growth in workstations fueled by seasonal banking hires was the largest contributor. Analytics was a close second with increased sales and portfolio analytics, reporting and risk. Additionally, our unique content data piece propelled CTS to its highest quarter ever. ASV from new and existing clients increased year-over-year with the Americas region bringing in the most new business. Cancellations remained relatively flat this quarter versus a year ago, a trend we have observed over the last few quarters. Turning to our geographic breakdown, our Americas organic ASV growth improved this quarter to over 5% showing signs of stability as cancellations improved once again. Outside the Americas, ASV grew organically by 6% with Asia-Pac growing over 11% and Europe growing at 5%. Higher cancellations this quarter versus last year weighed down the overall international growth rate. Despite this challenge, Asia-Pac had one of its biggest ASV quarters ever. In conclusion, we\u2019re pleased with our year-end results and to start 2019 with strong momentum. As we look ahead to fiscal '19, we believe we are well positioned to capture additional market share in this challenging market. Throughout this past year, we continued to return value to shareholders through our share buyback program and increased dividend. We repurchased approximately 330,000 shares for 68 million during the fourth quarter under our existing share repurchase program. Over the last 12 months, we have returned over $390 million to stockholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. This represents an average cash return of 91% as a percentage of free cash flow and proceeds from employee stock plans. Before I turn the call over to Maurizio and Helen, let me first welcome Helen Shan, our new CFO who has been with us since early September. And I want to say a special thank you to our outgoing CFO Maurizio Nicolelli who has been an instrumental member of our leadership team and has contributed greatly to FactSet\u2019s success. During his tenure leading finance, we have more than doubled our ASV and tripled adjusted diluted EPS. Let me now turn the call over to Maurizio one last time to talk in more detail about our financial results followed by Helen who will talk you through our guidance for fiscal '19. Maurizio Nicolelli : Thank you, Phil, and good morning to everyone on the call. We are pleased with our fourth quarter results ending the year with solid metrics. Versus our guidance, we ended the year with 6% organic ASV growth and 11% revenue growth. Our GAAP operating margin came in below our guidance due to certain one-time charges related to restructuring and corporate costs not accounted for in the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating margin for the full year was 31.3%. As discussed on previous calls, with the additional cash savings from the tax reform, we made purposeful decisions to make further investments in higher growth businesses. We saw some of this momentum build up in our fourth quarter with the highest ever ASV. This increase in ASV also drove higher compensation which in turn impacts our near-term margins. Let\u2019s now go through our fourth quarter results. GAAP revenues in the fourth quarter increased 6% to 346 million and 5% to 347 million on an organic basis versus the fourth quarter of 2017. Looking at our segment revenue, U.S. revenues grew 5% and international revenues increased 6% on an organic basis. This growth comes primarily as a result of higher sales across all our business lines. ASV increased to 1.39 billion at the end of our fourth quarter. Organic ASV increased approximately 6% year-over-year and 39 million since the end of our third quarter. This increase was primarily driven by higher research, workstation sales and analytics. Adjusted operating margins of 31.3% was 30 basis points higher since the third quarter of 2018 and 10 basis points better than last year as we continue to create more efficiencies in our cost structure. Looking at operating expenses in some detail now, operating expenses for the fourth quarter totaled 258 million, an increase of 5% year-over-year primarily driven by higher compensation expense and legal costs. Fourth quarter cost of services expressed as a percentage of revenues decreased by 40 basis points compared with the year ago period due to stock-based compensation acceleration in the prior year. The decrease was partially offset by restructuring costs, additional employee compensation and higher data costs. SG&A expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues were also up 10 basis points compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily higher compensation costs from severance and new hires and higher legal costs partially offset by lower stock-based compensation. Our client and workstation account were both up this quarter versus our fiscal third quarter of 2018. In the past three months, we added nearly a 170 net new clients and approximately 2,400 new users. The net new clients mainly came from institutional asset managers and wealth. We now have over 5,000 clients and over 91,000 users. Moving on to the tax rate, our quarterly effective tax rate was 18% compared with 25.3% a year ago primarily due to the U.S. tax reform that we discussed earlier in the year. Our annual effective tax rate was 18% which excludes the one-time deemed repatriation tax on historical repatriated foreign earnings to toll tax. GAAP EPS increased 16% to $1.77 this quarter versus a $1.52 in the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to the lower tax rate from the U.S. tax reform. Excluding intangible asset amortization, the deferred revenue fair value adjustment and other nonrecurring items, adjusted EPS also grew 16% to $2.20 this quarter. Free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending, for our fourth quarter was 91 million, an increase of approximately 2 million or 2% over the same period last year. The increase was due to a lower effective tax rate and an improvement in working capital items, partially offset by higher capital expenditures. Our CapEx grew due to the build out of new office space and technology upgrades. Next, we turn to our ASV breakout. As we showed you at our Investor Day, we think of our business in various workflow solutions. We realigned some of these workflow solutions, as Phil explained earlier. The changes to this breakout include moving a portion of PMT from research to analytics and reclassifying most of the workstations\u2019 ASV under the research business. As you can see on the slide, the growth rates from these workflow solutions are in line with what we showed at Investor Day highlighting that more than 50% of our business grew at a high-single and double-digit growth rate as we continue to manage the mix in our portfolio. Let me now turn the call over to Helen to discuss the outlook for our fiscal 2019. Helen Shan : Thank you, Maurizio, Phil and Rima and hello everyone. I\u2019m honored to be joining the FactSet team. I\u2019ve been a beneficiary of the FactSet offerings both as a banker and a corporate client. I\u2019ve only been here a short time, I\u2019m quickly learning about the portfolio lifecycle and the innovative solutions we are building for our clients and I believe we have a lot of opportunities ahead of us. I look forward to working with this team and to meeting many of you in the coming months. For our 2019 outlook, our views are predicated on a number of factors. We expect that macroeconomic conditions and global trends will essentially remain the same as we\u2019ve experienced in our fiscal 2018. We anticipate continued investment to offer a seamless portfolio lifecycle solution which we believe will provide sustainable growth in the future. And we believe growth will be propelled primarily through capturing a larger share of wallet from our existing client base through both cross-selling and upselling our higher value solutions. As Phil noted earlier, going forward we will provide top line guidance on both ASV and professional services on a combined basis. Organic ASV and professional services is expected to increase in the range of 75 million and 90 million over fiscal 2018. GAAP revenues are expected to be in the range of $1.41 billion and $1.45 billion. GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 29% and 30%. Adjusted operating margin is expected to be in the range of 31.5% and 32.5% reflecting the targeted improvement in operating efficiencies. The annual effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 17.5% and 18.5%. This range incorporates a full year with a lower corporate tax rate as a result of the U.S. tax reform. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $8.70 and $8.90. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects the absence of the 2018 toll tax charge. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $9.45 and $9.65. The midpoint of the adjusted EPS range represents over 12% growth compared to the prior year. As we look to 2019, we plan to execute on our strategies to continue to grow top line to optimize our cost structure. With that, we are now ready for your questions. Mike, I\u2019ll turn this call back over to you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Joseph Foresi : Hi. I wonder if we could start by talking about the Merrill Lynch deal. Is there any way to provide any color around some of the numbers associated with that deal? And how do you expect it to flow through the model? When will the \u2013 we\u2019d be able to see it in ASV and some of the other metrics on the revenue side? Phil Snow : Thanks, Joe. We were anticipating that might be the first question. So let me talk a little bit about the deal. We can\u2019t give you the exact numbers. But what I can tell you is it\u2019s an enterprise agreement. As you would expect for a client of that size and a commitment like this, it\u2019s a multiyear deal and it includes a lot of desktops. We disclosed the number in the press release and it also includes some feeds that we\u2019re providing them to go into their systems. What you should expect to see is us recognizing most of the ASV for this deal in the first half of the coming fiscal year. Joseph Foresi : Okay. And then \u2013 so I guess just for clarification purposes, is that included in guidance? So how should we think about the seasonality and the impact of margins? I just want to make sure that we\u2019re kind of modeling it appropriately. Thanks. Phil Snow : Yes, it\u2019s included in the total guidance number. Joseph Foresi : Thank you. Phil Snow : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. George Tong : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Your guidance includes the BAML contract. Can you discuss how your outlook for the underlying business excluding the BAML contract is currently trending relative to recent quarters, if it\u2019s consistent with recent growth excluding the new contract or if it\u2019s accelerating in growth? Phil Snow : Hi, George. It\u2019s Phil Snow. So we may be being a little bit conservative on our overall guidance. As I have mentioned on a lot of previous calls, we have pretty good visibility in halves of our fiscal year. There are a number of large deals that we\u2019re still waiting for decisions on within the first half. Some of those are renewals. And I guess as we get closer to the end of the first half, we may be in a position to give you some revised guidance at that point. But we didn\u2019t want to go out \u2013 we wanted to go out a little bit conservatively to start the year until we got more visibility on that. George Tong : Yes, it makes sense. And then on margins, you\u2019re still committed to 100 basis points of annual margin expansion. Can you talk about the near-term drivers for that margin improvement and potential drivers of upside or downside versus your expectations? Phil Snow : Absolutely. So we\u2019re absolutely targeting 100 basis points of margin expansion which would get us to 32.3%. And I can talk a little bit about what we\u2019re focused on there. One is just continued acquisition of the integration \u2013 to continue integration of the acquisitions we did. We feel that there\u2019s some efficiencies we can get there. We\u2019re looking at some of the larger parts of our business. We believe that there are some efficiencies there in terms of engineering content and so on. And Gene who\u2019s the new CTO, he\u2019s been looking at those areas. I think we\u2019ve done a lot of work in the last half of fiscal '18. We were expecting to get a little bit more benefit from that in Q4, but you should see that flow through into the first half of fiscal year '19. And I\u2019d like to sort of also remind people that halfway through FY '18 we sort of intentionally invested more in our business as a result of the U.S. tax reform. So we made some additional investments in risks. We also gave some compensation to our employees in certain locations for certain types of roles. And we did invest some money in the second half of last fiscal year for this BAML deal. So for a deal of this size, obviously, there\u2019s a lot of work that goes into it from an engineering standpoint, but we also staffed up pretty aggressively to make sure that we\u2019d be able to rollout to as many users as we\u2019ve talked about in a way that we were comfortable with. So we\u2019ve done that. That\u2019s going to be a lot of work for us this year. But that is expense that we\u2019ve made that we should get a payback from in the future. George Tong : Very helpful. Thank you. Phil Snow : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from David Chu from Bank of America. David Chu : Hi. Thank you and congratulations on the deal. So just in terms of your current outlook, if we assume 100 basis points of margin expansion in fiscal '19 and '20 like you suggested at the Investor Day, how should we think about margins beyond that? Do you think that it\u2019s going to stay at 33% to 34% range as you did historically where you managed to margins or could we see outsized growth beyond that? Phil Snow : We haven\u2019t modeled that far out, David. So thank you for the question and thank you for congratulating us on the deal. As we get more information as we get close, we\u2019ll think about that. But I think we \u2013 the guidance we\u2019ve given is for two years at this point. And if we decide to revise that, well of course we\u2019ll let you know. David Chu : Sure. Okay. And then just any update on the FactSet exchange marketplace. I just wanted to see if you\u2019re generating any revenue in earnest today and kind of how big of a revenue contributor should we expect for fiscal '19 and beyond? Phil Snow : Currently, we\u2019re expecting continued strong growth from CPS. We\u2019ve gotten tremendous feedback from the marketplace for the data exchange and the solutions exchange. And to remind everyone, the solutions exchange allows you to go into the open FactSet marketplace and begin testing and programming against the data in a hosted environment. So we\u2019re seeing tremendous interest in that. We have a lot of very large firms globally testing this out and we believe we\u2019ll begin to monetize this within fiscal year '19. But it\u2019s still early days. We\u2019re continuing to accelerate providers onto the platform and we\u2019re very optimistic about what it means over a multiyear period. David Chu : Okay, great. Thank you. Phil Snow : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Bill Warmington : Good morning, everyone. Phil Snow : Good morning. Bill Warmington : So for Maurizio I just want to say that that was the most upbeat financial presentation I think I\u2019ve ever heard him give and so wishing you happy trails. And then for Helen, welcome to the show. So first question is on the sell side ASV looked particularly strong this quarter. In fact, I think it\u2019s the strongest that we\u2019ve seen in eight quarters. So just wanted to ask what was behind that? Phil Snow : Hi, Bill. Thanks for the question. It\u2019s Phil Snow. So yes, we had a very strong year in banking. A lot of it was driven in the second half by just seasonal hiring in the banking group. So we reported we added a significant number of desktops in Q4 and a lot of those were from our banking users. And I think some of this also stems from the additional focus that we have in our strategic client group. So we\u2019ve talked about this a little bit but we\u2019ve sort of organized our sales team in a way where we\u2019ve got very high focus on our largest accounts both on the buy side and the sell side and I think that\u2019s also kind of helped there. Bill Warmington : Okay. And for my follow-up question, I wanted to ask about the key selling points in your [opinion][ph] in terms of the reasons that BAML made the decision they did to move from Thomson Reuters to FactSet and what I\u2019m specifically getting at is to try to get a sense for some of the biggest challenges that you\u2019re facing in terms of winning new clients and what you\u2019re doing to overcome them? Phil Snow : So I think in this case it really I think was a combination of the product that we have which is fantastic. We\u2019ve put a lot of work into FactSet over the last few years. It\u2019s not just for this wealth product but all of the work that we\u2019ve done to modernize our platform and program things in HTML and have more of a Web look-and-feel for our product really helped drive this. A big piece of that was the Google-like search functionality that we have in FactSet which makes it very easy to use. It\u2019s very easy to discover what\u2019s on our platform. The second thing is really our people and our service. So we got some of the best feedback we\u2019ve had for such a large deal in terms of going to all of these offices during the trial and I think it was the combination of those two things that really gave them the confidence to make what was a big decision for them to move. Bill Warmington : Thank you very much for the insight. Phil Snow : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie. Hamzah Mazari : Good morning. Thank you. The first question is just around potential to move into other markets. You\u2019re obviously moving into wealth but curious if there\u2019s an initiative or any focus on either insurance verticals, the corporate side. As you look at your business longer term, do you see opportunity in other markets or this is largely sort of buy-side, sell-side going forward? Phil Snow : That\u2019s a great question, Hamzah. Historically, we\u2019ve not broken out other client types other than buy-side and sell-side. We have a lot of client types in the buy-side bucket. And we\u2019ve done exceptionally well with insurance companies since we became more of a multi-asset class product. So our fixed income offering combined with our risk offering, which just continues to get better by leaps and bounds, that\u2019s helped us in insurance. It\u2019s a fast growing market segment for us. And we\u2019ve been quietly growing our corporate business very quickly. So part of that is through great partnerships we have with other firms but we also sell directly into the corporate space. So these aren\u2019t massive parts of FactSet today but to your point I think it opens up a good opportunity for us as a company as our product suite evolves. The other thing I\u2019ll point to is our open strategy. So we\u2019re unbundling our product in a way that is very compelling for the marketplace not just for large banks and asset managers, but we can now deliver pieces of FactSet in lots of different interesting ways which opens up opportunities for us at the big firms with the technology group, conversations that we wouldn\u2019t have had a few years ago but I think it also opens up conversations for us with the types of firms that you just mentioned in your question. Hamzah Mazari : Got you. Thank you. And a follow-up question just around \u2013 you mentioned sort of client cancellations flattening out. You\u2019ve said that a few times I guess. Just curious how are you thinking about buy-side consolidation? Is that a headwind that\u2019s now behind you guys? Just any views how you think about that and maybe just how that impacted your business the last few years. Is it two subscriptions going to one? Is it as simple as that or any thoughts on buy-side consolidation would be helpful? Thank you. Phil Snow : So I think we\u2019ll continue to see some buy-side consolidation. I think some of what you saw in our European growth rates slowing a little bit this quarter had to do with two large consolidations that happened in Europe. So active managers continue to be under pressure for a number of reasons. They\u2019re looking for efficiency. Some of that is combining forces to go after the market. So we\u2019re here to help those clients, get them through an integration and hopefully build a good relationship and grow from there. But we don\u2019t anticipate that it\u2019s over. It\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been dealing with for a number of years now and feel like we\u2019re getting better at in terms of providing more solutions to clients. So that\u2019s part of our whole portfolio lifecycle. If someone is consolidating and we can provide solutions all the way across from research to client reporting, we feel like we have a good opportunity. Hamzah Mazari : Great. Thank you. Phil Snow : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from Glenn Greene from Oppenheimer. Glenn Greene : Good morning. So first, Phil, on \u2013 it was helpful to get the ASV splits at the end of the year and obviously sort of showing the strength in CTS, analytics and wealth. Is there any reason to think that those sort of directional growth trends, meaning sort of high-single, low-double digit in analytics and wealth and maybe high teens in CTS, should that persist throughout fiscal '19 any reason to think that changes? Phil Snow : I think we\u2019re anticipating very similar growth rates for the coming year. We obviously are focused on growing all of these businesses and focused on having a strategy to grow each of them. And I think the way that we\u2019ve organized now \u2013 as we\u2019ve organized now as we\u2019ve gotten bigger really gives us an opportunity to do that. But these are big numbers. They\u2019ve got good momentum and I would expect to see similar growth rates for the coming year. Glenn Greene : And just a quick clarification on the BAML deal, was that \u2013 is the ASV for that included within the year-end number specifically within the wealth ASV number that grew 10%? And a follow up on that would be if that\u2019s the case, I\u2019m surprised it was only 10%? Phil Snow : Yes, so as I mentioned earlier on the call, we\u2019re going to recognize most of the ASV for this deal in the first half of the coming fiscal year. Glenn Greene : So it\u2019s \u2013 I read that\u2019s mean as revenue. So you\u2019re going to \u2013 it\u2019s not reflected in the ASV currently is what you\u2019re saying? Phil Snow : We did book a little bit in Q4 but the majority of it is getting booked in the first half of 2019. You\u2019ll see that in our Q1 and Q2 numbers. Glenn Greene : Great. Thanks for clarifying. Phil Snow : Sure. You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : Hi. Good morning. Phil Snow : Good morning, Toni. Toni Kaplan : Are there sizeable wealth deals in the pipeline that you\u2019re anticipating you could actually close? Phil Snow : So over many years, absolutely. These are large deals. There\u2019s a number of them out in the marketplace and I think for the reasons I\u2019ve stated earlier in terms of our products and our people and our focus, it\u2019s obviously something we\u2019re focused on. This deal has gotten us a lot of good interest not just from the largest wealth managers globally but the wealth market in general. I think it has really put us on the map in a different way. So we do anticipate that this deal will help drive the wealth business moving forward. And we\u2019ve put in a tremendous amount of work in FY '18 to get this deal. So it really accelerated frankly the development of our wealth product which means good things for every wealth manager. Toni Kaplan : Okay, great. And then could you give us what you\u2019re assuming on interest expense in the guidance? Helen Shan : We have some of \u2013 you might presume increases in underlying interest rates, but not material. So it\u2019s probably in line with what you\u2019ve seen in \u2013 what we\u2019ve reported in 2018. Toni Kaplan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Gregory Bardi : Hi. This is actually Greg calling on for Manav. Just wanted to talk about the sales cycle. I think you\u2019ve talked about it in the past recently as getting a little bit longer as you move into the enterprise-wide arrangements. Just what you\u2019re seeing there in terms of closing new deals and are you seeing any lengthening of the cycle as you continue to go through these larger deals? Phil Snow : Hi, Greg. So there\u2019s a wide spectrum. You saw us close a well over 150 new accounts in Q4 and some of those coming very quickly if they\u2019re smaller. But yes, the larger deals \u2013 BAML is a great example, something like that can be well over a 12-month commitment in terms of going from RFP to a signed contract. And as our product gets more complicated, it can be longer. But I don\u2019t have anything meaningful to give you in terms of what\u2019s \u2013 nothing\u2019s really materially changed in the last three to six months. Gregory Bardi : Okay, that makes sense. And then in terms of M&A interest, a bunch of the assets that you\u2019ve acquired over the last 12, 24 months are starting to get integrated. Just wondering about your interest in M&A and what you\u2019re seeing in the market. Phil Snow : So we continue to be opportunistic. We\u2019re always interested in content. I think the open FactSet marketplace allows us to integrate content at a much faster rate than we have historically where FactSet doesn\u2019t actually have to own their content. But we will look at unique content that we think we can monetize ourselves in a better way. We\u2019re also looking at anything that\u2019s interesting from a technology standpoint that might help us with our open strategy. We\u2019re looking at some smaller stuff there. But beyond that we feel like we have a very good lineup in terms of what we need to deliver growth over the next few years. Gregory Bardi : Okay. Thank you. Phil Snow : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Peter Heckmann from Davidson. Peter Heckmann : Good morning. My question has been answered but could you review with us the average price increase that you saw in fiscal '18 and what type of price increases might be contemplated in fiscal '19? Phil Snow : I think over the entire fiscal year, we probably captured somewhere between 1% and 2%, that\u2019s typical and we don\u2019t see that changing in FY '19. We think it\u2019s pretty similar. Peter Heckmann : Okay. And then if you\u2019d humor me with a follow up then, within the sub niche of wealth management for the current part of the sub niche that you have a solution for, how would you size that total addressable market? And I would assume that you would say that you\u2019re market share there is lower than it is across the entire data and services landscape? Phil Snow : So I\u2019m not sure I caught all of that, but the wealth market is large. I think before we closed this current deal, I think we were sizing the ultra-high network market that we were going at to close to $0.5 billion. And I think the acquisition of FDSG which happened I think about a year and a half ago now and the work we\u2019ve done here makes that a much bigger number. So we\u2019ve got massive amounts of runway in terms of growing the wealth business. Peter Heckmann : Got it. Thank you. Phil Snow : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Keith Housum from Northcoast Research. Brendan Popson : Thank you. This is actually Brendan on for Keith. I just want to ask what some of these adjustments and the non-GAAP adjustments, there\u2019s a little I guess a bit more room than we anticipated and there\u2019s some more in guidance too for next year. Just wondering if you could speak anymore to those, what exactly some of those costs are and if that\u2019s something we should anticipate as kind of recurring down the road or if this is just something that you\u2019re seeing for next year? Thank you. Maurizio Nicolelli : Yes, sure. This is Maurizio. So in the fourth quarter you saw a number of items come through in the nonrecurring range and so we went through a restructuring effort during the fourth quarter which really will help us going into fiscal '19 with our margin improvement. And so you saw a lot of those costs get booked during the fourth quarter. And we had a number of legal matters that got concluded during the period that got expensed as one-time items during the quarter. There will be these items going forward and so our best estimate is in our guidance now going forward. Brendan Popson : All right, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Peter Appert from Piper Jaffray. Peter Appert : Thanks. So, Phil, you haven\u2019t given us obviously the specifics on the size of the Merrill contract but I\u2019m wondering if ex-Merrill, the 6% in ASV that you\u2019re guiding to for next would actually imply maybe a little bit of slowdown in sort of underlying ASV growth? Phil Snow : So as I mentioned earlier, Peter, we\u2019re being conservative going into the first half just given that there are a number of large deals that we\u2019re aware of that we don\u2019t have full visibility on yet. If we \u2013 once we get through that I think we\u2019ll be in a better position to give you some revised guidance potentially at the end of the second half \u2013 end of the first half, I apologize. Peter Appert : I\u2019m wondering if \u2013 sort of related to that I guess, in the context of your win, are you seeing more aggressive response from competitors? I guess your commentary on whether the intensity of the competitive environment and the pricing pressures that we\u2019ve seen for a while is more evident now? Phil Snow : I don\u2019t think so. I think it\u2019s consistent with what we\u2019ve seen over the last few years. Peter Appert : Okay. Thank you. Phil Snow : Thank you. Operator : And the next \u2013 last question come from Tim McHugh from William Blair. Tim McHugh : Hi. Thanks. Just wanted to ask on the professional services I guess the decision to include that back into the growth I guess \u2013 I understand that comment that it\u2019s always included in the conversation, but I think that was true last year or so. I guess why the change in opinion on that? And you mentioned it\u2019s growing 20%. I guess what is the growth driver of that? Why is it growing quickly for you guys right now? Phil Snow : Yes, so this is a new area for us. When we began to implement our own risk models, we began to generate a little bit of revenue from professional services. But a number of the acquisitions we did which were more workflow and software-based than content came with groups that have professional services. So it\u2019s not a massive part of our business but we think it\u2019s something that we can rationalize. And as we move forward and our product becomes multifaceted and requires longer implementation, it\u2019s something that we want to kind of build up our competence around. So it is a bigger piece of what the sales force focuses on these days. Obviously, we want to incent and align properly with them. I believe we\u2019ll still be breaking out professional services. So if you want to calculate the ASV growth rate the way that we\u2019ve calculated it historically, you\u2019ll still be able to do that. Tim McHugh : Okay, thanks. And then just a follow up on the margin comments just to be clear. So when you talk 100 basis points of expansion, I guess the midpoint of the range for the full year is not at that level. So are you talking exit rate? Is that the comment? And I guess trying to understand that about the cadence of margins across the year? Phil Snow : What we\u2019re talking about is a full year margin of 32.3% that we\u2019re targeting. Tim McHugh : Okay. Is it just because middle of the guidance is 32.0% or something, correct? Phil Snow : Correct, yes. It\u2019s a wide range. Tim McHugh : Okay, all right. Thank you. Phil Snow : Thank you. Operator : And I will now turn the call back over to Phil Snow, CEO. Phil Snow : All right. Well, thank you everyone for joining us on the call today. If you have additional questions, please call Rima Hyder. We look forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator, that ends today\u2019s call. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Matthew, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the FactSet First Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Rima Hyder, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Rima Hyder : Thank you, Matthew, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FactSet's first fiscal quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I would like to point out that the slides we will reference during the course of this presentation can be accessed via the webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at factset.com. The slides will be posted on our website at the conclusion of this call. A replay of today's call will be available via phone and on our website. The conference call is being transcribed in real-time by FactSet's CallStreet service and is being broadcast live at factset.com. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions from investors. [Operator Instructions] Before we discuss our results, I encourage all listeners to review the legal notice on Slide 2, which explains the risks of forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the Appendix to the presentation and in our earnings release issued earlier today. Joining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer; and Helen Shan, Chief Financial Officer. Now I'd like to turn the discussion over to Phil. Philip Snow : Thanks, Rima, and good morning to everyone. We began fiscal '19 with a positive first quarter and are encouraged by the continuing demand for our data and technology offerings. Clients are turning to us for smarter, better connected solutions to drive their investment workflows. Our Wealth business drove higher results than usual for the quarter with strong support from our Content and Technology Solutions, or CTS business. We entered the year with good momentum and a strong product pipeline to execute on our growth strategy, but remained cautiously optimistic given the current uncertainty in global markets. This quarter, we delivered ASV and professional services of $11 million. This includes both organic ASV and professional services for a total of $1.42 billion and a growth rate of 6.6%. As we explained last quarter, professional services are a component of our sales goals, and as a reminder, when we give guidance or refer to our top line growth rate, we will be referring to ASV plus professional services. Moving on to other key metrics. Organic revenue grew over 6% and adjusted operating margin for the first quarter came in at 31.5%, 20 basis points better than the fourth quarter of 2018. We continue to target a 100 basis point margin improvement year-on-year as we get benefits from greater productivity from ongoing investment in solutions and infrastructure and tighter expense management. This fiscal year, adjusted diluted EPS increased 15% to $2.35, primarily boosted by the U.S. tax reform and higher revenues this quarter. Wealth and CTS were the two largest drivers of ASV growth this quarter. Last quarter, we said that we expected most of the impact of the Bank of America Merrill Lynch wealth deal to come in the first half of our fiscal 2019 and the majority of the incremental impact to ASV came in this quarter. CTS or increased sales of enterprise fees and trials of FactSet data exploration, a cloud-based data platform we launched this past summer [Technical Difficulty] demand. Open:FactSet, our marketplace for unique and diversified datasets, continues to capture growing client interest with ESG and sentiment data feeds garnering the most attention. In research, workstations grew this quarter mainly from adding more buy-side and corporate users. This was partially offset by seasonal churn in banking, which is typical at this point in the year. Analytics started the year with softer results relative to last year, but we're excited about our analytics product pipeline as we head further into 2019. New solutions include opening up our portfolio analytics suite through APIs, a unified risk platform and the vault. We also see continued success with risk, adding a number of new Multi-Asset Class clients this quarter. We believe our analytics solutions will result in higher growth in the quarters ahead. We were aware of a few larger cancellations coming into the quarter and outside of these, the rate of churn remained flat and in line with last year. Our sales teams, particularly in the Americas region has worked hard to minimize the rate of cancellations and their efforts have improved client retention in our largest region, and our overall client retention remains very high at over 95%. We've enjoyed high client retention for many years and we're seeing that clients want to partner with us for the next generation of smarter workflow solutions. A recent example of this is within our research group. This quarter, we launched the first of our deep sector strategy solutions by introducing detailed banking industry data and are encouraged by its initial demand. We're excited about this product and plan to go deeper into other sectors over time. Turning to our geographic break down. Our America's organic ASV growth rate improved this quarter to over 6%, EMEA experienced faster growth than the prior quarter at over 5% and Asia Pac continued its double-digit growth rate growing at over 10%. In summary, we're pleased with our performance this quarter and excited about the opportunities we have for the remainder of 2019. We're keeping a close eye on headwinds and client cost pressures, but remain very well positioned given our expanding and innovative product suite and industry-leading client service. Our strategy and philosophy of providing open and flexible solutions is resonating with the market and is proving to be a compelling value proposition for our clients. Let me now turn the call over to Helen to talk in more detail about our financial results. Helen Shan : Thank you, Phil, and good morning. It is great to be here with all of you with a full quarter now under my belt. We're off to a solid start in fiscal 2019. We delivered growth in organic ASV plus professional services of over 6%, improved our margin from the fourth quarter by 20 basis points and grew adjusted EPS by 15%. Beginning with this quarter, we adopted the new accounting rule, ASC 606, revenue from contracts with customers, which did not have a material impact on our financial results. I will now go through how we performed in the first quarter. Revenues increased 7% to $352 million on a GAAP basis and over 6% to $353 million on an organic basis versus the prior year. The growth was driven primarily by wealth and CTS. For our geographic segment, Americas revenue grew above 6% and international increased 7%, organically. Americas was largely driven by wealth through higher cross-selling both to existing and new clients, while international was driven by analytics and CTS. ASV plus professional services increased to $1.42 billion at the end of our first quarter. Organic ASV increased by more than 6% year-over-year and $11 million since the end of the fourth quarter. This increase was primarily driven by wealth and CTS. Our GAAP operating margin increased by 150 basis points over the prior year to 28.6%. Adjusted operating margin was at 31.5%, an improvement from the fourth quarter of 2018, but lower than the prior year by 20 basis points. Operating expenses for the first quarter totaled $251 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year, primarily driven by higher employee benefits, data costs and infrastructure investments. However, as a percentage of revenue, costs were lower on a year-over-year basis. Breaking this down further. Cost of services, expressed as a percentage of revenues, decreased by 170 basis points compared with the prior year as a result of higher revenues and lower compensation expense. The higher productivity from the restructuring actions last year had a favorable impact in the quarter. These lower expenses were partially offset by increased spend directly related to revenue such as variable data costs and hiring needed for enterprise deals. SG&A expenses, expressed as a percentage of revenues, were in line with the prior year. Lower employee related costs and marketing expenses were partially offset by increased spend in professional fees, higher bad debt expense and travel and entertainment costs. Moving on to tax. Our effective tax rate was 12.1% this quarter compared to 18.3% a year ago, largely due to the U.S. tax reform. Our tax liability this quarter was significantly impacted by divesting the restricted stock and the exercises of employee stock option and the refinement of our prior year toll tax charge. Keep in mind that in our annual guidance for our tax rate, we included an estimated amount for our stock-based compensation benefit. There's still uncertainty with regard to the U.S. tax reform and hence we maintain our guidance of 17.5% to 18.5%. GAAP EPS increased 23% to $2.17 this quarter versus $1.77 in the first quarter of 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to the lower tax rate, partially offset by higher interest expense. Excluding intangible asset amortization, the deferred revenue fair value adjustment and other nonrecurring items, adjusted EPS grew 15% to $2.35. Free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending, was $37 million for the quarter, a decrease of approximately $18 million over the same period last year. The drivers here include an increase in receivables, timing of payments, higher annual employee bonuses and higher capital expenditures for the build out of new office space and technology upgrade. This decrease is partially offset by higher revenue and a lower effective tax rate. Our client and workstation counts were both up this quarter versus our fiscal fourth quarter of 2018. Our client count increased by 155 and was primarily driven by a change in our methodology, whereby we now include clients from the April 2017 acquisition of Interactive Data Management Solutions. We also added new sell-side and corporate clients this quarter. We added over 23,000 users driven by wealth. We now have approximately 5,300 clients and over 115,000 users crossing the 100,000 mark for the first time in the company's history. Looking at our share repurchase program. We repurchased 275,000 shares in the quarter for $60 million at an average share price of $220. We have 181 million remaining in our share repurchase program. We remain confident about our outlook for 2019 and are reaffirming the guidance given on our fourth quarter call. As we look ahead to the remainder of this fiscal year, we continue to make investments to drive business growth, to optimize our cost structure and to return long-term value to our shareholders. With that, we are now ready for your questions. Matthew, back over to you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. Joseph Foresi : Hi. I wonder if you could start by talking about the market\u2019s had some recent volatility. How has that impacted demand? It sounded like the buy-side was good, but there's some investment banking churn and any thoughts on how that activity or that volatility could play out in 2019? Philip Snow : Hi, Joe. It's Phil Snow. Yes, definitely there's been some volatility in the market. I'm not sure we've seen sort of any difference really in the end markets up to this point. That doesn't mean if it continues that we wouldn't see that, but it's not really changed things. I think we're still seeing strong demand for our products and our sell-side business is actually pretty healthy. We saw good addition of new clients on the sell-side. The amount of churn that we saw was actually a little bit better, I think, than it was last year in banking. So we're - overall, we're encouraged by what we're seeing in banking and we continue to build out and release new product to that segment of the market. And we also saw an uptick in the sell-side research users this quarter versus the same quarter last year. Joseph Foresi : Okay. That's helpful. And then I know you held to this idea of expanding margins 100 basis points per year. Maybe you can break down the drivers of that 100 basis point margin improvement in '19? And where you're expecting it to come from so we can get a good sense of how achievable the target is? Thanks. Helen Shan : This is Helen. Thanks for your question. Let me talk a bit about Q1 and that, hopefully will help lead to talking about what we think for the year. We're executing on growing our business and managing our expenses tightly. The sequential improvement from Q4 reflects those actions. This quarter, we had some expense drivers related to employee-related costs such as medical and upgrade in technology stack, but there are costs also related tied closely to revenue, such as data costs and increased hiring to support new client wins. But for us, it's about really maintaining a tight control on costs. We're seeing, as I said, some positive impact from some of the actions that we took at the end of last year and that's coming through as well as continued benefits from integrating our acquisitions. Joseph Foresi : Okay. Thank you. Helen Shan : Welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Toni Kaplan : Good morning. So I know you mentioned that the majority of the BAML contract is now in ASV. Is there any sort of additional contract value that you would expect that's not yet realized, meaning, is like are all the workstations in there, but maybe not all of the feeds or just any sort of additional color on what we could expect in future quarters? Or maybe just like you said, the majority is already in there? So any color would be\u2026 Philip Snow : Yes, the majority is in there. But like - thanks, Toni, but with any large clients, we always have lots of cross-sell opportunities that are available. So I think it's deepened our relationship with that particular firm and that's our strategy when we work with lots of other firms. But in terms of sort of the users, and so on, you're right that this was an enterprise deal, a multi-year deal, and that most of it has been recognized already in - from an ASV standpoint. Toni Kaplan : Okay. And just directionally because I know you don't want to give us the actual incremental size of it. But excluding the contract, would your organic ASV has decelerated this quarter or how should we just think about directionally? Philip Snow : So I think the core clients on the buy-side and the sell-side are very healthy. So there were a couple of lumpy things in there this quarter. As I've talked about before, we do have an FP&A business, which we sell FactSet and content and some other pieces of our product offering to other types of firms, and this was one of those quarters where there was some lumpy stuff in there. But yes, overall, we're very encouraged by the underlying trends that we see on the buy-side and the sell-side, and our products suite across all of our different business lines is resonating. Toni Kaplan : Great. And just for my follow up, your employee count increased by just under 2% this quarter. It's like the lowest that we've seen it. Could you just give some additional color on what areas where you've slowed in terms of hiring, whether it be sales force or product development or back-office? That would be very helpful. Thank you. Philip Snow : Yes, I don't think there's any one particular area that we're cutting back on. I think we're just sort of looking at our business and trying to be the most efficient that we can across the different business lines. Toni Kaplan : Thank you. Philip Snow : Yeah. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. Good morning. Phil, I just wanted to clarify, you talked about, I think, how you were aware of several closures coming into the quarter, but then, the - I guess, the incremental closures were in line with the case of last year. So I'm just trying to - I was just hoping if you could give a little bit more color in terms of maybe what you've assumed in your guidance, I suppose. Philip Snow : Yes. So I think I did mention - thanks, Manav, in Q4, that there were some - we have a lot of multiyear agreements with large firms and there are a fair number of those that we were renegotiating. So I'd say, we're encouraged by sort of how that's trending, which I think gives us confidence that we will still be in the same range that we guided you to from a top line standpoint. And as we get further into Q2 on our next call, if we have more information to share, then we can - we could talk about it then. But I think, overall, there's - there are a large number of these and we're feeling pretty good about how we're doing. Manav Patnaik : Okay. And then could you also just elaborate on why analytics maybe started out softer than you would've thought? And why you're confident that it'll make up in the rest of the year? Philip Snow : Yes. So in Q1, as you know, it's typically a lighter quarter. So that could -- for any of our businesses, it could end up being that Q1 just is not as material as it was the previous year. Analytics is doing really well ahead a very strong Q4. So there was a lot of deals that closed at the end of the fiscal year. We did sell, I think, 8 of our Multi-Asset Class risk solutions in Q1. So that was obviously a product that we're very excited about, risk in general. We released version 2 of our MAC model and that's resonating really well with the clients. So it's a broad product suite. A lot of the acquisitions that we did are in that group, and we're getting those integrated and we're really excited about the product pipeline as we moved through the year and sort of what that group can achieve for us. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. Your line is open. Hamzah Mazari : Good morning. Thank you. My first question is, just any color you can give as to how correlated you think your business is to headcount growth in both buy-side and sell-side relative to the last cycle? And the reason I ask is, your mix has shifted to workflows. There's some other stuff probably going on that maybe makes your business more resilient relative to headcount growth, but maybe you want to add some color there? Philip Snow : Yes. Hamzah, thanks for the question. Yes, I think, you're right on the money that our business over time has become less correlated to headcount growth as we move from workstation to workflow. You saw our CTS business do very well this quarter, and CTS typically is not as correlated to headcount as users are, but we did see great uptick in our users this quarter. We're really encouraged by what we're seeing in wealth. I think the deal that we did there, I think, just paves the way for us to do more of those types of deals, and we're seeing a lot of interest. And all of the work that we're doing to put deeper sector content into the workstation, all the work that we're doing from a technology standpoint to sort of light up the workstation for FactSet. All of that's really positive and we're seeing good demand for that -- for our products across users as well as on the technology side for workflow. So we're hitting it from both sides. Hamzah Mazari : Okay. Great. And my follow-up question is just around potential client outsourcing opportunities. I think you had mentioned that, that may be an area that sort of not baked into your overall addressable market and as well you had talked about potentially some more front-office opportunities as you look at ASV growth long term. So just curious on those two items, outsourcing opportunity and front-office work, what you're seeing there or is that a sort of an early innings? Thank you. Philip Snow : Yes. So I think when you say outsourcing opportunity, maybe you mean FactSet going through other third parties and what we've called SP&A [ph] is that right? Hamzah Mazari : Right, right. Philip Snow : Yes. So I think a lot of opportunities do exist. As we unbundle our product offering and go to market with more of an open strategy, we have more than just content feeds to offer now within the marketplace. So I think you're right. The buy-side and the sell-side, I think, are looking for innovative ways to consume value. We're delivering that through -- by ourselves by unbundling our offering and going to market in new and interesting ways, but that also gives us the opportunity to work with third parties that historically wouldn't have. So we're very collaborative firm. We're out there with talking to a lot of technology companies, a lot of firms in our space and our approach is to be open. So I think that is a good opportunity for us as we move forward and one that we're obviously focused on. And then, what was the second part of your question, sorry? Hamzah Mazari : Yes. The second part of the question was just, what you're seeing in terms of opportunities in the front office for FactSet? Philip Snow : Yes. So I would -- that was sort of what I was referring to a little bit with our analytics suite. So getting -- releasing our portfolio management platform, which you will see in the second half, where a portfolio manager essentially can turn FactSet from sort of a read-only experience to a read/write experience. And look at the holdings, model of trade, enter a trade, execute a trade, you can do a lot of those things in FactSet with the different pieces we have, but it's going to be kind of a really elegant, integrated solution through our front end. So we're -- I think, we're going to see a very positive response to that. We've had equity only sort of single trade out there for a little bit, but we're quickly building out Multi-Asset Class multi-portfolio, and I think that for us is going to give us a great opportunity to link traditionally what we've done with research through to the performance [indiscernible] and create that end-to-end solution that clients are looking for in this market. Hamzah Mazari : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is open. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Phil, I'm just trying to reconcile 23,000 incremental users with $5 million of incremental ASV. It's just - if you kind of do the math, it's like $18 a month per user. Is some of the ASV going into the professional services section of the ASV? Or how should I think about that? Is there to be counted as the user a different qualification versus being counted as ASV? Philip Snow : So the - I think the organic incremental ASV was more like $11 million. I think Helen can probably explain some things that went on there from an FX standpoint. So I think $5 million is understating it. And yes, within this segment of the wealth market, I think, the price is lower than traditionally what we've captured, but I think the opportunity that we get in terms of just getting a wider footprint of users of our product and the railroad tracks that lays down for us to kind of upsell within to that ecosystem is very compelling. Helen, do you want to hit the FX piece of it? Helen Shan : Sure. I think that - remember that the $11 million is made up of both ASV and professional services. So it's the combined number. And to Phil's point, that was on an organic basis, which, as you know, excludes the FX impact. With the FX, that's how the $5 million comes through. Philip Snow : And I think we've talked about this a little bit before, but I think looking at our business from an ASV per user metric, it is a difficult way to analyze our business just because we sell to so many different types of users and so many different types of clients. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. And then I just want to move a little bit towards the open.factset.com. Is the pace of new datasets coming on accelerating particularly from third parties? And is there any update you can give us a little bit more on client response and the opportunities there? Philip Snow : Sure. So there are two parts to that. One is what we call the data exchange. So we continue to add more third parties into that ecosystem. The 2 kind of areas that I alluded to in my comments earlier were we're seeing a lot of interest in the ESG and sentiment providers, in particular. And the data is also up there with all the FactSet's core content. So the other fees we've launched is something called data exploration. So within that ecosystem, you can come in and you can explore the data, all of it, and you can use products like tableau, you can code in python, and certainly it's sort of where a lot of the analysts of the future are going to be sort of doing their researches in an ecosystem like that. So we have seen a lot of interest. We've got a lot of people trialing this. It isn't material yet in terms of what it's delivering in ASV, but we're very encouraged by sort of what it means for the future. And just to add on, Shlomo, to your sort of question about the size of that deal and what it means. It's great for us to be in the big banks. It opens doors for us. I think, we're creating relationships that traditionally FactSet hasn't had, and it really allows us to cross-sell the suite of solutions that we have. We - traditionally, we've been a little bit more bottoms up in terms of how we sell. But as we develop relationships with these bigger firms at a higher level, I think, it means good things for our company. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Thank you very much. Philip Snow : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. I'd like to drill down into your underlying business, excluding the BAML contract. You've indicated that you saw some lumpiness in the quarter with ASV performance. If you include the impact of the lumpiness, can you discuss whether ASV organic growth was positive or negative in the quarter? And whether you foresee additional lumpiness that could impact organic ASV over the remainder of the year? Philip Snow : So it was positive. If you take out a couple of big things that happened, and as I mentioned, we're feeling encouraged by the negotiations that we're having for the large multi-year contracts that we have for the rest of the year. And just to restate it, feel pretty good about the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year and can give you more color at the end of Q2. Helen Shan : And one thing I would add, as we think about the business, we do think of BAML as part of our organic growth. I'm not sure whether -- when you think about taking it out, but the reality is, it is part of -- we put our resources towards that deal and it's just part of how we normally run our business. George Tong : Got it. That's helpful. And just as a follow-up, you've indicated that you have several large deals in the pipeline from both the renewal and new client perspective. Can you elaborate on how much of these large deals are renewals versus new clients? And then what assumptions on the conversion rate of these large deals you're incorporating into your full year guidance? Philip Snow : I mean, it's a really good mix of both, and we -- our sales team is really good, I think, about sort of weighting these from a probability standpoint. And it just gives us confidence in the guidance that we gave you in terms of what we're going to deliver. So we've got a very broad-based suite of products. We've got a broad-based client mix that we're going into. Some of these are large deals, but we have very good sort of middle market business and we close a lot of interesting small clients every year as well. So it's very diversified. George Tong : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks. Thanks for taking the question. Just a question on professional services, ASV that was pretty strong on a year-to-year basis. Should we expect that kind of momentum going forward? Or was that more related to the BAML deal? Philip Snow : You're asking specifically about professional services? Ashish Sabadra : Yes, yes, professional services, ASV, which was... Philip Snow : Yes. So that was a very small piece of our incremental ASV organic this quarter. It was well less than $1 million, and it wasn't material in Q1 of last year either. So most of what you saw in Q1 was subscription-based revenue on a forward-looking basis. Ashish Sabadra : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up -- a broader question on the competitive environment. Have you seen any change in the competitive environment either from Bloomberg getting more aggressive on the research or on sell-side firm or Thomson Reuters with [indiscernible] branded as Refinitiv, have you seen any change in dynamics there? Philip Snow : No, we're not seeing any material change in the competitive environment. So we still feel really good about how we're doing and taking - believe that we're taking market share from the majority of the competitors that are out there. Helen Shan : And just to make sure we clarify your question. There was -- BAML was not in our -- there's no professional services revenue from the BAML deal. Ashish Sabadra : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Chu with Bank of America. Your line is open. David Chu : Thank you. So Phil, you just mentioned that organic ASV ex BAML was positive if you take out a few big things that happened. Can you just speak to that? I mean, is it just that lumpiness of those particular projects? Or what else was, I guess, \"these big things in the quarter?\" Philip Snow : Yes. I spoke about one earlier, it was some activity within our SP&A [ph] business, which is not buy-side and not sell-side. If you are defining core as buy-side and sell-side, we're accelerated. David Chu : Okay. And then just in terms of margins, how should we think about the cadence of margin expansion over the course of the year? I mean, should we expect sequential improvements? Helen Shan : This is Helen. Thanks for your question. I think it depends a bit on the investments that we're making. We have investments that are more in the first half of the year. So we expect to see some greater - that's more of a timing perspective. And so I would say that we should expect steady improvement through the course of the year, but we don't - as you know, we give annual guidance and not quarterly guidance. David Chu : Got it. Thanks. Helen Shan : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Peter Appert : Good morning. A question for Helen. On the free cash flow conversion, a little bit depressed in the current quarter, you mentioned receivables and few other things. I'm wondering if the conversion rate to free cash flow's going to be a little bit different this year or is it going to be consistent with historic? Helen Shan : Right. Thanks for your question. So I think I would look at a number of things that we saw this quarter. We experienced higher levels of client receivables. We had timing of both vendor and tax payments that came through, higher employee bonuses, which as you know, come through we pay out in the first quarter and higher capital expenditures as well. And our CapEx is related to build out that we've got in outside the U.S. as we really prepare for further growth. So I wouldn't necessarily look at this quarter as something that is different, but we did have things that occurred that provides some of that volatility or seasonality. Peter Appert : Okay. But specifically you would think that free cash flow conversion - EBITDA out of free cash flow would be similar this year to historic levels? Helen Shan : Yes, I would, but we do have, like I said, some higher CapEx, as we're making investments back into the business. Peter Appert : Okay. And then Phil, you called up a - called out a fewer larger cancellations in the first quarter. I'm just wondering if there's any common theme in terms of the clients who choose to not renew in terms of -- is it generally about price, is it generally about specific other vendors, any commonality you can cite? Philip Snow : No. We have large deals with some clients that are SP&A related or not, and there's no theme that I can speak too. Peter Appert : And the first quarter - I mean, the cancellation rates in the first quarter, do you view them as unusual or just sort of typical business... Philip Snow : No, I don't. So I think if you look at the majority of our business, I think, we did well. Peter Appert : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Peter Heckmann with Davidson. Your line is open. Peter Heckmann : Hey, good morning. Most of my questions have been asked. I just wanted to follow up on one area within OMS, EMS systems on the trading desk. We've seen a bit of consolidation there with all three of your larger competitors changing hands over the last year. Have you seen any change in the competitive dynamics, maybe the buyer's trying to bundle those services, be it either for further accounting or funding [ph] administration services that might require you to change your marketing approach? Philip Snow : So this is a new area for us. So I think what we're seeing demand for is an integrated solution and consistent data and analytics, all the way from research through to performance reporting. So I think that's what we're good at. And when we made the acquisition of EMS and OMS, that's what we were most excited about was getting those integrated. So yes, we're seeing consolidation. I would say that our integration has not gone as quickly as we would've liked, but I feel really good about where it sits now, and the product that we have coming to market. And we are beginning to see more demand for our OMS product, in particular than we had over the last year. Peter Heckmann : Got it. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, and forgive me if I missed it. But in terms of just the timing of the one large Go Live during the quarter, did that happen first, second, third months of the quarter? Philip Snow : That's a good question. I don't have that exactly, and maybe Rima can answer that one for you later today. Peter Heckmann : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair. Your line is open. Tim McHugh : Hi, thanks. Just the numbers one to start. I guess, you said you changed the definitions, I guess, for the user and client count to include the digital business. So can you give us a clean number perhaps? I'm not sure how much those impacted those two metrics? Philip Snow : Sorry. Keith [ph] can you repeat that? Tim McHugh : Sorry. I believe you changed the definition of the client count, and I believe maybe user account as well to include an acquisition from the prior year, and so it's not kind of a clean comparison when we look at the sequential or year-over-year growth rate of those numbers. So I wasn't sure how -- if you could give us a clean number to adjust for that factor? Philip Snow : Yes. So the wealth - the majority of the new clients were wealth related to FDSG. Outside of that, I think, our clients that we added were 23 this quarter. And if you look at the mix of those, I think, it was heavily weighted towards sort of the banking area was up and corporate clients were up as well. Tim McHugh : Okay. And then, the mention of more renewals this year, and I guess, including through the second quarter this year, can you give us any sense how outside of the norm, I guess, is the renewal risk or opportunity, either way you want to look at it this year versus kind of a normal year for you? Philip Snow : I don't think it's that much different. I think we've got a lot of big clients and a lot of them come up for renewal every year. Tim McHugh : Okay. Thank you. Philip Snow : Thanks for the question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Keith Housum : Good morning. Just one question for you here, more on the international side of the business. If I look at how the international ASV has grown, I guess, this quarter compared to the, say, the past 8 quarters, it seems that the international growth has been kind of slowing down from the ASV perspective, any color on that? Are you guys reaching - maturing in those markets or international markets are more challenging than U.S. Just any color you can give on that growth? Philip Snow : Yes. Thanks for the question, Keith. So we continue to see double-digit growth in Asia. It was a little bit lighter than, I think, the previous quarter, but it's still over 10%. And again, Q1 is typically not a big quarter for us. And I think in Europe, we're actually doing pretty well. So I think it might have ticked up actually in Europe. And despite the environment over there, I think that we're encouraged by sort of the activity in what we're seeing. So - and by no means that we tapped out. I think there's tremendous opportunity for FactSet in general across the markets, and we're very excited about all of our opportunities globally. Keith Housum : Got you. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open. Alex Kramm : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Sorry to come back to the ASV bridge, but I quite frankly am still a little bit confused because I feel like there are a few different ways you've been talking about this. So if I just sit back, I think you said quarter-over-quarter, ASV increased $11 million, but if we look at the stated number, I think it's $5 million to $6 million. So I guess, $5 million-or-so FX headwind. So maybe you just confirm that. But secondly, if I then look at, excluding BAML, would quarter-over-quarter actually would have been negative or would have been positive on a stated basis. I know there were some losses, but on a stated basis, would have been positive or negative? Philip Snow : So I think you're right. They were about $5 million or $6 million in headwinds from an FX standpoint. And if you exclude some of the SP&A [ph] activity that I spoke about, we would have been positive. Alex Kramm : Right, but if the SP&A [ph] wasn't there, it would have been negative - forgetting about that impact for a minute, that brought it negative, I guess, is the point. Philip Snow : Yes. I think the thing to focus on is that we grew ASV by $11 million. And I think that's great, we grew. And if you try to think of BAML as non-core, I think that's the wrong way to think about it, like this is an iteration of our product suite that's opening up a new market for us. So I would focus on the fact that we're growing and that we're getting into new markets, and there's a lot of opportunity for the company. Alex Kramm : Yes. Totally agree. I think there was just a confusion, so I just wanted to clear that. Thank you. Secondly, on the wealth side, Phil, I think you made the point that you are getting a lot of incomings, I guess. And anecdotally speaking, we're hearing that too that this - it definitely raised the bar, the BAML deal. But maybe you can just talk about little bit more, the detail in terms of where they're coming from, what are you seeing, what are the discussions, but then also maybe talk a little bit more broadly about the go to strategy on wealth now because BAML is obviously the largest one out there. You have maybe two more firms above 10,000 and may be less than a handful in the mid thousands, and then you have a very, very long tail. So how is the sales approach actually now focused in terms of tapping really into wealth because it's a very diverse market? Philip Snow : Yes. It's a very diverse market, but this deal, I think, has provided great visibility for us and we're seeing a lot of interest. So you're right that there may be only a few firms that have greater than 10,000. But we're seeing very good interest from firms that have thousands of users. I think the product that we went to market with is really a step change in terms of what the functionality that the advisers now have access to. This is a long run way. I mean, these deals take a little while to get through. So I'm not sure I would anticipate big impact from it in FY '19, but I think as you look forward into FY '20, this could be, I think, a really positive thing for us in terms of our growth. Operator : Our next question - our last question, sorry, comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Bill Warmington : Good morning, everyone. So I wanted to ask about the Multi-Asset risk side. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the new wins there, give us some color in terms of the types of clients that are signing up and then also maybe a little color in terms of what competitors are losing the business? Philip Snow : Yes. Great question. So Multi-Asset Class risk, I think, we're seeing demand for that across our institutional asset management clients, both small, medium and large. We're seeing a lot of interest for it, asset owners globally. So those are the 2 primary firms that we're seeing interest from - types of firms. And I think the competitive market is, sometimes these are in-house solutions, sometimes that's the usual suspects. I think why people are coming to FactSet and why they're excited is, the integrated solution that we have and some of the innovative things that we're introducing to the market as a result of acquiring the Cognity team as part of our BISAM acquisition. So that's an exciting thing for us and we're seeing a lot of interest in that scenario that we continue to invest in. Bill Warmington : Excellent. Thank you very much for that color Philip Snow : Thank you. Thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. If you have additional questions, please call Rima Hyder. And we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator, that ends today's call. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. And you may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the FactSet Second Quarter 2019 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to avoid any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Rima Hyder, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Rima Hyder : Thank you, Stephanie, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FactSet\u2019s second fiscal quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I would like to point out that the slides we will reference during the course of this presentation can be accessed via the Webcast on the Investor Relations section of our Web site at factset.com. The slides will be posted on our Web site at the conclusion of the call. A replay of today\u2019s call will be available via phone on our Web site. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions from investors. To be fair to everyone, please limit yourself to one question plus one follow up. Before we discuss our results, I encourage all listeners to review the legal notice on Slide 2, which explains the risks of forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, please refer to our forms 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliation to the most directly comparably GAAP measures are in the appendix to the presentation and in our earnings release issued earlier today. Joining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer and Helen Shan, Chief Financial Officer. Now, I'd like to turn the discussion over to Phil. Phil Snow : Thanks, Rima, and good morning to everyone. We closed the first half of our fiscal year on a solid note. We continued our track record of steady growth with increases to our top line and bottom line as well as operating margin improvement. We executed well against our strategy of providing smarter connected data and technology solutions and saw positive results across all our businesses. Our broadening suite of innovative solutions continue to resonate with the market. We're laser-focused on working with our clients to drive efficiency in their processes and delivering content and analytics in new ways, all while providing FactSet's best-in-class service. We're encouraged by an increasing number of high-level conversations with our largest clients regarding our entire solution set as they navigate a challenging economic backdrop. In our second quarter, we increased our organic ASV and professional services at a growth rate of 6%. Organic revenue also grew 6% and adjusted operating margin came in at 33.2%, 180 basis point improvement year-over-year. We're pleased with our overall cost discipline allowing us to improve our margin and make meaningful progress towards our goal of 100 basis points improvement for the year. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 14% to $2.42, primarily due to stronger operating results. Turning to ASV. Analytics and CTS were the main drivers this quarter, along with the annual price increase for our Americas clients. Both analytics and CTS have been sources of growth for several years due to the competitive strength of our Analytics Suite and the increasing demand for high-quality integrated data in the marketplace. Within analytics, our core portfolio Analytics Suite had a strong quarter and provided our sales team with many opportunities to increase ASV with the existing clients. Analytics drove the majority of the increase this quarter. CTS was the second largest contributor in the second quarter as it continues to increase its sales of core data feeds such as FactSet Fundamentals. And within the Open :FactSet Marketplace, data exploration is removing friction from the trial and evaluation process to evaluate content. Wealth also had a positive quarter as it continues to expand and take market share. The brand's rollout at Merrill is complete and was successfully implemented in under 6 months. We believe the wealth team has a growing number of significant opportunities in this space. Within research, we saw a healthy increase in users on the sell-side. Additionally, we saw growth of our RMS solutions across both the buy side and sell side. We're also pleased with the results of the detailed banking sector data we rolled out last quarter. We've more than doubled the users for this new content and plan to add new content in other sectors. Lastly, our overall cancellation rate remains stable this quarter versus a year ago. Looking at our Americas and international businesses. Americas delivered a solid growth rate of 6%, driven by our leading analytics and expanded CTS offering. We also see an increase in enterprise discussions across our client base for our workflow solutions. The EMEA region grew 4% this quarter, primarily as a result of analytics and CTS. Cancellations in one market drove a decrease in the growth compared with the first quarter of 2019. We have a good pipeline for the second half of the year, and we believe we will reach our goals for this region. In Asia Pac, we had a strong second quarter with analytics and CTS, again, as the main drivers followed by research, resulting in an 11% growth rate for the region. Additionally, the cancellation rate in Asia Pac is also trending positive. We believe we have significant opportunities in various markets in Asia Pac, especially with CTS and analytics. As we close the first half of the year, we're pleased with our financial metrics and progress on ASV relative to last year. At the same time, we remain cautious as client cost pressures remain. For the second half of the year, we'll continue to execute on our 2019 goals and are making good progress integrating our products for a seamless investment portfolio life cycle platform, in enhancing our risk offering and unbundling our products to provide open and flexible solutions. Our broad suite of offerings is resonating well with clients who are looking to increase productivity through smarter connected data and gives us confidence in our growth trajectory. As I said before, it's important to look at our company performance on a half-yearly basis. We anticipate that our growth for the full fiscal year could be more concentrated towards our fourth quarter. We reaffirm our outlook for 2019 and look forward to a successful second half. Now let me turn the call over to Helen to talk in more detail about our financial results. Helen Shan : Thank you, Phil, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be here with you all again. We delivered a solid second quarter. Both organic revenue and organic ASV plus professional services grew at 6%. We expanded our GAAP and adjusted operating margin year-over-year and grew adjusted diluted EPS by 14%. As I go through this quarter's results, please keep in mind that our GAAP net income and EPS in the second quarter of our prior fiscal year were impacted by onetime tax expenses related to U.S. tax reform. I'll expand on this a little later when I report out on the tax rate. I'll now walk us through our second quarter. GAAP and organic revenue increased 6% to $355 million and $357 million, respectively, versus the prior year. The growth was driven primarily by analytics, CTS and wealth. Note that our solid first quarter ASV results are a contributor as prior period ASV is more fully recognized as revenue in the second quarter. For our geographic segment, Americas revenue grew 7% and international revenue grew 4% organically. Americas benefited from an increase in wealth, analytics and CTS. And international revenue was largely driven by analytics and CTS. ASV plus professional services increased to $1.44 billion at the end of our second quarter at a growth rate of 6% year-over-year and $21 million since the end of our first quarter. The growth was driven primarily by analytics and CTS and reflects our annual price increase in the Americas. The price impact was approximately $10 million, in line with prior year. Adjusted operating margin increased to 33.2%, 180 basis point improvement from the second quarter of 2018. This expansion is driven in part by tighter expense management and increased productivity. Some of this improvement comes from the restructuring efforts we took in prior quarters and the continued mix of resources between higher and lower-cost regions. Favorable movement in foreign exchange rates were a notable driver as the dollar strengthened against some of the currencies we are most exposed to, such as the pound sterling, the euro and the Indian rupee. We believe that we remain on target to achieve the 100 basis point margin expansion for the full year. Operating expenses for the second quarter totaled $246 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year. This increase is lower than our revenue growth and as a result, we were able to expand our operating margin. As a percentage of revenue, the expense improvement came from our cost of services, which was positively impacted by lower compensation expense and a decrease in data costs. These reductions were partially offset by higher technology costs supporting our infrastructure spend. Additionally, the higher productivity from the restructuring actions taken last year continues to have a favorable impact on cost of service. SG&A expenses, expressed as a percentage of revenue, were in line with the prior year. Lower discretionary spend in marketing and office expenses were partially offset by higher compensation and bad debt expense. Our tax rate for the quarter was 18.8%, impacted by a onetime settlement with tax authorities. Excluding this discrete item, our tax rate would be 17.6%. In the second quarter of our fiscal 2018, our tax rate was 42.4%, reflecting the onetime toll tax that we had to pay on unremitted foreign earnings as a result of the U.S. tax reform. Excluding this and other discrete items, the effective tax rate for that period was also 17.6%. GAAP EPS increased 65% to $2.19 this quarter versus $1.33 in the second quarter of 2018. This increase is attributable to higher revenue, improved margins, a lower effective tax rate and to a lesser extent, lower share count offset by higher interest expense. Last year's EPS was negatively impacted by $0.57 due to the aforementioned toll tax adjustment. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 14% to $2.42. A reconciliation of our adjustment to GAAP EPS is disclosed at the end of our press release. Free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending, was $87 million for the quarter, an increase of 1% over the same period last year, primarily due to higher net income and partially offset by the timing of tax payments and higher capital expenditures. We increased the net number of new clients this quarter versus the prior quarter by 108, resulting in a total of over 5,400 clients. The drivers of the growth were mainly due to an increase in corporate and wealth management clients. Looking at our share repurchase program for the second quarter. We repurchased 215,000 shares for $44 million at an average share price of $205. We have $137 million remaining in our share repurchase program, and we remain committed to buying back shares at a steady pace and continue to balance our capital allocation between business investment and shareholder returns. We are changing our guidance for a few metrics. First, we are lowering our annual effective tax rate for the full year. It is now expected to be between 17% to 18%. Second, we are tightening our GAAP diluted EPS guidance to be between $8.70 and $8.85 and our adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be in the range of $9.50 and $9.65. There is no change to our annual guidance for GAAP revenues, organic ASV plus professional services and GAAP and adjusted operating margin. In summary, we are pleased with our quarter and with our first half results, where we had over 6% growth in both revenue and organic ASV plus professional services, an adjusted operating margin of 32.4% and a 15% increase in adjusted diluted EPS. We continue to demonstrate successful execution against our strategy, both client collaboration and service and on disciplined cost management. As we look ahead to the remainder of this fiscal year, we will make investments to drive business growth, to streamline our cost structure and to return long-term value to our shareholders. So with that, we are now ready for your questions. Stephanie? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Greg Bardi : This is Greg calling on for Manav. I just wanted to ask about the sales pipeline in a couple of ways. Just wondering if there were any delayed buying decisions in the second quarter, given what we saw in December. And then also a little bit of a rationale for why the growth will be tilted towards the fourth quarter. Phil Snow : Greg, it's Phil Snow. So I don't think we saw anything noticeable in terms of delays as a result of what happened in December, nothing measurable that I can point to. And as I said in my script, we really do think about our business in halves. When we look at the pipeline in any given year, it's typically much more heavily weighted towards Q4 and this year is no different. Greg Bardi : And then on the margin side, pretty nice results. We had always thought of the margins as kind of being a steady tick-up every quarter, but the second quarter was already above your guidance. So any color on timing that happened in the third quarter or how we should think about the margin trajectory from here? Helen Shan : I'll take that. This is Helen. We're very comfortable with where we are for the first half of the year. It really was driven by things that we've been executing on which is good discipline on discretionary spend, on employee productivity improvements, which we've seen from, as we noted, the employee mix as well as some of the actions that we've taken over the previous quarters. And then also we benefited from foreign exchange favorable rates, largely exposed to the ones that we're most open to, which is the pound, the euro and the rupee. As we think about it going forward, we're just going to continue to execute on the same plan on getting operational efficiencies. And so that gives us comfort of being able to meet our target for the year and to be within the range that we've given you guidance on. Any other questions? Operator : Your next question comes from Peter Heckmann with Davidson. Peter Heckmann : Phil, I was curious on the M&A front. It will be almost two years since the company's last acquisition. When you look at the marketplace, are you changing some of your thoughts about organic versus nonorganic growth? Or is there something else, like valuations, that's keeping you from closing deals? Phil Snow : So I think I'll just start with we did make a number of acquisitions within a couple of years, more software. So we, sort of, intentionally decided to pause and really get those integrated. And I think what you're going to see in the second half of this year is some real new exciting products coming out from FactSet within the analytics and trading space. And we're already beginning to monetize some of those. So that's been a big focus for us. When we think about M&A, we're always looking at everything that's out there in the market. There isn't a deal that gets done that typically doesn't come across our desk. And I think we're always interested in content. FactSet does an exceptional job of integrating content, monetizing content. But yes, the high valuations certainly don't help where we don't want to overpay for anything, but we are continuing to scan the market for interesting tuck-in opportunities. Peter Heckmann : And then can you comment on the Burton-Taylor study, which came out recently, talked about an estimate of 2018 data growth of the market of about 5.5% in constant currency and about 10% for data streams. Both of those pretty much matched your ASV growth for fiscal '18. And I guess that's a difference from historical patterns where FactSet grew faster than the market. Any comment there in terms of your perception of maybe their forecast versus your performance? Phil Snow : So I haven't had a close look at that yet, Peter. I think we don't address the entire market. So there may be some segments of the market that are growing faster than the segments that we address. And it doesn't mean that we can't get into those markets, but I don't think I can give you a great answer until I've looked at that in more detail. What I can say is that when we're facing the competitors that we're facing in the markets that we serve today, I see that we're winning more than losing. So I think, for the piece of the Burton-Taylor report, that FactSet -- that's our addressable market, we're doing well in that piece of it. Operator : Your next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : I wanted to ask about margins as well. So just given the strong results in the quarter, I was a bit surprised that maybe you didn't raise the operating margin guidance for the year. Is there anything that specifically held you back from raising it? Was there anything onetime in the quarter that sort of led you to stay where you are? Helen Shan : Thanks, Toni, for your question. So I think there are a couple of things to consider. When you talk about some of the operational efficiencies we've achieved, we take that all into consideration. That puts us above 32% for Q2, which is an increase both quarter-over-quarter on a year basis as well as sequentially. But I think the foreign exchange favorable rates also added about 1 point, which works well when it works your way. But we're not in the business of trying to forecast going forward. So when we look at the first half at 32.4%, which shows real good progress we made against our target, to us, that feels like the right place for us to be. And as we operate going forward, we don't -- we're going to continue to make the right long-term decisions for the growth of the business and not necessarily trying to manage to a margin. Toni Kaplan : And then, you mentioned how strong analytics was this quarter and follows the later first quarter. So did something change? Or was it more timing related? Or any additional color you could give on that would be helpful. Phil Snow : Well, Toni, this is Phil. So again, it's a tale of two halves. In the first half, we're typically much more heavily weighted to the second quarter. Obviously, we have that significant deal in Q1 of this year. But on the analytics side, we did very well with our core PA product, traditional PA. The seats grew. A lot of what was driving that was new risk clients that we've closed and some more enterprise deals that are actually then sort of resulting in more PA deployment within clients. And we were positive on both the risk and fixed income side in terms of driving ASV. Operator : Your next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. George Tong : Organic revenue growth in the quarter decelerated a bit to 5.7% from 6.4% in the prior quarter, despite easier comps in the year-ago period. Can you just elaborate on which areas of the business contributed to this deceleration and how you expect trends to change as you move through the year? Phil Snow : So if you're talking about the quarter-over-quarter growth, I think we had that very large wealth deal in Q1. So I think that's the -- on a quarter-to-quarter basis, that's skewing the numbers. On a year-over-year basis, I believe we're pretty much comparable to last year, sort of 5.9% or 6% and right in the middle of our guidance range for the year. So we're reaffirming our annual guidance from an ASV standpoint and feel good about that range. Helen Shan : And really, we want to -- we look at, as Phil mentioned, first half, where we look -- we look at the first half as opposed to just the quarter. So I think that's probably another way you should think about it as well. George Tong : And then you previously indicated that visibility into large deals should improve as we move through the year. Can you provide us an update on the progress of these large deal conversions, how this compares with your internal expectations and when you may be in a position to update guidance to reflect progress with these larger deals? Phil Snow : Yes. So I think we have good visibility now on the second half, but typically we're -- it's not clear to us, more than 6 months out on some of that stuff. So based on what we see in the pipeline, for the large deals, we're reaffirming our guidance for the year around the midpoint of the guidance. Operator : Your next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Helen, I just want to make sure I understood you correctly. Of the margin expansion year-over-year of 180 basis points, around 100 is from currency and 80 is from actions that the company took on its own, between restructuring, better use of resources, efficiency, mix of where work is done, stuff like that. Is that right? Helen Shan : Yes. I think that is correct. Shlomo Rosenbaum : And then, just could you talk a little bit about what was going on internationally? Usually, I expect international organic revenue growth to be faster than Americas. And I thought there was some kind of comment about a cancellation or something. Can you give a little bit more detail as to kind of what's going on over there? Phil Snow : Yes. Shlomo, it's Phil. So we actually had a very good quarter in the U.K. But there was one market on the continent where we had a significant cancel that accounts for the majority of the difference that you were seeing in the EMEA region. And I believe we accelerated our growth in Asia Pac slightly this quarter. We had a good quarter in Asia Pac. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Was it cancel or loss? Or what was going on over there? I know it's competitive, obviously. Phil Snow : Yes, we don't give a lot of detail sort of on the cancellation. So it was a significant step backwards, yes. Operator : Your next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Hamzah Mazari : My first question is just around the client environment. I know you mentioned client cancellations are stable. But any thoughts as to where do you think we are in terms of buy-side consolidation? And maybe just in relation to that, if you could just talk about, has it been negative for you or positive for you as you look at the consolidation that's sort of already occurred? Phil Snow : Yes. Hamzah, it's Phil. So yes, I'm not sure exactly where we are. I think that as we look further out, we're going to see continued cost pressures for the clients. In some cases, consolidation does help FactSet. We've got great relationships with our clients. Very often it forces kind of the new combined entity to sit down and look at everything they have. And we have a much broader suite of solutions now that we can offer clients. So obviously, there's cost pressure. When firms consolidate, they're looking for efficiencies. So it's a mixture of things. But this is an environment that we're used to operating in now, and I'm so pleased with how we performed and all of the products that we have coming to market. I continue to feel like there's more new and interesting product coming out from FactSet than we ever had. And even in an economic backdrop, which is difficult, I feel that we have a good chance of really continuing to take good market share. Hamzah Mazari : And just a follow-up. You had mentioned unbundling of products to provide more open solutions. Just any thoughts as to what that means, where you are in that unbundling process. Phil Snow : Sure. So I've talked about this a little bit before, but we're no longer just a workstation product. FactSet has done a lot of investment in our technology stack and that's allowed us to do a lot of interesting stuff. So one is we have this great new web product, which we're beginning to monetize in wealth and other markets. The result of that is we're actually able to break up pieces of that if we wanted to and deploy those in interesting ways, which we're already doing. We're opening up more APIs to our clients. So a good example is our Analytics API. If you wanted to take the engine that powers PA and plug it into your own system, we can help you with that now. And then, of course, we have our Open :FactSet Marketplace, which is another example of us sort of delivering content in new and interesting ways. So I'd say we're sort of at the beginning of that journey of unbundling. We think that's the way the world is going, and we're -- that's the way we're going as well. Operator : Your next question comes from Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray. Peter Appert : So Phil, the change in ownership of Thomson's F&R business is pretty dramatic change in the competitive landscape. Any commentary in terms of anything you're seeing in terms of that change maybe specifically in terms of opportunity or threat or even more broadly in terms of the competitive universe? Phil Snow : So I don't think much has changed there. So we've been competing with Thomson Reuters in some way, shape or form for a couple of decades now. We continue to feel good about our product offering versus theirs in the markets that we compete in. And I think -- I haven't seen much of a change to date in terms of how they are coming to market. Peter Appert : And then, Helen, I think you said -- you made a comment about not managing to margin, which I think is consistent with what the company has said historically. But that said, given your tenure now at this point, do you have a thought in terms of what you think maybe the appropriate level of margin for the FactSet business is longer term? Helen Shan : Thanks for your question. I can only use my early tenure for so long. But I think what we're seeing right now is that we continue to have opportunities on the operational front. I think as I noted, we really need to think about our long-term growth. We already are making investments back into the business, whether it's on infrastructure, on product, on even facilities. So from my perspective, I don't know that I have a particular target. I do think we continue to have operational productivity improvements that we can make. Operator : Your next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Drew Kootman : This is Drew Kootman on for Joe. You mentioned earlier the Merrill deal is done. I was wondering if you could touch on any color around how that process went and if you're seeing any flow-through into the model already. Phil Snow : Yes. Drew, it's Phil. So the process went exceptionally well. So we did it in under 6 months. I've heard that deployments of that scale historically were sometimes 2 or 3x that long. So we feel really good about how efficient we were there in terms of deploying the product. I, myself, actually went and observed one of the advisers getting trained and that was a real thrill for me to sort of see their action to our product versus what they had. And our team was amazing. So we had a lot of our existing FactSet consultants go out and do this and did a phenomenal job. All the feedback we got was exceptional. Our pipeline is building for other deals like this. And we feel really good about this as a new market for us and one that we think will be core to our business moving forward. Drew Kootman : And then in terms of the Americas, looks like you guys keep having some strong strength there. Could you maybe touch on a little more detail about the demand there and what you see moving forward? Phil Snow : Our Americas team had a really good first half. I think you saw our banking number, too. So that's been driven globally, but we're seeing really good growth in our users on the sell side, which might surprise some people, but we have a great product. Our deep sector strategy is paying off. We released that in October of last year, and we have thousands of users using that data already. So it's picking up momentum very quickly. Operator : Your next question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Q - Bill Warmington : So I just want to ask, the employee count was down quarter-to-quarter, while the user count was up. So it would imply that perhaps the ramp in the BofA business required less implementation staff than we had expected, maybe that it's ultimately higher margin business than we first thought. Is that the right way to think about that? Helen Shan : I'll take the first part of that question. When you think about our employee growth rate over time, on an organic basis, I think it is important to look in the past, there've been acquisitions, right, that had helped drive that growth rate. But overall, it is down, but in part, if you think about the fact that we do have a larger base of employees, too. So I think we have to be careful about just looking at the rate. I also think that we have become more productive, whether it's in content or in engineering. So we've been able to use automation and technology to be able to drive greater productivity. And also keep in mind, we did have some restructuring actions that we had taken in previous quarters, and so when you start looking comparatively, that's also going to make an impact as we think about total numbers. I don't know that we would tie it back specifically with what we've done with BAML. We had folks -- as we've always talked about, this was an organic deal, so we had people who were working overall, focused their efforts on the BAML win, which was very successful. And so as that winds and completes, they will refocus their efforts on new business. Bill Warmington : And second question is longer term. The organic ASV growth is running around 6%. The margins are in the process of rebounding to the mid-30s. Historically, because of the competitive environment, there's a need to reinvest in R&D and customer service and keep those margins around there. So mathematically, with the 6% growth and now -- and without margin expansion, how do you maintain double-digit EPS growth? Helen Shan : I'll take the first shot at that. So thank you for your question. I think for us, I mean, we're continuing, as you even note, to invest back in the business. Phil talked about the new products and the open nature of our products that we're putting to market. So that will drive, I think, growth. We continue to use cash as we think about capital allocation to also buy back shares. And that will help as well as we think about returning value to shareholders. So I think those are all the different levers that we'll look at to continue on our performance. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim McHugh with William Blair. Tim McHugh : Just want to know if you could elaborate on the sell side. I know you mentioned some of the new products there, but I guess how much is the wealth management deal? How much are you just seeing hiring, I guess, within some of your investment banking clients? Maybe just elaborate, I guess, what's driving the sell-side ASV to such a strong number lately. Phil Snow : Sure, Tim. It's Phil. So actually just one point of clarification is the wealth business, we put in the buy side. So none of the wealth users or the BAML users are included in that sell-side number. So we're really driving a lot of new seats in banking. I think that might have been up by well over 1,000 in this quarter, and we had one significant deal in Asia Pac as well that actually used our web platform. So we were able to deploy that very easily to a large number of users in the Asia Pacific region. So I think it's just a combination of the excellent software we have for banking and all of the investment that we're making in content for those users. Tim McHugh : And then within Europe, you talked about the cancellation, but absolutely a choppier macro environment in Europe. Is that flowing at all into the client discussions and the pipeline as you think about the growth rate outside of the U.S. going forward? Phil Snow : Yes, there's obviously a lot going on in Europe, right, in terms of Brexit as well as MiFID II and other stuff. So it's hard to tie any of it, honestly, to whether or not we're going to see a deceleration there. We've got a great team. We've got a great product. And I think we sort of view that market not that much differently than Americas, honestly, right now. And if that changes, we'll be sure to highlight it for you on the next call or two. Operator : Your next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Keith Housum : Helen, just a little bit color on the operating margins. For the first half of the year, 32.4%, top end of your guidance. Obviously, you've got some FX tailwinds at your back. Do you have those FX tailwinds baked into your guidance for the rest of the year? Or is that for potential upside? Helen Shan : Yes. So thanks for your question. We look at that in a number of different ways. I mean, if you take a look at some of our larger currencies of exposed currencies where the dollars have strengthened in the back half of the year, so when we compare that to where we think we would be, that's already baked in. Now that being said, it can work for us or it can work against us. So we really don't try to project, but if markets were to stay the same as where they are in -- where they are today, we'd expect to be in the range that we've given you. Keith Housum : Maybe related to that, asking a question on the op margins, were there any expenses you didn't incur in the quarter that perhaps you foresee that you have to require in the second half of the year? Helen Shan : Not necessarily. I think nothing that we necessarily haven't already baked into our view. Keith Housum : And if I could ask one question to Phil. Phil, you've mentioned historically that you ought to be able to get to 10% ASV growth over the long term. We're here a little over 2 years now, we've been stuck in the 6% ASV growth area, and obviously the markets have been a challenge and quite frankly, I'm not quite sure if they're going to get any better for any of us. But any change to your hope or expectation for long-term growth? And if so, what do you need to get there if consumer markets will probably remain challenged? Phil Snow : Yes. So we feel good about how we're performing in this market and our growth rate. But we're always focused on acceleration. So for us, the #1 metric that we're focused on as a company is our top line growth. And sometimes it takes a while for new products to take hold. The environment is not getting any easier, but we do feel that some of our product sets -- I might point to wealth and CTS as 2 that are really getting a lot of traction recently and have good momentum, so I'm optimistic as we sort of come out of the second half that we'll have good momentum going into the next fiscal year. Keith Housum : Do you think there is a new long-term growth, say 8% instead of 10%, that perhaps you guys are shooting for? Phil Snow : Yes, I'm not going to give you a number today. I think we're doing a lot of work on our long-term strategic plan. If we feel like we want to come out with any longer-term guidance for you, like in terms of long-term top line growth rate, we'll do that. Operator : Your next question comes from David Chu with Bank of America. Jitaek Chu : So how much incremental ASV was added from the BofA contract in the quarter? Is it something small like 5% of the total? Or is it something more meaningful? Phil Snow : I don't think we're going to break that out exactly. But it was -- most of the ASV was already attributed for in Q1 of last year -- of this year, sorry. Jitaek Chu : And then just in terms of the ERP system implementation, where do you guys stand today? And when do you expect it to go live? Helen Shan : It's Helen. As it relates to the -- on the finance side, we'll continue to work on it. We're looking towards fiscal '20 when it would go live. As it relates to the HR system, we actually have gone live on that. And so we're very pleased with the progress we've made there. Jitaek Chu : And do you expect this to be like a cost-saving benefit over time? Or are you already seeing it? Or do you expect to see that play out over time? Helen Shan : We don't have it baked in at this point. I mean, right now, I think it's too early for us to be talking about savings. What we're looking at here is productivity and being able to have greater insights in how we manage the business. And so we'll see how that works out over time. Operator : Your next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. Ashish Sabadra : Phil, a question on the comment that you had made around the banking data that you rolled out last quarter. I was wondering if you could help us understand how does this new product now compare to your competitor, SNL Financial, like from a competitive perspective. And then you talked about doubling the number of users as well. So as you think about the target market there, how do you think about ability to gain more users on that front? Phil Snow : Yes, so I would say it's very early days. We've just begun to invest here. So I'm not sure exactly what our competitors have, but what I can tell you is we're really encouraged by the data that we do have and the uptick we've seen in terms of users and sort of the demand from the market for us to do more of this. So that, I think, gives me a lot of confidence that this sort of data and investing in not just FIG but in some other areas is a good strategy for our company. Ashish Sabadra : That's helpful. And then maybe just a quick follow-up. You also called out that maybe other sectors, other things that are on your priority list that you talked about. Is there anything that you can share in terms of which sectors would be equally as important as the financial or the banking data? Phil Snow : Yes, I think we're just looking across all sectors right now. When we have more clarity on that, we'll be very happy to share it with you. Ashish Sabadra : Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up. And like with this new data around new sectors, what does that mean for your CTS business? Does it help on that front as well? Phil Snow : It certainly does. We're great at monetizing data both in workstation to web as well as off platform. So sometimes the more detailed the data, the better, right, in terms of how quantum data scientists want to look at it. So as we build that up, we'll be able to turn that around very easily and sell it in the feeds over time. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Alex Kramm : Just a couple of follow-ups, I guess, on the margin. First, I think you mentioned discretionary spending helping this quarter, and I look back and I see that the quarter, obviously, started in December, which was a really choppy period. So just wondering, did you pull back some spending pretty quickly? And I guess what -- I'm asking because it's just one of those things where it actually shows how you can react, which is a positive, obviously, right, to choppier markets if you need to and what flexibility you have. And then obviously, as you maybe didn't ramp fast enough, the ramping is now happening throughout the rest of the year. You know what I'm trying to say? Helen Shan : Sure. Thanks for your question, Alex. So I think as it relates to certain spend you can't hold back on, certain things are really in flight, right? So things like professional fees was really much more of an active strategy of how we manage that. I think similarly for marketing, although that one, as to your point, you can pull back a bit. T&E is another one that you can spend more judiciously. And so I think we try to pull off some of those levers. I don't think -- I would not say it was because of December in particular. I think it's more about us executing on the plan we set forth for the year. Alex Kramm : And then just lastly, you mentioned your restructuring actions and how those have been bearing fruit. I mean, are we basically done with that now? And I guess I'm asking to some degree because you continue to have restructuring charges every quarter, but if this is an ongoing thing, at something -- at some point, it's regular business. So I guess I'm saying are you kind of -- do we have this behind us at some point? Or where do we stand with kind of like the plan that the management team has laid out? Alex Kramm : Yes, sure. So I think for us, the program around more material restructuring was in Q4. And so we may have had small pieces after that, but I wouldn't look at that as being something that we're continuing every quarter. I think what's probably a bigger driver as we think about the productivity gain is also the mix, which -- the employee mix change. So we're growing in terms of people, much more in our centers of excellence, which are outside the U.S., as I mentioned, more in -- perhaps in lower-cost countries. And that's been a driver. And I think that's been more material per se, and we would expect that to be going forward as well. Operator : Your last question comes from Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Glenn Greene : Just two quick questions. And obviously, your margin's been a big profile for this call and tracking to all your expectations at least year-to-date. I think you had an expectation for 100 basis points of margin expansion in fiscal '20. Is that still the case? And then the secondary question relates to the cancellation in Europe to the extent, Phil, you're comfortable commenting on it, but was it in any way MiFID related or competitive? I'm just trying to get a confidence that this was sort of a onetime isolated issue, and we wouldn't sort of expect any other sort of like large cancellations in Europe going down the road. Phil Snow : Yes, at our last Investor Day, we did say that our plan was to improve margins for the next 2 years. So Helen's new. We're continuing to think about our long-term strategy. It's something as we go into the end of the year and we think about our multi-year plan whether or not that's something we want to continue to do or if we want to invest more in the business for high growth. And in terms of the EMEA region, yes, it was a onetime thing. It was competitive. But there are lots of situations where we win onetime deals versus competitors as well. So I think we're entering an age right now where FactSet is competing for 7-figure deals, in some case 8-figure deals, on a much more frequent basis than we used to with our largest clients. And I think some of this lumpiness is what we may continue to see over time. Thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We want to thank all of our employees for delivering solid results and express our appreciation to both our clients and shareholders with many of whom we've had long-term relationships. If you have additional questions, please call Rima Hyder. We look forward to speaking with you all next quarter. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the FactSet Q3 2019 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Rima Hyder, Vice President, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Rima Hyder : Thank you, Christine, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FactSet\u2019s third fiscal quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I would like to point out that the slides we will reference during the course of this presentation can be accessed via the webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at factset.com. The slides will be posted on our website at the conclusion of this call. A replay of today\u2019s call will be available via phone and on our website. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions from investors. To be fair to everyone, please limit yourself to one question plus one follow-up. Before we discuss our results, I encourage all listeners to review the legal notice on Slide 2, which explains the risks of forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, please refer to our forms 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the appendix to the presentation and in our earnings release issued earlier today. Joining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer and Helen Shan, Chief Financial Officer. I'd now like to turn the discussion over to Phil Snow. Phil Snow : Thanks, Rima, and good morning everyone. I am pleased to say that we are continuing our long record of steady growth in the second half of our fiscal year with growth across all our key metrics including ASV revenue, EPS and margin.  Cost pressures in the financial sector remain, but clients are looking to invest in technological solutions that drive efficiencies and we continue to benefit from their response to what\u2019s smarter and more connected data and analytics. This provides us with the ever growing opportunity to take higher wallet share.  Now moving on to the third quarter results, this quarter our sales team achieved comparable gross sales and expanded our footprint globally at net new clients and users. At the same time, we did see a higher than expected rate of cancellations due to industry-wide ongoing cost pressures. We think of our business in half year increments and as we pointed out in our last call, we expect our second half to be more weighted towards the fourth quarter. Turning to ASV. Analytics and wealth were the main drivers this quarter, along with the annual price increase for our international clients. Our ASV this quarter was impacted by a multi-year agreement with a corporate client that came to an end this year, outside of this cancellation, ASV would have grown in line with our fiscal third quarter of 2019. Helen will discuss this in more detail, but we did benefit on the revenue side from this cancellation as it resulted in a one-time sale of data to the same clients. This cancellation impacted our CTS business ASV, otherwise CTS had a solid quarter.  Sales for the standard data feeds accelerated through our data exploration products which removes the friction from the trial and evaluation process and this was the biggest contributor to CTS ASV. Within analytics, our core equity portfolio analytics solutions and transactional revenue from our trading solutions were some of the biggest drivers of growth.  The recent launch of our portfolio management platform and continued progress on risk portfolio services and API solutions allow us to believe in the growth trajectory of this business. However, while analytics was the largest contributor to growth, changes within our specialist sales force and unexpected cancellations let us to fall short of expectations. Additionally, we overestimated how quickly we can monetize some of our new products and we\u2019ve taken the necessary steps to address these challenges and believe that these adjustments will have a positive benefit on analytics overall.  Taking all of this into account, we now believe that we\u2019ll finish the year between $70 million to $75 million for ASV, plus professional services maintaining our mid-single-digit growth targets as we told you at Investor Day last year. We\u2019ve increased guidance for our other key metrics such as margin and EPS and Helen will walk you through those in a few minutes.  Wealth had another strong quarter as it continued to expand, gain share and take competitive volumes. With the strong pipeline of dynamic sales team that continues to target larger clients we believe wealth is well positioned to finish this year strong and will continue to be a growth driver for us.  And within research, the results came in better than expected with workstation wins and RMS sales. However, the business also experienced higher cancellations from continued pressure on the buy side. Cancellations in general were higher this quarter across all our regions, mainly from firm closures and consolidation continues to be a trend in our industry.  We are proactively making changes to our sales processes, renegotiating client contracts and ensuring clients understand the full value of the FactSet products to help mitigate future losses. Another significant change we made this past quarter was to move all the products sales specialists into our various business lines we have instead of continuing to align them to general sales.  This organizational change will give the heads of these businesses more line of sight into products and sales and allow for even more specialized client experience with our sales teams.  In terms of geographic breakdown, we continue to have a growing global presence with the diverse clients taking advantage of our open, flexible and configurable offerings.  Looking at our Americas and international businesses, Americas delivered a solid growth rate of 5% driven by analytics and CTS and the EMEA and Asia-Pac regions grew 4% and 11% respectively benefiting from the annual international price increase this quarter. Analytics and CTS both continued to be growth drivers in these regions. In summary, this quarter is a great example of the FactSet team\u2019s ability to perform even amid sector-wide challenges. We said last quarter that we remained cautious given client cost pressures and this quarter saw increased cutbacks across the industry with clients increasingly tightening belts with an eye to future volatility, which resulted in the higher than usual cancellation rates.  Despite these obstacles, we demonstrated growth in Q3 across ASV, revenue, EPS and margins and we remain confident in our long-term strategy and believe we are well placed to help clients navigate a changing environments.  Our open and flexible solutions are resonating in the markets, which is seeing growing technology adoption as clients search for new ways to drive efficiency and create value. We believe our solutions will continue to serve as mission-critical for clients and their dynamic investment workflows. We also continue to focus successfully on cost disciplines and higher ASV and EPS growth and are taking steps to accelerate our sales pipeline and we remain a strong steward of returning capital to shareholders with this quarter marking our fourteenth consecutive year the company has increased dividends.  Let me now turn the call over to Helen to talk in more detail about our performance this quarter. Helen Shan : Thank you, Phil, and good morning, everyone. It\u2019s great to be here with all of you. We delivered strong operating results in the quarter with over 7% growth in both GAAP and organic revenue versus the previous year. This increased the [indiscernible] fees led to a growth of over 20% in GAAP operating income resulting in a solid expansion in our operating margins. In addition, we grew adjusted diluted EPS by 20%.  The one-time sales data to a corporate client as referred by Phil earlier increased GAAP revenues by $5 million. Our quarterly results, in particular, revenues, operating income and cash were positively impacted by this sale. For comparability purposes, we exclude this transaction from our results on an adjusted basis. I will now walk us through the specifics of our third quarter. GAAP and organic revenue increased 7% to $365 million and $366 million respectively versus the prior year. Growth was driven primarily by analytics, CTS and wealth as prior period ASV is more fully recognized as revenue in the third quarter.  For our geographic segments, over the last twelve months, Americas revenue grew 8%, international revenue grew over 6% organically. Americas benefited from an increase in wealth, analytics and CTS. International revenue was largely driven by analytics and CTS. ASV plus professional services increased to $1.45 billion at the end of our third quarter at a growth rate of 5.6% year-over-year and up $4.5 million since the end of our second quarter. The growth was driven primarily by analytics and wealth and reflects our annual price increase in our international segments. The positive impact to ASV from pricing was approximately $5 million, in line with prior year. GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter totaled $247 million, nearly flat versus last year. As a result, our GAAP margin increased 470 basis points to 32%. Adjusted operating margin increased to 34%, a 310 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2018, a level we have not seen in five years.  This improvement continues to be driven in part by increasingly disciplined expense management and lower employee costs. Similar to the second quarter of 2019, movements in foreign exchange rates were also a positive driver this quarter, but to a lesser extent.  The dollar strengthened against several of the currencies to which we have the greatest exposure including the pound, the euro and the Indian rupee providing us favorable impact to our margins of approximately 80 basis points. As a percentage of revenue, the expense improvement came largely from our cost of services which was 360 basis points lower than last year on a GAAP basis. On an adjusted basis, the improvement was 250 basis points and margins were impacted positively by faster growth in revenue versus cost of services year-over-year.  Contributing factors include decreases in both employee compensation and contractor fees. This benefit was partially offset by an increase in computer-related expenses as we continue to upgrade our technology stack.  SG&A expenses, expressed as a percentage of revenue, experienced an improvement of 110 basis points over the prior year period on a GAAP basis. On an adjusted basis, this improvement was approximately 60 basis points. This result is driven primarily by expense reductions in travel and entertainment, marketing, as well as employee compensation.  Given our solid results, we are increasing our guidance range for both GAAP and adjusted operating margins. Our tax rate for the quarter was 18.6%, impacted primarily by added period and one-time tax adjustments. Excluding these discrete items, our tax rate would be 14.2%. Our tax rate has trended lower this quarter from a higher level of stock option exercises and that we are lowering our guidance for the fiscal 2019 annual tax rate. I would discuss that further in few minutes. GAAP EPS increased 24% to $2.37 this quarter versus $1.91 in the third quarter of 2018. This increase is attributable to higher revenue, improved margins, and a lower effective tax rate. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 20% to $2.62. A reconciliation of our adjustment to GAAP EPS is disclosed at the end of our press release. Free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations, less capital spending, was $148 million for the quarter, an increase of 24% over the same period last year. This is the strongest free cash flow we have seen in the history of FactSet. The strength was primarily due to higher net income, and improved working capital including increased cash collections, partially offset by higher capital expenditures.  Our CapEx has trended higher this year due to our new office space build out for some of our locations and increased investments in technology. Looking at our share repurchase program for the second quarter, we repurchased 175,000 shares for $48 million at an average share price of $272.  Additionally, this week, our Board of Directors approved an increase of $210 million to the existing share repurchase program, bringing a total of $300 million now available for share repurchases. Over the last twelve months, we have returned $327 million to our investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases.  We remain committed to buying back our shares at a steady pace and continued to balance the capital allocations between business investment and shareholder returns.  Moving to our annual outlook for the year, we are increasing and narrowing our guidance range for most of our metrics, like margin, EPS, ASV, plus professional services. ASV plus professional services for the year is now expected to be between $70 million and $75 million. We are tightening our GAAP revenue range to $1.42 billion and $1.44 billion.  Our GAAP operating margin is benefiting from this quarter\u2019s non-core sell transactions and now be between 30% and 30.5%. We are also increasing our adjusted operating margin guidance to 32.5% and 33%. We are pleased with the cost discipline measures that we have taken to be able to implement in order to achieve these results. As I explained earlier, our tax rate has trended lower this year due to one-time items and a higher than expected impact from stock option exercises. We are lowering our annual effective tax rate for the full year. We now expect it to be between 16% and 16.5%.  And finally, we are increasing and tightening our ranges for earnings per share. GAAP diluted EPS range is $8.90 and $9. Adjusted diluted EPS range is between $9.80 and $9.90. The midpoint of this guidance represents a 15% growth over the prior year on an adjusted basis.  We are proud of our operating results this quarter. Our dedication to cost discipline and process improvement continues to yield growth and we are on track to finish the year on a strong note for revenue, margin and EPS.  As we continue to make prudent investments to drive business growth aligned with our long-term strategy, we expect that FactSet will remain resilient despite sector and industry headwinds. And of course, we look forward to continuing our proven track record of returning value to our shareholders.  With that, we are now ready for your questions. Christine? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is open. Manav Patnaik : Hi, good morning. The first question I guess is, when you at first initiated guidance around the ASV you had almost sounded like it was conservative and you had a bunch of these renewals and all in the back half, but you didn\u2019t add to that. So I was just curious like, what was the real change that you are kind of referring to today, like, was it just a lack of visibility or did something materially changed along the way in terms of that shift? Phil Snow : Hey, Manav, it\u2019s Phil. Thanks for the question. So, yes, it is difficult for us typically to look one year ahead, we \u2013 I think have stated multiple times, it\u2019s a little bit easier for us to see kind of three to six months out. So based on what we saw in terms of the market and what we thought each of our businesses could do over the year, that was our guidance at the beginning of the year. I would say, to summarize, research, CTS, and wealth are all pretty much coming in as or above expected from the beginning of the year. But the biggest area where we are seeing kind of a difference is our analytics business. So, analytics business as you know grew at 10% at the end of last year and I would say that\u2019s the one where we are seeing the biggest difference versus our original projection.  Now it still is a growth driver. It\u2019s going to add, we believe the most absolute ASV out of any of the different business lines this year. But it\u2019s just not growing as quickly as we anticipated it would. Manav Patnaik : Okay. And then, maybe, if I would just follow-up on that point then, can you just elaborate more, is that because of competition or I guess, anything there on why it\u2019s slowing down? It sounds like temporarily but just why is that happening? Phil Snow : Yes, so there are few things that when we look into it. One is, the fixed income piece of that business is not growing as quickly as it did last year. Part of that we believe has to do with some of the specialist organization that I spoke about. So, our specialists were in the sales organization for a few years for analytics and we gotten away from having a completely specialized fixed income team.  And it was more of a multi-asset class team. But I think what we\u2019ve learned over the last few years is, it\u2019s good to have additional specialization within the group. So, we\u2019ve shifted about a third of the client facing sales force back into our business lines so that the leaders of those businesses now can work more closely with the sales specialists who are still going to work very closely with the general sales population, but we do think that that was a piece of it. It\u2019s certainly wasn\u2019t all of it. Another one is I think we overestimated a little bit how much revenue or ASV we would get from some of the newer products. So, part of that was our APIs that we opened up. It was hard to predict.  We now have four or five APIs out in the market for analytics. We are selling them, which is not getting as much as we thought we would at the beginning. But we are very confident in that strategy and we believe over time we will get material ASV and growth from opening up the analytics suite outside of the core workstations. So, if I was to highlight two things, those would be the two. Manav Patnaik : All right. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Bill Warmington : Good morning, everyone. Phil Snow : Good morning. Bill Warmington : So, I wanted to ask for some more detail on the Q3 expense speed and just you ran to a number of the numbers if you could summarize it for me in terms of how much came from FX, from acquisition integration, from core expense reduction? And then, trying to get also a sense from \u2013 of how sustainable it is? Helen Shan : Sure, thanks for that question. When we think about what we accomplished in Q3, it\u2019s really a continuation of execution on our operational plans. So, for the quarter, I would say, about 220 basis points were from operational efficiencies and I would classify that really into little less than half with - what is from expense management of discretionary items, T&E, as well as marketing.  And the balance is driven by productivity improvements and that continues to reflect the mix change between high and low cost countries in terms of the percentage of employees. So let me give you a little bit additional color on that.  If you look at the number of employees in Q3 this year versus last year, we saw a reduction in our \u2013 in the number of employees in our high cost countries by 4% and an increase in our low cost countries by 6%. And so that really accounts for that mix change. And I\u2019ll address this - the long term view on that. And then in the rest [build] [ph] was on FX. So where the favorable FX provides about 80 basis points for us. So that is around the quarter of the beat that we had in terms of the improvement in the margins. And that\u2019s \u2013 it aligns how we did it last quarter, except the last quarter was over 50%. So more of the improvement this quarter came from operational efficiencies.  As it relates to the sustainability, another good question, let me try to address that, if you think about the drivers of where we are getting the benefit, it really is starting with the way that we operate. We established business units, lines of business a couple of years ago and this year we now have cost centers and we have budgets and we have now put the accountability broader and deeper into the organization.  So we have folks in our leadership team who have the accountability, have the discretion to be able to manage their headcount and expenses and they are doing that. They are managing their spend and they are now making more informed decisions. The other again is the mix between high and low cost countries. The percentage mix has changed.  So if I look at this year to last year, we now have 2% higher end of our employees in low cost countries and so, if I think about those two things plus some of the integrations that we were \u2013 the expense reductions that were expected, which quite frankly, it\u2019s now integrated with the rest of our businesses.  But we do know of certain contracts, whether it\u2019s in technology or in content and we\u2019ve been able to rationalize and those have come through in 2019 as well. So, while we continue to look for ways to vest back in for long-term growth, we do believe that a lot of what we have accomplished, we should be able to sustain. Bill Warmington : Okay. And for my follow-up is I want to ask about the \u2013 you moved your terminal business to the cloud a couple of years ago and that enabled you to lower the cost of delivery and to pursue and win some higher seat count opportunities like wealth management. And when do you move your underlying FactSet infrastructure to the cloud? And what does that mean for near and mid-term margin targets? Phil Snow : So, just to clarify, I mean, we have our own sort of private cloud. The web product that we deployed to the large wealth, we did in others that\u2019s still in our private cloud. What we have up in the public cloud now is more of the open FactSet architecture which is part of what CTS is doing. And we do use the public cloud for a few other things, particularly on the analytics side when we need additional capacity for some very heavy duty calculation.  So, I think we are still on a migration to the public cloud. We can\u2019t give you an exact timeframe we\u2019re considering all that as part of our multi-year strategy, but I think what we have learned is that\u2019s the direction we need to go. It\u2019s the direction the world is going and it\u2019s going to allow us to develop products a whole lot faster and it\u2019s also going to remove a lot of friction from the sales process.  So we saw that with? CTS having the CTS offering up in the public cloud and having the data discovery module has lowered the amount of time it takes to begin trialing our products by orders of magnitude. It takes sort of a day now to go up and begin looking at all of the content we have and to make a decision versus what it might have taken previously which was weeks for both us and the clients to begin setting up the trial and getting it all set up.  So, that\u2019s a great business model. We think we can leverage it for lots of pieces of our business. The analytics APIs that I mentioned on the previous question, lot of those were available now. If you go into our developer portal, so that\u2019s another example of where we are removing friction and exposing our products in new and interesting ways to the clients. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Your line is open. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Hey Phil, I am just trying to understand the dynamics between revenue and ASV right now. I am seeing like the revenue kind of organic revenue growth kind of inch up, but I am seeing the ASV growth kind of inch down. And usually those things move in tandem and if I am seeing the ASV inch down, usually revenue should follow the other direction and it doesn\u2019t seem like you are saying that that\u2019s what you think is going to happen.  It sounds like you are confident what\u2019s going I was hoping you can kind of give us a little bit more background on that? Phil Snow : So, what I\u2019ll do is I\u2019ll describe the one-time deal or transaction that I mentioned for Q3 and then how I am going to follow-up I think a little bit on your question as well. So, I think I mentioned in my script we did have a one-time pretty large cancellation in Q3. It was about $4.5 million in ASV to a corporate client. So, this has been a ten year \u2013 over a ten year contract where FactSet was distributing one of our core content sets that we collected and the client decided to go in another direction. And I would say that\u2019s very comparable to FactSet over time, we\u2019ve taken all of the third-party contents internally, but you\u2019ve seen us turn into a content company and sort of going in other direction for some content.  So, there always a buy build common decision when it comes to content. So, that obviously negatively impacted our ASV for this quarter. I may have misspoke a little bit in my script. I think what I meant to say was, in the absence of that $4.5 million transaction, our growth rate would have been pretty consistent with the last quarter and on an absolute ASV basis, pretty consistent with Q3 of last year.  We did get a one-time payment of $5 million at the end of this contract which Helen mentioned that was booked as revenue, but I\u2019ll let Helen explain that in a little bit more detail. Helen Shan : Sure. So, I think the number that you are looking at there for revenue, that\u2019s a GAAP number of over 7%. And so that includes this $5 million one-time benefit from the sale. So, if you strip that out, we are more at a 5.7% increase and that is more aligned, I think to that what you are trying to get at in terms of the \u2013 a lot between ASV and revenue. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. And then, just if you don\u2019t mind, just on a follow-up, in terms of what you are seeing in terms of pipeline, what you are selling, you mentioned certain things you are not selling as well as they were before. Some of that sounds a little bit more kind of belt tightening type stuff or I guess, just the environment is not quite good as good as you thought it would be.  But on the other hand, the tone of what you are saying just seems still pretty confident, should we see kind of a pickup from here? In other words, is your pipeline building that you would expect that we\u2019re still bouncing off the bottom in terms of the growth rates or because, I think you said that, kind of 5% to 7% organic growth was more at the last Analyst Day is the way to think about things and just wondering if you could comment in that context? Phil Snow : , : We have so much great products coming to markets within each of our business lines and we felt larger deals that\u2019s in the pipeline than FactSet historically has had. Some of those are pretty binary right, so sort of like a BAML deal and you either get it or you don\u2019t.  So that can actually obviously materially affect growth rate, but I do feel that we have a very good opportunity to continue the pace we have and accelerate from here. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Toni Kaplan : Okay, thank you. Phil, you mentioned the sort of unexpected cancellation. Could you give us a bit more color on, are there any commonalities across client types? Are they sort of newer clients or long-term clients? The size of the clients or is there any way to sort of group them as opposed just \u2013 that would be helpful? Phil Snow : So, Toni, your question is about the client sets that cancelled completely? Toni Kaplan : Yes. Phil Snow : Yes. So, I think we showed that we would net around 50 positive clients for the quarter. I would say, most of the positive additions that were on the wealth and corporate side which is pretty consistent. We are adding a lot of new names in wealth and in corporations. I think what we saw was a bit of a tick down in the institutional asset management space and a little bit of a tick down in terms of hedge funds.  Hedge funds though were a positive, what this Q3 last year. So, I think we continue to do very well in existing hedge funds with our CTS fees in particular. But I think we are seeing, I think it\u2019s not unexpected, right. The both challenged part of the market is the institutional asset management space.  So, we are seeing very good growth in the asset owner space which is smaller for us, but they are relatively newer compared to the industry. But if I was to summarize it, I think it\u2019s the institutional asset managers or the traditional asset managers that are seeing the pressure. But we are seeing the cancellations. Toni Kaplan : Okay, great. And I know, Helen, you talked about the margin sustainability to an earlier question, but just trying to figure out an update on originally at the Investor Day last year, there was sort of a target of 100 basis points to margin expansion over the next few years and this year I think, you have had \u2013 you have outperformed that. And so, just trying to get a sense of have you accelerated the pace for just given as that has been a big contributor or should we still be looking at the 100 basis point next year as well? Thank you. Helen Shan : Sure. Thanks for your question. Listen, we are pleased about how we\u2019ve been executing our operational plan and our ability to meet and actually see our commitment for FY 2019. As we stated on the last call, we are not looking to manage to a margin but really grow revenues and earnings.  We are going through our strategic plans of this right now and so we are planning to determine how do we best invest to sustain for long-term growth and this is going to include spending in areas such as in content and in our infrastructure including technology, technology stack and our people. We are not necessarily \u2013 we did get a benefit from FX for this year and \u2013 but we are not necessarily assuming that going forward.  But we will come back to you when we got new information as it relates to our margins going forward. Toni Kaplan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Heckmann from Davidson. Your line is open. Peter Heckmann : Hi, thanks for taking my question. This may just be a follow-up, but it\u2019s a wide range of potential growth rates in the fourth quarter really just a product of the position of your guidance or are there some other uncertainties that you are trying to convey? Helen Shan : I make sure I follow your question because we narrowed our guidance across the board? Peter Heckmann : But, so if we take out the first three quarters, the fourth quarter is implying kind of 1% to 7% revenue growth. Helen Shan : Because I think you are talking about revenues because the numbers are so large, 1.42 to 1.44. You are trying back into \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t necessarily look at trying to look at that miss. It was much wider before if you look at our original guidance that was widest, because the numbers. I think it\u2019s the lot of number here that might be a little bit confusing. I don\u2019t see that we \u2013 you should necessarily look to a difference in our \u2013 we are not trying to convey a material difference in our growth rate. Peter Heckmann : Okay, okay. And then just as a follow-up, can you just talk about the tax items that occurred and was that added back with the non-GAAP EPS? Helen Shan : Yes, sure. Happy to do that. So, yes, these were related to a number of things including adjustment to our provision from last year. R&D tax credit, some impact from U.S. Tax Reform, the toll charge true up. So it\u2019s really a number of things, again out of this period and in some cases from last year.  So that helps drive that delta, but also as we mentioned overall, the higher exercise of options by employees where we get the tax benefit of that, it was higher than we would have expected and that\u2019s a material reason as well. Peter Heckmann : Got it. Thank you. Helen Shan : You are welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS. Your line is open. Alex Kramm : Yes, hey, good morning everyone. Just, Phil, in your prepared remarks, when you were addressing the tough environment out there, you were talking about taking steps with your clients to make sure cancellations will decline, et cetera. It sounded to me like, you have taken some pricing steps maybe on the negative side to maybe lock in some clients. Can you just flush it out a little bit to know what\u2019s going on there? Thank you. Phil Snow : Sure. So, I think really what we are doing there, Alex, is continuing to elevate the level of conversation we have, particularly with our larger clients. So, given the breadth of our offerings now, and the challenges our clients face, there is a very good opportunity to sit down with them, educate them about everything we can do from a content and technology and workflow standpoint and look to get into multi-year agreements where we can grow and succeed together.  So I think that\u2019s a little bit more of what we are referring to. Of course, in a competitive environment price does come into it. But I think we are looking to have conversations with clients before their contracts come to an end to talk about lengthening the contracts and restructuring things in a way which is a win-win. Alex Kramm : Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then just, just for the 4Q guidance on ASV or the implied 4Q guidance, maybe what\u2019s split in here is here, but if I look at the sequential quarter-over-quarter increase that you need at the midpoint, I think it\u2019s still a decent step-up and I know the fourth quarter is usually a pretty good quarter and I think somebody asked that before in terms of the pipeline.  Can you just describe, like, are there couple of big wins that you have in the pipeline that need to happen to get to this or is this a very diverse set of wins that you are looking for. I guess, I am trying to ask like, are you really looking for couple big ones here to make the year or is it just business as usual that should get you there? Phil Snow : That\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s the second. It\u2019s the business as usual. So I took a very close look at the pipeline. Q4 is a massive quarter for us. But in there is a very strong diverse portfolio of opportunities both by geography and by business lines. So, there are no massive deals either on the positive or negative side.  And I believe will impact the quarter in a binary fashion. I think it\u2019s really just a question of the sales team executing at a very high level which they will do to close a large number of deals in a relatively short period of time. But that\u2019s what we do every Q4. Alex Kramm : All right. Very helpful again. Thank you. Phil Snow : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. Drew Kootman : Hi, this is Drew Kootman on for Joe. I just wanted to ask about how the impact of wealth management this year and what you see moving forward? Phil Snow : Yes, so, obviously we had that fantastic deal that we signed last year and executed on this year and we captured the majority of the revenue in the first half. What we\u2019ve been doing for the rest of the fiscal year really is just building the pipeline.  So, we got a lot of interest from a lot of clients given the visibility of that deal. We\u2019ve had some very successful trials that we\u2019ve been running and I would expect the majority of the impact to start hitting next fiscal year not in Q4 of this year. Drew Kootman : Great. And then, just as a follow-up, looking at the Americas, it looks like it continues to be strong. So maybe you could just touch on the demand there and what you are seeing from there? Phil Snow : Yes. So, the Americas team is performing very well. In a lot of ways, it\u2019s our most mature business just in terms of the profits that we have for this market and the size of the sales team. I think Americas is really going to benefit highly from some of the new products that we\u2019ve been releasing. A great example is our portfolio management platform. So, we\u2019ve been hard at work the last two or three years integrating the acquisitions we did for what we been calling the portfolio lifecycle. And this quarter is the quarter that we released our portfolio management last one, which we believe will have good impacts for us in the front office of the buy side and the Americas sales team now I think is really getting geared up as to go out there and begin to educate clients about this offering. Drew Kootman : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks for taking my question. Phil, maybe just a quick follow-up. You talked about increased competitive pressure we\u2019ve also - which is being on cancellations, but you're also seeing some of your clients having cost pressure and then the changes within your sales force as well.  So, question there is, with all these headwinds, is there any potential risk to converting the pipeline in the fourth quarter given fourth quarter is such a strong in terms of ASV and pipeline conversions? Phil Snow : I've got a lot of confidence in our sales force and we have a great products and clients like working with us. They trust FactSet. So I think we are very well positioned to execute on Q4. There is nothing as I look out over the next few months that makes me feel any different than I felt at this time last year. Ashish Sabadra : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And maybe, Helen, a quick question, so one-time revenue of roughly $5 million which we saw in the third quarter, is it fair to assume that it flowed directly to the bottom-line in the sense there wasn\u2019t really any cost associated with it? Helen Shan : Yes. There is. Ashish Sabadra : And so, what was the \u2013 sorry, go ahead. Helen Shan : Yes. So, you are correct on that. So, that\u2019s why you are seeing that difference between GAAP to more significant difference between GAAP and adjusted this quarter. So you are right, that just flowed straight through. Ashish Sabadra : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Chu from Bank of America. Your line is open. David Chu : Thanks guys. Can you guys discuss what you are seeing from the sell side? It looks like ASV moderated quite a bit after five straight quarters of acceleration? Phil Snow : Yes, so, the sell side is pretty lumpy. We\u2019ve had a very good run in terms of increasing our footprint on the sell side. Q4 was a little hard for us to gauge. That\u2019s when a lot of the banks do their hirings and that\u2019s actually one of the hardest things to predict in terms of the Q4 pipeline sometimes as how many new hires the banks will hire and that can be a lot of people multiplied by the price of the FactSet workstation.  So, we typically get more visibility on this as the quarter comes to a close. But we are very pleased with the work we\u2019ve done on the sell side and we are doing a lot within our products particularly on the content side that I think is going to be exciting for our sell side clients as we move into the next fiscal year. David Chu : Okay. And then, Helen, just based on the guide, it looks like intangible asset amortization is really expected to fall off in the fourth quarter. Just wondering if I am thinking about this correctly? Helen Shan : Sorry, that you expected to fall off you said? David Chu : Yes, because I mean, it looks like there is about over $5 million this quarter right? Or around $5 million and based on your annual outlook, does it \u2013 is it expected to fall off quite a bit? Helen Shan : Okay. So, that\u2019s all your question, do you want to follow-up with Rima. But there is nothing material change that we would see happening. So that might be something which needs to clarify with you. David Chu : Okay. Sounds good. Thank you. Helen Shan : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Appert from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Peter Appert : Hi, good morning. So I'm - just stocks, big outperformer obviously, and I am wondering if that has any impact on your thought process in terms of the pace of buybacks going forward? Helen Shan : Sure. Thanks for that. I\u2019ll take that one. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve bought back stock around 150 million. But we are opportunistic is how we enter into the market, like you, we watch the share price every day. So, we are pretty happy with the trajectory of how the stock performed over the quarter. But from our perspective we weren\u2019t necessarily in the market though to chase that.  We\u2019ve continued to be very good about returning cash to shareholders. We increased our dividend this past quarter and we just increased the share repurchase program. So right now, we are looking for \u2013 how to continue to target around 200 million for this fiscal year. But, again, we are opportunistic. So, we\u2019ll see how things go. Peter Appert : And then, Phil I am wondering if you have any thoughts on the change in competitive dynamic was Refinitiv now separated from Thomson Reuters. Whether you are seeing they are having any impact on the market or any changes in behavior related to that? Phil Snow : No, Peter. I mean, we\u2019ve actually not seen much of a change in behavior. So, there are \u2013 we do compete with Refinitiv. I would say that's primarily going to be on the wealth side, I would say moving forward. But beyond that, we have not seen much of a change at all. Peter Appert : Okay. Thank you. Phil Snow : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. You called out the cancellation by a large corporate client this quarter since we decided to go in another direction. Can you elaborate on why the client canceled, if it was due to pricing or product capabilities? And then talk about how cancellation rates more broadly are trending? Phil Snow : Yes, so that\u2019s it\u2019s difficult to put yourselves in the mind of the other client. But I think, as I mentioned earlier, if you are thinking about having contents within your organization or on your platform, you\u2019ve got a buy build or a partner decision. It\u2019s something that FactSet faces every day and I think in that case, they\u2019ve probably decided either building it or partnering with someone else who was the best solution for that and that can be complicated in terms of the decision-making process.  When we are talking about cancellations of this size, on FactSet, this was a little bit of an outlier for us on the place that we do have a very good business with corporate. But this was probably the largest one that we had. So, I would not expect more of this size or frequency like I said this was a ten year contract.  It was a very long contract. So there was nothing about our products which we\u2019ve continued to improve and is massively successful on our platform and that was the reason for the cancellation. George Tong : Got it. And you indicated that you overestimated how much revenue you would get from new products and that contributed to some of the ASV guidance modifications. Can you discuss what caused that overestimation? Whether it\u2019s a function of evolving competitive dynamics more recently? Whether it\u2019s due to pricing or if it\u2019s due to sales force efficiency? Phil Snow : It\u2019s a great question. A lot goes into I think the business plan. When you are releasing these products there is a lot of factors. So I think, one of the things I am excited about is the increased discipline that we have here internally in terms of what we are spending our money on our projections, I think we can get better and better over the time.  I am very confident in the direction. Like I said, we\u2019ve already begun to monetize analytics APIs. But we just learned a few things in the market in terms of the functionality of the clients would want, how we want to price this and so on. So, that\u2019s really all the color I can give you Tong. George Tong : Got it. Helpful. Thank you. Phil Snow : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie Capital. Your line is open. Mario Cortellacci : Hi this is Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. Could you just give us an update on what you are hearing from clients given the current environment. Just one of you maybe you can compare what you are hearing in the U.S. versus Europe, versus Asia, and kind of compare those for us? Phil Snow : So, I think the themes very consistent Mario globally. Clients are looking to drive efficiencies within their organizations so that they can free up their resources to work on higher value activities and really look for more offer and so on. So, a lot of our conversation is really around how we can help them with those efficiencies. Part of that is just them consolidating their services onto FactSet.  Lots of clients are trying to make sense of the all the data they have within their organizations as the pace of data explodes and people need to look and see-through more of it. So we have lots of conversations with clients around how to help them organize their data. How to outsource stuff. Things they want to do in the public cloud that we can help them with.  It really is not that complicated. I think clients just want to do some of the things more efficiently with firms like FactSet so they can really focus on where they add value. Mario Cortellacci : Got it. Thanks. And just a quick follow-up. I mean, we know that there are pressures from clients regarding cost, but, I mean, could you give us a sense of, I guess, where or when you can reach an equilibrium or do you have working timeframe that you guys use while planning for the future? Or how do you think about catalyst that could help you with pricing longer term? Phil Snow : Could you restate the question? Mario Cortellacci : Sure, yes. I mean, so we know that there is costs from \u2013 I am sorry, there is cost pressures from clients. Do you wanted to see if you ever thought about like an equilibrium regarding pricing or if there is a timeframe that you use while planning for the future or maybe if you think about catalyst that could help you with pricing longer term? Phil Snow : So, it\u2019s - pricing is something we are looking at. FactSet is very modular in terms of our pricing and we may have overcomplicated things as we\u2019ve evolved as an organization. So, we are in the middle now of evaluating our business model. And as we open up our platform, we are considering new ways that we can get into enterprise agreements with our clients.  So, that\u2019s a piece of work that\u2019s ongoing. And I would expect that you might hear more from us on that. But it wouldn\u2019t be for probably at least a couple of quarters. Helen Shan : So, I guess, one thing you might consider obviously the way to continue to capture prices is putting more value for the client, as Phil was saying. That\u2019s what we are focused on. Clients want to pay for what they don\u2019t continue to have pricing pressures, but the way to get to the ability for equilibrium to use the word, is that we will continue to add value and clients will want to pay for that. Mario Cortellacci : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Keith Housum from Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Keith Housum : Good morning. I was hoping to explore the professional fees item that you guys have included in ASV. If you could provide a bit of color obviously that must be increasing, but how long does you should take grow professional fees to turn around and get recognized into revenue? And then, perhaps is the margin profile different from those fees and you would think of the rest of the ASV bucket? Helen Shan : Sure. Let me try to talk that through and then any follow-ups you have, you can definitely have with Rima. But the way that we take a look at professional fees is that we look at that over the last twelve months and add that in. We don\u2019t try to project out for say, from \u2013 and you\u2019ll think about ASV as an annual subscription value, professional fees are quarter-by-quarter.  So, from that perspective, it's really looking backwards on what we have already captured. In terms of how that comes through from a revenue perspective, it goes through in the quarter then it gets realized. Keith Housum : Got you. Helen, the margin profile of that business? Helen Shan : Well, it\u2019s more of a people-intensive business. But honestly it gets added on to some of our \u2013 it\u2019s a mix. So, some of it gets added on to our other existing business. So we don\u2019t really necessarily look at its own standalone business. Keith Housum : Okay then, just real quick in terms of the change in sales leadership over the quarter. Any change in the sales strategy in terms of how you guys go to market? Phil Snow : So, I think, sales was executed exceptionally well over the last two years. I think the biggest change is moving the sales specialists into the business lines that we created. I think the biggest impact we will see there is within analytics and CGS. So, about a third of our client facing sales force or sales specialists that know these products in very high detail, they are very good at pre-sales and they also do the implementation.  So, we think we will get great efficiency by moving the specialists into these groups. That\u2019s one change I think we\u2019re also going to be looking at the FactSet consultants and how they are coupled up with the sales force to make all of our client facing staff a little bit more commercially focused, not just the general sales people and continuing to push out the regional model that we\u2019ve begun over the last two years as well as expanding our focus on the C-suite.  So, we had the strategic client group which is, our top thirty or so clients. But that\u2019s been very successful in elevating conversations and we are looking at ways to expand that within the different regions. So, that\u2019s the summary.  I think some of you will have an opportunity to meet Franck pretty soon as we meet with you between quarters. And I think he\u2019d be very excited to talk to you about some of the changes he is planning to bring to the organization. Keith Housum : Thank you. Phil Snow : Sure. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy from Raymond James. Your line is now open. Patrick O'Shaughnessy : Hey, good morning. So, Symphony Communications raised another $165 million in capital during the quarter. Are you guys seeing any signs or any evidence of adoption of Symphony as a chat tool by your client base at this point? Phil Snow : So we have partnered with Symphony over time. We do see within our clients good, I think adoption within the clients. But we\u2019ve not yet seen a lot of cross - cross phone communication. So, I think it\u2019s there. But we don\u2019t see a lot of communication directly between the buy side and the sell side on Symphony. But I am not \u2013 I don\u2019t want to position myself as an expert in that area by any mean, so. Patrick O'Shaughnessy : Okay. Fair enough. And then, maybe one last quick question on the tax rate. So, moving lower this year due to this stock benefits. Any implications as we kind of think about modeling tax rate going forward? Are you kind of looking that as a benefit isolated to fiscal 2019 at this point? Helen Shan : Right. So, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily, at this point change the view on that. That is such a \u2013 I\u2019ll use the word unpredictable. Given the trajectory of our share price, if it continues we would expect this to be a continued positive for us. So, I would probably just say within our range for now. Patrick O'Shaughnessy : Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Phil Snow, I turn the call back over to you. Phil Snow : Well, thanks everyone for joining us on the call today and we are encouraged by the growth we achieved this year amid challenging headwinds and see this as a proof point that our long-term strategy is working.  We expect to finish the year with strong revenue, margin and EPS and to continue to capture wallet share and deliver value to shareholders. If you have additional questions, please call Rima Hyder and we look forward to speaking with you all next quarter. Operator, that ends today\u2019s call. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Rima Hyder, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead. Rima Hyder : Thank you, Chris, and good day, everyone. Welcome to FactSet\u2019s fourth fiscal quarter 2019 earnings conference call. We come to you today from London, England our European headquarters. Before we begin, I would like to point out that the slides we will reference during the course of this presentation can be accessed via the webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at factset.com. The slides will be posted on our website at the conclusion of this call. A replay of today\u2019s call will be available via phone and on our website. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions from investors. To be fair to everyone, please limit yourself to one, plus one follow-up. Before we discuss our results, I encourage all listeners to review the legal notice on Slide 2, which explains the risks of forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, please refer to our forms 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the appendix to the presentation and in our earnings release issued earlier today. Joining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer and Helen Shan, Chief Financial Officer. And now I'd like to turn the discussion over to Phil Snow. Phil Snow : Thanks, Rima, and good morning and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m pleased to report that we ended fiscal 2019 on solid footing. Not many companies in any industry can say that they\u2019ve delivered 39 consecutive years of top line growth and 23 years of adjusted diluted EPS growth. We\u2019ve been able to deliver consistent growth, because we\u2019ve continually innovated and pivoted when necessary, focusing our investments on our content, technology and our people. In fiscal 2019, we successfully launched new product, gained new clients and garnered support for many of the new initiatives we are planning to take into 2020. Additionally, we increased work force productivity, realigned our sales force, improved discretionary expense management and made important operational improvements to enhance our infrastructure. On Slide 6, you can see our annual break out for the different businesses at FactSet and we are proud to report that all four businesses grew year-over-year. Analytics continues to be our largest overall growth contributor. We remain confident about the strength of our entire portfolio analytic suite and the further integrated solutions offered across the entire portfolio lifecycle workflow. Newer products, such as APIs and portfolio management platform have started to ramp up and we are continuing to build out our enterprise risk solution. We are also encouraged by the analytic second half 2019 momentum going into 2020. Turning to CTS, we believe this business can accelerate its growth rate. Demand for our core data feeds and the addition of new data sets are big drivers for this business. There is an explosion in the volume of data in our industry as the pendulum swings more towards quantitative and data driven strategies in the search for alpha. FactSet has always served this segment well and we\u2019re now perfectly positioned to take advantage of this trend and lead the market with our integrated content and open platform. Our wealth business had a strong year with several large opportunities that we have the ability to win, we believe we can accelerate the growth in this business. We are quickly innovating our solution for wealth advisors and the client feedback has been outstanding. Research, our largest business had a solid year. We are really pleased to see growth across the majority of client types and we look forward to building on the initial success of our deep sector strategy and expanded content sets within the workstation. In fiscal '19, we grew our workstations double-digits within banking, corporate and private equity clients and we plan to invest in content to serve the segment of the market during fiscal '20. As we start the year, we believe in our ability to succeed in a changing environment. We operate amid an industry backdrop of continued cost pressures and evolution. And with more complex and unstructured data and with active and passive investing vying to find an equilibrium, clients are constantly evaluating technology transformations and are clearly willing to invest in solutions that help them become more efficient in their workflows. We believe that FactSet smarter connected content will continue to differentiate us in the marketplace. And the key to remaining ahead of the curve is an increasingly open platform that includes more APIs, unique and personalized data and speed to market. FactSet's value proposition has always been to help clients be more efficient and uncover more alpha. And as you know integrating content into FactSet ecosystem has been one of our biggest strengths and key differentiators in the industry for the last four decades. Over the next three years, we plan to accelerate our investment to increase the breadth and depth of our content and enhance our technology with the goal of driving higher top line growth. We're doing this now from a position of strength to reinforce and extend our leadership in the market and capitalize on industry trends. We will take advantage of the shift from public to private investments, increased sophistication and the needs of wealth advisors and their clients, the need for more automation and operational efficiency on the buy side and sell side and an ever-expanding global data universe. Content and its integration is our greatest asset. And essential to our vision and strategy is extending the set of facts available on our platform. Now turning to Slide 7, we outlined the two main areas comprising this investment. We plan to make investments in content for deep sector, private markets and wealth. Within analytics, we will continue to focus on capitalizing on our investment in risk and the integrated portfolio lifecycle. First, deep sector includes detailed data for additional industries and builds upon the proven market success of a banking regulatory data launched earlier in fiscal 2019. We believe this will help improve retention, allow us to grow existing relationships and also capture new logos in banking. We also see an opportunity to monetize this data within corporates, our fastest-growing client type, selling industry-specific data back to companies in those industries. Second, we seek to create industry-leading private market content, improving the scope of this data. We believe this opens up a larger opportunity for us with multiple clients in banking, private equity, venture capitalists and corporates. The integration of private and public company data will be a differentiator. Third, we believe we have an opportunity to capture significant market share in the wealth space with increased content investment. For example, on news product, StreetAccount is already a successful and highly valued product. We plan to invest more in it and make it a global products covering multiple financial markets. On the technology front, we expect to accelerate our investment in three key areas. First, we plan to accelerate our API program, a key piece of our open strategy, which should help us to achieve a high level of modularity. This is an area that clients are focused on as they embark on their own in-house technology transformations. Second, we expect to create a better experience for our clients that should help them be more efficient and uncover alpha through personalization. We plan to bring our content to life by leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence and other techniques to create smart content. Third, we believe, we will gain significant efficiencies for our clients and our self by moving to the public cloud. Time-to-market of new products should improve on a scalable foundation with variably priced economics. For example, internally, we expect to increase productivity within our sales force and bring scale to our content collection and integration processes. For our clients, we plan to shorten the client sales cycle from solution evaluation to purchase as evidenced by the success we have seen in our data exploration products and CTS. Longer term, we believe we can reap cost savings versus our current data center model. Critical to FactSet success are our people, our service model and how we collaborate with our clients. As we move ahead, we're excited by the opportunity to expand our content sets, enhance our technologies and invest in our people. I'm proud of our team's solid performance this year as there is a lot to be excited about as we look ahead to fiscal '20 and beyond. We will take every opportunity to pull further ahead of our competitors, with our open platform and connected suite of data and analytics solutions led as always by our people who consistently deliver the strongest customer service in the industry. Let me now turn the call over to Helen, who will discuss the specifics of FY 2019 performance, our 3-year investment plan and FY '20 guidance. Helen Shan : Thank you, Phil, and hello, good morning and good afternoon, everyone. It is great to be here with all of you. We finished our fiscal 2019 with solid operating performance in line with our guidance with stronger results in operating margin and EPS. For the year, the improvements were largely driven by higher revenue growth, productivity gains and cost management. We grew organic revenue by 6% and operating income by nearly 20%, resulting in an operational margin increase of 340 basis points to 30.5%. On an adjusted basis, the operating margin grew by 190 basis points over the previous year to 33 2%. Our adjusted EPS grew over 19% to $10 per share. We are pleased that we were able to execute successfully this year on our plan to drive solid top line and bottom-line growth. Additionally, we exceeded our targeted margin expansion. I will now walk us through the specifics of our fourth quarter as well as our fiscal 2020 and our investment plans. GAAP and organic revenue increased to $365 million and $366 million, respectively. Growth was driven primarily by analytics, CTS and wealth. For our geographic segments, over the last 12 months, Americas revenue grew 4% and international revenue grew 8% organically. Americas benefited from increases in wealth, analytics and CTS. International revenue was largely driven by analytics and CTS. ASV plus professional services increased to $1.48 billion at the end of our fourth quarter at a growth rate of 5.1% and up $35 million since the end of our third quarter. The growth for the quarter was driven primarily by analytics and CTS. Americas and EMEA ASV grew 5% and 4%, respectively. And Asia-Pacific continue to be our fastest-growing region at 11%. GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter totaled $253 million, 2% less than last year. Keep in mind, for year-over-year comparison purposes that we had one-time charges related to restructuring costs and those benefits reflected in this quarter. As a result, our GAAP margin increased 510 basis points to 31%. Adjusted operating margin increased to 34%, a 260 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter of 2018. This improvement continues to reflect disciplined discretionary expense management and lower employee costs through productivity gain. As a percentage of revenue, the expense improvement came largely from our cost of services, which was 300 basis points lower than last year on a GAAP basis. On an adjusted basis, the improvement was 240 basis points. Margins were impacted positively by faster growth in revenue versus cost of services year-over-year. Contributing factors include : decreases in employee compensation from both the continued mix shift from high to low cost locations and the timing of hiring as well as contractor fees. This benefit was partially offset by an increase in computer-related expenses as we continue to upgrade our technology stack. SG&A expenses, expressed as a percentage of revenue, experienced an improvement of 220 basis points over the prior year period on a GAAP basis. On an adjusted basis, this change was essentially flat. This result in -- this result is driven primarily by expense reductions in travel and entertainment, marketing, as well as employee compensation, offset by increased bad debt expense. Our tax rate for the quarter was 15.5%. For the full-year, our effective tax rate came in at 16.4%. Excluding one-time adjustment, our annual tax rate was 15.3%. Please keep in mind that when we provided annual guidance for fiscal 2019, we did not include any one-time adjustments in the tax rate. GAAP EPS increased 32% to $2.34 this quarter versus a $1.77 in the fourth quarter of 2018. This increase is attributable to higher revenue, improved margins and a lower effective tax rate. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 19% to $2.61. A reconciliation of our adjustments to GAAP EPS is disclosed at the end of press release. Free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations, less capital spending was $95 million for the quarter, an increase of 5% over the same period last year. The improvement was primarily due to higher net income, and an increase in cash collections, partially offset by higher capital expenditures. As noted on past calls, our CapEx is higher this year due to new office space build out for some of our locations and some existing leases have neared expiration, and increased investments in technology. Looking at our share repurchase program for the fourth quarter, we repurchased a little over 221,000 shares for $62 million at an average share price of $281. Over the last 12 months, we\u2019ve returned $320 million to our investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases. For those of you who have known the company for a long time, you know we are very good stewards of capital and investors interest, having increased dividends for 14 consecutive years and maintain a balanced capital allocation framework. Going forward, we remain committed to creating long-term value for our shareholders and to buying back our shares at a steady pace in line with the past several years. As Phil noted earlier, top line growth drives long-term value. We may progress this year in operational discipline through productivity, such as in the areas of engineering and content collection, cost management through greater empowerment to business leaders to manage budgets and have greater financial accountability and focus as reflected in our realignment of our sales force within the matrix organization. The value has been realized through our margin improvement. We've also invested this year in our solutions and infrastructure. As reflected in the launch of new products and the implementation of our new HR and finance system and the early movement of our technology to the cloud. We achieved our 2-year margin expansion target faster than projected. Over the next three years, we plan to capitalize on our FY '19 performance and take advantage by accelerating investments to grow ASV and revenue. Given the early successes that we have seen with our investments in deep sector content and based on our enhanced infrastructure for scale and efficiency, we believe that we can achieve our long-term objective. Our plan incorporates targeted actions that focus on driving growth across all our businesses, allowing us to scale its support for new growth and to streamline processes throughout the enterprise to increase productivity. We believe that this will result in a meaningful acceleration of revenue, particularly in our faster growing CTS and wealth businesses. We expect to drive higher rates of revenue retention and expansion in our larger and more mature businesses, research and analytics. As you can see on Slide 14, at the end of 2022, we believe we will accelerate our ASV growth rate, driven by the growth of -- in top line from each of our businesses. The addition of smarter content benefits all FactSet's products. Continued execution in our deep sector strategy, private market and wealth to directly benefit all of our businesses. We expect that all these initiatives will help improve retention, which is critical to our overall success. Our technology focus on additional APIs, personalized content and the move to the cloud enhances our ability to serve our clients better and faster. The returns on the technology spend include the anticipated productivity gains for FactSet as well through the use of automation and benefits of speed through the cloud. We are projecting that our adjusted operating margin will be at or above 33% by fiscal 2022 and that adjusted EPS growth will be at or above 10%. Turning now to our investment plan. We intend to reinvest additional 100 basis points of our margin into content and technology in each of the next three years. This acceleration is incremental and will result in some short-term margin dilution. The spend will be almost equally spread across the next three years and split between content and technology. Given the ramp-up time needed, we would expect to see roughly 25% of the revenue benefit to be realized in year two, and the remaining 75% to build up in year three. Similarly, we expect the productivity gains from faster development and content collection as well as the benefits of moving to the cloud through reduction of data centers to be more fully realized in years two and three. While this result in margin dilution in the short-term, we expect to capture margin growth as revenue is realized and productivity comes through. The investments in progress we've made in FY '19 have given us the proof points and confidence to execute our strategy. We continue to believe that long-term value must come from higher top line growth along with productivity gain. Moving to our annual outlook for fiscal 2020. For 2020, we expect ASV plus professional services for the year to increase between $65 million and $85 million. GAAP revenue is expected to be between $1.49 billion and $1.5 billion. Reflecting our increased investment in 2020, our GAAP operating margin is expected to be 28.5% to 29.5% and adjusted operating margin to be 31.5% to 32.5%.Our annual effective tax rate for the full year is expected to be in the range of 17% to 17.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $8.70 and $9 and adjusted diluted EPS range is between $9.85 and $10.15. In 2019, we have had significant tax benefits from an overall lower corporate rates and other one-time items as well as a large amount of stock option exercises due to the increase in our stock price. We are pleased with our operating results this quarter and for the fiscal year 2019, including the improvement of our -- in our operating margin. Our key competitive advantages, leading analytics solutions and open platform, the breadth and connectivity of our data and best-in-class client service will further differentiate us in the market. And of course, we look forward to continuing our proven track record of consistently returning value to our shareholders. And with that, we are now ready for your questions. Chris? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. Good morning. My first question is obviously around the margin. So two years ago, you called out 200 basis points, but your guidance is going to end up only being 50. Even if you look at your FY '22 guidance, margins are going to be basically flat from '19 to '22. And so my question is in the context of a lot of the other names in SPs, including a direct competitor, all finding ways to expand margins despite investments to growth and a lot of the same investments you guys have been talking about too. Why is it that FactSet can't do the same? Helen Shan : Hi. It's Helen. I will take it first. Thank you for your question. So I think there's a couple of things. One, when we talked about expansion in our margin, we accelerated and we were able to capture most of that, or actually all of that within a 1-year period. And as we look that, as Phil discussed, the ability to take what we view at a leadership position more quickly, in our view we are accelerating our margin -- our investments and from what is a longer time period into now. So that's why it's an incremental 1% that we're doing in each of the years. And we think afterwards that will bring us back to the level that we had given initially, which is more into the 33% plus area. So for us right now we're meeting what we committed to, which was to get through our 200 basis points improvement, we are accelerating that by investing more quickly. Phil Snow : And hey, Manav, its Phil. I guess, I will add on a little bit to that in that. We believe we have a very healthy margin in our business. And I think -- I don\u2019t know exactly which competitors you\u2019re referring to, but many of them have very high-margin businesses with our segments within that portfolio. But the pieces of that businesses that are more comparable to FactSet, I believe that we're doing well again. Manav Patnaik : I guess just the 33% level mark example, I mean that\u2019s kind of been the mark for a long time and you sort of move up and down that. My question is more broadly like why can't you invest to growth and grow margins beyond that 33%? Phil Snow : Well, I think that\u2019s our long-term plan. So with the investment that we are making, particularly in technology, that\u2019s going to allow us to be more efficient. It's going to allow our clients to be more efficient. And when our clients are more efficient that should also drive our top line growth in terms of the products that they\u2019re getting from us. Helen Shan : And I think that's an important point. We are not running the business simply to have a margin. We are running for both operating earnings growth. And what we want to do is drive top line growth and that\u2019s what these investments are meant to do. Manav Patnaik : Got it. And just one last one for me, talking with top line growth on the wealth side, the low teens expectations, can you just talk about the -- sort of the components there, like I guess that presumably assumes a lot of share gains over time or how much of that is market growth? Any color there would be helpful. Phil Snow : Yes. So, our wealth business is really split into two pieces. Part of it is the digital solution that we acquired a couple of years ago and the rest of it is the FactSet wealth products, that we've evolved from workstation to web. So those have different growth characteristics. The piece that we believe will grow materially faster is on the heels of the big deal that we did this fiscal year. We have a very healthy pipeline in wealth. These are large deals that take a long time to evaluate and materialize, the clients have long contract. But we are very optimistic about the future for that part of our business. Operator : Your next question is from a David Chu with Bank of America. Your line is open. David Chu : Great. Thanks. Yes, since we don't have the slides yet, so can you just discuss what your top line expectations are for '21 and '22? Phil Snow : Yes. So the top line expectations for '22, we had in the slides. So what we laid out there David was that we believe we will exit 2022 with high single-digit top line growth. Within the analytics segment, that will be at high single-digit growth. CTS could be in the high teens to low 20s. Wealth we believe will be in the low teens, and research, we believe will be in low single-digit growth. David Chu : Okay. And should we assume like a step up in '21 relative to '20 based on internal expectations or could it be just like roughly in line in '22 is really where we -- where it\u2019s the pickup? Phil Snow : I believe that we should see some acceleration from '20 to '21. Helen Shan : So just kind of keep in mind based on the company performances that acceleration really does occur in '22. That\u2019s our target. David Chu : Got you. And just the follow-up, so the timing of spend for 2020, it sounded like it was kind of even. Is this like all in the first quarter or are you saying even like split evenly among supporters are like one quarter of the incremental spend in each of the quarters or how should we think about the cadence of that? Helen Shan : That\u2019s a good question. I mean, what I was referring to is really even spend over the year, so across each of different years. I think quarter's will vary a bit depending on what it is that we're attacking. But you would see generally going probably across all four quarters. David Chu : So you're saying like incremental quarter -- higher spend per quarter? Helen Shan : I think that's right. There might be some quarters where that is up or down depending on the particular investment. We will be managing this pretty tightly. So that will be part of the way that we have greater operational view of achieving it. David Chu : Okay. Thank you. Helen Shan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Toni Kaplan : Thanks for taking my questions. I was hoping you could give us a sensitive breakdown of the margin drivers in 2020. So the investment program obviously will have a big hit to margins, but could you talk about how you\u2019re viewing in terms of the guidance the other drivers like efficiency, FX etcetera and also just in terms of the investment program if you could give us a sense of OpEx versus CapEx mix there? And how we should be thinking about CapEx over time? Helen Shan : Sure. I will make sure I will cover all that. So I think as we think about the productivity gains, it's fairly the same. What we think we captured 190 basis points this year, of which lets call it a 60-ish was from FX. We are not assuming any FX benefit next year, Toni, because we don't -- we are not in a business to trying to project FX. You could expect the rest to continue on. So really the rest of it quite frankly is -- and keeping in mind the investment we are making is on top of what we already have in play. We have been investing in as we talked about before, whether it's in deep sector or whether it was in the cloud, the movement to the cloud. So I would think that both from a productivity perspective, we should expect to see that come through the full point. The additional point is really is investment. In terms of CapEx, our CapEx this year was around $60 million and that would be essentially as things come off and on roughly the same going forward at least from what you see from FY '20. Toni Kaplan : Okay, great. And you\u2019re now including professional services in the workflow solutions growth rates. Could you give us a sense of would research have been negative if you hadn't included professional services in it. What segments have the most professional services ASV associated with them? And if you can give the growth rates x professional services so we can comp them to the prior methodology, that would be helpful. But if not, that's fine. Helen Shan : So I think probably that any details around that you can definitely follow-up with Rima. But broadly speaking, let me address your question which is that research would not have been on negative without professional services. Professional services spend is largely in the analytics part of our business as well as some in wealth, but we will not look at research as being impacted by that. Toni Kaplan : All right. Thank you. Helen Shan : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question is from Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Ashish Sabadra : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So a question on the fiscal year '20 ASV guidance. When I look at the high-end, it seems to be higher compared to what featured in fiscal year '19, although fiscal year '19 benefited from the [indiscernible]. So my question is just given the limited visibility beyond one to two quarters and some of the challenges in the end market and the competitive pressure, how you -- what are your assumptions for the ACV growth -- ASV growth, sorry, in 2020. Can you just -- [indiscernible] some color on that front? Phil Snow : Yes. Thanks, Ashish. This is Phil. So I think overall we wanted to be realistic in terms of our guidance for the midpoint given the continued pressure that we see on active managers and this is a little bit of a wider range of outcomes than we gave you last year. I think for us to hit the high-end of the guidance range, the one thing that could really drive us towards that is the wealth business. So we have quite a few large opportunities in the wealth pipeline that are significant that will be getting a decision on sometime in FY '20. Those are larger deals. It's pretty binary. You either get it or you don't. So those are the things that we think are probably giving us the greatest chance of coming towards the high-end. Ashish Sabadra : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And maybe just a quick question on client attrition that has increased if you consider retention went down from 91% to 89%. Just can you give some color on that front and how should we think of [multiple speakers]? Phil Snow : Yes. We are still -- I\u2019m -- yes, sure. I\u2019m still very pleased that we are adding clients. I think if you look at that we're adding clients across a number of different client types and we continue to add users across a number of workflows. So FactSet is gaining market share I think in terms of the people that have the product. I think what you're seeing there and the calculation is probably the long tail of smaller clients that we have and the churn that you see at the -- in the long tail of clients. We have well over 5,000 clients. Ashish Sabadra : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Phil Snow : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open. Alex Kramm : Good morning, everyone. Want to come back to the 2022 kind of what you\u2019ve laid out there. Maybe you can talk a little bit of what confidence level in to get there -- I mean, and what really needs to happen? I mean I can appreciate that a lot of it is I think coming from execution and hopefully you will do a good job there, but I remember when you took the job, Phil, a couple of years ago, you thought the business has the potential to get back to double-digit. And we\u2019ve been decelerating and I know it's been a tough environment, so I guess I'm wondering if the environment gets worse from here, do you think you can get to that high single-digit again, or is this kind of steady-state and execution to get you there only? Does that make sense. Phil Snow : Yes. So, thanks for the question, Alex. Yes, we believe we can get there. It is a tough environment. Our assumption is that it continues to be tough. When we look at the investments that we laid out for content and technology and how they apply to each piece of our business, we believe there is an opportunity to accelerate the growth rate for each one of them. There is also a lot that we have invested over the last few years in some of the acquisitions, getting those integrated, building our open FactSet marketplace, those are just beginning to bear fruit. So I think what you will begin to see as we move into '20, is a greater contribution, particularly with analytics, things like our portfolio management platform, our API program, the Vault product, which is a combination of the BISAM product that we acquired with PA. Those are really beginning to take hold and we saw a very good Q4 for analytics relative to Q4 of last year and an improvement in the pipeline moving forward. So, analytics was our biggest miss this year relative to what we thought we are going to do. I think you can see that the growth rate came down. But we believe strongly in this business. It really is the most differentiated part of FactSet in some ways. And that\u2019s going to I think be positive. CTS is great. That the trends are at our backs there in the marketplace. Clients want data delivered in new ways. Today they really just get it in feeds from FactSet. Once we built an API program for CTS, that\u2019s going to allow us to get more customers there. And as we continue to build more of our own content and integrate other people's content, we believe that CTS has a very long runway in terms of its growth rate. I already spoke about wealth and the investments that we\u2019re making in research, particularly around private market content and deep sector strategy. We've already seen very positive reactions from our clients, particularly around deep sector. So all those things lead us to believe that we -- what we laid out, that view, is achievable in 2020. Alex Kramm : Okay. Very helpful. Thank you. And then just I guess related to that to some degree I think during your tenure over the last few years, when things got a little bit choppier, you\u2019ve also got more aggressive on M&A to essentially by faster growing areas in the industry, which I think has been helpful. It's been a little bit absent in the last couple of years. So if I look at this today and I look at the target, maybe a little M&A could help. So maybe you give us an update about your latest view of what\u2019s up? And then also is this all organic, by the way, and your assumptions to 2022 or no? Phil Snow : Yes, that\u2019s a great question. Maybe we should have made that clear. So this is our organic thesis. We are looking at M&A. We decided to take a little bit of a break to get the software that we acquired integrated. And as I mentioned, I think we're there. It took a little bit longer than I had anticipated, but we are actively looking particularly at content investments that are out there. So when we look at deep sector, when we look at private markets, those are all a buy build partner strategy. So if there's stuff out there, that\u2019s attractive to us. We will execute on it. Alex Kramm : All right. Thanks again. Operator : Your next question is from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Bill Warmington : Good morning, everyone. So you recently realigned the sales force. I wanted to ask how much is that contributing to the lower ASV growth and how long before the sales productivity improves, or is it really more of a function of the industry headwinds intensifying? Phil Snow : Yes. Hey, Bill. It's Phil. Thanks for the question. So, yes, we realigned the sales force. We\u2019ve moved the specialist back into the business lines, which has been very helpful. And we think that will really help us with analytics and CTS in particular in driving higher growth rates. We believe that some of the miss that we saw in analytics was related to the specialists not being more closely aligned with the businesses. So that\u2019s already happened. We are also aligning sales and consulting in a way where we're going to I think have more of a focus on client retention for the consultants that support FactSet. So those are two things that we are positive about and we are also believe creating -- a team is dedicated to new business to focus on capturing new logos. So all of that's in flight and the sales team is excited. We just had a couple of very inspiring sales pick-off meetings in Americas and EMEA, and I can tell you from speaking to them personally, that there's a lot of energy and excitement about what we can achieve moving forward. Bill Warmington : And then for my follow-up, I wanted to ask if you could give us some examples of the type of content that you're investing in? Phil Snow : Yes. So we are -- I think we are already investing in some of the content that we laid out today. You're talking about organic investments? Bill Warmington : Yes, the ones you\u2019re -- drivers for the future revenue growth in terms of deep content that you're talking about putting dollars into. Phil Snow : Yes, so let me say deep sector strategy really what we mean is data that goes deeper for particular industries. So we made a small acquisition that we integrated last year for our banking, a data that's been very well received on the sell side and we are looking -- to look at eight or nine other industries over the next three years that we can integrate. Bill Warmington : All right. Thank you very much. Phil Snow : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Peter Heckmann with Davidson. Your line is open. Peter Heckmann : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Helen, could you talk about what level of share repurchase might be implied in your annual guidance, or are you -- is any included or not? Helen Shan : Sure. Thanks for your question. Right now, we are looking to repurchase shares in line with how we've been doing in the past. So if you look at the last several years on average, it's around the $200 million to $300 million. So that's what we've assumed. Peter Heckmann : Okay, great. And then in terms of Europe a little bit slower ASV growth. Was there a portion of that, that you would attribute to some of the uncertainties around Brexit or was it just more broad based? Phil Snow : Hi. It's Phil. I would say that's more broad based. We actually had a very positive year here in the U.K and the U.K team grew this market faster than the overall EMEA region. Peter Heckmann : All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is open. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Hey Phil, you've been doing M&A and looking to kind of reposition the company from workstation to workflow for last several years and why is this the right time now to make these investments versus maybe what it would have been a several years ago or kicking the can down the road, like what came to a head right now? Phil Snow : I think we\u2019ve learned some things over the years, Shlomo. So we've had a lot of irons in the fire here at FactSet and the trends have been shifting over the last five years and we\u2019ve been very consistent as you pointed out in your research report in terms of delivering double-digit EPS growth over the years. And I just sat down with the management team about six months ago; we took a very hard look at our business and decided that the best thing for our clients, our employees and our investors in the long-term was to make these bigger bets in content and particularly technology. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. And then what -- can you just explain a little bit the guidance implies that the top line is continuing to decelerate into fiscal year '20. The [indiscernible] positive commentary you made about changes in the sales force or so, can you give us some of the thoughts as to what are some of the cross currents that you're seeing. Is it just kind of the continued trend downward without the ability of some of this investment to reverse some of that or can you give us a little level detail greater, so we can kind of understand how you're thinking about it? Helen Shan : Yes. Why don\u2019t I take that one, Shlomo. Thanks for your question. So I think the way -- you're right, there are the headwinds out there. But you also see that we\u2019ve a pretty big range back to the points that Phil had alluded to before, where there can be things that will drive us one way or the other. But yes, we do believe this is with the right time to be accelerating what we had plans in place already, but by accelerating into those investments, we can drive each of the different components as laid out on that slide to those particular growth rate. So, I think is put from our perspective, it's the investments that will help us get there. Shlomo Rosenbaum : So why is the top line expected to continue slowing? Is that like I'm just trying to figure out what's going on. I mean, the growth like 3.8% to 4.5% versus what you've been kind of 5% to 6% over the last several years? Helen Shan : Yes, so I guess I'm thinking about ASV as the way to think about that a little bit. It's a little bit about the timing of when the ASV comes in as well. We are more back half loaded in general in our history as you I know works well and next year, we expect to see the same. We saw some of that even in this year, right, which is manifesting itself. So that's why you're seeing that phenomenon. Shlomo Rosenbaum : All right. Thanks. Helen Shan : Welcome. Operator : Your next question is from Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. Drew Kootman : Hi. This is Drew Kootman on for Joe. I was wondering if you could talk about the recent market volatility and if you're seeing any impact to demand or anything moving forward? Phil Snow : Hey, Drew. It's Phil. So, yes, I wouldn't say that the volatility we've seen recently is anything more than we've experienced over the last number of years. So that is not I think superseding the other trends that we see out there in the marketplace. Drew Kootman : Okay. And then just for my follow-up, just looking at the U.S revenue growth looks like, it decelerated this quarter. Just curious if there's anything to point out and the demand you're seeing on that as well. Thank you. Phil Snow : Yes. The U.S team -- I think we grew the U.S in mid single digits. We did have one large cancel in Q3 that may have affected the long-term growth rate there. But we believe there's a lot of opportunity in the U.S moving forward. Drew Kootman : Thank you. Phil Snow : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Keith Housum : Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Hey just -- I'm not sure if I saw or not, but in terms of the ASV retention rate, did you guys disclosed that, and if not, could you do out it now? Helen Shan : Hi. This is Helen. I will take that one. Right now we -- so we showed client retention, we didn't show ASV this quarter. We are actually looking at ways of how we can provide better information among those fronts. So you will see that come back in the next quarter. Keith Housum : Okay. Is it fair to assume that that number was below what it has been in previous quarters? Helen Shan : No, it's actually in line, but we wanted to think about how we are defining that to provide you actually greater clarity. So that -- but I would not view that is having come down in any material way. Keith Housum : Okay. And then just as a follow-up in terms of the investment program, is this primarily going to be in personnel or is going to be mixture of personnel and perhaps technology tools? And if it is in personnel, it's going to be more employees or it's going to be more like a contractor base that will probably roll-off when a program is done? Helen Shan : Right. This is Helen and thanks for that question. So I think across both, it is primarily people and it is primarily our own people. So we will see -- there's -- in order to accelerate, we are using third-party for especially on the technology front, so that will come off and that's what you're going to see a bit when we see the productivity improvements in year three. So when we talked about some of that margin expansion that will be a piece of how we're going to realize that. Keith Housum : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Hey, if you look out to kind of your projected growth rates, how much of that is coming from higher retention or new product because it seems like the research had been kind of flat and now you're looking for low single-digit. It seems like a pretty high hurdle given where the business have been trending so just any thoughts around that. Phil Snow : The sales team is definitely focused on retention that will help, but we believe this will come from the investment that we're making. So we accelerated our research growth rate this year with some pretty small investments and we think the concentrated investments we're making again particularly in deep sector and private markets gives us an opportunity to move the needle with the biggest piece of our business, which is very exciting in terms of our overall long-term growth rate. If we can move research up a couple of 100 basis points that really helps us achieve our goals. Kevin McVeigh : And then any -- it seems like kind of the CTS, if I have that right, that's up a little bit. It just seems like the mix is shifting around a little bit in terms of where the contributions coming from. Is that the investment or is that the data, what's driving that? Phil Snow : Yes. CTS had a very good year. I mean, it continues to be our fastest growing segment. There was one large cancel, which I pointed out in Q3, on our last call, which affected that group in particular, and without that which really was an outlier, CTS would have grown in line with what they grew at in FY '18. So we feel very good about this business. The data exploration product that's in open FactSet is allowing clients to evaluate our content at a significantly higher rate than they used to and as we build out our platform, we believe that CTS continue to accelerate from the current rate that it's at. Helen Shan : If you think about how the content investments are really going to help all four businesses, as you alluded to going forward, if you're having more content that's clearly going to help CTS, it will help research, as we talk about retention, we saw some of that this year, which is how it gave us some greater confidence and why we think the execution will go well as we execute across both the deep sector as well as private. Kevin McVeigh : Thank you. Helen Shan : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question is from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. George Tong : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. You had previously noted a slowdown in monetizing new products due to a client alignment issues around functionality and pricing. Can you discuss what assumptions around new product monetization you're including in your full-year guidance, and if you're factoring in benefits from your investment program? Phil Snow : Yes. Hi, George. This is Phil. So why don't I start with analytics. So as I mentioned previously on the call, we're really beginning to see some of the benefits of the new programs within analytics. We had a couple of nice wins with our portfolio management platform and we crossed a significant milestone in terms of our APIs for analytics. So those are just two very good examples. Another one is wealth, which is again the integration of the official performance system with PA, that's beginning to get a lot of traction. And I would point out research, again, we did that small acquisition of some bank regulatory data that we integrated into FactSet, which is what we do exceptionally well. We've got a very positive response from the marketplace. So those are smaller numbers, but as they begin to get traction, we think there is a significant opportunity for them moving forward. George Tong : Got it. In recent quarters, your competitive Refinitiv has seen an acceleration in organic revenue growth from flat to the 3% range. Can you discuss the broader competitive landscape and what trends you're seeing around pricing? Phil Snow : Sure. So we continue to take market share from our Refinitiv. That 3% is not coming from FactSet. We see a big opportunity against them moving forward. And I think we are doing a great job with our competitors. Everyone is facing a tough environment, particularly in the front office and all the solutions we\u2019ve are well positioned for our clients to allow us to take market share. That's an area where we are in, but we're not nearly as well penetrated as some of our competitors. So as they look to cut costs and we continue to improve our functionality we think there's a great opportunity. George Tong : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is open. Trevor Romeo : Hi. Good morning. It's actually Trevor Romeo in for Andrew. Thank you for taking my questions here. And thank you as well for providing the details on the 2022 outlook. Just wondering what do you see as the main risks to that outlook? And when you look at the business line break down, which business line would you say has the most upside potential relative to that outlook? Phil Snow : Good question. We are -- our assumptions are that we continue to operate in a tough environment. If there's a massive market correction or a serious recession, obviously that's going to impact not just FactSet, but all of us. And I am bullish about all of our businesses, so that different sizes that growing at different growth rates. I would say generally the opportunity for FactSet is to be an open platform. So currently CTS sort of paved the way for us in terms of creating an open platform. But as we build out our API program and each of our businesses then able to deliver the value to our clients in new and interesting ways that gives each of them a great opportunity to capture more market share. Trevor Romeo : Okay, thank you. That's helpful. And then from a follow-up, just wondering if you could talk about kind of the importance of analytics to the overall company. If you do see analytics growing -- continuing to grow high single digits, I guess, it could be as big as the research business in a couple of years. So just wondering if you could talk about it in those terms and whether you see analytics potentially being the biggest business line someday. Thank you. Phil Snow : Yes. Analytics could be the biggest business line someday. It's already $0.5 billion and it's continued to be an important piece of our offering. Analytics for us is really the products that we built around client portfolios that are on FactSet. So thousands of clients trust FactSet to store their portfolios and we've built great functionality around those for our clients. So very often the analytics products can drive other products with them and we -- like I said earlier, it's a very well differentiated part of our product versus our competitors. Trevor Romeo : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is from Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Glenn Greene : Thanks. Good morning. Hey, Phil, so just sort of, you were asked this question or similar question for this, but sort of big picture sort of stepping back when you came in as CEO, you sort of felt like you need to make a strategic shift and be more of a broader, sort of portfolio suite of solutions and just sort of workstation. And I guess I'm just trying to understand where we are now and in the context you had significant margin expansion this year. But you're sort of stepping up investments, and I just want to get a big picture what you're sort of thinking what you saw six months ago that sort of precipitated the sort of accelerated investments. Was there anything external in the market, anything that you're hearing from your clients, what you're seeing competitively? Just more in terms of the internal thinking about why now and why not do it six months ago or is it just you couldn\u2019t do it that quickly? Phil Snow : Yes, I think we were -- we have plans for a bigger shift than we used to be. We wanted to make sure that we were thoughtful about this as we laid out a 3-year plan. And we are not satisfied growing in mid single digits. FactSet has always had a high top line growth rate and we believe that's the best way to create value for our clients, our employees and our investors. So six months is not a big period of time in the big scheme of things, and we are committed to this 3-year plan. We are excited about it. Our employees are excited about it and I look forward to seeing the results. Glenn Greene : Okay. Then just how -- just a quick one. The shift to the public cloud, is there any way to quantify the potential savings when you sort of complete this project and any data security concerns as you do this? Helen Shan : Yes. Thank you for your question. This is -- we started this movement starting back at the end of 2018. So it is a multi-year project. We are not necessarily here to give you the dollars around that, but we do expect pretty significant savings again more in the 2021 -- 2022 when we are able to really move and aim for a majority of our technology out -- technology to be in the public cloud. Security is definitely always key. It's top of mind for us. And part of the spend that we're doing in the next three years is to ensure that our security is in line exactly with all of the digital investments we are making. Glenn Greene : Okay. Thank you. Helen Shan : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question is from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is open. Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Hey, good morning. So regarding your 2022 goals, do you think it's possible to get back the 33% plus operating margins without returning to high single-digit revenue growth, or do you have to get that revenue growth in order to get the margins to where you want them to be? Helen Shan : I think they're both. I mean, they are inextricably tied. Thank you for your question by the way. They are inextricably tied. So, yes, I think we have savings already built in as well, again, as we get the 2021. It will come from the ability for us to scale both on content again, as well as on the cloud shift and right now we've put a target out there. We obviously aim to do better, but I think we feel very comfortable that we can reach that it is not purely a top-line play. Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Okay, great. Thank you. And then a quick follow-up in your earnings release today, if I'm reading that correctly, I think you're guiding towards $25.5 million in non-recurring items that you anticipate excluding from non-GAAP results in fiscal 2020. If I\u2019m reading that correctly, can you provide a little bit of detail on what those primary components would be within those $25.5 million? Helen Shan : So I will definitely have you -- you can follow-up with Rima on details, but broadly speaking they are in line with how you've seen that delta in the past. So it's intangible amortization and some deferred revenue. Those have been two of the biggest thesis between that and then after that there are also other we anticipate some of the cost related transformation on that front as well. Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Okay. Thank you. Helen Shan : You're welcome. Operator : Our last question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research. Your line is open. Craig Huber : Great. Thank you. I have a few questions. First, in the organic revenue number for the quarter you just finished and also organic numbers estimate going forward for the next few years, how much of that is price, please? Helen Shan : What's assumed in there is fairly similar to how we've recognized in the past about 1% to 2% of that or 1.5% that usually is price based. Craig Huber : Okay. So no change. Okay, thank you. And then can you just talk a little bit further about cancellations of your products in the marketplace this quarter that we just finished, in the early part of this quarter. Is that trend materially different for your various products in the U.S and open Europe than it was in the last quarter? Phil Snow : Hey, it's Phil. So it was a little bit weaker. We certainly saw a few more cancels in terms of the number of clients that canceled as well as cancellations within the core client base, but it wasn't a material difference versus Q4 of last year. Craig Huber : And then my other question, when you think about your major competitors in the marketplace, are you see anything significant out there that they're doing right now that led you to step by your own internal investment spending? Phil Snow : No, I think everyone is dealing with the same market environment; the mega-trends that are out there, we're all dealing with. None of us really compete completely with each other. We compete with parts of each of others businesses. So I think everyone is probably investing to be more multi-asset class, make sure that they deliver a superior technology solution to their clients. We believe that having an open platform and our approach is going to be the winning formula in the market. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Q&A period. I will now turn it back over to Phil Snow for any closing remarks. Phil Snow : Yes, thank you. So I would really like to thank our clients and I would really like to thank all of the employees of FactSet. We\u2019ve got a great management team and I want to give us a shout out to Helen. She's only been with us a year. It's hard to believe, but she's done a great job of really creating operational efficiency and really creating a strong balance sheet. I want to thank everyone for joining us on today's call. We are encouraged by the progress we've made this year and are confident in our plans for investment in long-term growth. As we look forward to 2020 and beyond, we are confident that the investments we are making today will strengthen our position in the industry and in doing so, create greater long-term value for all our stakeholders. If you have additional questions, please call Rima Hyder. We look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Operator, that ends today's call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

Before we discuss our results, I encourage all listeners to review the legal notice on Slide 2, which explains the risks of forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, please refer to our forms 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the appendix to the presentation and in our earnings release issued earlier today. Joining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer and Helen Shan, Chief Financial Officer. And now I'd like to turn the discussion over to Phil Snow. Phil Snow : Thanks, Rima, and good morning everyone. We begin our fiscal '20 with growth across most of our businesses. And I want to remind everyone that our first quarter is typically the smallest of the year, and it's important to look at half and full year performance is more appropriate measures of progress. I'm pleased that we have a healthy pipeline for the first half of our fiscal year, especially against the backdrop of sustained industry pressures. On our last earnings call, we outlined a three year plan to accelerate the breadth and depth of our investments in targeted areas within content and technology with the goal of driving higher top line growth over the long-term. Our team has hit the ground running, delivering encouraging early progress in Q1. Within content, our deep sector and private markets sectors are proceeding at pace, and we've hired more sector experts following the launch of our successful banking regulatory data. We're making good progress integrating third-party private markets data into access and are expanding our valued street account coverage into new markets. We believe this expansion of coverage will resonate across all of our business lines, particularly research and Wealth. Our continued efforts to grow our tech stack are also yielding early results. We've tripled the number of APIs available since the start of the fiscal year, and are on track to release more in the second quarter. Our migration to the public cloud is well underway and we've identified opportunities to reduce our fixed data center costs in the long run. From a product perspective, we are building momentum in Analytics with multi-asset class risk, fixed income and Vault, our new performance measurement product, each showing particular strengths. We're also very pleased with our Wealth pipeline and the positive response from clients. Finally, we see growing demand for our open solutions. We announced this quarter that FactSet is now available on OpenFin, and we're proud to be the first market data providers to do so. As early adopters of the shift to more open and flexible product to access, we believe the wind is on our backs and we will continue to deliver information to clients where, when and how they want us. In sales, we've evolved our compensation plan and sharpened our focus on client retention and expansion. These changes include growing our strategic client groups, which looked at for our top accounts to cover more clients and build upon the strong C-level relationships we have in the industry. We're also expanding our new business and sales engineering teams to capitalize on increasing technology opportunities. While these collective measures will take time to impact our top line as the industry evolves, we're continuing to take proactive steps from our position of strength to ensure continued growth. Looking at ASV in total, ASV + professional services grew at 4%. This growth rate reflects a decrease in ASV in the quarter, driven by higher than expected cancellations in the research and a decrease in our add-on business where we sell through cross-sell to existing clients. In addition, new business sales increased year-over-year as we added more clients this quarter. Overall, we see continued cost pressures among institutional asset managers and churn within our banking clients. However, it's important to remember that the large banks are longer standing clients of FactSet. And when they hire later in our fiscal year next summer, we accordingly expect the benefit. This quarter, once again, we saw growth in users from corporate and private equity firms in the area where we're investing. In the Americas, we saw healthy growth in Wealth, asset owners and hedge funds. This was offset by seasonal banking churn in our research business. Americas had a tougher comparison versus the first quarter of 2019, when we had larger deals that contributed to higher ASV. We remain optimistic about the Americas as we deepen existing client relationships and capitalize on new business opportunities. In EMEA, we have positive momentum with the buy-side with Wealth and institutional asset managers. This region is facing some of the same cost pressures we have previously seen in the Americas, and uncertainty with regulations and the political environment. Our pipeline was healthy for the year with institutional asset managers, asset owners and wealth managers, as we see the demand for our analytic solutions. CTS was the main driver of the 10% growth in Asia Pacific as we sold data feeds across the region, primarily to local data provides. The opportunity in Asia-Pac is with the buy side, driven by risk solutions for asset owners and our Analytics offerings for the institutional asset managers, especially for the investment portfolio lifecycle. We continue to be bullish about our opportunity in this region and we are investing appropriately to capitalize on its potential. In the first quarter, we also saw promising growth in Wealth, CTS and Analytics. Wealth is the largest contributor as we continue to unlock its share in the pace. Analytics was another bright spot, driven by the strong performance of fixed income and risk products, while CTS continued to see solid demand for core and premium data feeds. Our adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS came in strong this quarter. And we believe that this year will be more in line with our annual guidance as we continue to execute throughout the quarter in accordance with our investment plan. In closing, I want reiterate that our fiscal year is a tale of two halves. Our pipeline is healthy and we believe that we are on sound footing to deliver on the first half of our fiscal '20, and are well positioned for the year. We have a proven track record of returning consistent long-term value to shareholders, a record that we firmly believe we will continue. It is also increasingly clear that clients are demanding more open, flexible and efficient technology to help to manage change, an area where we continue to excel. And as we execute our three-year plan, early signs indicate that we are taking a winning path to ensure continued growth through expanded opportunities with existing clients, higher retention and new business. Let me now turn the call over to Helen who will discuss the specifics of our first quarter performance. Helen Shan : Thank you, Phil, and good morning. It is great to be here with all of you. We began our fiscal 2020 with a solid operating performance, 10% earnings growth and operating margin that continues to reflect the productivity and efficiency improvements made throughout 2019. While we are at the beginning of our three-year investment plan, we are on pace as we start to ramp up hiring and spend. I'll now walk us through the specifics of the quarter's results. GAAP and organic revenue increased by 4% to $367 million and $368 million respectively. Growth was driven primarily Wealth, CTS and Analytics. For our geographic segments over the last 12 months, Americas' revenue grew 4% and international revenue grew 5% organically. Americas benefited from increases in Wealth, Analytics and CTS. International revenue was largely driven by Analytics and CTS. GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter totaled $253 million, a 1% growth over the previous year. With revenues growing faster than expenses, our GAAP margin increased 230 basis points to 31%. Adjusted operating margin increased to 34%, a 240 basis point improvement versus last year. As a percentage of revenue, the expense improvement came largely from our cost of services, which was 240 basis points lower than last year on a GAAP basis. On an adjusted basis, the improvement was 210 basis points. Contributing factors include decreases in employee compensation, reflecting the continued mix shifts from high to low cost locations, as well as lower contractor fee. This benefit was partially offset by an increase in computer related expenses as we continue to upgrade our technology stack. SG&A expenses, expressed as a percentage of revenue, grew 10 basis points over the prior year period on a GAAP basis. On an adjusted basis, we saw improvement of 30 basis points. This result is driven primarily by expense reductions in travel and entertainment, professional fees and lower bad debt expense, and partially offset by higher employee compensation and higher rent expense associated with our move to new headquarters. We've been improving our operating margin over the past four quarters, reflecting our efforts to maintain disciplined expense management and to both grow and sustain productivity gain through our planned workforce mix. We are pleased with the progress that we have made as it has given us the ability to redeploy capital back into the business in the key areas of content and technology. On the last earnings call, we provided financial targets for FY '22. To recap, our investments build incrementally at $15 million per year in each of the next three years, totaling an additional $45 million in the FY '22 expense rate. As we noted, we expect our ASP growth rates to be in the high single digits adjusted EPS growth at 10% plus, and an adjusted operating margin at 32% plus in FY '22. We've begun to execute on these projects as Phil noted earlier, the spend we'll be building over the course of the year. For fiscal year 2020, the majority of the cost will be people related. We expect the level of expense to ramp up were heavily weighted in the second half of the year as we build out the resources and capabilities. We believe we will be in line with our FY '20 guidance of 31.5% to 32.5% in operating margin given the phasing of incremental investments. We remain confident in our investment strategy and plan. Moving on, our tax rate for the quarter was 13.6%. This rate included a few onetime items related to finalization of prior year tax returns and a change in tax rate in one of our foreign jurisdictions. Excluding onetime adjustments, our quarterly tax rate would have been 17.3%. Please keep in mind that when we provided annual guidance for fiscal 2020, we did not include any onetime adjustments in tax rate. GAAP EPS increased 12% to $2.43 this quarter versus $2.17 in the first quarter of 2019, primarily attributable to higher revenue and improved margin. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 10% to $2.58. The reconciliation of our adjustments to GAAP EPS is disclosed at the end of our press release. Free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations plus capital spending, was $59 million for the quarter, an increase of 88% over the same period last year. The improvement was primarily due to higher net income, an increase in cash collections and the timing of payables, partially offset by higher capital expenditures. As noted on past calls, our CapEx is higher this year due to planned investments in technology, as well as new office space build out for some of our locations where existing leases have neared exploration. Last quarter, we looked to update our annual ASV retention metrics. On further review, we have determined that the current methodology is aligned with our client retention metric and remains an accurate measure of ASV retention. For the first quarter, our annual ASV retention continues to be over 95%. We're also pleased to reports that our client retention, the number of clients we've attained over the last 12 months, remained at 89% and our client count grew 6% year-over-year. Looking at our share repurchase program for the first quarter, we repurchased 343,000 shares for $84 million at an average share price of $246 per share. Over the last 12 months, we have returned approximately $345 million to our investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We remain committed to creating long-term value for our shareholders, and plan to repurchase shares at a steady pace in line with last year. The improvement in our operating results over the course of fiscal year 2019 and the first quarter of this year reflect our progress in operational discipline and in the sustainability of the productivity gains. We believe our plan to invest in more comprehensive and integrated content and in digital technology will fuel future top-line growth, which in turn is key for long-term value for our clients, employees and our shareholders. With that, we're now ready for your questions. Marcella, over to you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Peter Heckmann from D.A. Davison & Co. Peter Heckmann : So I was just trying to make sure if I m understanding correctly, I mean significant upside, maybe spending didn't ramped as quickly as expected. But because this -- your guidance does imply that we should see negative adjusted earnings per growth in the back half of '20. And how you then think about, I mean, we had 2022. But how do you think about that transitioning that into the first couple of quarters in '21? Helen Shan : It's Helen. So, no, I don't -- but we were essentially going to be doing, because we believe we will still end up with the same amount of spend for the year is that as it ramps up, we'll still be within that range. And then at that run rate we'll continue to see that through the first two quarters of '21. Let me just give a little bit more color. Most of the expense for this year are much more people related, so it takes time to ramp up. I would say if you look over the phasing of the year, it's roughly, just call it 30%, will be in the first half and the balance in the second half. And so that's -- and then the technology spend is more in the latter half of the three-year investment plan. So it'll be a little bit slow out of the gate and it takes time to hire, but we don't expect that to be an issue as we think about the guidance we've given for the year. Peter Heckmann : And then just while I have you, you haven't talked too much about Portware and the Company's efforts in trading. Can you just give us a quick update there? Phil Snow : Yes. Hey, Peter, it's Phil Snow. So, yes, we're seeing very positive momentum in the trading space over the last few quarters, and a lot of that is attributed to, I think, the integration now the EMS capabilities within co-FactSet. And we're also seeing good momentum with our OMS offering as well. So just to remind everyone, we have execution capabilities, we have order management capabilities and we've integrated those now into a portfolio management platform, which is also beginning to gain some traction. So these are big numbers right now but the trend is positive, and that we're very excited about that part of our Analytics suite. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Manav Patnaik : My first question is just you know these cancellations that you called out this quarter. Were they contemplated in your full year guidance? And I was just hoping if you could just help, maybe give us a little bit more color on how much of the guidance is assuming that you win a bunch of contracts over the course of the year? Phil Snow : Hey Manav, it's Phil. So I think that cancellations that we called out in Q1 was a little bit more of an expected cancellations within the sell-side across banking as well as research. And very often that's difficult to predict given the numbers are pretty large, and you're never sure sort of coming out of a hiring and into Q1 of what that's going to look like. And I think when we look at Q1 it's typically a smaller quarter for us, as I said in my script. We do go back 2 million or 3 million this quarter, but if you go back even a couple of years into fiscal 2018 that was a fairly small quarter for us as well. So when we look out for the rest of the half, it's significantly weighted, that's a Q2. And when we look at the pipeline versus the pipeline last year, we feel very good about our opportunities as we head into the second quarter. Manav Patnaik : And then maybe just your comments on growth in Wealth, what were the drivers there? Was it just the ramp of the BAML contract? Or was it a lot of single wins here and there? Just curious if you could give a little bit more color there. Phil Snow : Yes. So, no, I mean, we're doing very well at BAML. I think that was obviously a great deal for us and was a significant contributor to Q1 of last year. So I think you could have expected some deceleration in this quarter just given that was a tougher comp. But we've had some very nice wins in Wealth at larger firms within the Americas, and we also are doing very well in the middle markets part of Wealth and the pipeline is very healthy. So there are some larger deals out there for us, which are little bit more binary. But just going back to the previous question, we're not relying on any, like massive deals to come within the guidance range that we gave at the end of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Hamza Mazari from Jefferies. Your line is open. Mario Cortellacci : This is actually Mario Cortellacci for Hamza. Just kind of wanted to piggyback off the Wealth question, and you mentioned that there's some binary wins. And it sounds you're doing well in the middle markets channel. But just wondering if, say there is larger deal and more consolidation among the wirehouses, just didn't know how you guys are positioned and obviously when things as is are like you said binary. But how are you positioned and how do you think you'll fare if there is some consolidation among the much bigger players? Phil Snow : I think we felt well. This is a greenfield area for us. It's an area that we're not defending essentially, right, it's all offense. I think the product that we have is exceptional. We put a lot of effort into it. A big piece of our investment strategy for the next three years is to just continue to bolster the Wealth offering in terms of content, as well as -- and technology. There are some things that we're going to do there, I think, to make the life of the next generation of a financial advisor and wealth advisors so much easier. And some of that's integrating our risk capabilities, some of that's taking cognitive computing to essentially make the life of the wealth advisor and the financial adviser much more efficient. So this is a space we're super excited about. Typically, when there is consolidation, it means disruption and is an opportunity for a new newcomer like FactSet to come in and take a crack. So we're in lots of RFPs. These are big firms. They have long contracts. You don't win them overnight. But we feel exceptional about this piece of our business and the opportunity in front of us. Mario Cortellacci : And just one more and I'll turn it over. So like you said, there is a lot of white space in Wealth, and maybe this other part of the business isn't as big of a focus for you. But how much do you think your products lended themselves to say, commercial banking or insurance? Or maybe you can give us a sense of how much you've explored those markets as well? Phil Snow : So commercial banking is really interesting. We had a pretty good win there, and I think it was last year in Asia-Pac and that was a lot of seats but admittedly at a lower cost. But our web offering proved very good for that market, and I think we will continue to explore some opportunities there. We have pretty good business in insurance right now. So what resonate with our insurance clients is our Analytics products. We've got a great multi-asset class risk product, which we continue to invest in. And risk is one of the things I talked about in my script is, we've got a lot of good momentum in the risk space, the pipeline for risk looks really good and some of that is at insurance companies. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. Andrew Nicholas : In terms of the Wealth pipeline, it sounds like you're waiting on a few larger decisions. Any color on when you expect those decisions to be made? Phil Snow : Some of them are this fiscal year. Some of them are further out. Andrew Nicholas : And then I was wondering if you could provide an update on momentum in Analytics, particularly as it relates to kind of the sales force realignment. As that gets further and further in the rear view mirror, just wondering if you could update us on progress with respect to sales momentum. Phil Snow : Yes, so fixed income had very good quarter and we have a very good strong pipeline for fixed income. And that was one of the areas that we did worse than last year than we hoped. And the movement of the specialists back into the Analytics area has really paid off. So we've got some great leadership there, the team is excited. The areas that really are showing very strong momentum are fixed income, risk, Vault. And Vault to remind everyone, is kind of the combination of the BISAM performance product with traditional PA. That is gaining a lot of momentum. We're having a lot of unit sales with Vault. The APIs within Analytics are doing very well. We see a ton of momentum there. And I mentioned, we tripled the number of APIs that we had in Q1. And so a lot of that is our Analytics APIs. So all-in-all, we feel good about Analytics. I also mentioned our momentum there in the trading space. And a lot of these are really the workflow solutions and the portfolio lifecycle. So we've made a bunch of acquisitions three years ago. It has taken us longer than I expected to get those integrated. But I think what we're seeing now and out into the rest of the fiscal year is great momentum in those areas, the workflow solutions and helping the larger clients be more efficient from a technology standpoint. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line open. Toni Kaplan : I wanted to ask another question on the research cancels. Was it related to firms getting out of equities, or banking, or consolidation, or firms closing, or competitive losses? Or just any sort of extra color you could give on what led to the cancels? Phil Snow : Toni, it's Phil. Yes, I think these are -- a lot of the cancels are typical in terms of the seasonal banking shown. There were a couple of firms where we had some things happen that we didn't anticipate. One was at a larger sell side firm and the other was at a middle markets firm. The sell-side firm, it happened that we have a very strong relationship with them, very excited about the opportunities moving forward. I can't get into the specific details. But clearly there's pressure, particularly on the bigger firms. We're feeling some of that. I think that's what you're seeing in the numbers for Q1. But we're doing lots of things right to work our way up the stack as these bigger firms provide more solutions and it's going to be a little bit choppy at some of them, but we feel good about the longer term opportunity for us. Toni Kaplan : And then for my follow-up, I just want to find out how much FX benefited margins this quarter and if there was anything one-time, if it wasn't FX that helped the margins, just because they were a lot stronger than expected? Thanks. Helen Shan : Yes, sure. Toni, thanks for your question. So this quarter, the benefit of FX was about $1 million, which is actually less than in the previous year and obviously a lot less during the course of FY '19. So that was not a material impact. If you compare our margin this quarter to Q4, we're exactly the same, 33.9%. So I think it's reflecting more of the consistency of the actions that we've put forth over the course of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS. Your line is open. Alex Kramm : Phil, you talked about your excitement of, I think 2Q launch of some of the more in-depth data around financial services or banks. Can you just talk about the appetite there a little bit? I think this is supposed to be a little bit of a SNL competitor. But one of the things that I'm also hearing is that that competitor has a lot more different industries that they cover, so some firms might still wait until you have the full breadth. So I guess how much of this is going to be a niche solution for now and maybe in a few years, it's going to be a real competitor? Can you just touch it out a little bit? Thanks. Phil Snow : So we're attacking around eight sectors, I believe, over the next three years. To your point, we can't get them all done this year. So we have a very methodical plan to work our way through wage sectors and we're doing it in the order that we think will have the biggest impact for us. We've already hired all from the outside, industry experts for each of these sectors. So they are on board already this quarter. So I think we did an exceptional job there hiring, and it's going to depend on the firm essentially. So some firms may just want one or two sectors, some may want all eight, some may be very happy with 80% of the fund -- 20% of the functionality, but 80% of the value. But we are seeing a very healthy appetite for more choice in this area and we feel that we're going to have some impact this fiscal year. In fact, we already had I think one very good win. I can't remember if it's in Q1 or in the pipeline for Q2 with another firm for the financial data that we have. Alex Kramm : And then just secondly, again on the opportunity side, I mean, you mentioned the tough environment, which obviously all of us on this call probably know about. I've been hearing a little bit more of an effort to reduce costs when it comes to the really expensive competitors of yours. So I think you've been benefiting from that to some degree. And I think you've done this all along over the last few years, but are you seeing an acceleration in focus on cutting some of your more expensive competitors and is that going to be something that's going to help in the next couple of quarters or is it business as usual from that perspective? Phil Snow : I think we are seeing more of an appetite for that, I was on a recent trip to Europe, I had a couple of good meetings at larger firms, where I think historically, people have been given choice and it's been a little bit more of a grassroots effort to do this. But what I'm feeling at a lot of these firms that are having more cost pressures is that there's going to be more of a top-down push to save costs and to do some of what you just described. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. Joseph Foresi : It seems like you're going through, sort of, maybe a portfolio shift because some of the buy side stuff and sell side stuff isn't working as well. I'm sure we can all understand that. When do you think you'll hit an inflection point where organic growth starts to accelerate, because the portfolio has been right sized? Phil Snow : Well, I'm hoping Joe that this is the inflection point and that when we talked to you in Q2, we can point to that. Obviously it's hard to predict the future, but when I look at what I just described in terms of Analytics, when I think about our CTS product suite, which we haven't talked a lot about today, but we're having exceptional momentum there selling our content, the Wealth pipeline our efforts to fill out the portfolio lifecycle, all of that is really great. I think we are seeing obviously people pressure in our industry and a lot of pressure on the research side. So that's the piece that's a little bit harder to kind of predict, but we feel like we've got the right strategy and we've got a team that's sort of really excited to execute even in what is a tough environment. Joseph Foresi : Yes. I guess my follow-up will be an old question. Maybe we could start to get a breakdown from a percentage of revenue, or you could just give us rough ballpark numbers around the new pieces of the business and what they're growing versus sort of the old pieces of the business, so that we can kind of start to model out the inflection point ourselves. I'm just wondering if there's any thoughts around that or if there is any general numbers because you said you hope that there is the inflection point that we're at right now. Thanks. Helen Shan : This is Helen. Thank you for your question. I mean a lot of what we provide even when we talk to the client, are bundled as well. So, what we don't actually have plans right now to be breaking that out, but certainly we'll give you updates as we go on each call as we can. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Your line is open. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Phil, just a quick question. Not to beat that research cancellations to death, but is it people that are just no longer there or they are moving to a different platform? I just want to understand that dynamic a little bit more? Phil Snow : I don't have all of that detail, Shlomo. I imagine some of it is just people pressure right, within the research side that does sort of less hiring going on. Some of it may be competitive pressure. I think there are situations there where we're taking market share and others are taking it from us. Again, I'll point to the fact that it's typically a smaller quarter. So we're calling it out this quarter just because it's one of the larger numbers, but in the big picture, when you think about our numbers for Q2 and Q4 especially, I wouldn't read too much into that for this quarter. Shlomo Rosenbaum : But it's not -- I guess, what people are trying to figure out, is there any pickup in Refinitiv, is there anything going on in on the Cap IQ side that's becoming kind of nipping at your heels? Is there any change in any of that stuff? I guess, that's what I'm trying to get to, or is it just really... Phil Snow : We still -- when I look at the competitive win-loss, we're still I think doing well from a market share, taking market share standpoint. Shlomo Rosenbaum : And then just Open FactSet, are there any additional metrics you can give us besides, maybe some of the APIs, how that's tracking? Are you starting to generate any meaningful revenue over there? It seems like an interesting part of the business I want to delve into more. Phil Snow : Yes. So we're beginning to get some momentum there. There are different pieces to it. So the piece that's generating, I think, the growth in CTS is really the data exploration platform that we've created. So it's really the ability to come in and look at our content in addition to some of the Open providers that we've added, some of the alternative data. But a lot of the growth you're seeing is really from FactSet-owned content and we're beginning to see a pretty healthy pipeline for some of the alternative data providers that are combined with that. I think as much the model and the ability to come in and begin programming in Python using Tableau kind of what the analyst of the future and the data scientists in the future is going to want to use, that's really the most exciting piece of it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Bill Warmington : So you had mentioned the strength in Analytics, CTS and Wealth, and by application, I would take it that Research had turned negative this quarter. I just wanted to confirm that and ask if that was really the result of the churn that you've mentioned and to ask how long you think it will take to return to low-single digit type target growth? Phil Snow : Yes. So you're right, Bill. The other three businesses were positive this quarter, and Research is negative. Again, it's a smaller quarter. So again, it's hard to predict. We feel good about the Research business as we look out to the rest of the year and on our last quarter, we gave sort of longer-term guidance for what we think that business can do. The investments we're making in deep sector in private markets and StreetAccount, all will we believe, bolster that business and allow it to grow over time. Bill Warmington : And then a follow-up question for you on the data feeds business, that seems like a business that could potentially become commoditized. And so I wanted to ask about what you guys are doing to differentiate your offerings there? Phil Snow : Yes. So some of the data is unique, other people have it. I think the value that FactSet has always brought to the marketplace over the last 40 years is the integration of content. So you can deliver data sets all day out of a marketplace or a library, but the hard work is integrating the data so that you can use that as one data base and providing the tools to analyze the data. So that's what we do. We do very well. Of course, it's great to have our own content as well to monetize, but the real value for our content is how well it plays together and how well we can integrate it with other data sets and within other people systems. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Chu from Bank of America. Your line is open. David Chu : So related to a previous question, can you just provide some color on what you're seeing in terms of client budgets overall? I mean, is cost cutting more in focus versus let's say a year ago? Phil Snow : Yes, I believe it is. I think the active managers in particular, continue to be under cost pressure and it's up to FactSet to provide them tools that allow them to be more efficient. And that's really -- that's where it is with active managers. If I -- so if we think about other client types that are out there, we're making a lot of exciting progress in asset owners, which include planned sponsors and sovereign wealth funds, that's an area of growth for us. We're doing very well with hedge funds. I mentioned that we were positive this quarter. We're selling hedge funds a lot of CTS product. We are seeing good momentum in private equity. So that's an area that we're investing, but it's a smaller area of our business, but that's one that's going pretty rapidly. We're doing well in the corporate space. That continues to build momentum for us. So we're obviously active managers or a big piece of FactSet's business. We're providing good long-term solutions for them, but there are other markets that we're going into, that have a lot of great momentum. David Chu : And Helen, is the 1Q CapEx number a proper run rate for the year? Helen Shan : Thank you for that question. Yes, it's about that. We are expecting to be up year-on-year. So I think we ended last year around $60 million and we are looking more like an $80 million for this year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Housum from Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Keith Housum : Phil, as we look at the research environment, customers are getting rid of some of their employees, how protected is FactSet if one of your customers just goes from say 100 employees, down to 50 employees. Do you guys have minimums baked into your contracts that you're protected or not? Phil Snow : We do in some cases. So as clients have gotten larger and our footprint has gotten bigger with them, they look for I think more certainty within their budgets over time, and we do have floors in at some point. The other thing that we've made towards, and that continues is a bigger and bigger percentage of our ASV is tied to more workflow solutions and less people. So the majority of what I just described in the Analytics business has a lot less to do with seat count and a lot more to do with workflow and enterprise solutions. And the feeds is the same thing. So obviously, it's an evolution. It won't happen overnight, but I think it's the right strategy for us and one that we're already capitalizing on. Keith Housum : So do I understand then if as research can say consolidates further next year you as well as some protection with some of your contracts based on some of the floors, some may not? Phil Snow : Yes, I think that's right. Keith Housum : And then if I -- just turning to the international side. International revenue is down compared to last two quarters. Was there anything unique I guess at the end of last year that affected that revenue or anything unique in this quarter that your revenue declined actually sequentially? Philip Snow : Yes, I don't think there's anything unique. Europe clearly is under, I think, probably more pressure than the Americas and Asia-Pac. We see a ton of opportunity in Asia-Pac. It's hard to imagine that not continuing if we make the right moves there. But Europe is under a lot of pressure for a lot of different reasons. Helen Shan : Yes, as Philip mentioned before, I mean I think the pipeline is healthy. We have seen some good new business growth. So as we think for the rest of the year, we're feeling more positive about the growth rate. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Kevin McVeigh : Phil, obviously with Refinitiv change in hands twice within the last 18 months or so as you become part of the LSE any thoughts from a competitive perspective? Does that change the behavior on the continent at all or even in the current form as part of Blackstone, have you seen any competitive dynamic shift? Phil Snow : I've obviously thought a lot about that. It doesn't feel to me that the combination of LSE and Refinitiv is going to be much different frankly to us than what we've been dealing with from a competitive standpoint with Refinitiv over the last couple of decades. So there is still uncertainty I would think within both the client base and their employee base in terms of what's happening, and we're just capitalizing on that uncertainty right now. Kevin McVeigh : And with that I'll kind of lay the opportunity to the extent for any -- as you're kind of integrating would you see competitive advantage on that? If you were to look at other points in history, does that free up incremental opportunity or no? Phil Snow : I'm not sure I understand the question. Kevin McVeigh : I guess was there consolidating I'm sure they see disruption in their sales force, do you take advantage of that. Is there an opportunity to capture incremental share? Phil Snow : Yes, I think so. Yes, I think that's what I was trying to describe, yes, there is uncertainty in the client base and in then their employee base, there is opportunity for us to go into clients and have conversations and take market share. Kevin McVeigh : And then just quick follow-up, the investments you're making in kind of the research product, when do you think the earliest you'll see start to see the revenue benefit from that? Helen Shan : So overall, when we think about both the content and technology we see minimal in this year, but as it ramps up, in general, we would expect to see about 25% of the total growth coming in year two, excuse me, 2021 with the balance coming into 2022. So it's more of a back-ended in terms of the list. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners. Your line is open. Craig Huber : I think I missed the first few minutes of your comments, but I wanted to hear was there any major cancellation fees that showed up in your revenues in the quarter you guys just reported here? Phil Snow : Cancellation fees? Craig Huber : Well, for many clients of yours the remaining revenue that was pulled forward to account for revenues up to $2.5 million sequentially, your ASV of course was down slightly versus three months ago, I guess only the third time in the last 20 years or so. I'm just wondering if there is any clients that canceled any revenues that were recognized pulled forward, maybe to some degree in the November quarter, the first question? Helen Shan : Sure, this is Helen. No, we don't see that there is no pull forward due to cancellation from clients. So that's not how our model works, so that's not a driver at all. Craig Huber : My other question again with the ASV down slightly versus three months ago, you went through your confidence level of Wealth and CTS, et cetera. It sounds like you're still comfortable with the $65 million to $85 million increase in ASV. Is that your thinking that's more back-end weighted for the year? Phil Snow : Yes, correct. So we believe that this year in particular it's always back-end weighted, I think if you go back historically, it may be somewhere between 60-40 just in terms of the split. But the way that we thought about this year and the way that we've sort of modeled out our plan, we believe that the second half of the year is going to be more heavily weighted than typical. And we're still, feeling good about the guidance range that we issued last quarter. Craig Huber : And then I think you said this three-year investment program to enhance the product in excess of $45 million of extra costs, I guess by the time we get to the end of fiscal 2022. How much of that you think will fall into this year versus next year? Helen Shan : So, to go through, let me reiterate how that works. So we have $15 million in each of the years that we will be investing in for '20, '21 and '22. So in terms of what falls into the first year, it's $15 million. Craig Huber : And very little of that was obviously in the first quarter? Helen Shan : Right. Because much of the spend is people related and it takes time to hire, especially for the capabilities that we're building, which has to do as Phil talked about in terms of content, the expertise there and also on the technical sides related to digital capabilities. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. George Tong : Organic ASV plus professional services growth is decelerated to its lowest level in years. You talked a bit about client budgets coming under pressure and some sell-side headcount reductions. Can you elaborate on changes you're seeing with buyside headcount in both the US and internationally? Phil Snow : Hey George, it's Phil. So yes, I think we're seeing pressure on headcounts in the front office. I think that's pretty well known. I think portfolio managers, traders research analysts, I think over time our thesis is that we'll see sustained pressure in terms of the number of people and that clients are going to want to go to more efficient solutions and more of a technology type solution. George Tong : You noted a decrease in your add-on business where you cross sell to existing clients. Can you discuss broader trends you're seeing with new product uptake versus your expectations and traction with the client wallet penetration? Phil Snow : Yes. So a lot of that really had to do with the large deal, but we had in Q1 last year that was booked as an add-on business that was an existing client. So I think that was the vast majority of this and as I mentioned in my script and throughout the call we're seeing a lot of very positive momentum for Analytics product for feeds and on the Wealth side a lot of it is driven by used account. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to Phil. Phil Snow : Thanks everyone. I'd like to thank you all for joining us today. It's clear that the changes in our industry are happening and speed and we remain well placed to lead the charge. Our efforts are already taking root as we position the Company for the future, which is reflected in our new global headquarters here in Norwalk, Connecticut. And I'm very proud of the efforts we've made to create space that fuels innovation and collaboration and truly mirrors our Company and values. Demand for open flexible solutions is growing and I want to conclude by reiterating our conviction in our outlook for the year and happy holidays to all of you. If you have additional questions, please call Rima Hyder and we look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Operator, that ends today's call. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Rima Hyder, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead. Rima Hyder : Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to FactSet's second quarter 2020 earnings call. Like many of you were also in various remote locations today. We may have some audio quality issues and we really appreciate your patience in the event we have an audio interruption. Before we begin, I would like to point out that the slides we will reference during the course of this presentation can be accessed via the website on the Investor Relations section of our website at factset.com. The slides will be posted on our website at the conclusion of this call. A replay of today's call will be available via phone and on our website. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions from investors. To be fair to everyone, please limit yourself to one question, plus one follow-up. Before we discuss our results, I encourage all listeners to review the notice on Slide 2, which explains the risks of forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the appendix to the presentation and in our earnings release issued earlier today. Joining me today are Phil Snow, FactSet's Chief Executive Officer, and Helen Shan, FactSet's Chief Financial Officer. I'd now like to turn the discussion over to Phil Snow. Phil Snow : Thanks, Rima, and good morning to everyone, wherever you are today. I'd like to take a moment just to address the unprecedented times we are experiencing. And as ever, our foremost priority remains the health and safety of our employees, their families and our clients. We're doing everything we can to support our stakeholders around the world and our thoughts are with each of you during this extremely challenging period. FactSet has implemented its business continuity plans and our incident management team is in place to ensure we respond to changes in our environment quickly and effectively. We're also working closely with clients to support them as they implement their own contingency plans, helping them access FactSet remotely. On the service side, we bulked up our support and resources to manage increased volumes, and have extended additional web IDs to clients in need of immediate remote access to financial data. Our open flexible platform is well suited for this environment and the investments we've made to-date in technology allow us to serve our clients better. Additionally, part of our three-year plan is accelerating the digital transformation, and the efficiencies and values that digital transformation bring are even more amplified in a world where both we and our clients are working remotely. To that end, in the context of immense change in our industry and the markets at large, we're pleased to deliver a good second quarter and fiscal half year with promising growth across our businesses. Let's now talk about ASV and our geographic breakdown. Organic ASV plus professional services grew at 4.3%, an increase in our growth rate compared to the first quarter, resulting from a stronger second quarter year-over-year. The Americas region performed well with a particularly strong quarter from our analytics business. The Americas also benefited from the impact of our annual price increase as well as continued improvement in our client retention and new business initiatives. This performance was offset by softer results in the APAC region due to slower expansion and higher cancellation rates, which we could partly attributed to delays in expected decision-making amidst the Hong Kong protests and the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. As conditions improve, we see many opportunities to execute, particularly in the areas of analytics and CTS, and expect to see this region return to higher growth. Our sales in Europe improved year-over-year due to a lower cancellation rate compared to the second quarter of fiscal '19. Additionally, analytics and research both performed well in the Europe region, and we continue to capitalize on opportunities with wealth and institutional asset managers. Of course, we are being cautious amid greater uncertainty in all our regions as a result of the evolving impact of the coronavirus pandemic. A quick overview of our second quarter results. Q2 growth was driven by an especially strong performance from analytics. This strength was reflected across multiple aspects of the business, including performance and reporting, trading solutions, and risk management, where we continue to see demand for our multi-asset class offering. The analytics pipeline looks healthy with strong demand in performance, reporting and fixed income. Wealth also performed well across all regions. I'm proud of our team for expanding the wealth opportunities we have, especially compared to prior years. We're growing both our product offering and client base laying the groundwork for a healthy pipeline. Research had a solid quarter relative to the first quarter, driven by stronger client retention and cross-selling to existing clients. Our enhanced deep sector data strategy is helping to pave the way for additional corporate clients. Research also benefited from our annual price increase. Within content and technology solutions, we've got a solid pipeline as we head into the second half of the year, driven by strength in our core and premium data feeds offering. We're also excited about clients consuming data through APIs and continuing to make our proprietary datasets available on the cloud. An example is our partnership with the cloud data platform Snowflake, who helps users centralize, integrate and analyze FactSet content alongside other hosted data feeds in an open and interoperable way. As we've said before, we're investing from a position of strength to meet universal client demand for increased efficiency and cost savings, particularly through our efforts in content and technology. This investment is more important today than ever with clients stressing the need for flexible access to critical data in the current environment. Our continue to spend on technology, transition to the cloud, and increased pace of API launches have proven vital these last few weeks, and we believe they will make us ever more resilient in the long term. Our content strategy is also progressing well and is proving equally important to clients. Detailed, industry-specific data, what we refer to as our deep sector strategy is solely needed and we are seeing strong demand for the sectors we've launched as well as those we plan to launch in the coming months. We believe this demand will increase our appeal to a wider client base, especially when combined with our growing private markets and StreetAccount offerings. I'm very pleased that FactSet's overall expansion of coverage is receiving such a positive response from clients, helping us address their needs for comprehensive content solutions. Now, before I turn the call over to Helen I want to highlight that our pipeline at the end of this quarter appeared to be the healthiest in years. As we noted previously, we've been projecting a stronger second half for our fiscal 2020. And as we talk to you today, it's difficult to measure the potential impact of the coronavirus pandemic on our clients, employees, industry and broader markets, and Helen is going to walk you through the details of how this may impact our business in a few moments. But first, I want to stress that our robust subscription-based business model and our strategy together with our best-in-class products, many of which are critical to clients, position us well to manage through this period. Moreover, we continue to diversify our product and client base over the years. Our plans to invest in content and technology are more important in today's environment than ever. And I want to reiterate our commitment to our three-year investment plan. We've proven resilience in times of volatility with a strong balance sheet and have gone on to deliver consistent long-term growth and value to our shareholders, which we expect we will continue in the future. While we believe we have good momentum going into the second half, we fully recognize the scale of the challenge that the entire industry faces. And through it all, our job is to do what we do best, help our clients weather such unprecedented change. Let me now turn the call over to Helen, who will discuss the specifics of our second quarter performance and the second half outlook. Helen Shan : Thank you, Phil. And I'm really glad to be here with all of you today. I hope you and your families are healthy and safe. As Phil stated, our priority is the well-being of our employees and ensuring that we can provide uninterrupted service to our clients. At the same time, today is about updating all of you on our second quarter and also discussing our outlook for the second half, given what we know today about the macro environment. As we have discussed on previous calls, our performance is a tale of two halves. We are ahead year-on-year in our first half of 2020 in revenue, operating margin and EPS. Our three-year investment plan also remains on track as we continue to ramp up hiring and spend in the areas of content and technology. I will now walk us through the specifics of the second quarter's results. GAAP and organic revenue increased by 4% to $370 million and $371 million respectively. Growth was driven primarily by wealth, CTS and analytics. The result was further supported by our January 1 annual Americas price increase, which totaled $12 million, $2 million increase over the prior year. For our geographic segments, over the last 12 months, Americas revenue and international revenue both grew 4% organically. Americas primarily benefited from increases in wealth and analytics. International revenue was largely driven by analytics and CTS. GAAP operating expenses for the first half totaled $264 million, 7% uptick over the prior year. This increase reflects the acceleration of spend related to our investment plan. With expenses growing faster than revenue, our GAAP margin decreased 190 basis points to 29%. Adjusted operating margin decreased by 140 basis points to 32% versus last year. As a percentage of revenue, the decrease in margins came largely from our cost of services, which was 110 basis points higher than last year on a GAAP basis. On adjusted basis, the cost of sales was higher by 170 basis points. Increased costs for both GAAP and adjusted were driven by our planned spend in technology related to our three-year investment plan, partially offset by productivity gains and salary costs as we continue to shift hiring from high cost to low cost location. SG&A expenses, expressed as a percentage of revenue, grew 80 basis points over the prior-year period on a GAAP basis. On an adjusted basis, the expenses grew by 30 basis points year-over-year. On a GAAP basis, the increase in expenses is from higher professional fees related to the execution of the investment plan, offset by reduced travel and entertainment expenses, and lower bad debt expense. On adjusted basis, the increase was primarily due to higher office and marketing. Moving on, our tax rate for the quarter was 14%. This rate includes tax benefits related to stock compensation exercises. Keep in mind that when we provided annual guidance for fiscal 2020, we did include a certain level of stock compensation exercises. Given the strong performance of our stock during the quarter, the exercises in the amount of benefit was higher than we had estimated. GAAP EPS increased 5% to $2.30 this quarter versus $2.19 in the second quarter of 2019. And adjusted diluted EPS also grew 5% to $2.55 primarily due to a lower tax rate. Looking at the first half of the year, EPS growth was driven primarily by operating earnings, boosted by a lower tax rate and lower interest expense. Reconciliation of our adjustments to GAAP EPS is disclosed at the end of our press release. Free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending, was $75 million for the quarter, a decrease of 15% over the same period last year. This reduction is primarily due to expected higher capital expenditures related to office space build out for some of our locations, where existing leases have neared expiration. The timing of capex spend related to technology and facilities is important to note as when we review the first half of fiscal 2020 free cash flow grew by nearly 16% [ph]. For the second quarter, our ASV retention continued to be over 95%. Versus the prior year, we grew the total number of clients by 5% on a last 12 months basis, reflecting the addition of wealth and corporate clients and the retention of 89% of existing clients. These results and our overall healthy client base reflect the activities in flight with our sales organization, who have targets and focused on retention, expansion and new business. For the second quarter, we bought back 268,000 shares for $74 million at the average share price of $277. Our Board of Directors recently authorized an additional $220 million to our share repurchase program, bringing the total size back to $300 million. Over the last 12 months, we have returned over $375 million to our investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We remain committed to creating long-term value for our shareholders and plan to repurchase shares at a steady pace in line with last year. Turning to the outlook for the rest of our fiscal year. The environment we live and operate in has changed enormously in the past few months. One of the strengths of FactSet is our business model, which generates stable and recurring cash flows. Another strength is the criticality of our solutions for our clients, as reflected in our high retention rate. Lastly, we have a solid balance sheet with low debt leverage and ample liquidity. As a result, FactSet has proven to be resilient during periods of volatility and has the capacity to invest even through periods of disruption. These attributes should allow us to succeed through downturns and emerge stronger. As we look forward, uncertainty surrounding the magnitude, duration and overall economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic makes it challenging to assess the potential effect on our ASV growth, both in the second half of the year and further into 2021. However, in determining the possible impact on fiscal year 2020, we considered a number of factors. First, the potential delay in decision-making causing longer sales cycle. This may also have a positive impact in the form of delayed cancellations. Second, implementation risk due to restrictions on being able to work on-site. While we can do virtual implementation for many of our products, our clients may not have the technology to enable us to execute successfully. And third, possible reduced seasonal hiring at investment banks, who are some of our largest clients over the summer months. It is possible that the negative effect of these factors could present a significant headwind on our ability to realize our strong ASV pipeline in this fiscal year ending in August. Based on what we know today, we believe the risk could be up to $25 million over the fiscal second half. With this risk, we now expect the increase in our organic ASV plus professional services to be in the range of $50 million to $75 million. It is important to note that our business is subscription in nature. ASV booked later in the fiscal year is realized as revenue on a proportionate basis. Given that we booked the highest amount of ASV in the fourth quarter, we expect the impact to 2020 revenues would be limited. It is important to emphasize that these numbers reflect our best estimates at this time. It's simply too early to know what the exact number will be, but we hope to gain more experience to listed insights from clients over time and be able to better assess the implications for fiscal year 2020 and 2021. We believe that lowering our expenses would help to offset any reduced realized revenue. We remain committed to reducing expenses through the following actions. Further reduction of discretionary spend that are just travel and entertainment, building upon our prior success in prudent expense management and productivity, tighter management of head count spend with a focus on our most critical areas and hiring in lower cost locations, reduction in variable third-party content costs in a manner consistent with client demand. These actions will also moderate depending on the economic conditions. For example, T&E and targeted third-party content costs would be variable in nature. We have also taken additional expenses related to business continuity and the pandemic into account as well. Reflected in our profitability improvements over the past 18 months, our team has proven our ability to manage expenses and increase efficiencies. As noted, we are adjusting our guidance on the ASV range in light of our best estimates today, but leaving the rest of our guidance unchanged. Based on our results for the first half in which revenue growth and operating margins were in line with our expectations and our ability to mitigate the potential lower revenue impact with direct expense reduction in the second half, we are reaffirming the other metrics. In closing, we are often asked how we might perform during a future downturn in the economy. We point to the 2008-2009 time period in which we grew both the top and bottom line. As discussed, our business model is resilient and one of our greatest strengths. In addition, our product base has evolved in terms of its technology, interoperability, and of course it's openness and flexibility, making us more critical to clients. We remain committed to our investment plan and will look for other opportunities to grow, support our clients during times of change, as well as deliver value to long-term shareholders. With that, we are now ready for questions. Over to you, Chris. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Toni Kaplan : Thank you so much. Glad to hear you're all well. Given that the quarter ended in February, before a lot of the volatility started to increase, what are the trends that you're seeing in March across the different businesses? If you could just give us like a real-time trends that you're seeing through as late as you possibly could? Phil Snow : Sure. Hey Toni, it's Phil. Hope you're doing fine. So I think as Helen mentioned, during her script, we felt very good about the pipeline going into the second half. And from what we can see today, that pipeline is really hanging in there. So we are still closing deals. Obviously we're talking very closely to our largest clients, some of the bigger deals in the pipeline. And we are anticipating some headwinds. But we're not seeing just an immediate response from the clients, right, in terms of either cutting back services, or completely pushing out things that were in the pipeline that really works. Toni Kaplan : Got it. And you did mention the pipeline there, and then also that's the strongest that you've had as you ended the quarter. And you mentioned a number of the areas, analytics being very healthy, also research and CTS. Just I guess, which are the best most increased parts of the pipeline? What are you really seeing people signing up for and demanding right now? Phil Snow : Yes, sure. So let me zoom out a little bit. So I think the area where we're seeing some really great momentum is within the institutional asset management clients. So the core FactSet clients. When we talk about the buy side, there's lots of other firms that are included there, including a lot of wealth clients and the hedge funds, but the core institutional asset management clients this year are doing much better for us than last year. And I attribute a lot of that to the work we've done around the portfolio life cycle, the strength of the analytics products. So a lot of the work we did to integrate the acquisitions that you're all aware of from three years ago is really now beginning to bear fruit. So we can see that with our performance suite, we can see it with the advancements we've made in our risk offering. We're continuing to build momentum in fixed income now that the specialists are back in that business line. Our reporting suite, which was sort of a result of acquiring Vermilion. All of that stuff is doing great. And those are enterprise solutions in many cases, right, so they are not tied to the desktop. So, I'm very excited about that. Obviously, that's a segment of our market that's been under a lot of pressure, but just to see sort of the turnaround, particularly given the recent trends is very promising. Our open platform is resonating. So we have a very healthy pipeline for CTS going into the second half, and a lot of that is within these core institutional asset management clients now that are just, A, either feeding systems, or B, just needing to look at lots of new data in interesting ways. So those are some of the highlights. Toni Kaplan : Thanks a lot. Stay safe and healthy. Phil Snow : Yes, you too. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. Good morning. Phil, I was hoping for a little bit of compare/contrast the FactSet today versus '08, '09 kind of time frame. Because, yes, I believe in '09, you guys did grow slightly positively, but it also decelerated from what was a really strong growth prior to that. So I was just curious how you would describe the resiliency, diversification, etcetera today. Phil Snow : Yes. So it's a good thing to think about and of course we've gone -- I have gone back and reflected on that a decade ago, Manav. So I think each one of these black swan events is different. But -- and sometimes it's hard to go parallels. But I think there are some things that are different now. Back then, I think in some ways a lot of the markets were broken, right, and we saw Lehman and Bear just completely go out of business. And those were large clients for us. So a lot of what you saw there was just clients disappearing, right, big clients. I don't think that's going to happen the same way this time, you don't know. But I think that's one point of comparison. Back then also our clients had a lot more flexibility within the contract. So they were able to sort of unwind a little bit more quickly than they would be able to now if they wanted to, but I think sort of overshadowing that in a more important point is just the breadth of our product suite now, and the fact that we really have evolved from just being on the desktop to being more of a workflow solution. So back in '08 and '09, with the exception of our feed business which was pretty small back then, almost everything on FactSet was tied to people in terms of the workstation, and of course we had PA, which was great, but it was sort of an add-on typically then to the workstation and less of a workflow solution. So I think this is a point of comparison. I know that was a severe sort of downturn in the markets and we went down pretty quickly and then bounced up sort of a year later, but I think it's difference in a positive way for us this time. Manav Patnaik : Got it. And then Helen, you walked through a lot of cost areas where you have something to exclude, the -- I was just curious on the three-year investment plan. Does that continue at all costs? Is there a point where you think about even slowing that down? Helen Shan : Yes, thank you for your question. At this juncture, what we do typically is to review every quarter where we stand, how milestones are, what's happened in the environment that makes us rethink any of the -- any change that we would make. At this point right now, we're looking at prioritizing spend and we'll make adjustments if we needed. So for us, we're investing for growth in the long term. And the year one was really meant about investing as opposed to seeing the returns early on. So at this point, there is no plan for any change. Manav Patnaik : All right, got it. Thank you, guys. Helen Shan : Got it. Take care. Operator : Your next question is from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Your line is open. Hamzah Mazari : Good morning. Hope everybody is well, as well. Just a first question. If you could talk about whether you think switching costs are a barrier to entry in your business? Particularly when contracts come up for renewal, is there greater price sensitivity in a slowdown? And do people -- does switching costs kind of prevent -- help your retention, I guess, is another way to look at it. Or is it pretty easy for people to switch because competitors come in and they just redo codes to their product instead? Phil Snow : Hamzah, it's Phil. So I think switching costs changes -- there's a lot of work that goes into that for clients. So I think Helen mentioned this in the script, but in the same way that clients may be slowing down their decisions in terms of things that we have actively in the pipeline, in cases where we're working with either an internal solution or a competitor in some sort of bake-off. It's going to slow the decision-making around that. I think it's probably more of the change right now for clients in the switching costs. What I will highlight, which we're seeing a lot of positive feedback from our clients on right now, is we can deploy FactSet very quickly, and our web-based product now is proving to be a real winner in this market. So we are actively reaching out to our clients like we always do, saying how can we help. We are offering web ideas for FactSet, for clients where they need it, where someone may not even be a user today and we're deploying that. So I think we're nimble, we're agile, we're doing what FactSet does best, which is support clients, particularly through periods like this. And the fact that we can sort of get those out very quickly is getting a very, very positive response from clients. Hamzah Mazari : Great. And just a follow-up question. Any update as to simplification of your pricing model and moving to sort of more enterprise-wide contracts? Any update there? Thank you. Phil Snow : Helen, do you want to take that one? Helen Shan : Sure, I will. Thanks for your question. So right now in terms of our ability to continue to capture the value that we provide clients, we will on our larger clients look for enterprise. But that is not something -- it's really by case by case, or really for our strategic client group clients. So at this point, we do -- it's about pricing on a workflow basis and we've had good success with it. So I would see us continuing down that path. Hamzah Mazari : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open. Alex Kramm : Hey, good morning, everyone. Just want to come back to ASV that you still need to do for the end of the year to get to the midpoint. I think it's about $40 million. And how the kind of expectation is? What's supposed to come in terms of what's in the pipeline? And I guess what I'm saying there is, how much of the growth of the ASV is dependent on things already signed kind of bigger enterprise implementations versus maybe some of the ASV growth as opposed to come from more users at some of your existing clients? And maybe also how cancellations are already factored into the updated ASV? Thank you. Phil Snow : Sure. So I think the one area, which I think is pretty obvious, Alex, where we could see some pressure and it's hard to predict, is the summer banking highs at the large banks. So we've not heard yet that any of that's getting canceled. But sort of going into the second half, that's when we -- we have some predictions sort of based on prior years and how we think things are trending. So that's usually a pretty decent uptick in Q4. And if the banks decide to slow down hiring or cancel classes, that will affect us. So we've modeled a lot of that in already. We're actually -- we've given ourselves a pretty big haircut there in terms of what we're thinking. And like any flow, we've got things at different stages in the pipeline, all the way through almost signed to sort of 50-50. So, there's a lot of very good deals out there. Our sales cycle is a little bit longer than it used to be just given we've got some of these enterprise products. So these are important mission critical solutions for clients. So what we're not expecting, right, for these opportunities just to go away. I think if anything, we're expecting them and the decisions that get stretched out as clients try to get on sure footing and figure out sort of what they think the impact of all of this is going to be for them. Just in terms of what's in the pipeline, I think it's pretty evenly split between the Americas, and Europe and Asia-Pac. Asia-Pac is a very strong second half pipeline, and it will be very interesting to see how Asia-Pac does particularly in Q3 given that it looks like they're the region that hopefully has this under control. They look like they could come back to work sooner than other regions. So I think that will be an important things for us to keep an eye on. And again, the pipeline is very much weighted towards -- on a net basis, towards analytics and CTS, which are the again more of the enterprise or workflow solutions products. Helen Shan : Maybe I could just add a little to that. Alex Kramm : That was helpful. Yes, please. Thanks. Helen Shan : Yes, that's helpful, Alex. So everything that Phil said is spot on. And as we thought about the pipeline and our view on the risk, as we said, it's delay in decision-making, which is about, let's call it half of where we think the risk would come from, a longer implementation, which is, let's call it another quarter-ish, and then the balance could be due to user growth, meaning that if we had a reduction there. So on those first two buckets, as Phil was alluding to, that is a little more long-timing. And so we did do a lot of thinking, and as you can appreciate, we're a little more arts and science. But in thinking through them, not only where they are along the funnel, but also the sentiment. And so that's how we came about this. And hopefully, that gives you a little bit of a perspective of how we thought about the pipeline and what would be at risk. Alex Kramm : That's actually great color. Thank you. Maybe just one quick additional one in terms of the timing for -- in terms of even measuring your next quarter. Maybe you've said this already, but if I think about a typical I guess cadence, I think the next quarter is -- I think historically you've done about $10 million to $15 million ASV adds. And then, it's like $30 million, $40 million plus in the fourth quarter. So is your working assumption right now that 3Q could be almost non-existent given everybody's displays, and then hopefully you have a big catch-up in the fourth quarter? Or how do you thinking about the trajectory in general? And maybe you said this already. Thanks. Phil Snow : Yes, I don't know about non-existent. So we had -- I think our Q3 last year was sort of in the $4 million to $5 million range. And we are -- Q3 is still looking much better than it did at this time last year. So it's just really a question of how much can we close, right, in the next three months. So like I said, we've not seen -- it's been two or three weeks, right, since the news has gotten out there and we're just anxiously awaiting data just to kind of give us a lot more sort of -- a lot more accuracy in terms of either way. But right now, we're still -- we still look good on the relative basis to last year. And I think sort of how you highlighted Q3 and Q4, Alex, it's not that different. We have a very strong Q4 lined up as well, but sort of the relative weightings that you mentioned are pretty consistent with prior year. Operator : Your next question is from Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks for taking my question. So just a question on the -- Helen, you mentioned, I believe $25 million of ASV risk, but the guidance at the midpoint was only taken down by $12.5 million. So I was just wondering if you could put some context around how much the guidance was lowered versus how much of ASV is at risk. And then also put that in context of how much ASV is going to be generated in the back half. So would it be fair to assume that the remaining $40 million less $25 million is already you have good visibility on that front? So if you could help with that, respond to that one. Helen Shan : Yes. Thank you for your question. As you can imagine, I did mention this is a little more arts and science, right. So we really took a look at the sentiment on deals and then adjusted our range accordingly. So we said up to $25 million, we take $12.5 million. That's a little bit of how you move from a midpoint perspective. So I'm not sure it's -- we were trying to be much more precise than that. I think as you think about the cadence of how the ASV is meant to come in, I would look at our last couple of years where you have seen the bulk come in, in Q4, as a percentage. And I would say that was, as Phil mentioned, we're filling at least for Q3 through March, we've not seen major impact. And so we're filling ahead. But that being said, the cadence and the percentages, I would look towards how we've performed in the last two years. Ashish Sabadra : Helen, that's helpful. And maybe, Phil, a quick question, maybe a clarifying question on the pipeline. How should we think about some of the pipeline being delayed, which is potentially also a risk of getting canceled? Just given how quickly we saw this market going down 25% in such a short period of time, I was just wondering how up to date that pipeline is given how quickly things changed. Phil Snow : Yes. So I think Helen already spoke a little bit to the methodology that we use there. So the pipeline is updated in real time. Of course, we're looking at that every day. And we're encouraging the salespeople obviously to make sure that their probabilities are accurate and updated. So it's pretty good peak on a daily basis. And just in terms of cancels versus the probability of close or extension, I think we're expecting less pure cancels and more just delayed decision-making. Helen Shan : And Ashish, if you think about, we are only a few weeks in here, right. At least here on in the western part of the world. But our ability to significantly operate remotely, we've had no disruption in our top 20 deals. We've not -- there has been no delay as of now. We are fully operational. We've added resources to our helped desk. We've had really good engagement. So again this is just real time -- you're getting real-time data from us. And that's our best view at this juncture. Phil Snow : Yes, we're not getting calls from clients. We're not getting a lot of inbound calls around cancels or anything like that. It's -- something will be coming, I'm sure. Sort of clients evaluate the situation. But I think it's different than from '08, '09, sort of going back to the question that Manav had. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks a lot, sir. Phil Snow : Sure, yes. Operator : Your next question is from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo, your line is open. Bill Warmington : Sorry about that. Trying to unmute my phone. Good morning, everyone. Phil Snow : Good morning. Bill Warmington : First question I had for you, was, it sounds like the coronavirus had a pretty significant impact on APAC performance. Why wouldn't the Americas have a similar impact? Phil Snow : There will be some impact there, Bill. But the Asia-Pac is a much smaller region. And it's a little bit more difficult to sort of drop complete analogies there. So within APAC, there are other things going on potentially, although in that, I think that's just one of the factors that may have slowed it down. We've had some change over there, and sort of leadership change sometimes leads to a little bit of a slowdown as sort of the new leader comes in and implements a strategy. But we still view Asia-Pac as a really big opportunity for us and one that we want to overweight in terms of relative investments. So, I think going back to Alex's question about the pipeline and what's in there, I think seeing how quickly Asia-Pac comes back and really executes on the second half pipeline will be important. And sometimes years look a little bit different. So for that particular region, it could have been that the opportunities were just much more heavily weighted towards the second half than the first half, this particular fiscal year. Helen Shan : And just to add to that, there was a fair amount of political unrest that was happening in particular in Hong Kong. Right. So there are I think multiple factors that need to be taken into consideration. Bill Warmington : Got it, okay. And then I wanted to ask for a clarification on the subscriptions. What is the cancellation policy for clients? How much notice is required to cancel fee to reduce usage? Phil Snow : So we have a lot more clients. Go ahead. Helen Shan : Go ahead, Phil. Sorry. Phil Snow : That's fine. So one of the things I think that's changed over the years, Bill, is that we have a lot more clients on multi-year contracts with minimums than we did way back in '08 and '09. And most clients are on annual contracts now that aren't on those that have -- they have to give more advanced notice in terms of their cancellation, but it varies client by client. Bill Warmington : Got it. All right. And then I also have to point out -- did you come up with that name Phil? Snowflake, is that yours? Phil Snow : No, I didn't. But thank you [indiscernible] but I do have brother whose name is John Snow, which provides endless hours of amusement for everybody. Bill Warmington : All right. Well, thank you very much. Phil Snow : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is open. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, thank you. Just a quick question in terms of the tax spend. Is there anything you're seeing with the turmoil going on that's making you think about re-prioritizing just what you're spending on in the tech spend or spending more money, take advantage of certain things? I'm just wondering, how does that work or is it really too soon to make any changes given everything is kind of happening in a pretty quick pace? Phil Snow : Yes. Thanks, Shlomo. We are -- part of our multi-year plan obviously is to invest heavily in technology, open up more APIs, move to the public cloud, and have a more personalized experience for clients. So we are on track there in terms of our investments and executing very well against it. And as you point out, this might be a time to step on the gas in terms of what we do there. So Helen and I are looking carefully at the budgets. Obviously, we want to get as much visibility as we can on sort of what the next six to 12 months look like, but I do think there is an argument here to be made for going faster there, just for obvious reasons. Shlomo Rosenbaum : And can you also talk a little bit about just the -- with everyone working remotely and probably overloading the calls to your support staff, are you bringing on additional support staff? How you're handling that internally for right now? Phil Snow : Yes, we're beefing up our support desk for clients. We do see some increased volume. Right. We're seeing FactSet used more than ever. So as you can imagine, people need access to our stuff and we're seeing very good usage across the system, and obviously a lot more volumes in terms of trading. So we're performing exceptionally well from a systems standpoint. And we've over time sort of distributed our support anyway. So we've got a lot of folks in India and the Philippines that help particularly over chat. They're very skilled. We've been at it for years, particularly in Manila. And we're able to handle an increased volume. And I believe there are even some people that have been at FactSet a longer time, sort of pitching in a little bit on the analytics side, if we're getting a lot of complicated questions coming in for some of our workflow products. So, everyone is pitching in. There is a great spirit at the company. And this is where we shine I think just in terms of being there to support our clients. So we're doing everything we can in this environment to make sure that we're performing even better than usual. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, great. Thanks. Helen Shan : And I think, just to add a little to that is the, if anything what this period of time is telling us is our ability, how important it is for this transformation for us in digital technology investments. So I think that's a positive. And then secondly, the spend that we've done on our infrastructure is allowing us to be able to work remotely and to have more of our enterprise applications on the cloud, again a positive. So I think the current situation and reinforced some of the decisions we've made. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Thank you. Helen Shan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Peter Heckmann with Davidson. Your line is open. Peter Heckmann : Hey, good morning. I faded out there for a minute. I don't think this has been addressed. But Helen, could you talk about given the recent strength of the US dollar, what type of benefit you had in the quarter on expenses relative to the content creation centers in India and the Philippines? And I guess what type of benefit you would expect in the back half given some of the hedges that you have in place? Helen Shan : Right. No, thank you for the question. And we didn't address that yet. So in terms of this quarter, foreign exchange was not an impact on our margins. It was fairly neutral. So from that perspective, there was no impact. But going forward, we typically hedge around, it's a rolling exposure hedged about 50%. So looking where we are right now, we just looked at this last week,. I think our exposure to the pound and the euro will potentially give us some benefits, as it relates to where we locked in for the peso and the rupee, a little bit less so, but they're all very good levels. So we're very comfortable with that. Peter Heckmann : Okay, great. And then just in terms of the events. Just thinking about your sales force and how you're growing in wealth and analytics, how important is both field sales and attendance at kind of industry events for your new sales? And how do you -- is that part of some of the uncertainty in terms of trimming the ASV growth guidance? Phil Snow : That's never really been part of what we do. So we don't spend a lot of money on marketing. We do -- we have a client symposium every year where our clients come and sort of meet with each other, to learn sort of best practices and how people are using FactSet. That's probably every 18 months, once in a year, once in Americas. And we started to do that in Asia. But our sales people I think usually grow up supporting our clients. They've got good relationships. They usually a transition from technical support over to sales. And we just do a lot of sort of direct marketing to clients and working with them. So what's different for our sales force is, they're used to traveling, being in front of clients and sitting down with clients. But I'm sure you're all discovering some new things working from home, I am. And I'm actually positively surprised by the efficiency and even the intimacy that you can get over video. We use teams, which has been really good. So I think we're going to learn new ways of working with our clients and I think you're going to learn new ways of working. And I think it's a great opportunity for all of us to be more efficient. And I guess, Helen's pointed out, we're very well poised, I think for a new world. So it's going to be different. I hope we're all back to work in a month. We may not be obviously, and depending on the region. But when we all do go back to work, I think it's going to be different than what we used to and I think different in a good way. Peter Heckmann : Great. Thanks for the feedback. Operator : Your next question is from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Kevin McVeigh : Great, thanks. Phil or Helen, I wonder if you could give us a sense of trends within Asia is kind of a cue for I guess more from a recovery perspective, anything you're seeing there that kind of helps us frame what we should expect in Europe and ultimately the US, obviously still very early. But just any thoughts around that would be helpful? Phil Snow : Sure. So very strong pipeline in Asia for the second half, as I mentioned. And I think similar to what I mentioned for the whole company, which is heavily weighted towards analytics and CTS. We opened our office in Shanghai. I think it was just under two years ago now. So we've got a really crackerjack team in Mainland China. And we've been driving very strong growth in Mainland China, as well as Korea, which will be interesting. So, I think looking at those two markets in particular given that they were the hardest hit over there, will give us a good sense of what the comeback is going to look like. Kevin McVeigh : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is open. Andrew Nicholas : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I believe the majority your price increases occur in the third quarter, at least for your international clients. So with that in mind, would it be possible to size the percentage of international ASV that comes up for renewal this year, where our pricing conversation might be happening right now? And then, if you could talk a little bit about any changes you've made or expect to make on the pricing front, given the current environment? Helen Shan : Hi, thanks for your question. I'll take the first shot at that one. So we typically do annual price increases, and you're right. As we saw in Q2, we're very pleased with the improvement that we were able to get, which reflects what our clients value from us. So I think that's a real positive, and it also reflects all the investment enhancements that we've made to it. As it relates to Q3 and the international clients, right now, I would say if you look at what did last year versus this year, we feel very good of where we stand. We're likely to be there or better. And as you know right now, this is an annual -- we do it annually. So by the we finish Q3, that will have done through that price increase sector at that point. Andrew Nicholas : All right, thank you. And in a longer, more drawn out recession type scenario, which business lines would you expect to have the hardest time achieving near 2022 ASV growth targets? I guess, trying to figure out which business lines do you also would expect to be more resilient to the economic environment. Thanks. Phil Snow : Yes, I think banking is probably the one that could get hardest set for us, but I think that's less than 20% of our business now. And 10 years ago, I believe it was bigger percentage than that. And then I think underperforming asset managers, family offices, hedge funds, I think those are going to struggle in the long run anyway. But I think our core clients are healthy. They're middle market and large institutional asset managers. We've got a very healthy business with sovereigns and asset owners, which -- that's not going to go away. I think that's just the bigger opportunity for us moving forward. Insurance companies would be beginning to build up some good momentum in the private market space. So that's a smaller area for us, but we're seeing very good momentum there with a little investment we've made so far. So, I think there's lots of opportunities for us to grow, but I do think it's that traditional very people-heavy sort of sell side business that could be the most effective in the protracted down turn. Andrew Nicholas : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. Joseph Foresi : Hi. I wanted to ask just about the long term. You've been shifting the portfolio kind of more towards private clients stuff for quite some time and newer areas like that. And I guess my question is, when we come out the other end, do we think that that's going to accelerate? Are there any specific bets that you're making based on what's happening now that could give you some directional understanding of that? And then I have just one quick follow-up. Phil Snow : Yes, sure, Joe. So yes, private markets are still smaller business for us. We only just really committed to making a big investment there in September when we announced our three-year plan. So we've sold a lot of our traditional FactSet workstation. You can see there's a lot of utility there for certain workflows, but we do view that as a greenfield opportunity. So as we invest this year and through the next three years, we certainly see that as a great opportunity for us, a greenfield opportunity. I think private markets have obviously done very well and I think they're still sitting on lots of dry gunpowder to use. So that's one area. And wealth, wealth is important. And that's relatively new for us. I think the wealth advisor of the future is going to continue to evolve in all the investments we're making in technology to create a better work space for them and sort of anticipate what the workflow is going to look like. We're very excited about that. That's the second area for us. Joseph Foresi : Got it. And I guess just to add some humor, maybe you could ask your brother if John Snow's alive. Phil Snow : I will. Joseph Foresi : Thanks. Phil Snow : As far as I know, he is. Thank you. Very pleased. Appreciate that. Operator : Your next question is from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. George Tong : Hi, thanks, good morning. You talked about delays in decision-making and longer sales cycles. Can you talk about how much elongation of the sales cycle is factored into guidance, specifically? If you had to estimate how much of the ASV guidance is shifted to fiscal 2021 versus lost? Phil Snow : Helen, do you want to talk about that? Helen Shan : Yes. Sure. Yes, so let me kind of go back on what we were talking about earlier. So when we thought about the risk, I think about 50% was really attributed to delays in terms of the amount of time. That's adding another layer of arts and science there, but we looked at also where it was in the pipeline in terms of the sentiment and how far long discussions were. So I think it's a little bit hard, George, to pinpoint more than what we identify. So I would say about half of it was based on delay in timing. George Tong : Got it. That's helpful. You talked about various expense savings earlier. How do these expense savings alter your operating margin outlook over the next one to three years, especially when considering your continued commitment to reinvesting into content and technology? Helen Shan : Yes. So, as we discussed, we're not changing guidance. So as it relates to this year, we think that any of the impact from revenue, if this comes to fruition, we'll be able to offset with the expense actions that I talked about earlier. As it relates to the outlook for the three-year, there is nothing there new. I think we are way early in this process to be thinking about what the impact will be and will continue to focus on FY '20. George Tong : Got it. Thank you. Helen Shan : Welcome. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. And our last question is from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Phil Snow : You on mute, Keith? Operator : We disconnected. I will move on. Our last question is from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Your line is open. Craig Huber : Yes, thank you. I have a quick housekeeping question first, before my two main questions. Can you just give us if you would please, the Europe and Asia revenues, ideally to one decimal please, for quarter? Helen Shan : Sorry, can you just repeat that? I might have missed that. Craig Huber : Sorry. If you could give us the revenue in the quarter from Europe and Asia to one decimal, please, rather than wait for the 10-Q? Helen Shan : You're talking about the growth rate? Craig Huber : No, no. Just the actual revenue number. The revenue number, to one decimal, in the quarter. Phil Snow : Rima can follow up with you after the call on that. She can give you that information. Helen Shan : I think that's right. Craig Huber : Okay. And then can you talk a little bit about your outlook for costs in the May and August quarters, relative to this $258 million of expenses you had in the February quarter excluding the one-time items? And how should we sort of think about your hiring plans, etc., for the next three and six months, please, given the environment? Helen Shan : As we discussed in terms of what we're managing from an expense perspective, we have maintained our guidance. We will focus on hiring on the areas like the investment plan. So there's no change there. As you might guess, we will be taking a hard look. So if there are new hires that are I'll say less essential in the near term, then we'll modulate accordingly. But at this juncture, there is no material leering from what our plan is, as it's been for the balance of the year. Craig Huber : And then, also wanted to ask a wealth management question. You've talked decent amount about it today, the outlook there for bring on some more wealth management clients, these chunky deals and stuff, it seems like that -- like others have been pushed out here given the environment stuff, but are you still quite optimistic here as you think out -- as you go through this period to add some more wealth management clients of that size? Phil Snow : Yes, absolutely. So we've got a number of large active opportunities. Obviously, we're in constant communication with those firms. And these are large deals, lots of users who like you are going to be working from home; so we're doing everything we can to sort of work with them. And those opportunities are still alive, it's just a question of making sure that we can talk to our clients and make sure they're comfortable transitioning during this period. So we expect to get them overtime but that is one of the areas that could potentially get slowed down. Operator : This does conclude all the time we have for Q&A. I'll now turn things back over to Phil Snow for any closing remarks. Phil Snow : Great, thanks. So, thanks everyone for joining us today. And I really hope you're all safe, your families, all the employees at your firms, obviously this is a difficult time for everyone. I'm pleased with what we've accomplished during the first half of fiscal '20, and we're really encouraged by the solid foundation we have in place which helps us remain resilient amongst any future disruptions. The reality is that these are early days and what could be a lengthy period of global change, and there are many unknowns as we head into the future. All of us are being tested and asked to support one another in new ways. And I'm proud but not at all surprised by the efforts FactSet-ers around the world have been making, and will continue to make to support one another. And thank our team for it's continued efforts, commitment and resilience. We really have a fantastic management team, all of our employees are really pitching in, and I think we're really seeing our culture shine through here. And as ever we will use our unique strength to support clients, leveraging our increasingly open and flexible technology stack, and best-in-class service to help them implement their own business continuity plans. We stand ready to meet challenges head-on and remain steadfastly focused on ensuring the health and safety of all of our stakeholders. If you have additional questions, please call Rima Hyder, and we look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Operator, that ends today's call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",

After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ms. Rima Hyder, Vice President of External Communications. Thank you. Please go ahead. Rima Hyder : Thank you, Jimmy. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to FactSet's third fiscal quarter 2020 earnings call. Like last quarter we're in various remote locations today. We may have some audio quality issues and we appreciate your patience, should we experience a disruption. Before we begin, I would like to point out that the slides we will reference during this presentation can be accessed via the webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at factset.com. The slides will be posted on our website at the conclusion of this call. A replay of today's call will be available via phone and on our website. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions from investors. To be fair to everyone, please limit yourself to one question plus one follow-up. Before we discuss our results, I encourage all listeners to review the legal notice on Slide 2, which explains the risks of forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the appendix to the presentation and in our earnings release issued earlier today. Joining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer, and Helen Shan, our Chief Financial Officer. I'd now like to turn the discussion over to Phil Snow. Phil Snow : Thanks, Rima, and good morning and good afternoon to everyone. To start things off, I'd really like to thank the entire FactSet team for its remarkable efforts over the last quarter. It's really inspiring to see how FactSetters are going above and beyond each day to support our clients and each other, as we all explore new ways of working. We've been positively surprised on how quickly we've been able to adapt to working in new ways, and are actively evaluating what this could mean in terms of efficiency, productivity, client experience, talents and work-life balance for our employees. We've maintained a high level of engagement with both clients and employees over the last quarter, and we show healthy trends in client usage and interactions with our clients service team. Our annual Hackathon had a record number of projects submitted this year with some fantastic ideas. And FactSetters around the world continue to support our communities, through companywide volunteering and donation efforts. Let me talk a little bit about digital transformation and our investment plan. The events of this year and the uncertainty in what form the recovery might take is likely to put continued pressure on our end markets. There's even more urgency for firms to revamp their legacy platforms and accelerate their digital transformation efforts. Developing next generation manufacturing capabilities and delivering a more personalized experience is going to be the key to winning for asset managers and asset owners. And the success that firms on both the buy side and sell side have seen and working remotely could be a meaningful catalyst in transforming historically inefficient workflows. The transition to a more digitally driven future, which was already taking place is accelerating at a pace, few would have predicted three months ago. More firms are moving to the public cloud and upgrading their data and technology faster to meet the needs of a virtual workforce, manage volatility and continue to adapt, evolve and compete. Our investment plan addresses these trends and is rooted in migration to the cloud, and our longstanding mission of providing clients with actionable data and insights, where, when and how they want it. Every day, we are supporting our customers with their own digital transformation efforts, delivering personalized and value added solutions, and as a result of deepening our relationships with them. We remain confident and on track with the programs in our three-year investment plan. Our focus on transforming our technology landscape, creating a new universe of data for private markets, along with our expansion of critical content for banking and wealth position us well to capture market share. We found this as a good market for talent and made some key industry hires in the third quarter. Our business model has shown us its resilience and confirmed that our solutions are mission critical for clients, particularly during times of market stress. We launched many new enhancements in the quarter and added deeper, richer content in finance, insurance and real estate. Also, we reached an important milestone last week where we had our last VMS install, marking the end of project Next Gen. For those of you that recall this project, it's been a large undertaking for our engineers over many years, and completing this project allows them to focus on some of the newer things we're doing, such as the shift to the public cloud. Let me talk a little bit about ASV and the geographic breakdown this quarter. Turning to results, I'm pleased with our performance for the quarter. We executed well on our pipeline, and we were effective at managing costs. While we remain cautious given the uncertainty in the markets and economy, we remain on track to meet our revised ASV guidance for fiscal 2020, which we have narrowed to $60 million to $75 million. This quarter, our organic ASV plus professional services grew 5%. Our Americas region had a solid quarter with 5% growth benefiting from a healthy pipeline built earlier in the year. Asia Pacific, rebounded with strong growth of 9%, and saw an acceleration in new business and the easing of pandemic-related restrictions in key markets. And our EMEA region, which grew at 4% benefited from an uptick in demand for CTS and the international price increase. ASV growth in our third quarter was largely driven by wealth and research. We continue to expand our wealth pipeline and add wins this year, despite facing some delays due to the pandemic. Research grew, thanks to healthy demand from investments and asset management clients, especially in the America's region, as well as our international price increase and improved client retention. Our deep sector strategy continues to have a positive impact on both retention and our ability to expand our client base beyond the traditional investment space, particularly with corporate clients. Content and technology solutions also performed well, driven by continued strong demand for premium and core data feeds, and a strategic win with GPIF, Japan's largest pension investment fund. Analytics had a slightly weaker quarter, primarily due to some large deals being pushed out to the fourth quarter, but it's been a solid contributor to-date and has a healthy pipeline, especially across performance reporting and fixed income. Additionally, we delivered strong results in our adjusted operating margin, and EPS, seeing some cost benefits related to the pandemic. And Helen will walk you through these in a few minutes. In summary, we're executing well and remain confident in our ability to finish fiscal 2020 on a strong note. At the same time, we're aware that the uncertainty surrounding the corona virus pandemic makes it more difficult to predict the longer-term impact on our pipeline. We're excited about the pace of innovation at FactSet in our industry, and believe we are well-positioned to meet the needs of the virtual workforce. And we are pleased with the high levels of engagement and productivity we have seen throughout the quarter. As the world around us changes seemingly daily, I'm proud to say that we are still closing deals, bringing on new clients and finding new ways to collaborate. Before I turn the call over to Helen, I want to take a moment to talk about the four changes we announced yesterday. I particularly want to thank Phil Hadley, who has decided to retire from our Board and to welcome Robin Abrams as incoming chair. Many of you know, Phil, who was FactSet's CEO for 15 years and served as our Board Chair for 20 years. I want to thank him both personally and on behalf of the entire FactSet community for his visionary leadership and profound contributions to FactSet success. Additionally, I'd like to thank Scott Billeadeau, who's going to be with us until the end of the calendar year for his years of client perspective, as well as steering the audit committee. And we also look forward to working with Siew Kai Choy and Lee Shavel, who both bring a breadth of experience to our Board. You'll now hear from Helen, who will take you through more details for our third quarter. Helen Shan : Thank you, Phil, and hello, everyone. I'm happy to be speaking with you today and hope you and your loved ones remain safe and well. I want to reiterate, Phil's appreciation to the FactSet team. Our colleagues continue to show their strength and resilience in partnering with clients and with each other, the positive outcome is reflected in our results. We entered the third quarter with solid pipeline. And for second quarter in a row, we accelerated our growth rate in ASV and professional services. We experienced expansion in our operating margin and an increase in our EPS. Back in March, we had noted that the uncertainty of the environment could impact both the top and bottom line. In terms of our ability to generate new ASV and the potential to realize savings from lower discretionary costs, such as T&E. With discipline and execution, we secured new wins and use productivity benefits to help fund our investments in content and technology. I\u2019ll now walk us through the specifics of the third quarter. We increased ASV by $14 million or 5% year-over-year, reflecting solid growth through existing clients with continued strong retention and realization of cross sell opportunities. Our annual price increase outside the U.S. generated $7 million a $2 million increase over the prior year, affirming the value clients find in our suite of offering. GAAP and organic revenue increased by 3% to $374 million and $375 million, respectively. Growth was driven primarily by analytics, CTS and wealth. Please note that last year we had a onetime sale of data to a corporate client that positively impacted revenue for our third quarter of 2019, specifically in the America's region. Adjusting for this transaction, the revenue growth rate year-over-year would have been 4%. For geographic segment, America's revenue grew 2%, EMEA 3% and Asia Pacific was the highest at 7% year-over-year. The regions primarily benefited from the increases in analytics, wealth and CTS. GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter totaled $252 million, a 50% uptick over the previous year and in line with revenue growth. Our GAAP operating margin increased 30 basis points to 32.5%. Adjusted operating margin improved by a 150 basis points to 35.5% versus last year. These results also reflect the positive impact of 40 basis points due to favorable foreign exchange rate. Expenses for the quarter include investments in technology and in new talent capabilities, offset by net savings and productivity from workforce mix and a reduction in discretionary expenses. The result is an improved operating margin. As a percentage of revenue, our cost of sales was 70 basis points higher than last year on a GAAP basis. On an adjusted basis the cost of sales was essentially flat. Increased costs was driven by technology spend, which includes our shift to the public cloud as part of our three year investment plan. This total was partially offset by lower compensation costs driven by more concentrated hiring and low cost locations. Lower SG&A expenses are largely responsible for the increase in operating margin. When expressed as a percentage of revenue, SG&A decreased a 100 basis points over the prior year period on a GAAP basis. On an adjusted basis, SG&A expenses decreased by a 140 basis points year-over-year. The drivers include materially reduced travel and entertainment costs as well as office related spend. Both reflect the current working environment given closed offices and limited need for travel. We would expect a portion of this spend to resume once we\u2019re able to return to the office and operate in a post-pandemic environment. Moving on, our tax rate for the quarter was 15% compared to last year's 19%. This improvement is mainly due to the timing of an income tax expense in the third quarter of 2019, related to finalizing the company's tax returns. There was no similar event for this quarter. GAAP EPS increased 11% to $2.63 this quarter versus $2.37 in the prior year, and adjusted diluted EPS grew 9% to $2.86. Both were driven by higher operating results and lower interest expense, and GAAP EPS was further boosted by the lower tax rate. A reconciliation of our adjustments to GAAP EPS is disclosed at the end of our press release. Free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations plus capital spending was a $140 million for the quarter, a decrease of 6% over the same period last year. This reduction is primarily due to the timing of certain international tax payments. On a year-to-year basis, free cash flow grew by 4% despite higher capital expenditures on facilities. With the third quarter, our ASV retention continued to be above 95%. We grew the total number of clients by 1% compared to our prior year, reflecting the addition of wealth and corporate clients. Our client retention rate held steady at 89%, demonstrating the value of our offerings to clients, even and perhaps especially during these challenging times. For the third quarter, we bought back 47,000 shares for a total of $12 million, at an average price of $266. We remain disciplined in our buyback program and the amount repurchased, in part reflects the high performance of our share price this past quarter. Year-to-date, we've repurchased $173 million of our shares. Additionally, over the last 12 months, we've returned over $343 million to our investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We recently increased our dividend by 7% to $0.77, marking our 15th consecutive year of dividend increases. We remain committed to returning long-term value to our shareholders. Turning now to our outlook, for the remainder of our fiscal year. As Phil mentioned, our performance over the past few months reflects the resiliency and strength of FactSet\u2019s business model and the mission critical value of our content. Moreover, our recurring cash flows and strong balance sheet provides stability during times of market volatility. We continue to believe these attributes will allow us to succeed through further challenges and emerge stronger when the economy eventually recovers. Given our solid third quarter performance, we believe we were able to address some of the factors we discussed on our last earnings call. However, we remained cautious for our fourth quarter. First, we had noted that there might be delays in decision making which could cause longer sales cycle. We've seen examples of trials taking more time and disruption in the internal approvals process, especially with larger clients. A number of Q3 deals moved into Q4, but in line with the previous year. Similarly, this same dynamic resulted in benefit as we experienced lower cancelation versus the prior year, hence our retention rate remained high. Second, we\u2019ve cited the potential of delays and implementations due to restrictions on being able to work on-site. While we have some clients who are unable to accommodate our virtual implementation, these deals to-date have not impacted our topline in a meaningful way. And third, we had highlighted the uncertainty around seasonal hiring at the investment banks over the summer months. ASV from our banking business is primarily comprised of large investment banks with midsize and boutique firms making up a smaller percentage. To-date, over half of these large banking clients have confirmed their new class hiring members, which are in line or better than 2019. Consistent with the past, many of these decisions are confirmed by mid-August. While we are encouraged by the results thus far, we will likely not have a final view until the end of the summer. So a risk of smaller classes or hiring delays, remain. As many of you know, the fourth quarter is typically our largest. With what we know today, we remain guardedly confident in our ability to execute against our pipeline and moderate our spend. Based on these factors, we are bringing up the bottom end of our ASV guidance, the range for our full year is now expected to be $60 million to $75 million. Given how we've performed to-date and our control of and visibility into the investment and operating spends in the fourth quarter, we are increasing our guidance range for other key metrics, such as GAAP and adjusted operating margin, and GAAP and adjusted EPS. We are lowering the guidance range for our annual effective tax rate, these revisions are noted on Slide 14. In closing, I want to reiterate our conviction and our business model operating plan and investment strategy. The company's liquidity position remains strong with low leverage and ample cash flow. Our workforce mix continues to generate productivity, as we meet the hiring needs of both the core business and investment plan. Our spend in digital offerings and on our own infrastructure has served us well while operating in this pandemic environment. The current situation is generating unplanned savings, but we believe that a more normalized level of activity will return in the future. In the meantime, we will continue to focus on execution and on generating long-term value for all of our stakeholders. With that, we're now ready for your questions. Jimmy? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Toni Kaplan : Thanks very much for taking my question. I just wanted to make sure I understand the expense guidance changes clearly. Is it that you're benefiting from lower T&E? Is it the productivity that you mentioned? Just trying to get a sense of maybe a breakdown of the pieces that are contributing to the better margins that you're expecting for this year? Thanks. Helen Shan : Sure. Thanks Toni, for your question. So I would look at three different areas, when we think about what's driving the expense reduction or really margin expansion. So the first are expenses that are pandemic-related items. So T&E, office-related, even U.S. medical costs, which were actually lower as many folks stopped going to the normal doctor or medical activity, so we actually saw a savings on that as well. Then the second bucket I would call, operational discipline. So that's, our ability to manage third party content and professional fees, in some cases reducing, and other cases it's more of managing from a timing perspective and the workforce mix, which we've talked about before Toni. As you know, and that has continued to play out where we have, for example, we've hired 7% more in our workforce, but we've actually had 2% higher as a mix of low cost versus high costs. And then the last bucket I would say our investments, where we were also adjusting both by using our own employees for some of the needs that we have, and then also hiring in low cost. So tighter management around third party cost is really important. The three areas I would say are pandemic-related, operational discipline and spending investments of which the pandemic piece is largely, I would say, nearly 60 to -- two-thirds of the benefit that we're seeing in the quarter. Toni Kaplan : That's very helpful. And Phil, you mentioned the changes in the industry, basically accelerating the technology changes, given the COVID period. And I know that your investment plan has been sort of a multiyear period where you're investing in content and technology. And just wondering if anything from this period has changed? Where you're planning on spending within the investment plan? Maybe change the weightings or change towards different products, or just anything sort of structural in terms of industry changes, changing the way that you're attacking it? Thank you. Phil Snow : Yes. Thanks, Toni. So I'd say the biggest change and I think that we're really focused on is how our clients are going to be working in the future. So, we quickly sent out a survey to our clients when they were working from home to sort of understand how their lives were changing, and try to predict how they may change in the future. So, obviously the plan is very heavily weighted to move into the public cloud, opening up the tech stack and creating a more personalized experience that nothing's going to really change in terms of big buckets. But we do see a great opportunity to streamline workflows that are going to become more digital for our clients, around collaboration tools. We've all been in the industry for a long time, so we sort of know which of our workflows is still pretty manual, right, where there's a lot of people putting together pitch books or models or what have you. And I do think that now, people have been surprised. I mean, I've been surprised by how quickly we were able to adapt and that's what I hear from my clients. So I do think it's sort of really giving people an opportunity to think more boldly. And I just feel like we're in a really great position to kind of meet those needs for our clients. Toni Kaplan : Terrific. Thank you. Phil Snow : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is now open. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. Good morning, guys. You guys talked about the unplanned cost savings, the benefits I guess from COVID and kind of a follow-up to the last question. So we talked about this a little before. But do you think there's a case to be made that maybe you can take some of the savings and accelerate and maybe even spend more in terms of your three year roll plan just since the whole world seems to be digitizing so fast as well? Phil Snow : Well, we certainly are taking a look at what we've learned over the last year and new things that we'd be interested in doing. So we do that every year. We've been through that process in the last quarter. So we're looking at what we chose to do. That's solid, we're going to continue to invest in everything we said we were going to. But we do see some potentially new opportunities for us as well. So, I do think there's an opportunity to do more. And I do think there's an opportunity again, for us to look at not just the cost savings that we've kind of seen in the last quarter, but just look at how we're working as a company and how we may have been inefficient in terms of how we're servicing clients and doing other things. But, it's a much longer process to figure that out. But we're really actively looking at that and seeing what it might mean for us in the future. So, net-net, I'm very excited in terms of what the potential is for the company. Manav Patnaik : Got it. Helen Shan : And Manav, I think one thing, just to keep in mind, I mean cost like U.S. medical is still a little bit, TBD as we go into the quarter, and all this play into next year. And also some of the costs that we are getting the benefit in this year, or this quarter rather is little bit timing related. But for sure, we're all looking to see how we can best leverage that into -- as Phil mentioned into the existing investments, if not, new ones as well. Manav Patnaik : Got it. And I was going to ask Helen, like in terms of your comment and we do expect the business to be back to some normalcy from the cost perspective and so forth. I was hoping perhaps you could maybe use Asian as an example and maybe tell us what you're seeing there, in terms of the recovery and so forth? Helen Shan : Yes. I mean, as we think about our thinking as we go forward, I really look at it in kind of two different buckets in terms of the assumptions. So one is operational costs, how do we see going out of Q3. We talked about the fact that we have seen a good market for hiring new talent. You'll see that we increased our total headcount for over 10,000 employees now, I think it's the highest we\u2019ve been. So that's a 7% increase in hiring. So we were able to do a lot of that. We continue to invest as we discussed. And so I see some of that picking up and therefore driving higher costs going forward from a people perspective. I think I just mentioned there are some costs as it relates to things that we held back in Q3. 90 days ago, we weren't sure where the world was going to be, so we wanted to also be quite cautious. And some of that now we're showing better having experienced what we had in Q3, so we're seeing that come through. And we'll look to spend that in Q4 and some of that maybe even into the following year. As it relates to pandemic-related savings, we also have costs that we see come through. So those would be related to business continuity, equipment, internet, things that we need to make sure that our workforce is properly ready to work remotely, consistently. We have some office re-openings. It's a little bit unclear yet how we'll deal with that. And then medical costs, I would expect would come back as folks are now becoming more comfortable and now that we\u2019re re-opening. So I would look at that Manav as we think about go forward rate. Manav Patnaik : All right. Thank you, guys. Helen Shan : Welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Bill Warmington : Good morning, everyone. Helen Shan : Good morning. Bill Warmington : So, congratulations on the GPIF of Japan win. I was hoping you guys could give us some additional details on that. What were they using previously? Was it an RFP with multiple competitors? And then when does the new contract start? Phil Snow : Hey Bill, it\u2019s Phil. So, we typically don't give sort of that level of detail around the clients wins. We did have a press release around this, which I think is why we\u2019re mentioning it. But what I would point to I think more is just the opportunity that exists with FactSet for asset owners. So we do very well with sovereign wealth funds with plan sponsors. We've got good momentum with insurance companies. And when you think about our analytics suite and its really geared I think for the asset owner and asset manager of the future in terms of what we're able to do. I think that just is a good area for FactSet to grow in the future. That specific win was more CTS-related, so they are taking I think a good amount of our content essentially to build out some of their own analytics. So I think that also speaks to our platform assets and our ability to deliver content in new and interesting ways. Bill Warmington : And in your prepared remarks, you highlighted strengthening corporate clients as being one area. I wanted to ask about the new corporate clients. Is it being driven by new corporate clients or existing corporate clients buying more products? And are you displacing existing vendors or these first time users, if you will? Phil Snow : So, a lot of our new client win, I think we would net 55 new clients for the quarter. Many of those came from corporates and a good amount of them came from wealth advisors as well. So, we\u2019re closing a lot of new names. Typically, these aren't huge deals but they really add up when you put them together. And what we're selling traditionally is mostly into Investor Relations groups and Business Development groups. But as we build out our deep sector content, we started with financials, insurance and we\u2019re beginning to get into real estate, I do think there is an opportunity to sell more to the existing clients and to uncork some corporate clients in industries that traditionally FactSet may not have been as heavily weighted toward. So, we typically do very well in the sectors and industries that are very data and analytics driven and regulatory driven, as you can imagine. But I do think over time, I see a lot of opportunity, particularly as we open up a platform to do more for clients that are not necessarily on the buy side of the this offering. Bill Warmington : Great. Thank you very much for the insights. Phil Snow : Yes. Thanks, Bill. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is now open. Alex Kramm : Good morning, everyone. Could you just come back and flush out the pipeline and guidance comments for the 4Q a little bit? In particular, as it relates to some of the banking comments you made. You made it sounds like you have a very strong I guess visibility here. Is that based on talking to all these different banks and really having almost 95%-100% certainty what they\u2019re going to do? Or where is that coming from because you\u2019re obviously reading some of the headlines, like new hires are getting delayed, they\u2019re getting few thousand dollars to sit on the beach for two extra months. So just wondering where that level of confidence is coming from in particular? Thank you. Phil Snow : Yes. Thanks Alex. So, I think we typically don't get a final answer from the majority until August. Early indicate -- I think we've spoken to about half the banks so far and early indications are that they'll still be hiring that classes. Maybe it will get pushed out into Q1, as you mentioned. But when we're looking at our pipeline for Q4, it's pretty heavily weighted towards analytics and CTS, which shows that more of our platform offerings and less heavily weighted towards the people like the piece of the business that\u2019s very much workstation driven. So, we've got a good pipeline for Q4, and we certainly have enough in there to support the range that we narrowed this morning in our comments. Alex Kramm : Okay. No, very good. Thank you. And then, secondly, I guess this is for Helen. I may have asked this before and maybe a little bit of a too detailed question, but like when you look at your adjustments to your numbers these days, obviously some of those adjustments have been getting bigger and bigger. I think it was like $5.5 million this quarter for, I guess, one-time ish items. But when you look at the footnote, it's kind of related to some of these investments spent that you're doing. So can you just flush out what you think is reasonable to back out some of that stuff? Because quite frankly, if you're backing out a lot of these investments, then you may as well invest more, if it doesn't come towards EPS, if you know what I mean? So, yes, please just help us, why that's the reasonable in your opinion? Helen Shan : Sure. I don\u2019t comment maybe a little bit broadly in any detailed questions, you can obviously get that from Rima directly. So there's a couple of different things that fall into that. Now some, as you know, there's a number in there that is, I would say most of it is not necessarily investment new part of our three year plan. A lot of that is more infrastructure related, so things that we're doing, whether it's on a workday or things that are more I'll call it, corporate infrastructure focused so those were one-time. We also have in there double rent that we have as we've been building out facilities. So some of our facilities, we've got both our existing building and we already have a lease on another one. So that's not really part of the ongoing, so we call that out as well. So that gives you a little bit of what's in there. They're not really directly related to the three year plan. Alex Kramm : Okay. Thanks again. Helen Shan : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Hamzah Mazari : Good morning. Thank you. I just had a question around the wealth business. Could you remind us, what your market share is this, or what your market share is there? Specifically, if you can\u2019t talk about market share, maybe you could talk about how down market in wealth you could go? So we all sort of know of a few large firms, right, that have armies of financial advisors. But just curious in terms of thinking about the wealth segment, how far down market can FactSet go? Phil Snow : Yes. Hey Hamza, its Phil. Thanks for the question. So our wealth segment is around 10% of FactSet in terms of its size. And I do think, we've got a ton of total addressable market that we can look at. The very high end of the market, I think we're suitable for the ultra-high net workflow. You mentioned sort of the armies of financial advisors out there, so obviously we had a big win a couple of years ago that we're very proud of and doing well with. And it's uncorked a lot of opportunities for us. We had a significant wealth win this quarter, so it was a building on an existing relationship, but we really had sort of a good size win, displacing a major competitor at a large firm. And we have a digital business, which really can get to tremendous amounts of users, that are sort of retail users of a bank essentially. So, we've got a full gamut of stuff, I think, particularly for the market data and news segment of the workflow. I think now we're getting to the point where the product can really begin to leverage our analytics suite, where those two can come together when we can begin to do more for existing clients in the risk oversight area and some other areas. So we're really optimistic about our ability to capture more market share and wealth. And as I mentioned just previously, we closed a lot of smaller family offices and wealth advisors each quarter, and we did the same thing in Q3 of this year. Hamzah Mazari : That's very helpful. Just a follow-up question, I'll turn it over. It seems like the EU and U.S. regulators are scrutinizing, exchanges buying data businesses quite a bit. And so, we're wondering if that creates an opportunity for you. And what we mean by that is, a number of years ago you did quite a bit of M&A, and then you focused on integration. Now, you're sort of focused on this three year organic growth investment plan. And just curious can you still be opportunistic on M&A while continuing to execute on that investment plan? Or is M&A kind of off the table because you have a lot going on internally? Phil Snow : Yes. We continue to look at things that are opportunistic. So absolutely, I think we've obviously got the balance sheet to support that. We've done a lot of work to integrate the software companies that we acquired. But we do think there's some good opportunity out there for some smaller data sets or providers that could really support what we talked about, right, in terms of the areas of the market that we're interested in. So, we're actively looking at things like we always are. Obviously, evaluations were pretty high over the years and talking to banks. I think deals are starting to get done again, obviously, it was kind of a frozen period. But I do believe that the ice is thawing a little bit and we're going to begin to see some deals in our space. Hamzah Mazari : Great. Thank you so much. Phil Snow : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is now open. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, thank you very much for taking my questions. So, Phil, can you talk a little bit about the company's ability to sell in the current environment? It sounds like you guys are doing pretty well. How much of it is the same way that you guys are benefiting from retention? So there's stuff not falling out of the funnel? And how much of it is that you're actually really doing a good job selling, which is fairly impressive in this kind of work at home environment? Phil Snow : It's a good mix Shlomo. So we've been able to close some new names. We did well in new business in Asia, which as I spoke about on the last earnings call. I thought it would be kind of the first region to come back from that standpoint. But talking to our leader of our European business, she's telling me that we're beginning to see some good opportunities over there on the new business side. We have been really effective at closing what was in our pipeline for Q3, so that when we spoke three months ago. And I think part of what Helen and I were thinking about was would it really delay clients decisions to buy things? We've seen some of that. How well would we be able to implement things virtually? We are very capable of doing that. In some cases, our clients I think we're having difficulty engaging with us. But, net-net, I think again, we were positively surprised and how we were able to do things more remotely than typically FactSet has done in the past. So, I think that's very promising in terms of how we think about selling and supporting clients in the future. And yes, there have been a few cases of clients that were planning on transitioning potentially to other solutions. And those decisions have been delayed, which has helped us on the other side as well. But again, net-net, it's been very positive. I mean, I'm sure it's not lost on you that this is the best third quarter that FactSet has had since 2016. And I think to execute in this environment and produce those results is something we're very proud of. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, great. One other question, just on the tech investment. Are there any milestones that you could talk about in the earlier signs of success that you could talk to? Just as we talk about the investment and the potential for you to accelerate the spend, maybe you could talk about some of the things that maybe early innings you've been able to accomplish? Phil Snow : Yes. So we've opened up a lot of APIs. I believe we're up to about 40 that we've put into our developer portal. So clients are able to now come in and program directly against FactSet. They were able to do that in some cases before. And they're not analytics with area, we've seen a good adoption of API. So we began to sell the APIs for analytics. A little over a year ago we had some initial success last year, but it's really begun. It's a small number now, but it's beginning to grow pretty quickly. And I think we're learning as we go as well. So that's one that I would point to. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, great. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is now open. Andrew Nicholas : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. It looks like ASV growth reaccelerated a bit in APAC in the quarter, which is obviously encouraging. I was just wondering if there's anything you can take away from that, that uptick, whether it be in terms of sales cycles, pipeline conversion, implementation timelines? And then apply that to how you're thinking about the same dynamics in the U.S. or EMEA over the next couple of quarters? Phil Snow : Sure. I would say it was just a very good mix in Asia PAC, and I think we saw good growth in Japan. We saw good growth in Hong Kong and North Asia. And we saw good growth in Singapore. So I think the team executed well across the whole region. As we just pointed out, we had some good wins on the new business side. So, I think we've begun to go back to the office in Hong Kong. So that's the first office, I think that we've begun to have employees return to. So it looks like clients are really engaged over there. And as we've spoken about before, we view Asia as it's our fastest growing region, one that has a ton of opportunity for it and where the trends are really in our favor. So, we're really optimistic about what we're able to do there across all geographies and all of our business lines. Andrew Nicholas : Got it. And then one more would just be on on-site implementations. I know that was kind of a headwind you called out last quarter. Just curious if there's been any improvement in that capability, whether it be FactSet's capability or client's ability to handle off-site implementations? And kind of how that's evolved over the past couple months? Phil Snow : Yes, it's been really positive. I think as I just pointed out with the previous question, that we've been able to do, almost everything we need to do from an implementation standpoint virtually. And our clients are learning how to do that as well. And that's clearly one of the benefits of going to the cloud, if everyone's up there, I think it just makes it easier for all of us to work together. And if you have APIs and components that sort of plug in very easily with other people's systems and ecosystems, that it makes the whole thing much faster. It really just catches the sales cycle and the implementation scheme versus kind of the heavy lift where it's more custom and you have to be on-site. Andrew Nicholas : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Chu with Bank of America. Your line is now open. David Chu : All right. Thank you. So can you just highlight the cadence of ASV growth over the course of the quarter? Just wanted to see if things were quite slow and like let's say mid-March, early April and things picked up quite significantly since then? Phil Snow : I don't think there's anything different David honestly, from previous quarters. So, we had a healthy pipeline going into the quarter. And from what I saw, we were closing things at kind of the same rates that we did in previous years. Like any sales team, right, you're going to have that mad push at the end of the quarter or the end of the year. So, our Q4 is always our biggest quarter. And typically in a quarter people are very anxious to sort of get things in. And one thing that we've done, which has really helped is we've got clearer compensation model for our sales team. And they are really incented to bring things in earlier if they can and they're getting paid on a more frequent basis, just based on transparent compensation models than they had in the past. So, I think some of what we're seeing here is just some of the discipline that we've put into the sales force over the last years, and all the great work that's been done there. David Chu : Got it. Thanks. And then in the past, if we look at like past recessions revenue growth slowed more sharply at the tailwind, or as the economy was coming out of the downturn. Just wanted to get your thoughts around timing. Do you feel like we've seen the worst in terms of the revenue impact? Or is that something maybe still to come based on just the subscription nature of your business? Phil Snow : Well, I think it's very hard for all of us to predict. So I do think that this, if you want to call it a downturn it's different than what we experienced in '08 and '09. But I think all of us, as we look out over the next 12 months, it's very hard to predict what's going to happen in the world from a lot of different dimensions and what the impacts are going to be on economies, the markets, and then us. But I'll just go back to is, we're a resilient company, we've just shown that. And no matter what the environment, we're going to I believe execute well against it. But in terms of talking about whether or not we've seen the worst of it, I don't think any of us can say that with any certainty right now. David Chu : Sure. That's fair. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Heckmann with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open. Peter Heckmann : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So about $19 million of ASV growth year-to-date coming from price increases. Can you talk about how that compares to last year? And kind of your thoughts on the sustainability of that as you build out more depth and breadth of the content sets and then go back and try and true up pricing. How much fight are you getting on those front lines? Helen Shan : Sure. I'll try to address that. Thank you for your question. So as you recall, last quarter when we talked about the Americas, we got an improvement of $2 million year-on-year, and so the international was the same. So that gives you a sense of the improvement this year versus last year, so $4 million. But I think what we see, I mean, we are in a competitive environment, so that's always the case. But we have put in a lot of enhancements and value into products and the offerings, and I think that's really coming through. So what we're seeing in this year and we have also natural price increases in our contracts already. Is that continued recognition by clients that the value that we're bringing in is worth the additional amount. Now that being said, we have to continually invest in to be able to do that. And I think the three year plan is certainly meant to help that along, not only with new products, but really enhancing our existing and to maintain if not increase our retention rate with our existing clients. Peter Heckmann : Yes. Okay. That makes sense. And then I didn't hear you refer to it, but just in terms of you talked in prior calls the outlook for 2022, the ability to -- or the aspirational goal of hitting high single digit ASV growth. Can you give us an update about how you're thinking about that number? You think that's still achievable within 18 months? Helen Shan : Yes, I'll take the first shot there. We are working hard to make sure we can get the next three months correct. So I wouldn't say there's a lot of variables right now. Our plan hasn't changed, we still see in terms of our belief of what the investments will bring in the upside, I think we'll have more, we're going through all that right now, as you can imagine, in our own budgeting process, but also in thinking through how our investments were fair. So, I think we'll come back to talk more about that. Right now, we don't have any change in our view, but gosh, there's a lot that can happen and we're doing work on that right now. Peter Heckmann : Got it. Thank you. Helen Shan : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks for taking my question. So maybe just a quick clarification, you raised the lower end of the ASV guidance or took down the revenue guidance for the year. I was just wondering if you could provide some color there what's causing that. Is it just the timing of when the revenue gets recognized? And then just a quick one on wealth front, you mentioned a significant win there. I was just wondering if we can think about the sizing for that significant win compared to your prior win. And when do we when will that get implemented and revenue gets recognized? Thanks. Phil Snow : Okay. Thanks, Ashish. Yes, so I think, in March, I think all of us were really wondering what was going to be happening, right, in terms of what was going on in the world around us. We mentioned we had a very strong pipeline. And it just wasn't clear to us sort of how clients were going to react and really what was going to happen in the markets, if you remember, sort of how volatile things will back then. So, we came up with a methodology which we thought was good to, at least be conservative in terms of what can be achieved. But we've learned a lot over the last quarter. And as I mentioned, we were effectively able to execute on the pipeline that we had in Q3. And I still feel good about our pipeline for Q4. So that's why, we just feel like we can raise the bottom end of that guidance up to $60 million to give you a narrower range as we look out for the quarter. The other wealth win was at an existing client, I think we were all -- where we have a pretty good deployment. And I believe that much of that has already been deployed, and that we're recognizing the ASV for that and the revenue in Q3. So it's not the same scale as the deal that we talked about two years ago, but it's a significant seven figure win at an important point for us. Helen Shan : And let me just pipe in a little bit as it relates to the revenue. So the good news is we've gotten from this quarter Ashish, some better confidence. So that's a real positive because of some of the unknowns, as we've already talked about. Do keep in mind, in a subscription business, it really does matter when the ASV comes in. And so as you know, the first one quarter for us was softer than we had hoped. And so that it does carry through. And depending on what happened on the back-half of the year, without the pandemic, the dollars might have been a little bit different. And so we believe how revenue was going to come out. But knowing, a, that we had a weaker Q1, that it's really coming through a bit from a revenue perspective as we look at the full year. Ashish Sabadra : That's very helpful. And maybe, Helen, if I can ask a follow-up question on the margin trend. Particularly around your low cost location or employees in the low cost location, what percentage of our employees are currently in low cost location? And where do you think it can go over the mid-term? And then what does it mean for the margins, because you've given that margin goal for fiscal year 2022, given you're tracking much ahead of it? Is there -- as you transition to lower cost destination does that -- could that provide upside to the mid-term margin target? Thanks. Helen Shan : Yes. No, we've continued to migrate, we look at high cost low cost. And as I mentioned, there was about 2% improvement in this quarter. That's been pretty consistent. So right now, we're roughly around, let's call it two-thirds offshore one-third onshore. We did actually hire more onshore, it's actually growth. And that would have been I think the first in a couple of quarters due to the capabilities that we're trying to build. And in some cases that can really be found more in the developed markets. So that's where you see that come through. And that was anticipated. The opposite of that or the balance to that, as I mentioned, is that some of the roles that we saw from our investment plan that we could fill that we thought would either need to be new hires undeveloped countries, we were able to either sell with own folks, or quite frankly, with folks in the lower cost countries. Going forward, I mean, that's still going to be a driver for us on productivity with or without investments was a focus. And we saw that from FY '19 through now. And that's certainly part of our thinking, as we were thinking about the margin that we come out in FY '22 already. Ashish Sabadra : That's very helpful. Thank you. Thanks on a good quarter and congrats on a good quarter. Helen Shan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. George Tong : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to dive a bit deeper into the ASV growth outlook. You indicated that the pipeline was healthy in the quarter and that win rates have been relatively consistent. Can you talk about how ASV growth could evolve over the next 12 months, given the high visibility there based on what you're seeing in the pipeline? Phil Snow : Well, I think I've been consistent George, in saying that it's a little difficult to see more than six months out with a huge degree of confidence. So, I think we're comfortable talking about Q4 and the fact that we've definitely got the pipeline to support the range that we provided. And Q1, just bear in mind, is typically a smaller quarter for us. So I think in terms of talking about next year, we may be able to give you some more visibility on that next quarter, but it's a little difficult to predict typically and I think given the current environment, it\u2019s even more difficult to predict. George Tong : Okay got it. And then, if we dive into some of the components of ASV, specifically just bifurcating renewal rate performance versus new business trends, can you comment on both of those and how they've progressed within the quarter? Phil Snow : Yes. I think, we\u2019ve seen -- go ahead, Helen. Helen Shan : I think what we\u2019re seeing in retention is I'm sorry for that, in retention is that we\u2019ve continued to see that as we -- talked about above 95% that\u2019s continue to be strong for the reasons that we've already outlined, as the decisions can be somewhat delayed, but then we get the benefit of that as well. And new business I think has remained steady, so if we look over the course of the last couple of quarters that contribution from new business has been around the same level, which is around that two plus percent of our total growth comes from new business. Sorry Phil, didn\u2019t mean to interrupt. Phil Snow : No worries. George Tong : Got it. Thank you, very helpful. Operator : Thank you. And the last question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. Keith Housum : Good morning, everybody. Phil, over the past few weeks you guys experienced another change at the sales level, the directors level. I think this is another change or probably a third change over the past several years. Any reason for the change, any reason for a change in the strategy there? How should we be thinking about that? Phil Snow : So, I\u2019ll refer you back to the 8-K there, so we don't typically comment beyond that in terms of changes in leadership. But what I will say is the sales team that's been executing exceptionally well. When I look at the four leaders, the Americas, the EMEA, the Asia Pac region and our strategic client group, between them, they all have over 60 years of experience in total. So we've got a very deep bench and they\u2019re all executing at a very high level. And we've put in a tremendous amount of discipline in the sales force over the last number of years in terms of pipeline management, pricing, how we compensate folks. So, I'm really pleased with how the sales force is executing and the talent we have in the team. And I'm confident in their ability to execute as we move forward. I'm not planning any changes in the organization right in terms of how things are structured, I think it's working really well and it's working well with the specialty sales teams that are organized the way they are. So, we're looking for a new leader there and in the meantime the sales leaders reporting to me. And I'm heavily engaged with the clients, so I feel really good about the team that we have on sales side. Keith Housum : Got you. I appreciate it. And as a follow-up, you guys are well-known for having a great servicing group of consultants, young kids out of college. And obviously now they're not traveling or servicing the customers and that\u2019s obviously an inefficient role of travel. Are we thinking that perhaps those consultants are lesser in number today than they were several months ago? And as you guys travel more you'll need to hire more or were you guys able to I guess redefine what their roles were and working more from home as opposed to travelling? Phil Snow : Yes, I think it's been an evolution with that role. I mean, I was one of those consultants once upon a time. And I checked in with one of them who -- she's been with us for a year. And I asked her what life was like working at home, so she said at that point where is becoming dangerous in terms of how much FactSet she knows. And she told me that it's been a great experience and working with clients and being able to train clients and even finding that it's even easier sometimes to engage with people over video that it might be like in a room full of people. So it's giving us a lot to think about in terms of how we support clients in the future, but I do think there's a way for us to continue to involve what is an industry leading service model for our clients, and just continue that great tradition for FactSet. So, thank you for the question. Keith Housum : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Phil Snow, CEO for any closing remark. Phil Snow : Okay. Thank you. So, I'd like to thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased with our accomplishments year-to-date and our ability to pivot around the challenges and rally to be there for each other in times of need. It's undeniably been a challenging few months for us all. And as we reflect on this past quarter it's impossible not to think of the broader events that have occurred. I want to take a moment to address that here particularly the Black Lives Matter protest. At FactSet, there\u2019s no place for racism or discrimination of any kind. And I want to extend a special thank you to the members of our black business resource group for sharing and organizing insightful conversations over the past year, including Let\u2019s Talk about Race and The Recognition of [June theme]. I remain committed to supporting our black colleagues and clients and to listen and learn, and I'm also committed to our overall diversity and inclusion initiatives. We had a focused D&I strategy and effort in place since 2016 and we've come a long way cultivating a more inclusive environment. I'm proud of what we've accomplished with the launch of our business resource groups, unconscious bias training, leadership commitments and increased investments in our retention and advancement programs for diverse leaders. And we\u2019re now stepping into the next phase of our strategy and the company plans to significantly expand our investments in diversity and inclusion efforts, with a focus on examining the processes by which we attract, recruit, support and promote our people to ensure we\u2019re eliminating any and all bias and to make progress. We\u2019ll continue to increase diversity at all levels of the organization and we\u2019ll do our best to work to be an agent of change. With that, I'd like to thank everyone once more for your time. If you have additional questions, please call Rima Hyder, and we look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Operator, that ends today\u2019s call. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This does include your program and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce host of this conference call, Ms. Rima Hyder, Vice President of Investor Relation. You may begin. Rima Hyder : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FactSet's fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. We continue to be in various remote locations today. And if we have any audio quality issues, we certainly appreciate your patience, should we experience a disruption. Before we begin, I would like to point out that the slides we will reference during this presentation can be accessed via the website on the Investor Relations section of our website at factset.com. The slides will be posted on our website at the conclusion of this call. A replay of today's call will be available via phone and on our website. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions to investors. To be fair to everyone, please limit yourself to one, plus one follow-up. Before we discuss our results, I encourage all listeners to review the legal notice on slide 2, which explains the risks of forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the appendix to the presentation and in our earnings release issued earlier today. Joining me today are Phil Snow, Chief executive officer; and Helen Shan, Chief Financial Officer. I would now like to turn the discussion over to Phil Snow. Phil Snow : Thanks, Rima, and good morning and good afternoon, everyone. First, I hope everyone is healthy and continuing to do well. And when we started this fiscal year, none of us I think could have anticipated what we'd be faced with over the last six months. And I really couldn't be prouder of our team\u2019s performance and its resolve to be there for our clients as we all quickly adapted new ways of working. Our resilience and ability to execute over the last three months meant our client-facing teams armed with an expanding suite of products achieved the highest quarter of incremental ASV in our history. We finished our fiscal year having delivered 40 consecutive years of top-line growth and 24 years of adjusted EPS growth. I'm pleased with how our digital transformation efforts are supporting this growth and increasing our ability to build personalized solutions for our expanding client base. Earlier this year, we partnered with Forbes insights to survey 200 asset managers and asset owners from around the globe to better understand where they stood with their digital transformation programs and how they're leveraging next generation technologies. And according to the results, 75% of executives believe their firms need to invest more in technology initiatives and also 69% of executives believe that businesses are facing more competitive pressure than in the past as customers expect higher and more personalized levels of service. A successful digital strategy includes having a scalable cloud foundation, a modern data layer with best of breed content, streamlined processes, the use of cognitive computing and the personalized client experience. This is the journey we ourselves are on as an organization. It makes us stronger, and more importantly, will help our clients get to where they too are ongoing. We believe, we're making tremendous progress in our initiatives, and we were widely recognized by the industry in 2020 with numerous product awards for solutions across every aspect of our business, including best data providers of the buy and sell sides, and best buy side analytics tools from Waters Technology. This past year, we executed well against the first year of the investment plan we laid out back in September of 2019. On the technology front, we've made significant progress on our move to the public cloud, and we have announced plans to migrate our real-time ticker plant to Amazon Web Services. This migration will create the first global ticker plants of its kind in the cloud. We also opened up many more APIs, creating new ways for clients to ingest process and program against our data and analytics. We added more industries to our deep sector program, made progress on our private market strategy, and executed on our wealth investments, expanding coverage of our StreetAccount offering in both Asia-Pac and Canada. We remain committed to our multi-year investment plan for both content and technology, and believe continuing to invest now is the best long-term strategy. Turning to our results. We continued to execute well against our second half pipeline, resulting in a strong fourth quarter. Our ASV growth rate accelerated 45 basis points to over 5% and we maintain our margins as well as grew EPS for the quarter. Both the Americas and EMEA's growth rates accelerated with both regions seeing strong contributions from our largest institutional asset management clients. Private equity, venture capital and hedge fund clients also drove growth in the quarter, also in large part by our increasing private market content. Asia-Pac continues to be our fastest growing region, even though our business in the region saw a fair amount of challenges this year, due to the effects of the pandemic. We saw some bright spots in Australia and Singapore, particularly with sovereign wealth funds. And we believe we have good opportunities next year, as the recovery proceeds, especially with our premium products, such as reporting and trading solutions. Looking at this globally, I'm happy to say that all our businesses contributed to the fourth quarter growth. The greatest contributions year-on-year were from wealth and analytics. Analytics grew 7% and was the biggest contributor to overall ASV. This business saw strength in our performance reporting, fixed income and risk solutions, and we believe these products will continue to benefit us as we go into 2021. CTS, the second biggest contributor grew 13%, thanks to continuing demand for core data feeds. And we're confident that this business will maintain its high growth rate, as we head into 2021, especially as we develop new content and broaden our distribution channel. Wealth continued to execute well on its pipeline with a well-distributed number of wins across various client segments and sizes, resulting in a 9% growth rate. And research saw increased retention this year and benefited from our investments in our industry-specific or deep sector content. We're particularly pleased to see the growth of this business remain stable at 1%, with a well-balanced client base that includes asset managers, asset owners, sell-side research, corporates and portfolio managers. In summary, I'm pleased with our performance in fiscal '20 and proud of our team, which has executed well across all areas of our Company. Our business model combined with our strong liquidity and balance sheet position us well to continue to manage through uncertain markets. We believe, our focus on providing solutions aimed at our clients\u2019 own digital transformations and an unwavering commitment to expanding our library of smart, connected content is a winning strategy that is delivering results. As our survey shows, digital transformation efforts are an increasingly integral part of our clients\u2019 businesses, and FactSet is supporting its own growth by accelerating our clients\u2019 journeys through technology innovation. We also have a strong and experienced sales team focused on deepening client relationships and further diversifying our client basis -- our client base. For these reasons, we remain confident that the execution of our investment plan along with continued product innovation, open and flexible solutions, and retooling our workforce to adapt to a virtual environment will help us return to a higher growth rate over time. Having said that, we approach our 2021 guidance and future higher targeted growth with necessary caution. We do not yet know the full extent of the impact to our clients as it relates to the pandemic. And we acknowledge risks remain such as delays in completing complex deals and challenges in client retention as budgets tighten. We are therefore viewing the new fiscal year carefully with projected ASV plus professional services growth anticipated to be in the range of $55 million to $85 million. Helen will take you through the details of our 2021 guidance in a few moments. Just to wrap up, we enter fiscal 2021 with a sense of excitement. We're in a period of accelerated innovation within our industry, as clients look to differentiate themselves and be ever more efficient. There's a great opportunity for us to work in new ways and create new products to improve the experience of both our clients and FactSeters around the globe. You'll now hear from Helen, who will take you through the specifics of our fourth quarter and full year performance for 2020. Helen Shan : Thank you, Phil, and hello, everyone. I'm happy to be speaking with you today. And I hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. I want to echo Phil's sentiment on the strong performance by the FactSet team. Their efforts are clearly reflected in our full year results. Our financial results in 2020 proved the strength and resilience of our business model, the critical value of our content and the strength of our client relationships. At the start of the lockdown in March, our team quickly pivoted to focus on helping clients and ensure they were able to operate productively from remote locations. We were rewarded with continued loyalty as reflected in our client and ASV retention rates. Since the first quarter of 2020, we accelerated our growth rate in ASV plus professional services through solid execution of our second half pipeline, crossing over $1.5 billion mark and exceeding our most recent guidance for the year. Building upon our operational improvement in 2019, we continued greater productivity through workforce mix and disciplined expense management. We executed on our investment plan, adding needed talent and technology. Savings and costs related to the pandemic contributed to our results as we managed deliberately to keep our employees safe and productive, while working remotely. Our team's notable efforts led to an adjusted operating income improvement of 6% and adjusted operating margin expansion of 40 basis points to 33.6% and an adjusted EPS growth of 9% to $10.87, primarily driven by higher operating earnings and supported by a decrease in our tax rate. We are really pleased with our four year results, especially amid the unexpected challenges of the coronavirus pandemic. Let me now walk you through the specifics of our fourth quarter. As noted on the previous slide, we increased ASV by more than 5% year-over-year, reflecting strong retention across our client base and continued realization of cross-selling opportunities. Before I explain the quarterly results, please note that our fourth quarter GAAP results were impacted by a one-time non-cash charge, impairment of an investment in a third party of approximately $17 million. GAAP and organic revenue increased by 5% to $384 million and $383 million, respectively. Growth was driven primarily by analytics, CTS and wealth. For our geographic segments, Americas and Asia Pacific revenue each grew 6% and EMEA grew 5%. The regions primarily benefited from increases in analytics, wealth, and CTS. GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter totaled $285 million, a 13% uptick over the previous year, mainly impacted by the one-time charge. Our GAAP operating margin decreased 490 basis points to 26%. Without this charge, our margin would have largely been in line with last year at 30%. Adjusted operating margin decreased by 70 basis points to 33% versus last year. These results also reflect a positive impact of 34 basis points due to favorable foreign exchange rates. Aside from the one-time charge, GAAP expenses for the quarter include our planned investments in technology and in new talent and capabilities, and were offset by net savings from continued workforce mix, productivity and a reduction in discretionary expenses, mainly due to pandemic-related savings. As a percentage of revenue, our cost of sales was 180 basis points higher than last year on a GAAP basis. On an adjusted basis, our cost of sales was 260 basis points higher, driven by technology spend, which includes our shift to the public cloud, as well as our multiyear investment plan. This total was partially offset by lower data cost spend. Higher SG&A expenses are largely responsible for the decrease in our GAAP operating margin, as the investment impacted the SG&A and GAAP margins. When expressed as a percentage of revenue, SG&A increased 310 basis points over the prior year period on a GAAP basis. On an adjusted basis, the SG&A expenses decreased by 180 basis points year-over-year. The drivers include materially reduced travel and entertainment costs, as well as office-related spend due to office closures and restricted travel. As some of our offices have started to open, we expect a portion of the spend to resume. Moving on, our tax rate for the quarter was 7%, compared to last year, 16%. This unusually low tax rate was primarily due to higher exercises of stock options, resulting in a tax benefit. Excluding these exercises and one-time item, our tax rate would have been 18%. We have estimated and announced the stock option benefits in our tax rate guidance for fiscal 2021, but as you're seeing this year, timing and the amount of stock option exercises can cause large variances versus our estimate. GAAP EPS decreased 2% to $2.29 this quarter versus $2.34 in the prior year. Without the one-time charge, our GAAP EPS would have increased 16% to $2.71. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 10% to $2.88. Both EPS figures were primarily driven by the lower tax rate and improved operating results. A reconciliation of our adjustments to GAAP EPS is disclosed at the end of our press release. Free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending was $145 million for the quarter, an increase of 52% over the same period last year. This increase is primarily due to the timing of certain tax payments and lower CapEx on facility spend. On a full-year basis, free cash flow grew by 16%, despite higher capital expenditures on facilities. For the fourth quarter, our ASV retention continues to be above 95%. We grew the total number of clients by 5% compared to our prior year, reflecting the addition of more wealth and corporate clients. Due in part to the focused and successful efforts of our sales team, our client retention improved to 90%. For the fourth quarter, we repurchased 82,000 shares for a total of $27 million at the average share price of $349. We remain disciplined in our buyback program and the amount repurchased in part reflects the high performance of our share price this year. For the full year, we repurchased $200 million of our shares and increased our dividends for the 15th consecutive year. We remain committed to returning long-term value to our shareholders. Turning now to our outlook for fiscal year 2021. We operate in an environment that is in need of greater digital capabilities and differentiating solutions, which presents numerous opportunities for FactSet. For that reason and given the solid progress we have already made, we remain confident in our strategy of investing in content and technology, and in our ability to drive growth with our clients and to operate efficiently. The current environment also gives us less visibility due to pandemic, economic and political factors that may well have an impact on our clients' budgets for next year. Therefore, we remain cautious as we start our new fiscal year. As Phil mentioned and as you can see in our press release from this morning, we expect ASV plus professional services for the year to increase between $55 million and $85 million over fiscal 2020. The remaining metrics listed on this slide, all stem from our ASV ranges and reflect our planned investments. We will continue to execute at the same pace in content and technology as outlined last September. We believe momentum in our businesses from fiscal 2020 will carry us into fiscal 2021 with a number of tailwinds, including the strength in our analytics business as clients add our front office solutions, performance and risk and APIs to their workflows, as well as continuing demand for our core data feeds and wealth tools. Additionally, we expect high client retention to continue and will serve as a solid base for research, buoyed by the continued demand for expanded content coverage in deep sector and private markets. As highlighted earlier in the year, I want to give you some details of external factors we think may impact our top-line growth for 2021. First, delays in decision-making could cause longer sales cycle. While we\u2019ve built a strong pipeline and converted it with solid execution in 2020, we did experience situations in which larger and more complex deals require additional reviews, lengthening the time to close, especially in this virtual environment. We expect this may continue in 2021. Second, client budgets may tighten. The majority of our clients will finalize their 2021 budgets towards the end of this calendar year. Depending on the speed of a vaccine and economic recovery, clients may be cautious in their outlook and reduce or delay their spend. And third, a prolonged pandemic and virtual environment may slow new business growth. The strength of our sales force and our value proposition converted into key wins this year, proving that we can sell virtually. However, as pandemic-related uncertainty blunts decision-making, we acknowledge that clients may take longer to switch providers and it may take more time to build new relationships virtually. These same factors impact our visibility when we consider the 2022 targets laid out last September as part of a multiyear investment plan. While we maintain strong conviction in our ability and to achieve our milestones and solutions, capabilities, and savings, we would need greater visibility in order to reaffirm our 2022 targets, which we are unable to do so today. We have modeled multiple scenarios, including one with an economic recovery that supports our 2022 growth objectives. We believe that we have the right team and right products to see our growth objectives materialize. However, we must continue to weigh the factors I just mentioned, and as time goes on, to see the timeline of our growth targets that may shift from 2022 to beyond. In closing, our team rose to the many challenges that our industry, our clients, and our world faced this year. We posted our highest ASV quarter ever amid a global pandemic and marked 40 years of consecutive growth. Our core strength served us well, stable business model, strong liquidity, valued solutions and laser-focused client service. The results are top line and earnings growth, increasing retention, commitment to investments and growth in our clients and employee base. I'm confident that our strategy and team will continue to help us manage successfully through the challenging environment and generate long-term value for our shareholders. With that, we are now ready for your questions. Over to you, Kevin. Operator : Our first question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thanks. Hey. Phil, you made a comment. You said a highest quarter of incremental ASV growth in the Company history. Can you kind of just frame the puts and takes around that? Specifically, it looks like on the research side that seeing a little bit more momentum. Is that just structural change around COVID or some of the early benefit of the multi-year investments? Just any thoughts on that would be helpful. Phil Snow : Sure. Hey, Kevin. So, yes, it was broad based across all of the businesses in Q4. It was very strong. Research, I think was comparable to what we did in Q4 of last year. We did see decent hiring in the banks. I think, many people were concerned that that was going to be significantly lower, but we saw pretty good strength there. Analytics had a particularly strong quarter. We saw -- we talked about that earlier in the year where some of the investments we've made previously around the portfolio lifecycle were really starting to gain momentum. So, we did great with our performance system, which was really the result of the acquisition of BISAM integrated with PA and also our reporting system, which was the Vermilion acquisition. So a great quarter from analytics. CTS had a very good quarter, better than Q4 of last year. Our hope is sort to grow CTS a little bit faster this year, but we did have less salespeople I think than we needed at the beginning of the year going into \u201820, which we've corrected going into \u201821. And wealth had a really good quarter relative to the last Q4. So, all businesses grew, firing on all cylinders and the sales team did a tremendous job of executing on the pipeline that we had laid out at the beginning of the second half. Kevin McVeigh : And then, Helen, real quick, the expense management used to be really, really effective. Any thoughts on, just any structural savings, maybe on the travel side or occupancy? And does that allow you to share more with the market or accelerate product development, just thoughts around that? I know, it\u2019s still early, but you've got a couple of quarters here. Helen Shan : Yes. No, thank you for that question, and it's definitely an important one. Right now, given our fiscal year end, we have the situation where we have half a year of non-COVID, half a year of COVID, right? And so, as we think about the go-forward, we have A, proven that we've been able to sell virtually very effectively; and B, we have to obviously take into account how our client's behavior is. And so, when we think about the go-forward, we do assume that we are going to go back to the offices, sometime in the second half for us, but also that there will be some level of change, and that is built into our numbers. Now, that is in part, we are, I'll say reinvesting some of that back into the business, not all of it. But, that is part of what when we gave our guidance for FY21 built in. So, we do think that there are some, you were calling it structural change, but there will be some level of difference of how we just operate as a business that is taking into consideration. Kevin McVeigh : Thank you. Helen Shan : You're welcome. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Hey, Helen, can you talk a little bit about the pipeline and what you're seeing, just as you -- kind of the cadence of sales running through the quarter and into the first quarter, just give a little bit more color on the support for kind of the accelerating organic growth rate that you\u2019re speaking over the course of the year. Helen Shan : Sure. I'm happy to touch on that. So, I think as mentioned by Phil, we think about our different businesses, in particular for analytics, one of the benefits we've seen over the course of '20, which we think will continue into \u201821, will be along the lines of expansion. For example, with the reporting and risk and performance, we have found that those who have our core analytics solution within certain period of time, do have those add-on. So that expansion is happening. And so, we think that will just continue to build as we go forward. From a CTS perspective, as Phil mentioned, we have additional sales resources, for example. So, we think that positions us better, and that will reflect itself into '21. And then, what we're really building into our minds here as it relates to both research and wealth is that solid retention. It is in part buoyed by the investments that we've made, and we would expect that to continue. And we're not looking for any of large deals and necessarily be part of what's going to help us to succeed in '21. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, great. And then, just give me a little color as to the ASV growth rate. It seems to be -- an expectation at least for the year is lower than the revenue growth rate. And usually, I look at that as kind of a leading indicator. An ASV grows faster in an improving environment and it would decline faster in slowing environment. Why is that different now? Helen Shan : Sure. So, there's a little bit at the nature of ASV and revenue, which you hit upon. But, when you have a very strong, say Q4, right, so, you're not really recognizing that revenue in year, you recognize it really in the following, let's say, the next 12 months. So, there's a little bit of a lag effect that can occur, because you're not going to see that all in there. So, that's really what we're seeing here, when we're talking about the growth rate, it\u2019s the impacts from the previous year, that's showing through into the subsequent year. Operator : Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Hamzah Mazari : My question was just on Asia-Pac. It's been continuing to outperform. I know you mentioned sovereign funds. But maybe anything you can touch on in terms of the mix of that business or execution? I guess, it's a small base, do you envision that business being as big as the U.S. over time? Just sort of any thoughts there would be helpful. Phil Snow : Sure. Hey, Hamzah. It's Phil. So, yes, Asia-Pac had a slower year of growth than we were expecting. But, we do think that it will return to a higher growth rate this year. It was the first region to get affected by the pandemic. We did see particular strength in a couple of different countries, and we see a lot of good momentum going into next year. So, I don't think that\u2019s sort of a longer term trend in terms of Asia-Pac not growing at rates that it used to grow out. In terms of it getting back to -- over time to the size of the U.S., I mean, it is only around 10% of our business today. So, it certainly has a lot of potential. I think, Asia-Pac is a great market, if you're an asset manager, there's a lot of opportunity on the wealth side there. So, we're very bullish on it. But, it would take obviously a long time for it to get to the size of the U.S. But, I think we've been consistent over time saying we think our EMEA plus Asia-Pac business could be 50% of our ongoing revenue at some point. And I think we're beginning to get close to that now. Hamzah Mazari : Got it. And then, maybe if you could just update us on -- you laid out the multiyear investment plan, just in terms of timeline of that initiative, clearly, we're looking at ASV bounce back, which is sort of a milestone to judge success maybe of that program, but just maybe just update us on the timeline of that initiative. And if there's been any change sort of due to COVID? I know you mentioned the sales cycle, but any thoughts that would be helpful. Phil Snow : So, we're on track. We've not changed our plan. So, the three-year plan that we laid out, we\u2019re still committed to. So, the broad buckets, which were digital transformation, which includes a move to the public cloud, opening up the platform through APIs and more personalization, all of that continues to do well. On the content side, we committed to deep sector, private markets, and some investments for the wealth clients. We did really well this year with the deep sector strategies and we had significant releases in the three sectors. And we believe that that led to some very good retention, some clients, the work that we were doing that. We've secured a lot more content providers to kind of fill out new sectors that we\u2019re working on, and we have a full team of sector specialists for each of the different sectors that we had for the three-year plan. So, like any plan, you'll make some tweaks here and there. But, the plan itself, the overall strategy, the pace at which we're investing, none of that has really changed. Operator : Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : First, I actually just want to confirm the ASV guidance range. I think, the press release at the low end had $55 million, but on the slide, I think it said $65 million. So, I just wanted to make sure I have a good handle on what the bottom end is. But, my main question, though, is really, you had a pretty nice acceleration in ASV last quarter to 5%; this quarter, again, to 5.3%. So, so far, you're really not seeing the COVID impacts that I think, I would have thought, and -- but then, on the guidance being lower, it sounds like maybe it's just -- it hasn't happened yet. So, just wanted to understand, is it really conservatism, or is it something that you're seeing in your data, maybe in the retention rates or in something that's leading to sort of the slowdown? Phil Snow : So, yes, the low end should be 55, and I believe, that's already been corrected in a deck. So, we'll get back to those. The range is 55 to 85. We've been very successful, Toni, at selling virtually. So, I'm very proud of the team, and I think we're very confident that we can sell FactSet and support it and implement it virtually, and we're not sure how long that's going to go on. I think, there's a couple of things here. We are always very back-end loaded in terms of ASV. And sometimes it's hard to have visibility into the second half of the year. And this is a year where I think we would all agree that there's a little bit -- there's more uncertainty, more things that could happen. So, we\u2019re trying to put a good number out there for you. If we need to adjust to the second half, we can as we get more visibility. The one area that I think we're a little bit just not worried about, but thinking halfway about is how do we get the much larger deal teed up over the year. Like, can we do as many of those as we did in fiscal year '20? We're able to do them, it's just a question of are the clients themselves in the end markets going to be willing to make those large decisions? So, as we get closer to the end of the year, we'll understand how clients are looking at their budgets. Because we're an August company, that's a little bit different. But I think we're going into the first full budget cycle for clients, since COVID began. So, we're just not sure how that's going to play out exactly. What I can tell you is that we have a comparable pipeline going into FY21 as we had going into FY20. Like I said, if we need to revise our guidance at the mid-year mark, we will, but this is I think the range that we felt was appropriate sort of given what we know today. Toni Kaplan : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And I wanted to ask about CTS. Obviously, it's still a double-digit growth rate, but it is down from 15% last year, 20% in prior years. I think, just trend in terms of expanding need for data and things like that I thought were sort of positive tailwinds for that segment. And so, just wanted to understand -- it's a good number, but can you get back to 20% range on that line? And were there any specific drivers of the slowdown this year to get to that number? Phil Snow : Yes. I believe, we can certainly grow this at a faster rate. And as you mentioned, all the trends in the market are there, it really is a tailwind. I believe we're growing this business faster than most of the competitors offer the type of data that was selling. So, I think we're doing well and taking market share and we sold a lot of our core content. So, as more of our -- as we develop more of these content sets and we\u2019ve made a significant investment in content recently, we're going to be able to have more SKUs on the shelf to sell to our clients. One area that didn't come in as quickly as we thought as it might this year was the API. So, traditionally, clients have consumed FactSet content through feeds and our ability to file. We have built a lot of APIs to clients to sort of pull the data in a program that aims it directly. We believe that is a winning strategy. It just didn\u2019t come to fruition as quickly as we thought it might. And we\u2019ve built out a lot more sales channels through other enterprise software providers and through our strategic partnerships and alliances and things. So, I believe it will be our fastest growing segment for some time. And we've got a lot more specialists selling CTS going into FY21 than we had going into FY20. I do think that was -- that somewhat limited us that it's a very specialized sale. And if you don't have enough people to sell it, it can slow down the growth rate. Toni Kaplan : Thank you. Phil Snow : Sure. Operator : Next question comes from Owen Lau Oppenheimer. Owen Lau : Good morning. And thank you for taking my question. Could you please give us an update on your wins in some non-traditional sectors, for FactSet, like insurance and real estate? And also, could you please talk about the value prop with them, and why they are switching over to FactSet? Thank you. Phil Snow : Sure. Thanks for the question, Owen. Let me talk about insurance. So, we do very well in the asset owner space. We grew that type of client this year I believe in high single digits. And we did have a lot of success with insurance companies, particularly in the fourth quarter. And usually, the insurance companies are going to be using our analytics suite. So, we'll be selling into the general fund. Typically, they'll be subscribing to our multi-asset class risk solutions. So, as we continue to build our capabilities there, that's resonated greatly with the insurance companies. So, that is a space we're very bullish about. We don't do a lot with real estate companies today. That is an area that we're investing in. So, maybe that's something we can talk about at a future call. Owen Lau : That's great. Very, helpful. And then, the follow-up question is, you talked about Asia Pacific, decelerated a little bit, but I also realized that EMEA accelerated from 3.7% to 5.7% linked quarter. Any color you can provide, any -- what's the driver for that? Thank you. Phil Snow : Yes. We had a great quarter and a great year, in the EMEA region. Analytics and CTS were big drivers there. We did very well in some of the very large accounts in the region. And the UK sales team actually really crushed it this year. So, we had a very good performance out of the UK. And we did well with redistributed as well. So, we do have a segment of our business that goes out to other fintech companies or other consumers or financial data other than the buy side and sell side, and that team had a very strong year. Owen Lau : That's very helpful. Thank you very much. Phil Snow : Sure. Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Bill Warmington : Good morning, everyone. Helen Shan : Good morning. Bill Warmington : So, I know that the contracts can vary from client to client. But, could you talk about how, for the majority of your revenue, potential seat reductions could impact or wouldn't impact your revenue? Helen Shan : So, just to address it quickly, which is, when we think about our contracts, like you said, they all varied and they\u2019re multi-year in nature. So, that's point one. The second point will be that many of them, especially the larger ones, which is probably what your question is focused on, we have minimums and then we also have tiers. So, I think from the perspective of a number of users, yes, that may change over time. But, it would have to be something, more material for any kind of impact more specifically as it relates to how our contracts were set up. Now, I'm giving you a general answer, Bill. But that is how we would think about it and probably the way it would play out. Bill Warmington : That's helpful. The other question I have for you is, it's really one where I was just doing some --we were doing some calculations earlier today. And if we take the ASV segments, as you have them now, and we take the growth rates that you have done this past quarter, aside this past year, and you just run those out for the next three years. The challenge is, it doesn't move the ASV growth very much. I mean, it takes it from the 5.2%, 5.3% growth to about 6%. And the challenge I'm facing is I\u2019m trying to figure out like how you get it to the upper single digit, which is where that 40% is -- sorry, that 60% is growing now. How do you get the whole Company up to that level? Phil Snow : The big move as far as, Bill, CTS and analytics, we have to execute on those two in particular. And I think, it's seat count as well. So, how well do we do in capturing more seats in the wealth and research space. So, when we laid out a plan, we have a theory where we can move each of these pieces of our business to a higher level, and some have more opportunity than others. But, that's really the theory is how quickly can each of them get to the growth rates that we think that they can attain, so as a group gets to the high single digit number that we outlined for you last year. Operator : The next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Manav Patnaik : Phil, maybe somewhat tied to this prior question. You talked about, there was no pace in the change of your investments, and early in the call, you talked about how all the clients and almost everyone we listened to is going through this accelerated digital transformation and so on and so forth. And I was just curious, your thought process and perhaps why maybe you guys didn\u2019t decide to accelerate, given all the trends that we're seeing there? Phil Snow : You mean investing more in it than\u2026 Manav Patnaik : Yes, investing more and faster or so forth. Phil Snow : Yes. We certainly could do that. I think, we have -- this is an ambitious investment plan that we have and it's I think good to I think see how it goes essentially. So, I think we're very encouraged with the investment that we've made so far. And, if it proves that some of these things produce higher growth rates than we originally imagined, we could certainly consider that. So, we have tweaked some things, and there also is -- there's only so much capacity I think we have to execute on some of this stuff at a certain rate. So, that's another potential limiting factor. Manav Patnaik : Okay. Fair enough. And then, just to follow-up, on the content side, the private sector expertise you're talking about, could you just remind us or give us a flavor of where you\u2019re sourcing that data or how you're collecting that data and how much of it is more proprietary versus just a partnership to resell the data and so forth? Phil Snow : Yes. It's a combination of partnerships and us collecting data ourselves. So, I don't know if we've been completely public about. Some of the sources we have. So, I want to be a little bit careful there. But it is a very healthy mix. One of the big kind of rocks within our digital transformation strategy is to automate a lot of our own content collection. So, we have a very good machine for collecting content, but if we would have set up our company all over again today, we'd probably do it in a different way. So, we're making that transition. And as we get further along with that journey, I think we'll be able to source more of this data ourselves that can come from a wider variety of documents and more unstructured content as well. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. Helen Shan : And Manav, just to add, part of it is having content, and part of it is concordance with everything else that we have, which is a differentiating factor and important one. So, I wanted to sort of keep that in mind as well. Manav Patnaik : Okay. Thank you both. Phil Snow : Thanks, Manav. Operator : The next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Alex Kramm : Yes. Hey. Hello everyone. I just wanted to put a couple of these pieces together that you talked about. Maybe I may be stating the obvious. But, since you took the guidance away for 2022, which is understandable, I think there was mostly in ASV comments, right, in terms of top-line growth. But as some people have noticed, you\u2019re also basically saying the investment continues to go forward. So, there was a margin guide that was 33% plus in 2022. And I assume that was predicated on getting to that higher growth and that drives the margin expansion. So, if we're not getting that growth, I assume those margin targets are off the table for now, and will stay in probably more of these levels. Is that that a fair assumption? Helen Shan : Hey, Alex. It's Helen. Thanks for that question. So, since we're not commenting specifically on that, I'm going hedge a little bit. But, I would say, if you take a look at the trend of what we've done in terms of '19, '20 and '21, I would expect us to continue to see some of the productivity and efficiency gains. And yes, for sure, the margin is impacted by the revenue growth in that. But we would still be executing very well against the operational improvements that we've done thus far. Alex Kramm : Okay. And then, maybe just to finish on margin, little bit more near-term on 2021, I know it's a difficult year to model. But, A, any seasonal stuff you would point out as we should be thinking about it from a quarterly basis? Again, maybe related to when things reopen, but how you would be thinking about it? And then just, I think you said -- maybe it was 180 basis points that COVID was a margin benefit, 2020. For 2021, did you say how much of a margin benefit COVID you're building in to the model today? Helen Shan : Yes. So, let me touch on that. So for seasonality, normally, our business isn't that seasonal per se. So, the difference would be savings that comes from some of the continued office close or lower T&E as you suggested, the back half of the year is really the -- where that resume. In terms of impact, keeping in mind that -- given our fiscal year, we had half a year in '20 that are under the situation, and let's call it a half a year in '21 that\u2019s under that situation. And the impact in both is roughly around 1% on a net basis, for both the savings that we get from office savings, as well as T&E, but also offset by some of these expenses we're going to have to take in terms of business continuity and ensuring that our employees are able to work effectively from home. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas of William Blair. Andrew Nicholas : It seems like you're particularly successful growing the wealth business in the quarter, as a primary driver of ASV growth, user count, client count. I was just hoping you could speak a little bit more to the growth in the period, what type of clients you're able to bring on board, and the extent to which there were any notable wins in the periods that are worth calling out? Phil Snow : Well, I would say for the year, we had a very broad base success with wealth. There were some much larger deals that we were shooting for that unfortunately we weren't able to capture in the end. But we did capture three significant wins with some marquee names in the three different countries. And we also did very well executing on sort of smaller and medium sized wealth shops. So, we're really encouraged in terms of the products and the service level, I think we've proven that, just from the feedback from the marketplace. And we also had a good year with our digital business. So, for those of you that remember, we made an acquisition a few years ago, and we had a relatively good year there with our digital solutions. So overall, I think, wealth just continued to execute well throughout the entire year. And in one particular case, I think really took advantage of some of the digital transformation that we've been doing, where we were able to unpack different views from FactSet and plug those into a client ecosystem rather than just taking the traditional FactSet experience through the web or through the workstation. Andrew Nicholas : And then, just as my follow-up, the conversation around ESG and ESG data seems to be growing with every passing quarter. So, I was just kind of hoping you could talk a bit about how you're capitalizing on that trend to FactSet, and how material of an opportunity that could be within content technology solutions? Thanks. Phil Snow : Yes. We view that as a significant feature opportunity. Today, we integrate a lot of the best of breed ESG content that's out there, either through the workstation or through the open FactSet marketplace. So, if you go to open up factset.com, you can see we've got I think over 100 now providers of alternative data grouped by theme, and the most popular theme, and I'm guessing the one with the most contributors in it is ESG. So FactSet has always been great about taking everything that's out there and putting it in one place, providing great analytics and service. That's the current approach we're taking the ESG. But we're certainly taking a very careful look at what we can do ourselves from a proprietary standpoint to take advantage of the trend that\u2019s out there. Operator : Our next question comes from David Chu with Bank of America. David Chu : So, when you introduced the three-year accelerated investment, the idea was to get roughly like 25% of revenue benefit in fiscal '21 with the remaining in fiscal '22. I'm just wondering, if that's what's embedded into your guide, and what that means in dollar terms? Helen Shan : I think, from the perspective of how we're looking at those 25 and 75 was obviously based off of what we thought we would able to continue to do under the normal conditions. It is some of the benefits that come through from the investments, that comes through in the form of retention, as well as new logos. So, I think from the view of giving an exact dollar, that's not how we think about that. But rather that it is supporting the overall growth in '21. I think, the benefits will come across all businesses. But, given where we are in the different investments, research, gets some of the earlier benefits from that, and we'll see that come through on the digital side into analyzing CTS going forward. David Chu : And then, CTS remains quite strong. And just wondering, who are the primary, like users here, just wondering if they're mainly quants and what your thoughts on the sustainability of that user base might be? Phil Snow : So, you're right that a very large percentage of what we've traditionally sold was to quants, either through feeds or through other mechanisms. But, we do sell a lot of data -- into performance systems, other systems. When clients are doing application development, they need a lot of content to do that. So, there are multiple workflows that we sell to. We also sell real time feeds. It's a smaller piece of what we do, but we do have a good offering there. And we're currently looking at all of the different addressable market for us on the feed side. So, as we enter FY21, we\u2019ve sort of taken a fresh look as TCS and where we were pointed, and we're still is going to do very well in quants, but we are ramping up the focus on some areas that we can sell feeds to that traditionally we hadn't spent as much time focused on. Operator : Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. Ashish Sabadra : Maybe just a question on the M&A pipeline, how are you thinking about any acquisition opportunity? It's been a few years since we've really seen any acquisition per se. Thanks. Phil Snow : Do you want to take that one, Helen? Helen Shan : Sure, happy to do that. Thanks for your question. So, we, as you can tell from our solid liquidity and balance sheet, we have the capacity to do so. And we've initially chosen to continue to invest in organic as a way of building our growth. But, we continue to analyze acquisitions that support our strategy, in content and technologies, and the ones that have the adequate returns that exceed our hurdle rates. As you can guess, the market is pretty frothy. And from the perspective of evaluation, we continue to look at that in every one of our decisions as we continue to look at many of the opportunities out there. We agree that having inorganic growth will be very helpful to support our overall longer term growth. But, we are going to remain disciplined in making sure that we get those adequate returns. The positive here is that we have plenty of liquidity to be opportunistic, and we'll continue to look to do so. Ashish Sabadra : That's very helpful color. And maybe just to follow up on the question on the '22 target. Where do you see -- like in your scenario analysis, where do you see, which segments or which end markets are, maybe which geography do you see the biggest variances as you think about the 2022 target, any color that you can provide? Thanks. Helen Shan : Sure. I'll take the first shot on that. So, when we think about the scenario that helps support that and as Phil sort of talked to before, what will happen to help from even in getting toward upper range in the FY21, when we think about the factors, which include the exogenous factors of delayed decisions of new business being done virtually as well as budgets, those all have to work more in the favor of -- I'll call it a normal environment. Although, what normal is probably still a bit unclear. But having more confidence, just like with the markets, the more confidence there is in the future, the more there are clients who have confidence in their spend. We know that our products are resonating. We know that they fit the trends and the needs of what they need to be productive on their end. But that confidence in the future and their own markets will allow for them to work with us and for us to be able to reach -- in the scenario that outlines to reach back to where we believe our original strategies meant to take us in the long term. Ashish Sabadra : That's helpful. Thanks. Helen Shan : You\u2019re welcome. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. You talked about being cautious with your ASV outlook due to potential economic, political and pandemic related risks. Can you elaborate on recent client sentiment and spending intentions and whether you're actually seeing some of those risks manifest in what clients are saying? Phil Snow : Hey, George, it's Phil. So yes, we saw a little bit of that in Q4 even. I believe we would have had an even stronger second half if it hadn't been for the pandemic. And I've been on some calls myself, particularly with clients that feel like they're under a lot of cost pressure. Right? So, they're obviously thinking about their own futures, their own employees, and what it is they want to do. So, we're navigating through it, I think it's already happening. But again, I think, a lot of companies budget towards the end of the calendar year. And that's the one thing that we think will get sort of more of as we get to the end of the year. And, as people get more visibility themselves on how they've operated during this period and how long they think the pandemic is going to affect them. George Tong : Got it. That makes sense. And then, switching gears to margins, you're not reaffirming your fiscal 2022 margin target of 33% because of less operating visibility. Can you talk about whether this reduced visibility comes from unknown ASV growth which can obviously impact margin flow-through or if it reflects potential changes in what or how much you plan to invest in, since presumably, you have more control over investment levels and more control over margins? Helen Shan : Yes. That's a good question. And you are correct, as we think about where we've got more control and visibility. So, right now, we intend to continue to invest at the pace that we talked about last year. So, that we have the levers, so to speak, if need be. But, it really -- since it's all around revenue growth being higher than and spend -- expense growth, that\u2019s really what -- why we lacked that visibility at this juncture. But, our intent is to continue to invest at the pace that we outlined a year ago. Operator : Our last question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Keith Housum : Question for you on the operations. You guys have proven that you're able to sell it virtually, but yet your model has been traditionally high-touch with the consultants visiting customers often. Coming out of the COVID pandemic, is there any expectation that the business model may change and you're able to cut back on some of the high touch T&E that you guys do? Phil Snow : So yes, we've been doing inside sales now for six months. So, I'm really intrigued by how can we be more efficient at selling the higher volume type sales or the smaller clients -- the smaller type clients without necessarily having FactSeters sort of fly around the globe. But, I do think for the larger firms and the more complex deals, there is going to have to be that element as sort of being in front of the clients, talking to them about their overall strategy and building those relationships face to face. So, it's not going to go away. But like every other company, we're going to rethink carefully our business model, how we work with our clients and also how we work as a company. So, I think, it presents -- it presents more opportunity than not honestly. And I've been very encouraged from what I've seen with the sales force and how they've been able to execute during the last six months. Keith Housum : Okay, got it. So, to see if I can clarify, your pipeline expectations as of now, I think we heard several different comments, is that the pipeline is equal the size that was pressed a year ago, but maybe you're not seeing as many large deals in that pipeline as of now, and it's certainly probably not as strong as it was at the end of the second quarter. Is that a good summary of how you see the pipeline right now? Phil Snow : It's a comparable size going into the year as it was last year and deals build up and bring more confidence in those deals as the years go -- as the year goes on. So, the one area that I think we\u2019re just hesitant about and need a little bit more time is, can we build up that pipeline of the larger deals for the second half, the same way that we were able to do that in the first half of last year. Operator : I would now like to turn the call back over to Phil Snow for closing remarks. Phil Snow : I'd like to thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased with our team\u2019s and Company's performance this year and the strong progress we have made on our investment plan. We're excited for this New Year. As we continue to expand our offering and equip our team and our clients to operate success in this environment, I'm confident we will capture further wallet share and secure additional client wins. And importantly, we remain committed to investing in our people, our clients, and communities to create long-term value for our shareholders. With that, I'd like to thank you one more time for your time. And if you have additional questions, please call Rima Hyder, and we look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Operator, that ends today's call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, you may now disconnect. And have a wonderful day.",

After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference call, Ms. Rima Hyder. You may begin. Rima Hyder : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FactSet's first quarter 2021 earnings call. We continue to be in various remote locations today. We may have some audio quality issues, and we appreciate your patience, should we experience a disruption. Before we begin, I would like to point out that the slides we will reference during this presentation can be accessed via the webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at factset.com. The slides will be posted on our website at the conclusion of this call. A replay of today's call will be available via phone and on our website. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions from investors. To be fair to everyone, please limit yourself to one question, plus one follow-up. Before we discuss our results, I encourage all listeners to review the legal notice on Slide 2, which explains the risks of forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the appendix to the presentation and in our earnings release issued earlier this morning. Joining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer; and Helen Shan, our Chief Financial Officer. I would now like to turn the discussion over to Phil Snow. Phil Snow : Thanks, Rima, and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to report that FactSet has started its fiscal year on track to meet its first-half goals. We've learned a lot over calendar year 2020, how resilient our business is, how well we can work remotely and the strength of our client relationships. The last 12 months have also served as a reaffirmation of our investment strategy in content and technology. FactSet's focus on supporting client workflows across the entire portfolio lifecycle is increasingly serving as a differentiator for us in the market and we enter the new calendar year with increased visibility and measured confidence in our position. Our focus remains on maintaining our already high client retention, adding new clients, expanding wallet share with large strategic clients and continued pricing discipline as we seek to capture more market share. Strong execution will be key to performance this fiscal year and we are optimistic in our ability to close our pipeline.  Our second quarter pipeline is higher now than it was at this point a year ago and we have proven that we can execute well. Ultimately, we provide clients with critical data that is only increasing in importance. The demand for more and more differentiated content is at an all-time high, especially on the buy side and FactSet's depth and scale in this area places us in a solid position.  We believe we offer the strongest data concordance in the industry and this strength coupled with FactSet's comprehensive suite of open and flexible technology solutions are driving more engaged and actionable C-suite level conversations. Moreover, our ability to link diverse content and convert unstructured data into structured meaningful financial insights is a key differentiator for us in the industry. We are the provider of choice for many of our clients looking to scale their technology and migrate their workflows to the cloud.  We further improved our content in technology this quarter with the exciting acquisition of Truvalue Labs, one of the strongest ESG providers in the industry. I'm very pleased with the demand we see from clients and the speed with which we're integrating this company into the FactSet ecosystem. They were already a provider on the open FactSet marketplace, and one of the many ESG data providers on our platform. Truvalue's pioneering AI technology, their alignment with SASB and the UN SDGs combined with our existing library of content creates a powerful engine to data collection and signal creation that will certainly add value for clients across all our businesses. As we look at Q1, the growth rate for organic ASV plus professional services decelerated by 40 bps over the last three months ending at 5%. Our research business, which primarily experienced higher growth due to stronger retention helped support the ASV growth this quarter. The strength and research was offset by delayed decision-making that slowed our ability to close deals, as well as higher cancellations and other businesses. We also saw an increased level of activity in new business as well as expansion with existing clients.  As we've said before, the first quarter typically tends to be our smallest quarter, and is not necessarily an indication about performance for the remainder of the year. We're also pleased with improved results for both the adjusted operating margin and EPS this quarter, driven by higher operating results. Helen will walk you through the details in a few minutes. Turning to our regional segments. In Americas, strong retention and expansion of our research solutions with our largest clients, especially banks and asset managers, helped sustain growth in this region. As we enter our second quarter of 2021, we anticipate closing on large deals within wealth, banking and asset owners that we believe will help us stay on track to meet our first-half goals.  Our EMEA region contracted this quarter largely impacted by cancellations. There is a heightened focus by the sales team to mitigate these cancellations by increasing new business with ESG as a central theme. We have plans to deploy the Truvalue Labs\u2019 product as a differentiated offering in this region. We also continue to see good opportunities in EMEA for our CTS and analytic solutions. In Asia Pacific, the ongoing conversations with clients around digital transformation and portfolio lifecycle are helping to build a strong pipeline across different markets. The Q2 pipeline looks strong as some large deals, largely in our analytics business, will push from Q1 into Q2, as they near their final stages of closure. We also see solid demand for CTS data feeds across the region and our new business pipeline reflects that. We have conviction in the second quarter pipeline across all regions stemming from the demand we see for our products, especially with our end-to-end portfolio lifecycle solutions. We are the only provider of integrated solutions that originated portfolio research and then with client reporting. We are targeting the front office with these robust research and analytics solutions, tapping into clients' technology budgets with digital transformation, focused on thematic-based selling, especially with ESG products, and continuing to provide holistic, open and flexible solutions. This sets us up well to meet our goals for the first-half of the year. In summary, I'm proud of our team for delivering solid results this quarter. We are reaffirming our fiscal 2021 guidance. As we look at the world today, we are more confident than ever that the early investments we made in content and technology, coupled with solutions that cover the entire portfolio lifecycle, increased FactSet's value to our clients. While the short-term environment continues to be affected by the prolonged pandemic, we are taking the necessary steps to meet our goals this fiscal year. We are doing all this while maintaining cost and capital discipline across the organization. The relationships with our clients have strengthened during the pandemic, allowing us to build an even stronger Q2 pipeline than we saw at this time last year. Above all, we have an exemplary team that has demonstrated again and again its ability to execute. I'll now turn things over to Helen, who will take you through the specifics of our first quarter performance. Helen Shan : Thank you, Phil, and hello, everyone. I'm happy to be speaking with you today. And I hope you and your loved ones continue to be safe and healthy as we enter the holiday season and end of the year. In our first quarter, we accelerated revenue growth, reflecting the momentum from our fourth quarter\u2019s strong ASP performance and expanded our operating margin. We continue to progress in our investments in content and technology and, in fact, are using a portion of the cost savings associated with the ongoing pandemic to further fund initiatives in sales and product. We are also pleased to welcome the Truvalue Labs team to FactSet. Given that we closed the transaction in early November, the financial impact on our results is immaterial for this quarter. The acquisition adds approximately $5 million of ASV, which is included in our reported ASV plus professional services. We will exclude this amount for organic-related metrics for fiscal year 2021. As Phil stated earlier, we grew organic ASV plus professional services at 5%, as IT [ph] acceleration from the previous quarter and reflecting the seasonally slower start to our fiscal year. GAAP revenue increased by 6% to $388 million, while organic revenue which excludes any impact from foreign exchange and acquisitions increased 5% to $387 million. Growth was driven primarily by analytics and CTS.  For our geographic segments, America's revenue grew 6%, EMEA came in at 5% and Asia-Pacific revenue grew 10%. The regions primarily benefited from increases in analytic and CTS. GAAP operating expenses grew 5% in the first quarter to $267 million, impacted by higher cost of sales. Compared to the previous year, our GAAP operating margin expanded by 30 basis points to 31% and our adjusted operating margin increased by 40 basis points to 34%. These improvements are largely due to net savings, and continued productivity through workforce mix and a reduction in discretionary expenses, including lower travel and office costs. These benefits will partially offset a higher spend in both compensation and technology. As a percentage of revenue, our cost of sales was 350 basis points higher than last year on a GAAP and adjusted basis. This result reflects increased hiring from fiscal year '20 as well as higher compensation expense for our existing employee base. Growth was also driven by higher technology spend, which includes our shift to the public cloud as part of our digital transformation and multiyear investment plan. This total was partially offset by lower third party content costs.  When expressed as a percentage of revenue, SG&A improved year-over-year by 380 basis points on a GAAP basis and 390 basis points on an adjusted basis. The primary drivers include materially lower travel and entertainment costs, reduced spend due to office closures and lower facility expense, offset in part by higher compensation costs. The pandemic-related savings are helping to manage a portion of our higher spend. Over the long-term we believe a portion of the savings will become permanent.  Moving on, our tax rate for the quarter was 16% compared to last year's rate of 14%, which has included income benefits related to a change in the foreign tax rate, as well as credits tied to finalizing our annual tax return. GAAP EPS increased 8% to $2.62 this quarter, versus $2.43 on the prior year. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 12% to $2.88. Both EPS figures were primarily driven by improved operating results. Reconciliation of our adjustments to GAAP EPS is disclosed at the end of our press release.  Free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending were $71 million for the quarter, an increase of 3% over the same period last year. This increase is primarily due to lower CapEx on facility spend, as we have finished a portion of our office build outs. For the first quarter, our ASV retention continued to be above 95%. We grew the total number of clients by 6% compared to a prior year, reflecting the addition of more wealth and corporate clients, an ongoing trend in our client base. Our client retention improved to 90% year-over-year, which speaks to the mission criticality of our solutions and the efforts of our sales team.  For the first quarter, we repurchased 132,000 shares for a total of $43 million at an average share price of $327. We remain disciplined in our buyback program and committed to returning long-term value to our shareholders. We remain measured in our outlook on growth. We also continue to monitor the factors laid out last quarter, potential delays in decision making, tightening client budgets and a challenging new business environment.  As we begin our second quarter, we have more momentum and visibility into our business as reflected in the size and quality of our pipeline and our level of client engagement, particularly in their digital transformation. This is an area of competitive strength for FactSet. As we invest for long-term growth in the areas of content and technology, we are redirecting savings driven largely from the pandemic to fund additional hiring in sales and in the development of products, including in wealth and analytics. As noted earlier, we expect a portion of the T&E facilities related costs to become permanent post this pandemic environment, enabling us to offset ongoing operational expenses. Our discipline in cost management is also reflected in our continued shift in workforce mix, as well as expense rationalization with external vendors. We believe these collective actions will allow us to achieve solid results that are within our FY21 guidance ranges. We are reaffirming our guidance for 2021.  With that, we are now ready for questions. Kevin, back to you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Andrew Nicholas : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Really strong margin performance in the quarter, nicely above the full-year guidance range. Given you maintained the full-year guide, I was just hoping you could speak to the mix of factors driving implied step up in expenses through the second-half of the year or through the remainder of this year. Mostly just wondering how much of that implied increase is investment spend versus maybe a return to a portion of -- a return of a portion of those T&E costs or the facility costs, you called out. Just trying to get a sense for that and maybe the cadence of spend throughout the rest of this year? Helen Shan : Sure. Thanks for your question. So yes, we are pleased with how we're performing. When we think about the benefit in this quarter, it comes in part from the higher revenue growth, given the strong Q4, and that's offset by both growth and expand in both comp -- compensation and technology. The salary growth with \u2013 comes with the new hires. We did quite a lot in Q4 and that's coming through. And that's why when they become more of a run rate, which is more in Q1, we\u2019re going to see that come through for the rest of the year as well as our merit increases that come through. So that's why there's a bit of that cadence that we'll see come through post Q1. And we've also been doing additional spend in sales and product hiring and development, and that's going to see that come through for the back-half of the year also.  I think that when we talk about the part that's going to be more permanent, that is really when we\u2019re back to an ongoing normal, whatever that\u2019s defined as an environment. But we\u2019re also going to start to lap, as we get into -- partly into Q2, but more into Q3, Q4. So that\u2019s also why, from a margin perspective, we\u2019ll see that play out through the rest of the year, and so that margins will reflect that as well. Andrew Nicholas : Understood, thank you. And then, obviously, one of your competitors announced a major merger late last month. I was hoping you could speak to one, how you anticipate the competitive dynamics in this space to evolve as a consequence of that deal? And then second, what your outlook is in terms of consolidation in this sector broadly, and whether you anticipate continued activity of this type going forward? Thank you. Phil Snow : Hey, Andrew, it\u2019s Phil Snow. I\u2019ll take that one. So, what we\u2019re focused on, is our strategy, which we feel really good about. So if you think about FactSet and how we differentiate ourselves in the marketplace, so much of that has driven by the workflows that we build out around the client portfolios, particularly on the buy side and increasingly with wealth. So, our strategy is covering the portfolio lifecycle from research through to client reporting, and what we can do there in combination with the investment we're making in digital transformation for our clients. So, that's the piece of the market that we see as being truly differentiated for FactSet, along with the concordance that we offer between those portfolios and all of the data sets that we have on our platform. And we think there's some real advantages to that strategy and the agility that we have, when we talk to our clients. So we -- the consolidation of the industry has been happening for a long time, but we don't necessarily see this particular deal as something that would necessarily affect us in a negative way. Andrew Nicholas : Great. Thank you. Phil Snow : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. Good morning, guys. I just had a question on the Truvalue Labs acquisition. I think the cross-sell opportunities seem pretty evident. I was just curious on what this means to the ESG strategy, because I think, in the past you were more ESG-agnostic, I guess, just pass-through other data through your system. Does this change that? Like how should we envision what you guys are working towards in terms of the ESG thing? Phil Snow : Hi, Manav, it's Phil. I would think of this the way that, we've handled some other new content sets that we've gotten into. So we still want to be that ecosystem where the concordance that we offer and the software that we provide is a reason clients want to come to FactSet. So we have, I think, upwards of 20 ESG providers within the open FactSet marketplace. And I believe we've integrated about nine of those within our workstation and other workflows just based on client demand. So I don't anticipate that changing. I think what we can do, if we own n asset, which is differentiated, like Truvalue is we can further integrate that through the different workflows for our clients. So we see exciting opportunities for Truvalue, just in terms of continuing to sell it, as a discrete product, which could be a feed or an API just for the signals, but then we can get it really embedded in our RMS, Research Management Solutions. We can attach it to the portfolios. So I think it's going to become ubiquitous now, ESG across portfolio management. And the strength that we have with our portfolio analytics products, is that you can really configure the groupings, the columns, the things that you want to know about your portfolio, and getting this data in there, I think, will be exciting for our clients and something that frankly, they're all going to be demanding and needing to do in the future. Manav Patnaik : Got it. And maybe just -- if you could give us an update on Open :FactSet, I guess, it's been a while just maybe some metrics, how things are going there? Phil Snow : Yes, it's been an evolution. So we continue to add lots of alternative data providers to Open :FactSet and you can easily go and look at those now through the FactSet website that\u2019s \u2013 we've got the whole library of data that we have up there. The strategy is evolving as we go, and as we learn more in terms of what clients are wanting. The way I would describe Open :FactSet now is not just necessarily that you're accessing alternative data providers in a modern research environments, but it's really the opening up of FactSet's technology stacks. So we continue to deploy more and more APIs, so that those that want to come into the FactSet ecosystem and create value, either with content or technology, are able to do that. So we do see some momentum both in the alternative data providers and how much we're able to monetize that, as well as the use of APIs. The use of APIs has actually been driven mostly through the analytics group so far. So all of the power of PA that clients use to for the workstation, they're now able to take those APIs and plug them into their own technology stacks and workflows, if that's something that they wanted to do. So we\u2019re \u2013 it's a big piece of our strategy. And I think, again, it's one that differentiates us when you think about FactSet and how we go to market and how we work with our clients. Manav Patnaik : Got it. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : Thank you. Phil, just touching on that digital transformation strategy point, I know you just mentioned the APIs, but maybe you could talk about where you are on the move to cloud, how much is sort of left to go? And what are the -- just in general, biggest opportunities encompassed within this digital transformation theme? Because I know you've talked about your clients going on this process as well. So is there a way to sort of quantify it or is this more about taking share versus others as you sort of personalize things? Just anything from a product or strategy or positioning standpoint would be helpful? Thank you. Phil Snow : Sure. Yeah, so one metric that could be useful is how far we've come in terms of moving to the public cloud. We said that a year or so ago that our plan was to be 80% in the public cloud by the end of the original three year plan, which would be seven quarters from now. And we're now 35% of the way there. So that's something that we're measuring very closely. Of course, there are lots of other ways to measure that, but I think that's a good one to keep track of. I'm talking these days, Toni, to more CTOs and CIOs than I have around their entire workflow, and what it is they're doing from a technology standpoint. These are our largest clients. So one thing that our strategic client group and our other regional teams are doing with our larger clients is sitting down with them, really understanding the opportunities that are there, and some of the pressures frankly, that the clients are facing regarding their own digital transformation.  And we're having very open conversations with our clients about their entire workflow, their technology stack. We help blueprint that for them and then we really overlay access capabilities across their entire workflow to help them understand how we can help them consolidate their -- the number of providers that they deal with in the marketplace.  So the very largest clients, over the years have dealt with hundreds of providers, whether they\u2019re technology or just content providers, and then being forced, I think to choose who are the one or two firms that we really want to tie ourselves to for the future as a platform and then how do we get that list of hundreds of providers, maybe cut it in half even. So that's something that we're spending a lot of time with clients on. And this is one of the things that I'm most excited about, particularly as we look at the second half of the year in terms of the pipeline, and really trying to get deals that are in the millions of dollars into that pipeline around this theme for our clients. Helen Shan : Maybe Toni, I can just add a couple things that we look at internally in terms of measuring is a little behind the scenes, but we're making good progress in terms of content automation, and the speed. So we're measuring the speed of, when we're integrating and the collection around the speed and processing. And those are important pieces because that is part of our digital transformation. That is again, behind the scenes that we measure and track as well. Toni Kaplan : That's great. And it sounds from the comments in both the press release and earlier in the call that you sound like you have more conviction in what's going on in the market and the pipeline being robust. And the investment strategy is sort of in the line of what your clients need. So just wanted to help understand -- bridge that versus your guidance is still sort of calling for further deceleration in ASV by the end of the year. I know last quarter, you talked about the large deals. Is that mainly the real bridge between that because it sounds like you have some momentum right now that you're expecting coming? Just wanting to understand why the decel. Thank you. Phil Snow : We're certainly anticipating a strong Q2, as I outlined in my comments. And I think as we get through Q2, we'll have even more visibility on the second half. I've spoken before that sometimes it's difficult to have a really high degree of confidence more than six months out. But if we feel there's an opportunity to change any of our guidance, Toni, I think the best time for us to do that would probably be in March after we've gotten through Q2 and we've got more visibility on the second half pipeline. Toni Kaplan : Got it. Thank you. Helen Shan : Yes, especially, Tony, as you think about the back half, is always our bigger half. So we have greater visibility, that there are things we're continuing to track, like the larger deals. They can -- they -- some moved from Q1 to Q2, which Phil talked about. So I think it's really it's reflected in our wider range in terms ROI [ph]. So we have confidence that's reflected in our wider range. Toni Kaplan : Excellent. Thanks again. Operator : Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Mario Cortellacci : Hi, this is Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. With the growth in your new customer, I think you said 6%. Just trying to maybe see if you can give us an update on the wealth channel and maybe you can actually help us have some perspective on the mix of the size of the client in that pipeline. I know you talked in the past about having chunkier opportunities and large opportunities in wealth. Does that make up the overwhelming majority of that pipeline or are there a lot of smaller wealth players that you can you can tap into? And has the mentality shifted in that space as we get much further into COVID? Phil Snow : Yes, hi, it\u2019s Phil. So you're right in that there are some bigger chunky deals that are out there and those are usually binary and we continue to see a lot of enthusiasm from the marketplace around larger wealth deals and are exploring those moving forward. And we do see a high volume of smaller wealth deals as well. So with the combination of those two, plus the business that we have around digital, which is part of the wealth business line that we report out on. So there's a good, healthy mixture across that.  What we do see, just in terms of the market on the wealth side is an increasing demand for more sophisticated tools for wealth advisors. We think that human element of wealth is still going to exist. I don't think it's going to be completely automated. But the clients of wealth are going to demand, I think, more insight from the wealth advisors moving forward and more of a personalized touch. So we're excited about some of the products that we have coming to market. We've released a new advisor dashboard product, which we have a lot of opportunities for in the pipeline that really does a great job of organizing our wealth advisors day. So we're able to sift through the hundreds of thousands of portfolios, that are wealth or millions of portfolios that our wealth shop is managing and really help a wealth advisor understand what she may or may not need to do that day in terms of an order of priority, in terms of dealing with their clients. And some of that's just good old FactSet software, some of it's also the increased use of cognitive computing to highlight some of those things for our clients.  So this is an area that we're excited about. It's scenario -- if the market I think where we have some tailwinds and one that we're just going to continue to invest in. Helen Shan : And Mario, one of the outputs from our digital transformation project, so that you \u2013 I\u2019ll call it as a proof point. Mario Cortellacci : Great, thank you. And then just one more and I'll turn it over. Just on the Truvalue acquisition, you touched on the opportunity a little earlier. But maybe you can talk about how it's differentiated. You have other competitors that are a little more qualitative, you have ones that are quantitative. I mean, where does Truvalue sit in the competitive environment. And then also, it's kind of like you also have 20 maybe plus ESG providers or vendors on your platform. Why did you choose Truvalue over one of the other ones? Phil Snow : So Truvalue, was one of the first ESG providers to leverage the machine learning and artificial intelligence in its collection process. So I would say it's more on the quantitative side Mario. So what the product does is it comes through unstructured text and looks for signals within that unstructured test using cognitive computing. So this -- which we're very excited about. So it was kind of a two part acquisition. It wasn't just the ESG signals that Truvalue was creating, it was the technology that they also were using. And this is technology we believe we can apply to other parts of our business. Mario Cortellacci : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from David Chu with Bank of America. David Chu : Hi, thank you. So just in terms of pricing, have you made any concessions during the COVID for customers that had tough times during the period? Phil Snow : Hi, David, it's Phil. Few months ago there were certainly a few clients that we spoke to that anticipated they were going to have some difficulty moving forward. So there were a couple of cases where we dealt with some of our clients to do what FactSet does best during these periods, which is really think about the long-term relationship, understand what our clients are going through, and in some cases, adjust for that. So typically it will end up being a win-win for some shorter term concessions or conversations. We\u2019ll also negotiate in terms of what that means for the longer term relationship. And that worked exceptionally well for us, over the last 20 years when clients are going through these types of issues. As I mentioned in the script, I think there's a lot more conviction in the markets now and a lot less uncertainty for all of us as we enter calendar year 2021. So I don't anticipate that we'll be having many more of those conversations. David Chu : Got it. That's helpful. And what are you hearing about client market data budgets, just wondering if COVID is having a material impact? Or is it going to be a relatively normal year? Phil Snow : I believe it's going to be a relatively normal year. Just going back to the comments I made, when -- around Toni's question is the clients are looking to consolidate their technology and data into a lower number of providers. And in some cases that may -- and that may be the lowest span for them as they face their cost pressures. But even in those cases, we are well-positioned to take market share. So when you sit down with a client and you're able to provide a holistic solution for them over the longer term, that can end up being a win-win if they can see ways to be more efficient and we can see ways to help them for the long run and improve the amounts of wallet share that they spend with us that's good for both the client and FactSet. David Chu : Got it, makes sense. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Kevin McVeigh : Great, thanks. Hey, Phil, you mentioned that kind of the demand for differentiated data has never been higher. But then sounds like your third party content costs were down in the quarter. Is that just some of the tech transformation or just any thoughts as to, so would think, more differentiated data would mean maybe more investment, but it seems like the third party content costs, you've been able to manage them pretty well. Any thoughts around those two dynamics? Phil Snow : Well, this -- when we -- our entire content costs are third party content. So things we may get from other providers. But they also -- we also spend a lot ourselves on technology, on content and investing in content. So I don't think the amount that we're investing for example in deep sectoral private markets would necessarily be represented in that third party content. Helen do you have more color on that? Helen Shan : Yeah, Phil happy to answer that. So we manage our budget pretty tightly. I would say we have more content set providers, but we've been very judicious in making sure that we're rationalizing them appropriately as well. Because that might be in the form of price, that might be in the form of where we have duplication that we are doing it more efficiently. But the actual number of content providers have increased from a third party perspective. Kevin McVeigh : That\u2019s helpful. And then just as you think about ESG from a client perspective into 2021, do you feel like you have the data set you currently need or would there be maybe more tuck in acquisitions? It just -- it seems like that's going to be an area more focused particularly amongst U.S. clients than what 2020 was? Phil Snow : There'll be more demand. So whether it's a third party, that we're able to integrate through the marketplace or through the workstation, or if there are other assets out there that makes sense for us to own directly we'll look at that. But I think you're right, that's the trend and we anticipate. We'll have more of it on Fact. And that's one of the beauties of our platform is that, people love the concordance and the fact that they can come into one environment and get everything in one place and apply software to those different contents. Kevin McVeigh : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. So maybe you could give a little bit more detail on some of the ASG drivers, and like where you saw some cancellations and some of the things that were -- comments that were in the press release about wealth management and analytics being slower growth versus the research product being faster. It -- will it be counter to what I kind of expected and what's actually driving the revenue right now? So probably maybe can you give us a little bit more detail on what's going on? Phil Snow : Sure. So hopefully, you can hear me above the ambulances that are outside my window, right now. The -- so yeah, those are relative numbers to last year Shlomo. So we're I think we're minus 7 and last year, we might have been minus 3 for Q1. So the research numbers were down, they typically are in Q1. You'll see some soon over there in terms of the banking relationships, because just the retention was higher than it was last year. We could see a little bit more weakness in analytics and wealth than we did in Q1 of last year. And CTS kind of held in there pretty well. So again, it's a small quarter. Those are relative numbers in terms of what's affecting the growth rate. I think what we see as we look out for Q2, which is typically a much bigger quarter is probably going to be a better indication just from an -- from an absolute contribution standpoint, which of our businesses are going to be driving the rest of the growth in the first half. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Then just could you talk a little bit about the selling environment? You've talked a lot about high confidence and it\u2019s a fact your sales people are doing so much more remotely? Is that hampering anything at all? And I guess, if you kind of level set, the growth has been fairly the same over the last several quarters within several tens of basis points. Do you think, if we were not in COVID environment and your sales people were out there meeting people face to face, the growth would be higher, just trying to get some sense as to understand what kind of environment you feel like you're in? Phil Snow : I believe, it would have been higher over the last six to nine months, just intuitively. Moving forward though, I think we're probably getting to equilibrium. It's easier to sell to smaller clients in a short-term environment as we learn how to operate. So I think some of the momentum, you're going to see probably in Q2 is related to research and CTS as a core workstation, and the feeds business. But as we look out for the rest of the year, we're learning how to interact with clients, as I mentioned, like that these blueprinting exercises, we were able to do those virtually. And typically, those are more analytics heavy, right, in terms of the workflow going from research all the way through the client reporting. So FactSet and our clients have been learning at the same time. And I do you think we're going to reach a nice equilibrium in terms of being able to effectively monetize some of the products that are more sophisticated and have a longer sales cycle. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Alex Kramm : Yeah, hey, Good morning, everyone. Just a quick follow-up on the question just prior. On cancellations in particular, can you give us a little bit more detail of what you're seeing, what type of clients and also what kind of services and why? And I think you highlighted EMEA as particularly an area of elevated cancellations if I read that correctly. So again, same question what exactly are you seeing and like what type of products? What type of clients and the region? Phil Snow : There were a couple of lumpier cancels in EMEA, Alex, I believe were hedge funds. Helen, I don't know if you've got any more detail on\u2026 Helen Shan : Yes. I think that's right. I mean, this is a low quarter. So when you have something that cancels Alex, it becomes more impactful. So yes, I would say to clients that are in that hedge fund space with reduction. So that said, that EMEA [ph] impacts more in this quarter and then maybe into other quarter. And I think what we talked a bit about is the slowdown in decision making so often we would new wins offsetting that as well. But I wouldn't say there\u2019s a concentration in any particular type of businesses, or cancellation of anything the one that Phil talked about earlier, is that in research, we saw better than in previous years or at least previous year in terms of cancellation outlook. Alex Kramm : Fair enough. And then just another quick one on deep sector, I don't think you gave us an update today. I think you've been at this journey for what two years or so now. Any updates on take up, but also any more specific numbers you can put around this at this point in terms of how much does this contribute to ASV as this, I think should be an area -- one of your growth areas going forward? Phil Snow : We're about 15 months in Alex to this initiative. And we're very pleased with what we've been able to accomplish on the product side. So the team is fully built out. And we're well on our way to delivering two or three of those sectors in great detail. So where you're going to see that show up at the beginning is in the research numbers. So it's going to help with retention, particularly on the banking side. And over time, I believe it's going to help drive new adoption across all types of clients and we're also going to be able to monetize this data in feeds. So we'll be releasing pretty shortly, some deep sector feeds that would show up in the CTS number. Alex Kramm : Very good. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks for taking my question. Maybe Helen, a quick clarification, do you provide the cost saving from lower T&E because of the ongoing pandemic if there's a way to quantify that? Helen Shan : Sure. And are you talking about longer term or are you talking this quarter\u2019s specifically? Ashish Sabadra : Yes. Just the quarter. Helen Shan : Yeah, so in this quarter, I would say it's sort of a continuation of what we saw last year. So I would say it's around a point of savings if I just look at it purely year-over-year. That being said, we did -- we covered -- used that to help cover some of our higher expense as well in both compensation as well for our technology spend. Ashish Sabadra : That's helpful, and then Helen, also on the longer term, how should we think about what's the -- how should we think about this permanent reduction going forward? Helen Shan : Yeah, well, that in a normal environment that's a little bit of a hard one that we are looking to get back into that, and that will be beyond this year. We think that's around 25 maybe 50 basis points. Let's compare that to 2019 in a more normal environment. Then I would say that's benefit we can see come through. I would look to that, whether that comes purely in funding some of our new initiatives in that, that we'll be seeing that, that's where I want to see more permanent structural change. Ashish Sabadra : That's very helpful. And maybe a quick clarifying question on the headcount growth in sales and content, particularly on the sales side. I was wondering if you could provide any color on any geographies or verticals or products that you're more focused on the sales front. And same on the content side, is it part of the deep sector strategy? Any color on both of those fronts? Thanks. Helen Shan : I'll take a shot at that. So as we think about our sales front, I think Phil mentioned this earlier, and also talked about in our last call. It is in areas that we believe we have a lot of opportunities. So in CTS for example, where we've invested more on sales front, upselling in new business and corporate is another area. So it's not necessarily any particular geography, it's much more where we feel that we had some good opportunities to reach our resources in that area.  On the content side, I think that is in a couple of different places. Yes, this is actually where we put the most, but also I think in the areas of private markets, as we are spending more of our investment. Ashish Sabadra : That's very helpful. Thanks. Helen Shan : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to drill in a bit deeper into the selling environment. You provided some details on cancellations in the quarter. Can you elaborate on where you're seeing longer sales cycles and how client budgets are evolving on average year-over-year? Phil Snow : George, I think I talked about that a little bit with Shlomo. So the sales cycle for our analytics suite, when we do the portfolio life cycle and sit down with a client to talk about their entire digital transformation, that can be a six month plus exercise, whereas the sales cycles for just deploying FactSet workstations or feeds are probably getting shorter, frankly, just because it's so much more efficient to do things virtually. George Tong : And then the question on client budgets, how are those evolving on average year-over-year? Phil Snow : We don't have visibility into client budgets exactly on what their -- the clients typically don't share that with us at that level of detail. So it's really hard for us to give you an accurate number. George Tong : Got it, okay. So\u2026 Helen Shan : The way to think of it is [technical difficulty] and there's the BAU [ph] on the business budget under the digital transformation budget. So where are we --Phil is exactly right, we don't ask our client number [ph] or anything like that, but they are clearly spending more also in that second budget and that's where a lot of the conversation Phil was alluding to in [indiscernible] that's where that is more focused on. George Tong : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And just as a follow-up question, customer count in the quarter grew faster than ASV, similar to earlier periods, and you noted that you've been seeing more wealth and more corporate clients. Can you elaborate on the spending propensity of these clients relative to other types of clients? Phil Snow : The spending capacity of smaller clients, is that your question? George Tong : The spending propensity of wealth and corporate clients which appear to be growing faster than other types of clients. Phil Snow : I think those are typically smaller clients that we sell, George. So those are I think typically with a smaller client, they're able to make a decision more quickly. And on the corporate side, I think typically we've seen that sale cycle to be pretty short again, because it's going to be a workstation type deal rather than a broad analytics conversation that we might have with an asset owner or an asset manager. George Tong : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jake Williams with Wells Fargo. Jake Williams : Good morning, everyone. Helen Shan : Good morning. Jake Williams : Can we assume that this is Truvalue Lab acquisition indicates an increased focus on owning data in the CTS space as opposed to reselling or do you think you'll take more of a continued hybrid approach moving forward? Phil Snow : Well, this is just a continuation of the last few decades. So FactSet has a lot of proprietary data that we collect ourselves and half of our employees are in the business of collecting or engineering the collection of content. So Truvalue is really very small compared to the overall content budget or strategy that we have. It's a very good indication of something that we can act on. That's where the current trends. But it's going to be like it's been for the last 10 or 20 years in terms of us integrating more and more data onto our platform, either through third parties, through data that we collect ourselves organically or through acquisitions. But it's hard to draw any real conclusions from such a small acquisition. Jake Williams : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Our last question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Keith Housum : Good morning, guys. Just wanted to drill down a bit further on a Truvalue acquisition. I know you had a lot of questions already. But the run rate here is $5 million. So I guess first question is that pretty much all the revenue that comes with Truvalue and then does this give you the foothold you need in ESG, or do you need to do a tack-on acquisitions in order to make this a bigger part of your business and part of your strategy going forward? Phil Snow : Well, it's an asset that we're very excited about. I think you've got the number right, and it's one that's growing in very healthy double digits. So we think we can -- like some of the unique content that we've acquired over the years, the Revere Data set was a good example. We believe we can get a really amplified return for unique content like this if you integrate it through the FactSet platform. ESG is going to be a big trend. We believe that's going to continue, so we'll keep our eye out for other things that we believe it's important for us to own. But more importantly, we want to be that platform where people come to analyze the data if they want to not just get it through a feed or an API examine for example, but apply what FactSet does really well which is concur the data together and provide an environment where clients can really analyze the data the way that they wanted it. Keith Housum : Got you. And changing gears I guess, slightly here to your guidance. How much of your guidance is dependent in terms of going back to work sometime during the fiscal year? Or what is your assumption in terms of returning back to work in the fiscal year? Phil Snow : I don't think it\u2019s -- well go ahead Helen. Helen Shan : I don't think anything has changed. At this juncture, we were assuming that maybe it's more of back half of the year, more of a return. And that will be more from a cost perspective than anything [technical difficulty] we're operating quite well. And also from the way we\u2019ve been performing the last three quarters. Keith Housum : Great. Thank you. Operator : And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Phil Snow for any closing remarks. Phil Snow : Thank you all for joining us today. I'm encouraged by the conversations we're having with our largest clients and the continued progress our team has made on our investment plan. I look forward to executing on a robust pipeline and to continuing to help our clients solve problems and access critical data anytime anywhere. While the prolonged uncertainty makes our annual performances it has been in the past a tale of two halves. We remain focused on developing our content, technology and people as well as delivering value for our shareholders. Please be well this holiday season and if you have any additional questions call Rima Hyder. We look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Operator, that ends today's call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation you may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference to your speaker today, Rima Hyder, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Rima Hyder : Thank you, Joelle. Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to FactSet\u2019s second fiscal quarter 2021 earnings call. We continue to be in various remote locations today. We may have some audio quality issues and we really appreciate your patience should we experience a disruption. Before we begin, I would like to point out that the slides we will reference during this presentation can be accessed via the webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at factset.com. The slides will be posted on our website at the conclusion of this call. A replay of today\u2019s call will be available via phone and on our website. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions from investors. To be fair to everyone, please limit yourself to one question plus one follow-up. Before we discuss our results, I encourage all listeners to review the legal notice on Slide 2, which explains the risks of forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the appendix to the presentation and in our earnings release issued earlier today. Joining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer and Helen Shan, Chief Financial Officer. I\u2019d now like to turn the discussion over to Phil Snow. Phil Snow : Thanks, Rima and good morning everyone. I am pleased with our solid second quarter and overall first half results and the investments we have made to further advance our offerings in both content and workflow solutions are resonating. Over the past 12 months, we have proven our resilience and our ability to strengthen our value to clients and we begin the second half of this fiscal year with good momentum, greater visibility and continued confidence in our ability to execute. Our investments in content and technology are progressing at pace and we see market validation of our strategy with some key wins this quarter. Our content advances, particularly in deep sector, are being well-received by clients, especially across the sell side, supporting workstation growth. And our focus on digital transformation allows us to offer more personalized solutions and an increasing number of ways to deliver value to clients. The market is looking for solutions that are both easy to integrate and unite the front, middle and back office and we are well positioned to capitalize on this trend. Our shift to the public cloud is progressing according to plan, with the majority of our new storage and collection centers successfully migrated. This quarter, we are particularly pleased to see growth in our core workstation offering. The efforts we have made through our investment strategy are starting to drive our top line, and we delivered a strong first half due to our ability to execute on our product line with continued discipline. In our second quarter, our organic ASV plus professional services growth rate accelerated to 5.5%. This acceleration was led by our sales team effectively growing wallet share with existing clients as well as capturing a higher price increase in the Americas. This was partially offset by cancellations, largely across asset management firms. We are pleased that our performance resulted in increased adjusted operating margin and EPS, and we have good momentum going into our second half. We have reaffirmed our ability to deliver results within our guidance of fiscal \u201821 and are raising the lower end of our full year organic ASV growth range to $70 million from $55 million. Helen will explain in more detail shortly. Turning now to the performance in our regions, the Americas growth accelerated to 6%, driven by strong sales of workstations in research and wealth solutions and data feeds in CTS solutions. Our research solutions had a particularly good quarter, supported by our digital transformation and the expansion of our deep sector content offering. This was evident from wins with our large existing banking clients who benefited from our tailored workflows, which allow them a more connected and personalized experience. CTS also had a successful quarter as clients bought more of our core and premium data feeds. And in wealth, we\u2019re extremely pleased with the RBC win. This was an entirely virtual rollout, and I\u2019m proud of how quickly and seamlessly our team integrated our adviser dashboard workflow and CRM solutions for RBC\u2019s entire wealth management team. Asia-Pac accelerated its growth rate to 9% due to strong performance in Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia. We saw wins at institutional asset managers and data providers with our research and CTS solutions. EMEA\u2019s growth remained at 4% with wins across the region, most notably in France and the Nordics. The region benefited from increased sales of CTS and wealth solutions to asset owners and institutional asset managers as well as accelerating new business. Our diversifying client base continues to see mission critical data, and we see strong demand for our growing content offering. We are pleased with the progress we are making in the ESG market as we further integrate our ESG products into clients\u2019 everyday workflows. We have already expanded our ESG content suite with the launch of Truvalue\u2019s UN Sustainable Development Goals monitor. This is in addition to a new joint offering with Ping An Insurance Group, which offers ESG metrics on companies incorporated in Mainland China. Overall, we see a long runway for growth as we execute more enterprise-wide deals and believe that every touch point with clients today represents an opportunity to cross-sell in the future. The conversations we are having, combined with our sales team\u2019s execution, make us optimistic that we will continue to grow our market share long term. In summary, our focus continues to be on achieving higher growth and providing clients with effective and efficient solutions across the entire investment workflow. We remain committed to our investment strategy and to living our purpose, which is to drive the investment community to see more, think bigger and do their best work. And we are starting to see the rewards of the efforts we are making. We continue to push ourselves to be a more diverse, inclusive and impactful organization. To that end, I am pleased to say we recently hired our first Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer as part of our strategy to strengthen our organizational accountability, increase diversity across all levels of our company and ensure workforce equity. We know we have more work to do and remain committed to furthering our efforts. I am pleased with our progress as we strive to be the best place to work and give our employees the flexibility they need to thrive in the new normal. I am proud of the ways in which we are showing up for one another and for our clients every day. With that, I will now turn things over to Helen, who will take you through the specifics of our second quarter and first half 2021 performance. Helen Shan : Thank you, Phil and hello everyone. I hope that you and your loved ones continue to be safe and healthy. I am proud of the FactSet team for finding new ways this past year to support both our clients and each other. Today, I will share more details on our performance to-date and to provide an update to our annual outlook. For the first half of fiscal 2021, we grew our revenue by 6%, expanded our adjusted operating margin by 60 basis points and increased our adjusted EPS by 9% year-over-year. Our multiyear investment plan is on track and beginning to materialize in top line growth. Last quarter, we welcomed Truvalue add to FactSet. I am pleased to report that the integration of the team and of the ESG technology assets is largely complete. As with our previous acquisitions, we will exclude any revenue and ASV associated with Truvalue while reporting out our organic-related metrics for the fiscal year 2021. As Phil stated earlier, we grew organic ASV plus professional services by 5.5%, an acceleration from the first quarter that reflects the diligent execution of our pipeline, powered by healthy demand for workstations and data feeds. Ongoing investments in our core solutions continue to resonate with clients. As reflected in our annual Americas [indiscernible] increase, which totaled $14 million, $2 million more than the prior year. As the previous years, our annual price increase was a contributor to ASV and again this year, further accelerating our growth rate. For the second quarter, GAAP revenue increased by 6% to $392 million, while organic revenue, which excludes any impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and deferred revenue amortization, declined 20% to $389 million. Growth was driven primarily by our analytics and CTS solutions. For our geographic segment, revenue growth for the Americas was at 7%, EMEA at 3% and Asia-Pacific at 10%. All regions primarily benefited from increases in our analytics and CTS solutions. GAAP operating expenses grew 5% in the second quarter to $276 million and impacted by a higher cost of sales. Compared to the previous year, our GAAP operating margin expanded by 90 basis points to 30% and our adjusted operating margin increased by 80 basis points to 33%. These improvements were largely due to net savings from continued productivity for our workforce mix and a reduction in discretionary expenses, including those related to travel, office and professional services. These benefits were partially offset by higher spend in both compensation and technology. As a percentage of revenue, our cost of sales was 230 basis points higher than last year on a GAAP basis and 170 basis points higher on an adjusted basis. This increase is driven by higher technology spend related to our shift to the public cloud and increased compensation expense for existing employees as well as new talent to support a multiyear investment plan. When expressed as a percentage of revenue, SG&A improved year-over-year by 320 basis points on a GAAP basis and 250 basis points on an adjusted basis. The primary drivers include materially lower travel and entertainment costs and reduced spend due to office closures offset in part by higher compensation costs. These results are in line with our expectations, as noted in our full year guidance. As discussed on previous calls, we planned for an incremental investment spend of $15 million each year starting in 2020 through 2022, while realizing full benefits from productivity and a delayed ramp up in hiring last year, we are on track to spend around $26 million in our fiscal FY \u201821. As noted on last quarter\u2019s call, we are also using a portion of the pandemic savings to invest further in both sales and new product development. Moving on, our tax rate for the quarter was 16% compared to last year\u2019s rate of 14%, primarily due to lower tax benefits realized from stock option exercises this quarter. GAAP EPS increased 9% to $2.50 this quarter versus $2.30 in the prior year. The adjusted diluted EPS grew 7% at $2.72. Both EPS figures were largely driven by improved operating results, partially offset by higher tax rates. A reconciliation of our adjustments to GAAP EPS is disclosed at the end of our press release. Free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations plus capital spending, was $130 million for the quarter, an increase of 75% over the same period last year. This increase is primarily due to the timing of certain tax payments and lower capital expenditures as we have completed the majority of our office build-out. For the first quarter, our ASV retention continued to be above 95%. We grew our total number of clients by 7% compared to the prior year, reaching over 6,000 clients for the first time in our history. This growth reflects the addition of more wealth and corporate clients as well as data providers and asset owners, an ongoing trend we have continued to \u2013 as we continue to diversify our client base. Our client retention improved to 90% year-over-year, which speaks both to the mission criticality of our solutions and the solid efforts of our sales teams. Our user count grew 12% year-over-year and cost of total of $150,000 largely due to additional wealth and research workstation users. As noted in our press release this morning, we revised the methodology for how we define our users to capture more expenses across all our solutions. We have provided revised user counts for the last 8 quarters at the end of the press release. For the second quarter, we repurchased over 221,000 shares of our common stock for a total of $72 million at an average share price of $322. Our Board of Directors recently authorized an additional $206 million to our share repurchase program, bringing our total size to $350 million, in line with recent years. We remain disciplined in our buyback program and committed to returning long-term value to our shareholders. Given our solid first half performance and improved visibility for the rest of the year, we are bringing up the lower end of our organic ASV post-productional services growth guidance range from $55 million to $70 million. So, our full range is now $70 million to $85 million. This raises our midpoint from what we set first at this guidance 6 months ago. Client demand for our enhanced solutions alongside the momentum built by our sales team gives us greater conviction in our second halfway point. Based on the first half results, we are encouraged by the client response to our enhanced product suite reflected in both growth and new clients as well as increased expansion with existing clients. We do remain in an uncertain environment as different parts of the world begin to recover from this pandemic. Our full year views take into account as clients continue to performance in current market conditions and that additional delays in decision-making and taking client budgets could impact our short-term performance. The global environment will continue to present challenges, but we believe we are well-positioned for the longer term. With that, we are now ready for your questions. I will turn this over to Joelle. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is now open. Manav Patnaik : Yes, hi. Good morning. So, I just wanted to ask early in the call you talked about the move to public cloud is going well. And I just wanted to maybe take a step back and I was hoping you could help us just appreciate where FactSet today is in terms of its tech stack and how long do you think you get to where you want to be? Phil Snow : Yes. Thanks, Manav. Yes, when we published our 3-year plan six quarters ago, we have a 3-year window to get 80% into the public cloud, which will just give us, I think, a lot of advantages in terms of speed and agility across how we develop products and how we deliver product to our clients. So I\u2019d say we\u2019re on pace. We are halfway through that journey. We\u2019re already beginning to see a lot of the benefits from being in the public cloud. So that is a major piece of the move from a technology standpoint. I would say the second thing is opening up the platform. So providing APIs to access FactSet content and analytics, whether or not you\u2019re our clients and you want to just program directly against our database or if you want to access it through some other means through some other channel, we are making that available as well. And it should also make FactSet easier to integrate with other third party systems. So that\u2019s another important aspect of that. So overall, we\u2019re pleased. I\u2019d say we are halfway through that original plan. We are a technology company. So of course, that never ends. But we are beginning to definitely see some of the benefits of the work that we have been doing. Manav Patnaik : Okay, got it. And then just on Truvalue Labs and the ESG integration you talked about, I guess I just wanted to appreciate maybe better what the strategy there was or would Truvalue Labs be kind of like StreetAccount in many ways in terms of a good offering just integrated in your packages? Phil Snow : Yes. I would say it\u2019s still different than StreetAccount. So we certainly have a fantastic product there that we can sell today as its own offering. That will continue. Very often, that\u2019s to feed these days. However, we have done a lot of work already to integrate the Truvalue Labs data through the FactSet workflows. So I think we all sort of recognize that ESG is very important and will be a piece of just about everybody\u2019s workflow in some way, shape or form. So for us, making sure that you can access ESG directly or as an overlay, whether you\u2019re a research analyst, you\u2019re a quant, maybe you want to look at your portfolios and group things a certain way or add in some metrics, we want to make sure that all of that\u2019s available through our platform. And one of the advantages, again, of using FactSet is you can seamlessly stitch together all those workflows. So we have learned a lot in terms of integration during our lifetime. And this has been one of the faster integrations of both the people and the technology and the content that I have seen. So we are well on our way. We\u2019re very optimistic about ESG as a theme and we think we will begin to see the benefits of that before too long. Manav Patnaik : Got it. Thank you so much. Phil Snow : Sure. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Toni Kaplan : Thank you. I wanted to ask about wealth and congratulations on the RBC win. Just in terms of the overall strategy and features there, I know you have the full-featured web deployed version that you created about 2 years ago. You have won some significant contracts. Just I guess, how are you tracking versus your expectations in wealth and how much opportunity is left there just given that you have been sort of ramping up in wealth over the last few years? Phil Snow : Thanks, Toni. We see a ton of opportunity in wealth. It\u2019s one of our fastest growing firm types that we sell into. Obviously, these big wins are very important because I think it gets us more noticed in the marketplace. And as advisers move around from firm to firm over the years, I think they will get used to using FactSet as a tool. So we think there is a ton of runway here. We see that there are a lot of interesting trends going on in the wealth space. And today, we own a small piece of the workflow. One thing that we\u2019re excited about is our Adviser Dashboard product, which essentially helps an adviser think about what their next best action is. So we\u2019re beginning to introduce cognitive computing to look at the clients\u2019 portfolios and the news associated with the holdings they have to really help them organize their day and so on. So we think that\u2019s unique and good opportunity for us. And we just think that in terms of the wealth space, there are lots of other places over time that we could begin to move into that would be accretive to FactSet. Toni Kaplan : That\u2019s great. And can you also just hone in on the sort of differentiators that you are offering? Are you winning more now because of the quality of the product or price or service? Just trying to understand, you have some momentum there, so I wanted to get to the bottom of that? Phil Snow : Yes, sure. On the product side, we have very good search functionality. So, it\u2019s very easy for an adviser to come into our wealth offering and find what it is they are looking for very quickly. That has been a big winner. And our web offering is seamless to navigate as well just in terms of sort of navigating from screen to screen. The speed of the product is really good. So if you are an adviser and you are managing the assets of 200 families or individuals being able to kind of get around quickly is important and service has been a big piece of this, Toni. So, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we were able to virtually rollout this offering to, I think 8,000 advisers really quickly. And in some ways, doing it virtually was easier than how we might have done it 2 years ago, which would be literally to fly around to almost every city we could to train people in person. So we have learned a lot about efficiency over the last year and that\u2019s been a good experience on both sides. So, I think it\u2019s that classic FactSet combo of the product and the service that\u2019s really allowing us to win here and it\u2019s the investments that we made in technology that I just spoke about that are allowing us to scale, upload more portfolios and support more people than we might have been able to do on our old tech set. Toni Kaplan : Thank you. Phil Snow : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Hamzah Mazari : Good morning. Just had a question on the ASV acceleration, is that all \u2013 I know you touched on the prepared comments with pricing, but is that all the RBC win in the ASV acceleration or is there anything else in there, I know you touched on pricing? And then as part of that, is there a reason why the low end of the revenue guide wasn\u2019t raised but you did raise the ASV guide on the low end? Phil Snow : Yes, sure. So let me \u2013 I\u2019ll try to answer both of those. And Helen, please chime in on the second one, if there\u2019s more to be said. So in terms of the acceleration, Hamzah, we are seeing very good performance from our research offering. So the core workstation and core web offerings are doing very well. So yes, obviously, it was a really nice win and a lot of the users you see there in terms of the increase were driven from that. But we are also doing exceptionally well with our large banking clients in terms of renewals and the adoption, just more usage through our deep sector offering so that certainly has been a driver. And we have seen I think good uplift in terms of buy side as well in terms of the research offering. So I think it\u2019s that core FactSet workstation that is performing well in this environment, given the investments that we\u2019ve made and some of the trends that are out there. So that\u2019s the main thing that I would attribute it to. And revenue always takes a long time to catch up to ASV. So a lot of our ASV comes in the second half and the amount of revenue that we capture from that isn\u2019t as much as we would from stuff that we closed in Q1 and you knew that in the Q1 we were sort of minus 7% out on the ASV side. Helen Shan : No, that\u2019s exactly right. Hamzah, thanks for your question. We are back end or back half loaded and I would say, even within the second half, we typically have strong Q4. That doesn\u2019t reflect or turn into revenue necessarily in year, so that\u2019s why we did not change our revenue guidance. Hamzah Mazari : That\u2019s very helpful. And just my follow-up question is just you had mentioned areas outside of wealth, whether it be corporate insurance, maybe private equity, maybe other areas, do you have to invest more in sales or go-to-market to be able to penetrate some of those verticals or do you have enough capacity that you can penetrate those verticals with sort of the headcount you have today? Phil Snow : Yes, we can do it with the headcount we have today. As I mentioned on the RBC win, we were able to deploy a large number of users very virtually. So, I think what we are learning is that for the non-enterprise-wide sales sort of selling and supporting our clients for the core workstation is something that we can do very efficiently and we are beginning to explore new ways of how to double down on that in terms of how we can get more of those clients at the smaller end more efficiently so that we can focus the rest of our resources on the larger, more enterprise-wide deployments. Hamzah Mazari : Got it. Thank you so much. Phil Snow : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Owen Lau : Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Could you please talk about your recent traction in the asset owner space? Do you have the ESG products you like to further penetrate into this area and what other products you think can help you increase your penetration? Thank you. Phil Snow : Yes, thanks for the question. In the asset owner space, our analytics suite really plays a big part there. So very often, when we are working with asset owners, we will be doing risk deployments or we will be doing portfolio analytics across either their internally managed or externally managed assets. So we are \u2013 we have done a lot of work as you know across the portfolio lifecycle and we have done a lot of work to invest in multi-asset class offerings. So, we do have some good momentum across different types of asset owners and it\u2019s a space that we are increasingly optimistic about. Owen Lau : Got it. And then could you please also talk about your partnership with Ping An? There are other ESG content providers in China. Can you talk about what is the value proposition of one connect and also is this content exclusive to FactSet users? Thanks. Phil Snow : Yes. So, we have a good relationship with Ping An in China. And I think they have developed some very good ESG content and we just \u2013 we are a good channel partner for them. So, I think where you will see this show up first of all, is in the open FactSet marketplace and then we should have plans to integrate that into the FactSet offering for the workflows that our clients care about. And I am not in a position to sort of talk about whether or not it\u2019s an exclusive. Owen Lau : Alright. Thank you very much. That\u2019s it for me. Phil Snow : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thanks so much. Hey, I wonder, can you give us a sense of where you are in the 3-year investment. I mean, it sounds like you are making good progress on the cloud, but maybe just a little more context within kind of analytic, CTS, wealth, I mean it sounds like on research side you are starting to see some benefits for that. But any sense of kind of benchmarks we should think about as we continue the transition to these investments? Helen Shan : Sure. I will take a \u2013 thank you, Kevin for the question. Let me take a shot at that. Kevin McVeigh : Sure. Thanks, Helen. Helen Shan : Yes, sure. So first, we have made some really solid progress as we have discussed and we\u2019re very confident in strategy going forward on content and technology. And the discussions that we have had over the past 12 months, if anything has really only reaffirmed that the investments that we are making is key for them, that\u2019s in content, digital transformation and on the personalization front. So in terms of where we are beginning to see some of that impact, we are seeing that in our workstation growth. We are going to talk about a bit more. So the investments we are making in this sector is really resonating with banking clients, for example. And in fact, some of the digital improvements we have made, has been part of one of the key wins and the availability that they have got through the cloud and the integration there. And then when you talk about CTS as well as on the analytics front, we are seeing pickup in APIs in our signals and CRM, APIs and concordance. And then the benefit from the cost perspective, some of the improvements we\u2019ve made is helping us on the automation on content collection, for example. So those are what we will look at as some of the real key deliverables that are beginning to come through this year and why we make the comment that the impact is happening as we expected and we are going to continue through as we invest for the rest of the year until 2022. Kevin McVeigh : And just real quick it seems like you picked up about 100 basis points of client retention, was that some of the actions you took as a result of COVID or just any thoughts as to what\u2019s driving that retention improvement? Helen Shan : Yes, sure. I think there is probably a mix. I mean that number can move a little bit around, but it\u2019s pretty stable as that 90%. What we tend to focus on more is on the ASV retention as well, but it really is we have been able to do some of the good renewals, I think the points that Phil made earlier on how we\u2019ve been able to continue to service folks very well with the faster implementation that we have done on our new products, it\u2019s really been the expansion that has really resonated. So, I think those are all those reasons on why we have been able to maintain, if not improve our client retention. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thank you. Helen Shan : You are welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is now open. Alex Kramm : Yes, hey, good morning everyone. Just coming back to the earlier question on ASV outlook and what changed there. It sounded to me like you said, you are more confident in some of those deals coming through. But can you talk about the pipeline as well, has the pipeline grown? And given some of the wins that you have had so far this year, like what was missing to maybe get a little bit more aggressive on the high end of the range as well? Phil Snow : Hey, Alex. Yes, we are very happy with the pipeline for the second half. So we do have a healthy pipeline. I would say for us to \u2013 and we certainly have a pipeline that could support the top end of our range. So, the things that I think would need to go right there would be the banking hiring in Q4. That\u2019s always a big variable for us. So, I think if the banks are having good hiring this year that bodes well for us just sort of given about some of the trends we already talked about on the sell side. We are optimistic that we will be able to execute on our Q3 price increase in EMEA and Asia-Pac, which comes after the Q2 price increase in the Americas. The one area of our business that slowed a little bit is analytics. It has, I think, the highest absolute ASC contribution in most years. And what\u2019s happening there, I believe is that because of the COVID environment, these longer sales cycle, more complicated implementations are taking a little bit longer. The analytics pipeline is very healthy. It\u2019s comparable to last year. So if we\u2019re able to execute on that well, I\u2019m optimistic about what that means in terms of ASV for the full year. Alex Kramm : Okay, great. And then just maybe, Helen, for you, can you give us an update on the margin trajectory here? I mean I think you had a fairly good start to the year. I think you have said before that the margins should trickle down lower. But I think given what you\u2019ve done so far and you didn\u2019t change anything with the guidance there, it still suggests a decent step-down in the second half. So maybe just refresh us on where that\u2019s coming from and if there could be any upside to what you\u2019ve currently laid out? Thanks. Helen Shan : Sure, we\u2019ll do. And thanks for the question. I\u2019ll touch a bit on Q2 and then talk about H2, which will be more of the same, so it might be helpful. So we\u2019ve been very pleased with the improvement that we\u2019ve driven year-over-year as it relates to the operating results. Part of that is clearly due to higher revenue as well. But if we think about the uptick on the cost, it reflects in a couple of different ways. The increased investments that we\u2019ve made in our deep sector of content collection, digital capabilities, those are coming through in higher salary and technology costs. We also have made additional hiring in sales and product development as we talked about last quarter, and that\u2019s reflected in the 8% growth in our headcount year-over-year. In terms of a headwind that we had this quarter, it was a bit on FX, which impacted our margin about 30, 35 basis points. And then offsetting all of that is the continued efficiencies that we\u2019re getting through the workforce mix. We moved shift again to help lower cost countries by another 1%. We\u2019ve had reduced professional fees this quarter, services cost this quarter. We do expect that to pick back up in the second half. So that might be \u2013 that is more of a timing issue. And of course, we are getting the benefit of being out of the office and change though after this quarter, we\u2019re going to start to lap the previous year. So when we think about the second half, you\u2019re exactly right, Alex, we do expect costs to ramp up further. And that\u2019s in part driven by the investment plan for sure. As I mentioned in my remarks, we are \u2013 we believe we\u2019ll have around $26 million of costs related to the investment in this year versus more like $15 million last year. And we\u2019re seeing that salary run rate start to really pick up. And a lot of the investments that we are needing are more specialized, so they tend to be in the little higher cost country. So we see that pick up. Professional fees, we believe, as we\u2019re employing others to help us on the execution implementation front that\u2019s going to pick up. And we\u2019re still having the double carrying costs between the cloud and the data centers. And then we also have the full absorption of the dilution from the TVL acquisition as well. We will see what kind of costs we\u2019ll have to have as it relates to the offices, hopefully, reopening as business starts to get closer to whatever that level of normal is so that could be an offset. And we continue to be focused, of course, on managing the spend and any discretionary costs that we have. So we will be focused on driving that as we have over the past 2.5 years. Alex Kramm : Great color. Thank you very much. Helen Shan : You are welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Chu with Bank of America. Your line is now open. David Chu : Hi. Thanks. So subscriber count was up roughly like 6,700 in the \u2013 versus the first quarter. And I think RBC brought over about 8,000 users, so just wondering if user count sells on a quarter-over-quarter basis on an underlying basis ex the RBC users? Helen Shan : Sorry, I\u2019ll take a shot at that one. Thanks for your question. So the total number of subscribers, I think we talked about how we have recaptured in some cases of that. That RBC is a piece of that or a big piece of that. But overall, user accounts were up subscribers were up in both wealth and corporate. So that is \u2013 and corporate, while they are a smaller number in terms of each firm, there is quite a few of them. So, both of them are driving the increase on the subscriber side. David Chu : Okay. And then if I can focus on margins more broadly over like the next few years. So just given the recent strong performance, and it feels like an increased focus on cost since, Helen, you\u2019ve been there taking over as CFO, just wondering if there is any reason you can\u2019t get above the historical 33% to 34% range. Just wondering if there is anything structurally that would suggest that, that\u2019s the long-term range go forward? Helen Shan : Yes. I don\u2019t \u2013 as you know, we don\u2019t necessarily talk about our long-term margin. Right now, if you take a look at our history, especially back where we were able to do a pretty material expansion in our margins, we took the opportunity to reinvest and reinvesting in what we\u2019re doing in \u201820 as well as in \u201821, part of the drivers of margin as you know with the top line growth, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing. So I don\u2019t look at what we have as a structural issue as much as we\u2019re investing. And as we get the top line to grow, given the benefit that was aligned for our clients, we would expect our margins to be improving as we continue to drive more of the top line growth. David Chu : Okay, thank you. Helen Shan : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is now open. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Hey, Phil and Helen, I thought I would just circle back to the one of the questions you touched on before, just in terms of the validation of moving to the cloud. I apologize if I missed this, but were there specific examples of products or something like that, that you\u2019re seeing the uptake in sales on or new products that were generated because you were moving to the cloud that gave you the faster product development, they are able to point to in terms of that validation. If you can talk about that a little bit and then I\u2019ll have a follow-up after that. Phil Snow : Sure. Thanks, Shlomo. So, one of the things that I mentioned in my comments was moving our content collection efforts to the cloud. So we have been working on sort of refactoring how we collect content and how we store content so that we can onboard content more quickly. So when you talk about deep sector, private markets, very often, these data sets can be orders of magnitude more than we\u2019ve been used to collecting in the past. So that was a very important piece of work that we\u2019ve been undergoing. So we\u2019re beginning to see some of the benefits of that. More will come later, I believe, on both the products and the cost side as we complete that work. So that\u2019s one good example. The APIs and the endpoints that we\u2019re setting up, those are also getting some pretty good adoption, particularly in analytics. So that\u2019s a great example. And then I think when you consider some of the work we\u2019re doing with firms like Snowflake, for example, where we\u2019re able to sort of work with them and provide our data feeds and our concordance as a service, all of this is wrapped up into our digital transformation efforts. So \u2013 there is a lot of foundational work here, a lot of costs associated with moving, but there \u2013 the real payoff will come when the work is completed over the next year or two. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, thank you. And then just the European organic growth at 1.5%, is that kind of a legacy thing from some of the client cancellations in a quarter or two ago that you just need to work through or how should we think about that? Phil Snow : Yes, we saw a slowdown in Europe. We did have one pretty large cancellation this quarter actually that had to do with the digital offering. So it was \u2013 you remember, we acquired IDMS a few years back, and this was a pretty large bank in Europe that had a big digital offering there. So it was a legacy product that we ended up losing, which contributed to some of that slowdown, but I\u2019d characterize that as more of a one-off. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, thank you. Phil Snow : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is now open. Andrew Nicholas : Thanks. Good morning. It seems like there is been quite a bit of M&A in the portfolio management space, particularly of late. And so I\u2019m wondering if you could update us on how you\u2019re thinking about your product suite there, how it stacks up competitively? And whether there are any product gaps or opportunities that you would like to address in the near to medium term, whether it\u2019s organically or via M&A? Phil Snow : So the question is around consolidation within the asset management space? Just to clarify. Andrew Nicholas : Yes, that and just the portfolio management kind of technology space as well and how that kind of \u2013 if other players are kind of moving up the chain or adding pieces to their suite, if that\u2019s changed, how your offering stacks up competitively? Phil Snow : Yes, good question. So consolidation, obviously, has been going on for a long time in our end markets. And I\u2019ve mentioned this on previous calls, but we are having more and more exciting conversations with our asset management clients at the C level. So very often now, we\u2019ll be talking to CTOs, CIOs about FactSet\u2019s overall offering from research, all the way through the client reporting. And as these firms are consolidating, the equation for them gets more and more complicated in terms of how do they rationalize their spend across a large number of vendors and how do they make sense out of that technology stack and how they are managing their own data throughout their workflows. So we are so well positioned for these conversations now, given the offerings we have all the way across the portfolio life cycle and the integration that we\u2019ve done and our move to the cloud. So when we sit down with our clients now and talk about the trends in the marketplace that they are dealing with, which in some ways are the same trends we\u2019re dealing with as a technology company, we\u2019re having really good conversations about how we can help them. So there is a big push, I believe, within the asset management space for these larger asset managers, particularly that are stitching together different entities to really simplify their lives, which means simplify the number of technology providers they deal with and simplify the number of data providers they deal with. So we\u2019re running towards those conversations. And these are longer term efforts with our clients, but I\u2019m very encouraged by the level of conversations that our sales and technology teams are having with clients on the buy side. Andrew Nicholas : Okay, thanks. And on... Phil Snow : Yes. The second part of your question is these larger asset managers really only want to deal with sort of one or maybe two major partners to build their ecosystem around. And there is a pretty short list, frankly, of firms that are able to do that for them. And FactSet is one of the firms on the shortlist. So there is some consolidation, there are other people kind of moving into the space, as you mentioned. But in terms of firms that have the number of workflows and a critical massive content for the clients, that\u2019s a pretty short list. Andrew Nicholas : That\u2019s helpful. Helen Shan : And maybe I could just add. When we talk about adding on capabilities, you can do that via the acquisition of, I think, what you\u2019re saying more of a technology type of asset. But often, the assets that we have seen even with Truvalue come with their own or more content or feed is they actually have a lot of their own proprietary capabilities, which adds quite a lot to us as well. So I wouldn\u2019t look at pure technology capabilities that happen to be obtained purely from technology acquisitions. Andrew Nicholas : Got it. Got it. That\u2019s all very helpful. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, and variations of this question have been asked and you\u2019ve answered some of them. I guess I\u2019m just wondering, you announced the 3-year investment program in 2019. Obviously, a lot has happened since then. But I\u2019m wondering, given what seems like a bit more stable sales environment, how you\u2019re thinking about that high single-digit ASP growth target? I know it was originally estimated to be 2022. But how has that time line evolved or changed? And how are you thinking about that over the next couple of years? Thank you. Helen Shan : Yes, I\u2019ll take that one. And right now, we\u2019ve been catching up. The world has changed. But we are on plan, as you noted, in terms of our hiring and development milestones as we expected for this fiscal year. And our focus right now is executing and determining any changes that we\u2019ll adapt to in the macro environment as we think about next year. We\u2019re committed to our multiyear plan. And as I said from the beginning, we really reaffirmed in some sense on our strategy. But the environment continue to be uncertain, so we\u2019re taking a continued measured approach. And our goal is to get to what we talked about a longer term growth rates. And the timing of may have shut. But once we\u2019ve got better visibility on our progress and the market, then we\u2019ll be able to provide greater clarity and an update. But for now, we\u2019re very pleased with where we stand as it relates to where we are in FY \u201821. Andrew Nicholas : Got it. Thanks again. Helen Shan : You are welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the RBC win. Just a quick clarification on the RBC, is all of the RBC ASP included in the second quarter \u201821 or is there anything more coming in the out quarters? Thanks. Phil Snow : Helen, do you have the details on that? I believe it may be spread out over a couple of quarters, as are the users. Helen Shan : Yes. No. I think that some of it was in Q1. Some in \u2013 but most of it now is in, so I wouldn\u2019t necessarily look towards that as a material change in the back half of the year. Ashish Sabadra : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful color. And then just on the pricing increases. This time, it was $2 million more, $14 million of pricing increases from Americas, if I got that right. I just wanted to better understand what\u2019s driving that higher price increases. Phil, you mentioned the deep sector strategy, driving a lot of sales. Is that also driving better prices? And if that\u2019s the case, just any color \u2013 incremental color on the deep sector strategy of where are you in the process of fully building it out and which sectors have been built out and which are still in progress? Thanks. Phil Snow : I think generally on the price increase and, Helen, chime in if you\u2019ve got more color here. I think it was just very good execution within this environment and clients recognizing the value within the FactSet product. And I\u2019m sorry, what was the second part of your question? Ashish Sabadra : Sorry, the second part was just on the deep sector. You talked about that driving pretty good sales so my question there was on the deep sector, if you could just provide us an update on which verticals have, yes, details on that front? Thanks. Phil Snow : Yes. So we\u2019ve done work on financials, insurance and real estate. Those are the three that we\u2019re talking about now. But as part of our 3-year plan, we did \u2013 we are actively \u2013 have plans to do more than those three sectors. Ashish Sabadra : That\u2019s helpful color. Thanks. Go ahead. Go ahead. Helen Shan : And yes, as it relates to price increase, I think that\u2019s all exactly right. We have spent a lot \u2013 and again it\u2019s part of our core culture of focusing on enhancements and making the service as best we can for the client. And I think during \u2013 if anything, during this period, during the pandemic, that has really come through really showing through with clients and resonates. So I don\u2019t want to say that\u2019s exactly therefore drive higher prices, but it does mean \u2013 it does reaffirm the value that we\u2019re bringing to them. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks. Thank you very much. Helen Shan : You are welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Wanted to dive deeper into the ASV growth guidance for the full year, at the midpoint, the ASV guide was increased by $7.5 million. So what extent was that increase attributable to the new RBC contract versus other factors? Phil Snow : Hey, George, it\u2019s Phil. I think it\u2019s a lot more than the RBC win. As I mentioned earlier, the confidence that we have in our research products and the performance that we\u2019re seeing there is very encouraging because the core workstation and web offering can be sold to all different client types. And when you see the number of net new clients that we added this quarter, even though they were on the smaller side for the net new business, it was a really healthy mix across asset managers, hedge funds, asset owners, private equity, corporates. So pretty much across the board, we\u2019re adding new names, which I think is a great indication of the strength there. And then you\u2019re seeing it as already described, within the existing clients in terms of just adding more seats. And when we\u2019ve got a seat, we\u2019re able to cross-sell more of our analytics products, we\u2019re able to go in and sell CTS. So I would say that is the main thing that\u2019s driving the optimism there on the full year. George Tong : Got it. Helen Shan : And George, I would add to that. When we started off back in September preventing our guidance, it obviously was wide with given the uncertainty. And so what we wanted to see and what\u2019s come through, which gives us a better perspective for the back half of the year, is the fact that our retention has remained stable. New business which wondering how that was going to come through in FY \u201821 has also been in line with the past quarters. And what\u2019s really been the driver is the expansion. So we are selling more to existing clients. And I think that just helps us feel better certainly on the lower half of that range, and that\u2019s why we moved it up. So it\u2019s not attributable to a deal, but rather the momentum we\u2019re seeing across the way we\u2019re executing. George Tong : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Your net client count increased by 164 over the past 3 months, primarily driven by an increase in wealth management and corporate clients. Can you discuss how net client count is performing among buy side clients? Phil Snow : Yes. So I think I just mentioned that. So we added a number of new names and institutional asset managers, asset owners and hedge funds, which is most of the firms that we have on the buy side. George Tong : Got it. So just to clarify, on a net basis, buy side clients went up in the quarter? Phil Snow : Correct. Yes, they definitely did, yes. George Tong : Very helpful. Thank you. Phil Snow : Sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. Keith Housum : Good morning guys. Question for you regarding the remainder of the year and how you guys kind of thinking about bringing employees back and perhaps returning more to a life of normalcy as some were heading in that direction now. Obviously, just trying to think about how expenses are going to unfold through the rest of the year? Phil Snow : Yes, that\u2019s a great question. So we just had a couple of really good calls with our leadership team globally to talk about that. There is still a lot of factors out there. But we\u2019re optimistic, particularly in the U.S. that we can begin to reopen offices on a phased basis starting in June. So we, like many companies, will step our way in and make sure that we\u2019re doing things correctly. So we certainly won\u2019t be going back to 100%, I believe, until sometime towards the end of this fiscal year or early next year in terms of the Americas. And even when we do that, I think we\u2019re going to be working in a hybrid environment. So a lot of employees have benefited from the balance, both from a work and life standpoint. So we\u2019re like every company, trying to make sure that we figure out what that balance is best for everybody. Other countries that we operate in, vaccines are less readily available. But we\u2019re \u2013 I\u2019m sure over the next 12 months we are going to be in a really good position. So I think the short answer is you\u2019ll begin to see us head back into the offices and locations where vaccines are readily available in the beginning of June, and it will just ramp up from that. Keith Housum : Okay. And then switching over to the sales side, obviously, it\u2019s been a challenge as everybody has adjusted their sales structure into the virtual work. Have you seen any pent-up demand though or expectations of pent-up demand for when things do get a little bit more back to normal just because some things weren\u2019t able to be done virtually or do you think everybody is converted over and is it pretty much sales expectation should be more as we have seen them? Phil Snow : For the larger and more complicated enterprise deals, being face-to-face for some of that sales cycle as well as the implementation will have some degree of importance. But on the \u2013 I think for the smaller deals that are more easily than virtually, we\u2019ve learned a lot there. But I think there is \u2013 there should be some pent-up demand of some sort, I think, for the larger, more complicated deals that we have out there. Keith Housum : Great. Thank you. Appreciate it. Phil Snow : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Phil Snow now for closing remarks. Phil Snow : Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking to you next quarter. And in the meantime, please call Rima Hyder with additional questions. Operator, that ends today\u2019s call. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Rima Hyder. Please go ahead. Rima Hyder : Thank you, Joelle, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FactSet's third fiscal quarter 2021 earnings call. We continue to be in various remote locations today. We may have some audio quality issues, and we appreciate your patience should we experience a disruption. Before we begin, I would like to point out that the slides we will reference during this presentation can be accessed via the webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at factset.com. The slides will be posted on our website at the conclusion of this call. A replay of today's call will be available via phone and on our website. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions from investors. To be fair to everyone, please limit yourself to one question, plus one follow-up. Before we discuss our results, I will encourage all listeners to review the legal notice on Slide 2, which explains the risks of forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, please refer to our forms 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the appendix to the presentation and in our earnings release issued earlier today. Joining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer; and Helen Shan, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Revenue Officer.  And now, I'd like to turn the discussion over to Phil Snow. Phil Snow : Thank you, Rima, and hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased to share our third quarter results, headlined by strong top-line growth. This has allowed us to increase our organic ASV plus professional services guidance for this fiscal year. Building on last quarter's momentum, we grew organic ASV plus professional services by 5.8% this quarter. The investments made in both content and technology over the past 7 quarters have strengthened our product portfolio. And as a result, demand for our solutions is increasing, further supported by our clients' own digital transformation needs. Our growth this quarter was strongest with wealth managers, banking clients and asset owners. The acceleration in ASV reflects solid execution from the sales team who increased wallet share with existing accounts and further improved client retention. Our strategy to build the industry's leading open content and analytics platform continues to make an impact in the market. We remain on track with our multiyear investment plan. We continue to build out our content offering with particular focus on deep sector, private markets, ESG and data for wealth managers. Growth in workstations this quarter was driven by deep sector and private markets data, especially with banks and corporate clients. The expansion of our StreetAccount coverage in Canada and Asia as well as more fund data collection has generated greater demand from wealth managers. And clients are using our data management solutions which include entity mapping and data concordance services to manage their own content. These offerings are key differentiators, often sought by asset management clients. Our migration to the cloud is progressing as planned and gives us the opportunity to build new products that support ASV growth. One example is the Advisor Dashboard, which is being well received by wealth managers as evidenced by new wins and solid pipeline. Clients are seeking personalized tools like the Advisor Dashboard that can surface insights, increase efficiency and help users identify the next best action. In addition, we provide greater flexibility to clients by further opening up our platform. Our broad API offerings allow clients to leverage core and alternative data sets, tap into our robust portfolio analytics engine build digital portals and gain access to proprietary signals. We are seeing strong demand for our analytics APIs as well as fundamental company data APIs for CTS. We are also seeing more data sales through cloud-based platforms, such as Snowflake and having success with CRM integrations. This growth in our digital solutions can be attributed to our technology investments.  Looking at our regions, I'm pleased to say that our ASV growth rate increased in the Americas and EMEA across the majority of our business lines. The Americas\u2019 growth rate increased to 6% with strength across CTS, research and analytics. Acceleration was driven primarily by strong workstation sales to our banking clients and overall demand for premium and core data feeds. We've benefited from an increase in hiring at middle market and bulge bracket banks due to robust M&A and equity capital markets. EMEA's growth rate accelerated to 5%, improving over the past 2 quarters. We experienced stronger results in research and analytics, reflected in part by higher retention of our asset management and wealth funds. In addition, we captured greater international price increases as clients continue to affirm the value of our solutions. Asia Pac's growth remained at 9%, driven largely by research and analytics. Results include strong cross-sales to asset management firms as well as increases to global banks who are hiring more to accommodate increased capital markets activity. The region also benefited from higher price increases. In summary, we enter the end of fiscal '21 with good momentum and have good visibility into our fourth quarter. We have a strong pipeline weighted most heavily towards institutional asset managers, broker-dealers and wealth managers and are increasing our organic ASV guidance to $85 million to $95 million for this fiscal year. Overall, we are encouraged by market trends. Clients are showing more willingness to spend against the backdrop of anticipated economic recovery. Decisions on more complex deals that have been delayed are now beginning to be reconsidered as clients look to execute on their own digital transformations. We see increased demand for enterprise-wide technology upgrades and data management as CIOs and CTOs look to future-proof their technology stacks. This gives us conviction in the long-term benefit of our multiyear investment plan and our path to higher growth. This month marks FactSet's 25th year as a public company. I'm proud to reflect on our team's strong performance, the culture of continuous innovation we have fostered and the significant value to shareholders we have created over the years. We will continue to push ourselves to create smarter, more adaptive and more personalized solutions that make us the trusted enterprise partner for clients. I'll now turn it over to Helen, who, as many of you know, has taken over the leadership of our sales organization as Chief Revenue Officer, while continuing to serve as our CFO. She will take you through the quarter in more detail. Helen Shan : Thank you, Phil, and hello, everyone. As you've seen from our press release this morning, we are pleased to report an acceleration in our top-line, both in terms of revenue and organic ASV plus professional services. Our quarterly results also reflect increased year-over-year spending in people and technology, in line with our investment plan as well as anticipated higher ASV performance. We believe the progress made in our own digital transformation is enhancing our ability to help clients do the same. I will now share more details on our third quarter performance and provide an update to our annual outlook. We grew organic ASV plus professional services by 5.8%, reflecting in part the client demand for our solutions driven by their own digital transformation needs. In addition, our ability to realize higher pricing is a direct reflection of the value our products provide to clients. To that point, in line with the $14 million captured last quarter with the Americas price increase, we added $8 million from our international price increase this quarter. Our investments in content and technology have further strengthened our product offerings with clients as reflected in both higher levels of client retention and cross-selling. Focused execution from our sales team in delivering key workflow solutions also accelerated our growth. All of these factors underpin our results year-to-date. For the quarter, GAAP revenue increased by 7% to $400 million. Organic revenue, which excludes any impact from foreign exchange, acquisitions and deferred revenue amortization, increased 6% to $397 million. Growth was driven primarily by our analytics and CTS solutions, which have been the drivers of ASV in prior quarters. As a reminder, ASV represents the next 12 months of revenue. So there is a lag between the recording of ASV and the realization of revenue. For our geographic segments, organic revenue growth for the Americas grew to 6%, EMEA grew to 5% and Asia Pacific to 11%. All regions primarily benefited from increases in our analytics and CTS solutions. GAAP operating expenses grew 12% in the third quarter to $282 million, impacted by higher cost of services. Compared to the previous year, our GAAP operating margin decreased by 300 basis points to 29.5%, and our adjusted operating margin decreased by 390 basis points to 31.6%. As a percentage of revenue, our cost of services was 570 basis points higher than last year on a GAAP basis and 560 basis points higher on an adjusted basis. This increase is driven by higher compensation and technology costs. Compensation growth is comprised of higher salary expenses for existing employees, new hires to support our multiyear investment plan, and higher bonus accrual in line with stronger-than-anticipated ASV performance. This higher technology spend relates to our planned migration to the public cloud. We have been experiencing higher cloud usage and costs due to increased client trials, enterprise hosting and new product development. We anticipate this level of elevated expenses to continue as clients adopt our digital solutions. SG&A expenses, when expressed as a percentage of revenue, improved year-over-year by 270 basis points on a GAAP basis and 170 basis points on an adjusted basis. The primary drivers include reduced facilities expenses, lower spend due to office closures and a decrease in professional fees, offset in part by higher compensation costs reflecting the same factors as noted in the cost of services. Moving on, our tax rate for the quarter was 12% compared to last year's rate of 15%, primarily due to lower operating income this quarter and a tax benefit related to finalizing prior year's tax returns. GAAP EPS was almost flat to last year at $2.62 this quarter versus $2.63 in the prior year. Adjusted diluted EPS decreased 5% to $2.72. Both EPS figures were largely driven by higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher revenue. A reconciliation of our adjustments to GAAP EPS is included at the end of our press release. Free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending, was $122 million for the quarter, a decrease of 13% over the same period last year. This decrease is primarily due to higher capital expenditure from higher investment in internal software and the timing of certain tax items. For the third quarter, our ASV retention continued to be above 95%, and our client retention improved to 91%, which speaks both to the mission criticality of our solutions and the solid efforts and focused execution of our sales teams. We grew our total number of clients by 7% compared to the prior year to over 6,100 clients, largely due to the addition of more wealth and corporate clients, including private equity and venture capital firms. And our user count grew 11% year-over-year and crossed the total of 155,000, primarily driven by wealth and corporate users. For the third quarter, we repurchased over 178,000 shares of our common stock for a total of $58 million at an average share price of $323. We also increased our quarterly dividend by 6.5% to $0.82 per share, marking the 22nd consecutive year that we have increased our dividend. We remain disciplined in our buyback program and committed to returning long-term value to our shareholders. The impact of our multiyear investment plan is reflected in our results. The demand for our strong content offerings, digital solutions and open platform is accelerating growth. Given our strong performance this quarter and our confidence that we will execute successfully on a healthy pipeline as we close out the fiscal year, we are increasing our full year organic ASV plus professional services guidance range to $85 million to $95 million. We are also reaffirming the other metrics in our annual outlook. Given its timing and nature, an increase in ASV in the fourth quarter will not materially change revenue in fiscal year '21, but would result in a higher bonus accrual. The related expense would impact our margins by an incremental 60 basis points to 75 basis points. We believe that we will remain within our stated annual guidance ranges. In closing, from the vantage point of now overseeing FactSet sales and marketing organization, I can attest to the diligent focus and efforts we have made this year, helping clients leverage our offerings, building a stronger and broader pipeline and converting opportunities to sales. I have confidence in our ability to continue to execute on all these fronts and grow our market share as we finish the year. And with that, we are now ready for your questions. I'll turn it back to the operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Manav Patnaik : I just had one question, and that is, it sounds like the end markets of your clients are pretty positive compared to what they were in the prior few years. And so I was just curious on what you are seeing on the competitive side. Is that -- is it budget of the clients increasing because of that, is competition increasing? Just some overall dynamics there would be helpful. Phil Snow : Manav, it's Phil. Thanks for the question. So I'd say it's a combination of things. We're really excited about the movement in our top-line. And I attribute that really to the investments that we've made over the last year or 2 in both content and technology. So we're seeing a lot of good uptick in the research part of our business. And the digital transformation in terms of opening the platform is allowing our clients to consume value from FactSet in new and interesting ways. So the APIs are really driving some of the momentum we're seeing in both CTS and showing some strength now in the analytics business. And I do believe we're taking market share on the wealth side. I think it's pretty well understood who we're competing with there. And for the desktop business, that's a combination of firms. And analytics, again, it's a combination of firms. But overall, I feel really good about the top-line and how we're stacking up versus the competitors in the marketplace. And overall, yes, I think we're seeing that clients are -- we can all see a return to some sort of normalcy in terms of how we're working, and the underlying trends in the market are definitely positive. Manav Patnaik : I guess then just related to that, maybe can you just talk about your current pipeline and compare it to maybe the prior couple of years? Phil Snow : Sure. So yes, we've got confidence in Q4. We've booked more ASV at this time than we had last year. And we have a stronger weighted pipeline. So there's a higher confidence in the pipeline and a lot more bigger deals. And it's well distributed amongst all the different business lines. Operator : Our next question comes from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Owen Lau : So the expense in the third quarter was a bit more than expected. And I think, Helen, you called out a couple of things like salary, bonus and technology. But for the technology, could you please add a bit more color on, for lack of a better term, how much of that will be like onetime or nonrecurring in nature? Helen Shan : Yes. Sure. Happy to talk about that. And thanks for your question. When we think about the higher cost and technology, I would say, in part, it's really driven also by higher cloud-related costs. And the drivers of the cloud costs include the migration of our existing data and applications, which is always planned; client-related activities, such as hosting and trials; and then new product development as we're doing new products, which is going directly to the cloud. And we monitor these pretty closely, but we're learning along the way. And the cloud allows us monitor our usage better. I would say most of the higher costs are really related to client activity and new product development. And I think that reflects the faster adoption, probably a bit faster than we had planned. So it's in line with clients who also need to make their own digital transformation. And so we would expect all of this to give us an indication really linked to future ASV growth as opposed to this year specifically. But I would say, if we think about the higher cost on the cloud side, a portion of it is just related to future top-line growth. Owen Lau : Got it. That's very helpful. And then switching gear to -- I want to go back to Truvalue Labs, the Sustainable Development Goals to monitor. And I think the monitor, it's free. But could you please talk about how you're going to monetize these data set? Is it through data feeds or any other product? Phil Snow : Yes. Owen, yes. So absolutely, we'll continue to sell the data feeds and APIs that Truvalue Labs had developed before the acquisition. And we've been doing hard work to get all of that integrated into the broader FactSet suite, so that the Truvalue Labs data and analytics can be available throughout FactSet. So that's a big piece of the strategy. Operator : Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : I wanted to ask about the 8% sell-side growth in the quarter. Was there anything particular to call out there? Was it more a couple of client wins? Or was it more broad-based? And you mentioned the more willingness to spend by clients, so that seems positive. So just wanted to hear about your visibility into the new hiring class as well at the banks. Phil Snow : Sure. So yes, it is broad-based, Toni. And I think we've seen the benefits of hiring this far into our fiscal year. And a lot of that is really driven by the investment that we've made in content and the core platform to support the extra workstations. And there are still quite a few large banks that we don't have perfect visibility yet on their hiring classes, and those are going to come in, in the next month or 2, but we feel optimistic about that, just given the trends that we see in the market. So a couple of other things I'd point out for the sell-side. One is we're beginning to monetize feeds and analytics in the sell-side which previously we've not done much of. So that is supporting some of the growth. And then in terms of new logos, we're positive this quarter for the sell-side firms, whereas Q3 of last year, we were negative. So we've seen a good relative -- even though we've closed more corporate and wealth clients, we're seeing good relative performance in terms of new logos for the sell-side. Toni Kaplan : That's great. And now that you're seeing things sort of normalize a little bit, can you just give us an update on if you've changed your thinking at all on the transformation targets in terms of either magnitude or timing? Just any sort of extra color from those targets that you had previously laid out before COVID? Phil Snow : So you mean the 3-year targets that we laid out? Toni Kaplan : Yes. Yes. Phil Snow : We're -- I think, as we said last quarter or maybe a couple of quarters in a row, we're not going to revisit those right now. But when we get to Q4, we'll be able to give you some guidance like we do every year for fiscal year '22. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Andrew Nicholas : I wanted to follow-up on the strong sell-side ASV growth a little bit further. Specifically, curious how much you would attribute that acceleration to the deep sector rollouts and maybe what's a reasonable expectation for the timing of new deep sector rollouts going forward? Or anything else you can share on areas of focus there. Phil Snow : I would definitely attribute some of it to that. We had one significant win that was related to deep sector. And we're on track with that program. So the team did a tremendous job of laying out over a 3- year period a number of sectors that we would be developing. And we're on track with that program. So 7 quarters into it, we feel really good about the momentum there. We've done a lot of hard work to partner with a lot of firms to bring their data and integrate it into FactSet, which is something we always do really well. And then for other data sets, we're going out and collecting it ourselves. So overall, we're really thrilled with that program. The team has done an amazing job, and it's beginning to have a real impact for us on the sell side, but it's not just the sell side. We will be able to monetize this data within the corporate space, within the buy side as well. Andrew Nicholas : Got it. Makes sense. And then for my follow-up, I know you touched on it here and there in the answer to other questions. But just maybe broadly speaking, if you could update us on the selling environment right now. You've talked in past quarters about lengthening of the sales cycles and analytics, some longer implementation cycles. So any changes there over the past couple of months as things have kind of picked up momentum or anything to call out there on a relative basis? Phil Snow : We're beginning to see some real positive signs there for analytics. So I think if you look at that space for our competitors as well, I think it was an area that slowed down for many firms. But we've had a good quarter for analytics, and the pipeline looks really strong. So they've got a really good suite there of things we've been working on. So the core PA product is actually doing well. We're adding new logos and seats for that. I mentioned APIs already. We have a new quant research environment that we are releasing, which has gotten tremendous feedback from the market. And our front office solutions are beginning to show some green shoots as well. So analytics is definitely stabilizing. And clients are willing to now revisit a lot of these decisions for some of these longer sales cycle deals. So -- and obviously, clients are beginning to open up, we are as well as a firm. I think the sales team is itching to get back out there. Operator : Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Ryan Gunning : It's actually Ryan Gunning filling in for Hamzah today. First, could you just talk about how you're thinking about your pricing model today and whether you believe enterprise-wide versus seat-based is better and how your model currently works? Helen Shan : Sure. Ryan, I'll take that question. This is Helen. So I think we have a pretty good mix. We do both, in some cases, seat-based; in other cases, usage-based. On our larger deals, larger clients where you would see more perhaps an enterprise pricing model, we do that, but we do that via bands. So therefore, if the users go up or down within the band, the pricing is the same; then if they go to the next tier, it goes up. So I would say for our largest clients, that's where many -- that\u2019s how many of them are set up. Again, it's a blend of, in some cases, usage; but in other cases, users. And we've seen good growth. We can tell from the pricing increases that we've had, our annual price increase, again, for international is up. So we've been able to capture more of that value that the clients have put into our product. So we would continue to see our mix there be sustainable. Ryan Gunning : Got it. That's very helpful. And then I guess, switching gears, can you give us an update on how you're thinking about larger scale M&A? Obviously, we've seen a good bit of deals in the info services space more recently, but any update there? Helen Shan : Sure. I'll take that one. As it relates to larger deals, and we don't comment on that, as you know, as we've talked about, our focus has been on content and technology. We look to where we think we've got the best use of perhaps gaps that we can help fill in. So we always look at buy versus build versus partner. In terms of acquisitions, we've just completed a small one, that's called [Cabot Investment Technologies], which provides a platform for more behavior-based analysis and targeting asset managers and asset owners. So while it's small, it really fits into our strategy as it relates to the front office, and as it relates to helping, as Phil talked about in his opening remarks and making that next best decision. So we're going to be very disciplined in how we're approaching the potential acquisitions are out there, even though we are looking at all of them as they come through. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Alex Kramm : Just a couple of things on the margin side. First of all, Helen, can you just -- you made the comment at the end there about the fourth quarter, I think, 60 basis points to 75 basis points. Was that relative to what we just saw in the third quarter? Or how would you characterize that 60 to 75? Helen Shan : Right. So the way I think about it is really 60 to 75 for the year. So in this particular quarter, because once we had greater visibility, Alex, into where we would see -- where we anticipate for the year, then we had to both true-up the first half as well as increase for Q3. But what I wanted to give was, what is that impact for the entire year, we would say it's somewhere between, we think, 60 basis points to 75 basis points depending on where we end up. And that is based not only on top-line but also on margins. Alex Kramm : Okay. So it should be reflected in the run rate, if I heard you correctly now because you've started to true-up? Helen Shan : Right. Alex Kramm : Okay. And then secondarily, also a very quick one. You talked about this, the cloud and the costs associated with that. It sounded very much like this is spent to grow. But I thought I was also under the impression that there were some duplicate costs as you've been migrating to the cloud. Just can you remind us, are there still duplicate costs today? If they are, when are they -- I mean, how big are they and when they're supposed to tail off? And would you just reinvest those savings eventually? Or would you actually expect that to flow to the bottom-line if there are savings to be realized? Helen Shan : Yes, sure. Happy to answer that. So our cost as it relates to the cloud, I would say a portion of it is part of our investment plan. And you're absolutely right, it is the duplication that's happening because we are not able to get out of our on-premise data center costs at this point. Now the way that we've looked at it is that it's meant to drop off as we complete our total migration. So that will drop off, we think, towards the end of FY '22 or the end of our third year. That's where it was meant to happen. And at that point, we'll make the decision around, as those drop off, whether or not any portion of that gets reinvested, but that is part of the savings that we would have expected going forward as well. We're not -- we've not really talked about the dollar for dollar, but most of this is -- as I said, the increase in the spend on the cloud is really, to your point, client-related. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Kevin McVeigh : Phil, you talked about kind of demand for open content and analytics fueling growth as your clients are pursuing digital transformations. Is there any way to frame what the potential market for that can be as it relates to FactSet? And is it -- can it shift the organic growth 100 basis points? Or just is there a way to just maybe tighten that comment up, particularly around the digital solutions, kind of the current and how you see that playing out over time? Phil Snow : Yes. I mean, I think the -- I mean, we're playing a big market today, right? So I think it's at least a $30 billion market that FactSet participates in. And the trends definitely are moving to clients, putting together, I think, more customized workflows for themselves using open technology stack. So I think it's really just an evolution, honestly, of how clients consume content and analytics today. And our strategy we believe strongly is the right one in terms of creating these Lego blocks that clients can then use to stitch together to differentiate themselves from their competitors. So those are the conversations we're having with our clients. The workstation is not going away. I think there's always going to be a place for that in the market. But the firms that are going to win are the ones that are being able to plug-in as needed for the clients across their entire workflows, whether it's buy side, sell side, wealth, you name it. Kevin McVeigh : That's helpful. And then just anything to call out, it seems like the ASV retention was around 95%, but you saw some nice improvement on the client retention. Any dynamics to call out there around retention, client relative to ASV overall? Phil Snow : I just think it speaks to the strength of our product, the investment we've made and how well the sales team has been executing. We're interacting more and more with our clients, the virtual environment in some way has upped the amount of interactions we have with them. So I think it just really speaks to the product and the fact that clients like working with us. Operator : Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Helen, can you talk a little bit more about some of the costs for the client trials? Are those increased people costs, increased technology costs? How does that work? It seems like it's a precursor to future revenue to come. And thought maybe you can discuss that a little bit and then I have a follow-up. Helen Shan : Sure. Happy to do that. So I would think the majority of that is more along the technology cost. One of the nice things around the trials and the data exploration, in an odd way, it shortens the sales cycle. So what used to take much more time and involvement with our sales and implementation folks now can be done in a matter of hours versus weeks or months. And so I would say, in some ways, there's people who help on that front. But the cost driver to your direct question is much more on the technology side. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. So is that like hosting costs? I can -- I'm sorry, just to understand... Helen Shan : Sorry, I should be clear. Yes, it is more around hosting the cloud cost. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Very good. Helen Shan : And yes, the cloud, both for data as well as for computation. But it is cloud. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Got it. And then so I'm assuming that those are good things that can lead to future revenue growth. I mean, that's the way that we should be looking at that, just to finish up that question? Helen Shan : Yes. I think that, that is -- I mean the higher activity, the more they're trucking out the different various feeds. We're seeing that lead to more even if they're looking at alternative data feeds on our Open :FactSet they often end up buying our own data feed. So I would say that is a feeder into that. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Got it. Okay. Then one other thing, just kind of a housekeeping item. It seems like the -- there's some kind of reallocation of revenue amongst the segments in the last year quarter. When I go back in what's in the press release for Americas versus EMEA versus Asia Pac, the revenue is much higher in the prior year what's being reported now in Americas and less in the other 2. Is there something that prompted that reallocation? Or was there something that was talked about that I missed over the last couple of quarters? Helen Shan : You're saying the actual dollars? Shlomo Rosenbaum : Yes. If you look at the dollars... Helen Shan : Sometimes -- sorry go ahead. You finish your question, sorry. Shlomo Rosenbaum : No, I was just going to say, if you look at the dollars as what was reported in, let's say, Americas last year in the 10-Q, it was like maybe $7.5 million than what's now. And the other ones were higher, and it seems to be a reallocation. Did something also change for the fourth quarter? I'm just trying to figure out for modeling how I should be handling that. Helen Shan : Sure. No. Thanks for that question. Yes, there are some things that were reclassed in part due to where the clients are based. Rima can give you much more detail on that, but that is a reclassification. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. And that's something that's going to be for the fourth quarter as well, that the year-over-year comp is going to be different than what we saw, if you take out the K and you subtract the first 3 quarters from it? Helen Shan : I'm going to say, yes, because of the way that the movement of -- these are existing clients that move. But again, if you spend a little time with Rima, she can talk you through it. Operator : Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. George Tong : I wanted to follow-up on the margin question earlier and the impact of higher bonus accruals. The 60 bps to 75 bps of margin impact full year, can you clarify if that's relative to your original margin expectations for fiscal 2021 which would imply you would land in the bottom half of your guidance range? And perhaps discuss if there are any offsetting factors to the upside that might mitigate that impact? Helen Shan : Sure. Thanks for your question. So yes, the impact for the year is higher. So the 60 to 75 would have been beyond what we would have provided in terms of our original plan. There are offsets as we manage both from a people perspective, some of the productivity, lower professional services fees that we think. And we'll see how Q4 ends up, but we had expected a certain level of G&A for Q4, and we'll see where that goes. We do think from a margin perspective, though, overall, we'll be on the lower end of our range. So I think that, that is a fair way of thinking about it. I would also add what we're seeing come through that likely on the tax rate side will be on the lower end as well. So we should take both of those into a bit of consideration. George Tong : Got it. Very helpful. And then you're continuing to invest in content and technology. Earlier, I believe you had mentioned plans for the full year of about $25 million, $26 million. Can you talk about your plans over the next 12 months? You had laid out a 3-year investment plan where it's $15 million on average per year. So how is that shaping up? Do you think your 3 investments might be similar or would it step down from this year's levels? Helen Shan : Yes. So we'll -- as Phil had alluded to earlier, we'll give greater guidance on this later on after Q4. Our focus right now is obviously trying to execute and convert everything in -- for this fiscal year. I will say the way to think about it, our investment plan is in terms of what we gave in the beginning 2 years ago, we're on target, both milestones as well as in general spend. That being said, the cadence, the mix, made the hiring, which was slower in the first year, caught up mainly in the second year, but that -- some of that might bleed into the third year. But we'll give more guidance on that when we complete the year and have our call next time. Operator : Our next question comes from David Chu with Bank of America. David Chu : So when you guys first launched the accelerated investments, I think, Helen, you noted 25% of revenue should benefit should be in year 2 with like 75% in year 3. Is this still the expectation? Or have you seen some of it pull forward, given -- it seems like it's really helping the ASV growth? Helen Shan : Thanks for your question. I mean I do -- we do think, in general, that we'll see more of the benefit in the third year as things are built, as Phil talked about, a lot of underpinning some of the acceleration is on the technology and cloud-based side. So it's a little hard to point to any particular dollar or deal. I think we're still in that general range as I've given before, that most of it's coming in the third year. But yes, we're really pleased of where we are at this point, given the higher ASV growth thus far. David Chu : Okay. Great. And then just on employee headcount. It looks like it was up about 6% over the past 12 months ex the Truvalue. It sounds like that's slightly down from the last quarter about like 7.5%. So just thoughts on how should we think about that over the like next year or so? Helen Shan : Yes. I think -- I mean, we've continued to do a lot of hiring for the investments and this churn that's happening as well. So I think that's a fairly -- I mean we have a general cadence that you'll see by quarter. So I wouldn't necessarily apply -- I would say it's on par from the previous year for this quarter. So I would expect to see that continue. Operator : Our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Keith Housum : Helen, I was hoping you can provide a bit of context. It's obviously been 4 quarters in a row now where you guys have benefited from lower facility costs and T&E. How much of that benefiting operating margins this quarter? And how do we think about that going forward as you guys resume back to, I guess, a more normalized world, however that normalized where it's going to be? Helen Shan : Right. Thank you for the question. Yes. It's one of those where -- when we first set our guidance, we were thinking around the fact that the back half of this year, we would be much more, I'll call it, back to whatever that new normal is. So we did expect an uptick. We didn't see that come in Q3, but we're also lapping. So I think on a go-forward basis, when we think about the amount of savings on a run rate, will be somewhere in that, call it, 25 basis points to 50 basis points based off of our FY '19 run rate. We can't look at last year in particular. So that's how I would think about that. The hybrid model allows us to manage our facilities footprint and expenses much better. And honestly, the learnings from operating virtually in terms of client interaction, implementation, which we can do remotely now, as we've shown in several of our larger wealth implementations and internal meetings are just going to allow us to have that much more productivity. Keith Housum : Okay. Appreciate it. And then just as a follow-up and changing gears on you. Congratulations on the move over to the CRO role. I guess any thoughts now as you approach the Chief Revenue Officer position in terms of the sales -- direction of the sales department and the marketing strategy. I guess, any thoughts on the move over? Helen Shan : Yes. No, thanks for that. I'm really pleased and honored to be able to take on this role. The nice part is we've got a really talented sales organization and a solid leadership team. And so I think our FY '21 results to date reflect the focused execution in what still remains to be a challenging, albeit somewhat improving environment. And so from my perspective, the areas that we'll look to accelerate our efforts will be on the solutions that we bring to market from our investment plan. So ESG, wealth analytics, private markets. And to increase the wallet share in our targeted clients, I think we talked a little bit about retention earlier, but expansion that's been a big driver for us this year, and we're just selling more things to our existing clients. And then lastly, the focus will be more also on the enterprise discussion with senior executives. Our aim is to really provide our platform for their own digital transformation. So I don't look at major changes as much as to really enhance what we've got going on thus far. Operator : Our last question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Craig Huber : Can you just clarify a little bit further your costs for the May quarter, they look like they're up about $9 million or so as I look at them versus the February quarter. Was there anything of onetime in nature? Just go through that a little bit further how we should think about as we try to think about cost for the August quarter. I can see your guidance for margins, but is there anything onetime in nature to call out that won't repeat like a catch-up for accruals, for incentive comp? Helen Shan : The largest piece of that -- so thanks for your question. The largest piece of that really is compensation. So the compensation, meaning the bonus accrual. So we had to do a catch-up from the first half of the year. But now that we have greater visibility to where we'll end, I mean we are a pay-for-performance culture. So we -- if we expect higher performance, then we will increase our bonus accrual as a result. So that's what you're really seeing in Q3, and that again reflects both the catch-up as well as the higher accrual for the quarter. Craig Huber : Are you able to quantify that for us? Helen Shan : I think as we have said for the year, it's around 60 basis points to 75 basis points for the year. If we had not had the improvement and if we did not add in the bonus accrual, the increase, that would have been 150 basis points for the quarter. Craig Huber : Okay. And then my other question, please, that $10 million to $15 million higher expectation for ASV organic growth for the year. Is there a way for you to break down that within the segments or revenue with the extra $10 million to $15 million might come from as you look at it, please? Phil Snow : Yes, we don't -- I don't think we typically do the segments by quarter. But we are -- we've seen very good momentum within the research business this year. So I think I would expect research to have a very strong quarter. The CTS business, the feed business is doing really well, particularly as we go to digital, there's just more ways to monetize the data. I spoke about analytics, showing some stabilization there. And then on the wealth side, we see a pretty strong pipeline there in terms of some exciting deals. So I would just say it's pretty broad-based. Operator : I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Phil Snow for closing remarks. Phil Snow : Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. In the meantime, please call Rima Hyder with additional questions. Operator, that ends today's call. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference may be recorded. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019d now like to hand the conference over to your speaker host today, Rima Hyder. Please go ahead. Rima Hyder : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FactSet\u2019s fourth fiscal quarter 2021 earnings call. We continue to be in various remote locations today, we may have some audio quality issues and we appreciate your patience, should we experience the disruption. Before we begin, I would like to point out that the slides we will reference during this presentation can be accessed via the webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at factset.com. The slides will be posted on our website at the conclusion of this call. A replay of today's call will be available via phone and on our website. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions from investors. To be fair to everyone, please limit yourself to one question plus one follow-up. Before we discuss our results, I encourage all listeners to review the legal notice on Slide two, which explains the risks of forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, please refer to our Form 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our slide presentations and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the appendix to the presentation and in our earnings release issued earlier today. Joining me today are, Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer; and Helen Shan, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Revenue Officer. And now, I'd like to turn the discussion over to Phil Snow. Phil Snow : Thank you, Rima, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased to share that we delivered strong fourth quarter and full year results. We ended the year with record organic ASV plus professional services growth of $68 million for the quarter, crossing the $100 million annual ASV threshold for the first time, and soundly beating the top-end of our guidance. Our year-on-year organic ASV growth rate accelerated 200 basis points to over 7%, and we delivered annual revenue of $1.6 billion and adjusted EPS of $11.20. Our outperformance was driven by two years of planned accelerated investments in content and technology, which is paying dividends. FactSet\u2019s goal to be the leading open content and analytics platform is resonating in the marketplace, and increasing our wallet share with clients. Our targeted investment in new content sets was a significant ASV driver in fiscal \u201921, and fueled our workstation growth. The continued development of our deep sector coverage improved sell side retention and expansion with our largest banking clients and helped secure new business. Content and technology were both key to our expansion with wealth management firms, where we landed important wins, including with the Royal Bank of Canada and Raymond James Canada. These wins were due to our market-leading data and the launch of FactSet\u2019s Advisor  Dashboard. We are also expanding our addressable market by increasing our content and delivery capabilities across the front, middle, and back office. We added meaningful ASV from our cloud and API solutions this year, including delivering more data through the cloud and cloud-based platforms, entity mapping and linking client data through our data management services or DMS, and unlocking opportunity in new workflows by unbundling our components to plug and play into other third-party systems, such as CRMs. Cloud delivery, coupled with the strength of our DMS in concordance as a service solutions enable our clients to centralize, integrate, and analyze disparate data sources for faster and more cost-effective decision making. This has been a major driver for our CTS business. As we look ahead to 2022 and beyond, we remain focused on three things, scaling up our content refinery to provide the most comprehensive and connected set of industry, proprietary and third-party data for the financial markets; two, enhancing the client experience by delivering hyper personalized solutions, so clients can discover meaningful insights faster; and third, driving next generation workflow-specific solutions for asset managers, asset owners, sell-side wealth management and corporate clients. We added new data and capabilities to further these goals by acquiring differentiated assets over the past year. The addition of Truvalue Labs has grown our ESG offering. BTU Analytics advanced our deep sector content for the energy markets; and Cabot Technologies will better support the portfolio analytics workflows of asset managers and asset owners. The progress we have made on our investment plan along with these acquisitions and our award winning products give us a distinct competitive advantage. Turning now to our financial results, we accelerated our organic ASV plus professional services growth to 7.2%. Our strong performance was driven by stellar execution from our sales and client-facing teams throughout the entire year, and especially in the fourth quarter. Our buy side and sell side growth rates increased 100 basis points and 400 basis points, respectively, since the third quarter, reflecting highest sales across our key clients. On a year-over-year basis, we saw an increase in ASV growth rates from high-single digit to double digits across banks, asset owners, hedge funds, data providers, wealth managers, and corporates, including private equity and venture capital firms. We capitalized on the strength of our end markets, particularly in banking, and landed several large deals in our wealth and CTS businesses. Turning now to our geographic segments, we saw acceleration in every region. ASV growth in the Americas rose to 7% in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by increased sales to our banking, corporate, and wealth clients. We also had a large data partner win this quarter in CTS. Asia-Pac had a record ASV quarter and delivered a growth rate of 12%. We saw wins across many countries with global and regional banks, as well as our research management products. CTS and analytics also contributed to growth with wins across asset managers and data providers. EMEA accelerated to a 6% growth rate driven by strong performance with data providers, asset managers, and banking clients, and CTS had the highest contribution to this region followed by Research. Now turning to our businesses, Research was the largest contributor to our ASV growth this year with a growth rate of 6%, driven by very strong growth on the sell side at 12%. We increased research workstation users by 86% this quarter versus a year ago, with growth across both sell side and buy side clients. Increasing our workstation presence and footprint with our largest clients' positions us very well for cross-selling opportunities in the future. Analytics and trading accelerated in the second half in fiscal 2021 versus the first-half, ending the year at a 6% growth rate. We saw wins across performance reporting, front office, and core analytics solutions. Within the front office solutions, we are really pleased to see larger wins with our trading platform, and believe this will be a contributor to analytics going into next year. CTS grew 16% driven by core company data, and data management solutions sold through an increasing number of channels. CTS had robust sales to data providers this year, and expanded their footprints across multiple workflows within middle and back office functions, and asset management and banking clients. Additionally, while all Truvalue Labs ESG sales are excluded from our organic numbers, I'm pleased to report that ESG data sales were a contributor to CTS\u2019 overall growth this quarter. Wealth ended the year with a 6% growth rate, wealth workstations grew 24% year-over-year, and they alongside FactSet\u2019s Advisor Dashboard have been the biggest contributors to winning new clients. We've seen a combination of large and medium size wins as existing clients continue to expand their advisory businesses, and we are equally pleased with our new business wins. We are also seeing cross-selling opportunities with analytics products as wealth managers increasingly look to advance the sophistication of their offerings. Moving forward with fiscal \u201822, we will report three workflow solutions. We are combining the desktop portion of the wealth business with research into one business to be known as Research and Advisory. We believe this is the right strategy to further our goals to holistically manage our desktop solutions, accelerate the build out of differentiated front office solutions, and facilitate the global expansion and adoption of StreetAccount news and FactSet web. We have also taken the wealth digital business and combined it with CTS to better align our digital solutions. In summary, we are entering fiscal \u201822 with strong momentum and a solid pipeline as reflected in our annual ASV guidance. The need for more differentiated contents in analytics is at an unprecedented high. And we are perfectly positioned to capture this demand and poised to deliver best-in-class workflows, and a hyper personalized experience for our clients. I'm proud of our company's strong performance in fiscal \u201821. We have advanced our digital platform, executed at a high level and strengthened our relationship with clients. I'll now turn it over to Helen, who for the last time as CFO will discuss our fourth quarter and full year performance in more detail, and take you through our fiscal 2022 guidance. I want to thank Helen for leading our global finance organization the past three years. And I'm confident that as our Chief Revenue Officer, she will bring a disciplined, growth-oriented mindset and the same rigor to the sales organization as she did leading finance, enabling us to continue our success going forward. Helen Shan : Thank you, Phil, and hello, everyone. I'm happy to be here with you today, and I hope that we will continue to engage even after I fully transition to my sales role. Like sale, I want to congratulate FactSetters around the world for achieving outstanding results in fiscal 2021. While we have continued primarily operate remotely, I am so impressed with the resilience with which our FactSet teams are able to serve our global clients. Our 7% top-line growth this year is a testament to the hard work of our teams, and validates our strategy to invest in content and technology, capitalize on market trends and address clients\u2019 needs. Throughout this fiscal year, we accelerated our growth rate in ASV plus professional services through consistent conversion of our pipeline, delivering over $100 million and ASV growth and surpassing our most recent guidance for the year. Full year revenue also exceeded our target, as we realize more revenue from ASV booked early in the fourth quarter. We generated solid earnings through disciplined expense management and operating leverage. Driving sustainable long-term growth requires continued investment back into the business, as reflected by our increased spend on differentiated content and cloud-enabled technology. We executed our plan well and our operating results are in line with expectations due to higher revenue and productivity gains, with higher adjusted operating income and growth and adjusted EPS. Let me now walk you through the specifics of our fourth quarter. Before I explain the quarterly results, I want to remind everyone that our prior year fourth quarter GAAP results were impacted by a one-time non-cash charge of approximately $17 million, related to an impairment of an investment in a third-party. Thus, any year-over-year comparison of GAAP operating results for the fourth quarter of 2021 should take that into consideration. As you saw on the previous slide, our organic ASV plus professional services growth rate was 7.2%. This increase reflects the higher demand for our solutions, as clients execute on their own digital transformation. Our success in solving the workflow challenges has resulted in higher levels of both client retention and cross-selling activity. For the quarter, GAAP revenue increased by 7% to $412 million. Organic revenue, which exclude any impact from foreign exchange, acquisitions and deferred revenue amortization, also increased 7% to $410 million. Growth was driven by our analytics, CTS and research solutions. For our geographic segments, organic revenue for the Americas grew to 6%, EMEA grew to 7%, and Asia Pacific to 12%. All regions primarily benefited from increases in our analytics and CTS solutions. GAAP operating expenses grew 3% in the fourth quarter to $293 million, impacted by a higher cost of services. Compared to the previous year, our GAAP operating margin increased by 320 basis points to 28.9%, and our adjusted operating margin decreased by 150 basis points to 31.6%. As a percentage of revenue, our cost of services was 10 basis points higher than last year on a GAAP basis, and flat to last year on an adjusted basis. The increase is primarily driven by growth in compensation, comprised of higher salary expenses for existing employees, new hires to support a multiyear investment plan, and higher bonus accrual in line with stronger than anticipated ASV performance. SG&A expenses, when expressed as a percentage of revenue improved year-over-year by 330 basis points on a GAAP basis, but increased 170 basis points on an adjusted basis. The primary drivers include higher compensation costs, reflecting the same factors as noted in the cost of services. Moving on, our tax rate for the quarter was 15% higher than the prior year's tax rate of 7%, primarily due to lower tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation in the current quarter, as well as a tax benefit related to finalizing the prior year's tax returns. GAAP EPS increased 15% to $2.63 this quarter versus $2.29 in the prior year. Again, this improvement is primarily a result of the impairment charge we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020. Adjusted diluted EPS remained flat year-over-year at $2.88. Adjusted EPS was driven by higher revenues offset by higher operating expenses, and an increase in the tax rate. Reconciliation of our adjustments to GAAP EPS is included at the end of our press release. Free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending was $171 million for the quarter, an increase of 18% over the same period last year. This increase is primarily due to higher net income, improved collections and the timing of certain tax payments. For the fourth quarter, our ASV retention remained above 95% and our client retention improved to 91%, which again speaks to the demand for our solutions and excellent execution by our sales team. Compared to the prior year, we grew our total number of clients by 10% to over 6,400, largely due to the addition of more wealth and corporate clients. And our use account grew 14% year-over-year, and crossed the total of 160,000, primarily driven by sales in our wealth and research solutions, and in particular in the number of banking users. For the quarter, we repurchased over 265,000 shares of our common stock at a total cost of $93 million, with an average share price of $348. For the year, we repurchased 265 million of our shares, and increased our dividend for the 22nd consecutive year. With share repurchases and dividends on an annual basis, we have returned to shareholders almost 70% as a percentage of free cash flow and proceeds from employee stock options. We remain disciplined in our buyback program and committed to returning long-term value to our shareholders. Turning now to our outlook for fiscal year 2022, we delivered outstanding results in the back-half of 2021, and believe this pace will carry into our next fiscal year. For organic ASV plus professional services, we are guiding to an incremental $105 million to $135 million. The midpoint of this range represents a 7% increase, which is equal to this year's organic growth rate, reflecting continued momentum in our business. We are confident in our ability to perform at the high standard we demonstrated in fiscal \u201921, with underlying drivers to include disciplined execution and continued benefits from our investments. We expect growth to be driven largely with existing clients through high retention and cross-selling. In addition, we expect our ability to successfully sell new business in this virtual environment to continue. Our recent investment in digital and content are providing us with more opportunities to sell direct solutions tailored for specific workflows. Drivers of future growth would include, first, the retention and expansion of our sell side client base through a deep sector strategy as we launch new targeted industries, in addition to new private markets offerings. Second, new wins with wealth managers who have been responding well to our web-based workstation and personalized advisor dashboard. And third, growth with institutional asset management clients, who benefit from our data management solutions and enhanced capabilities in front office and ESG workflows. We are mindful about the global environment and potential future market disruptions. But we believe we have the right offerings and strategy to maintain our high performance and growth rates into fiscal 2022. From an operational perspective, we plan for continued labor productivity and operating leverage. In addition to our multi-year investment plan, new investments will be made in content and front office solutions, funded in part by ongoing cost discipline, including permanent savings related to the pandemic and additional efficiency actions. As a result of higher growth in revenues and continued cost discipline, we are guiding to an expansion in our operating margins. Combined with our consistent use of capital for share repurchases, we expect to accelerate growth in our diluted EPS, both on a GAAP and adjusted basis. We are seeing the results of our investments take hold in both technology and content. As we look to fiscal 2022, we are focused on delivering more value to clients, prioritizing our resources and ensuring execution excellence. As I transition to my new role, I am seeing firsthand experience and skills of our sales team adapting to meet the needs of the market. Our clients-centric mentality, combined with our expanding data universe and digital advances, provide me with the confidence that we have the people, strategy and products to build a leading open content and analytics platform in our industry, all while generating long-term value for our shareholders. With that, we are now ready for your questions, and I'll turn it over to the operator. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And I'll now first question coming from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks. Congrats on such a solid quarter and an impressive guidance. My question is more on research side. This is the first year where we\u2019ve seen such a massive acceleration to 6%, as you mentioned, your deep content as well as technology transformation bearing fruit. I was wondering if you could provide more color. It looks like it's being driven by new wins, client retention. But if you can just talk about how do we think about this research and advisory growth going forward? Is that kind of growth sustainable given your deep sector strategy? Thanks. Phil Snow : Hi, Ashish, thank you for the question. Yes, we're very pleased with how our research business performed this year. Clearly, we had very good performance on the sell side, and the investment that we made in new content really helped drive new logos, expansion of existing clients, and help with retention. So, that was a big driver on the sell side. However, the research business grew at a healthy cliff in lots of different firm types, so we did very well on a relative basis to last year with institutional asset management. We did well with corporates, hedge funds, a number of different firmtypes. So, we\u2019re pretty broad-based. You can see that we grew our workstations by, I think, 14% over the last year, so just getting that footprint is really important for us moving forward to cross-sell, and we closed lots of new logos. So my hats off to the research team. They've done an amazing job and just really a monster quarter from the sales team in terms of going out and executing on all the opportunities we had in front of us. Ashish Sabadra : That's very helpful color. Thank you. And maybe just a question on margins. Again, great to see margin expansion despite the investments. And my question was more over the mid-term, as you retire your data center -- first, the question is, are you still on track to retire the data centers by end of fiscal \u201822? And how should we think about the cost savings as you get rid of some of the redundant costs and get back to a more normalized investment cycle? Thanks. Helen Shan : Hi, it\u2019s Helen. Thanks for that question. Yes, as it relates to the status of our investment plan, we remain on track. We're obviously being able to, as we've talked about in the past, to be doing our transformation and transition to the cloud, and that remains on track as well. And so we do expect to complete most of what we expected to get out of the data centers by year-end. But obviously, we'll see how the year progresses. But there's nothing right now that changes our view. Ashish Sabadra : That's helpful. Thanks again and congrats on the solid quarter. Helen Shan : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse, Your line is open. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thanks so much. And let me add my congratulations as well. Hey, for \u201822 guide, can you unpack maybe a little bit Helen, how are you thinking about new logos versus additional client offerings? And then just any thoughts as to the client retention because again, you're seeing a lot of success across multiple vectors. So just trying to get a sense of the build up a little bit. Helen Shan : Yeah, happy to do that. Thanks for your question. So we've been very pleased with the way we've been able to execute. Honestly, as we think about from a year ago to now, I think what has been extremely beneficial to us is our ability to grow with existing clients. So in the past, we've talked about two-thirds of the growth comes from existing, one-third from new. If we take a look at how the year actually progressed, we actually saw with existing clients the ability between retention and expansion to be nearly three quarters of it. That doesn't mean that new business didn't grow, in fact, it grew at the same pace as in the past, Kevin, but what we saw was our ability from many of our investments to really resonate with our existing and even our largest clients. So, we do look at new business going forward, continuing to do well. As I think about the course of the year, we actually had more in terms of volume. The average transaction price might be a bit lower, but we made that up from volume. And I think that just reflects the virtual environment and the situation that we're in. But it continues to be a key part of our overall growth. Kevin McVeigh : That's great. And then just real quick. It looks like in September, Snowflake announced a new solution, the financial services data cloud. That probably brings more leverage in terms of what you're doing with them, but any updates as to how that impacts kind of the existing partnership you announced back in January, if at all? Phil Snow : I think it's just consistent, Kevin, with what we've been doing with them, and we're working with lots of different cloud providers to make sure that we provide FactSet data and analytics in the places that our clients want to consume it. So, super happy with the Snowflake relationship, adding on services, like concordance will help us. And we do think that new channels like this are going to be important as we move forward. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Congrats again. Phil Snow : Thank you. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. Good morning. So, I just had a question on the analytics business. It\u2019s been, I guess that could go 6%, 7% growth for the last couple of years. Is that the right growth rate for this business or is there any initiative embedded to probably get that higher? Phil Snow : Hey, Manav, thanks for the question. We certainly think analytics can do better. We did get off to a bit of a choppy start with analytics in the last fiscal year. And we attributed that to I think sort of everyone getting their feet under them as we\u2019ve learned how to work through the pandemic. Analytics had a much stronger second-half, a very good performance with our front office solutions, which include our portfolio management platform, as well as our trading solutions. And analytics is setting up much better for next year. So we see like good pipeline for the first-half, and good pipeline are within the buy side, which is you know, is where most of our analytics solutions appointed. Manav Patnaik : Got it. And then just on the research business, can you just talk about or help break out how much of that growth came from just new hiring on the sell side, with the rest of the buy side? And then, I think you talked about winning some trading business. Can you just elaborate a bit on the trading side of the offering? Phil Snow : Sure. So, we think that we outperformed significantly for three reasons. One is the investment in contents and technology, which we outlined. The excellent performance of our front office team. And then, we'd say about a third of it probably was us really just capitalizing on the strong trends in banking. So I probably attribute about a third of it to the trends that are out there. And it's the work that we put in, though that allowed us to capitalize on those trends. The trading business is really -- the port web business that we acquired a few years ago, we had a very strong year, we closed some new logos, and we increased our transaction revenue. I think a lot of that might have come from FX, so we've got a very strong FX capabilities within our EMS. Helen Shan : Yeah, Manav, I think it\u2019s important to keep in mind that the retention piece that Phil alluded to is really quite key. It is a part of why research did so well this year. Manav Patnaik : Appreciate that. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Toni Kaplan : Thank you. I wanted to focus on wealth. The ASV was up 6% organically, year-over-year it\u2019s a little bit lighter than we've seen in the last few years. You did mention that the workstations and wealth was up in the mid 20% range. So just hoping you could give some color on what sort of drag the rest of wealth down. Thanks. Phil Snow : Yeah, good question, Toni. So, you're absolutely right, the desktop business grew significantly at 24% and the ASV ex- the digital solutions part of wealth grew at about 10%. So, we had one large deal that got cancelled in February, which was a legacy digital solution from the acquisition we did many years ago, and not the type of solution that we're sort of upgrading our clients to these days. So that was something that was out there. It was with a large firm that was under financial stress and something that was a headwind for us in Q2. You might have -- I think I may have mentioned this in that quarter, we also had one other loss on the digital side, which was not related to wealth, but another anticipated council. So in total, we might have had about $6 million in council from the old legacy digital business. So I would factor that in when you're thinking about our wealth business. But the new solutions we\u2019re focused on and how we're going to market now, that was exceedingly healthy, and I think bodes well as we go into next fiscal year. Toni Kaplan : Got it. And just regarding removing the wealth disclosure in the future, I guess, why are you doing that? And how much is related to research versus CTS? And if you could sort of give the growth rates of the pieces so that we know how much to impact each of those segments by, that'd be helpful. Thank you. Phil Snow : Yeah, so it's just we've aligned our business. So the wealth business, which was run by Goran Skoko, has now become research and advisory, which he'll be leading, once Christie moved into the Chief Product officer role about a quarter ago. So really, there were two pieces to wealth, there was the web or workstation business, which lines up nicely with our research, business line. And then, there's the digital part of wealth, which lines up very nicely with CTS. So there were really good synergies on the product and workflow side that we can capture, by organizing things this way. And the digital piece of wealth, new really good capabilities have been built there, called FactSet widgets, which is in line with our open strategies. So I believe after the call, you'll get all of the numbers that show you what the growth rates would have been this year for those three business lines, which I'm sure Rima will be happy to review with you later today. Toni Kaplan : Perfect. Thanks. Phil Snow : Yeah. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Your line is open. Mario Cortellacci : Hi, this is Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. My first question just around from sales, just could you comment on how much capacity and the room for improvement there may be in sales execution today? And maybe you can also touch on what your hiring plans are over the next year? Helen Shan : Hi, this is Helen, thanks for that question. When I think about the continued pace for sales in terms of what we have the opportunity to do, I think from an execution perspective the results speak for itself for this year. And where we're looking to accelerate our efforts will be along the lines of some of our solutions that right now we are seeing a lot of client demand for on ESG on wealth analytics. And what we're seeing, as I mentioned earlier about our ability to expand within the wallet are about existing clients, I would expect to see that continue as well. And so what we've done is we're going to be planning on essentially focusing on-premiere type clients or highest clients, and including some that we think we can really continue to do that expansion on the enterprise front. So from an execution perspective, those are the areas that I think we'll continue to expand on. But it really is building on the momentum that we already have seen this year. Mario Cortellacci : Thanks. And then for my follow-up, I mean, we've seen a lot of large M&A in the financial services space in general. Maybe you can just talk about what your willingness is to participate in a larger M&A? And specifically, are there any synergies with assets that are currently not in your portfolio today? And then are there any significant scale advantages today that you might be lacking? Phil Snow : Well, I think our answer has been consistent regarding M&A. So we feel that we have the scale we need. We're one very well integrated platform. And we're very good at doing tuck-in acquisitions for a unique content and technology, which we demonstrated this year. So we're really happy with our platform and our ability to be a central player in the ecosystem, and be really agnostic to the data that's on our platform, whether it's ours or us integrating third-party content. We do have a very healthy balance sheet. And we've said historically, that if the right transaction comes around that's larger, we're in a position to execute on it. But we don't feel that it's something we need to do to be successful and we've demonstrated that this year. Mario Cortellacci : Great. Thank you very much. Helen Shan : Thank you. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open. Alex Kramm : Yes. Hey, good morning, everyone. Sorry if I missed this in your prepared remarks, but can you just talk about the outperformance on ASV in the fourth quarter? I mean, obviously, you had some guidance out there that you gave us just a couple months ago. And then, I would say you beat that by $25 or so million dollars. So just wondering if there was anything chunky, maybe not repetitive, that you would call out that we may have missed and because that obviously creates a tougher comp for next year? Phil Snow : Well, like some quarters, Alex, we do have some large wins. So we did have one very good win on the wealth side. And we had one very good win on the data partner side. But that doesn't mean we can't have these types of wins in future quarters. So that certainly helps getting those done. But again, I think just excellent execution from the sales team, really closing out the year in dramatic fashion, and capitalizing on those market trends that we spoke about earlier. Alex Kramm : Okay. No, no, that's helpful. Just wanted to make sure there wasn't anything super chunky. That seems like two larger things. And then just as a follow-up to a question earlier, I think you said that you think the environment added about a third of the growth. So I guess a little bit over 2% or so. So I guess as we look into 2022, what type of environment is kind of factored into your guidance from an overall industry perspective? Because you can't ignore as you just said yourself, that there's been a lot of tailwind in capital markets that have helped you. So just curious what you expect, if you expect us to persist or what kind of environment we should be thinking about? Phil Snow : So just to be clear, I would say a third of the outperformance versus our guidance was due to those trends, not a third of our overall performance as a company. And as I mentioned in an earlier question, the buy side is setting up very nicely for us next year. We see a very healthy pipeline, good trends on the buy side. So even though there are some tough conditions out there for asset managers, our investment in our platform, our content, opening it up, really allow us to take market share and really help them with some of the challenges, which is managing data better, which CTS does a great job of, and then really being plug and play in terms of the workflow solutions. So, we feel good about the buy side going into next year. Of course, continued health on the sell side will help us, but we don't need that to be successful and to meet our guidance. Alex Kramm : Oh, thanks for clarifying. Take care. Phil Snow : Sure. Thank you. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is open. Trevor Romeo : Hi, this is actually Trevor Romeo in for Andrew. Thanks for taking my questions. I was just kind of hoping you could provide an update on the selling environment and how sales cycles have evolved in terms of length and complexity? You've seen any changes in the speed of client decision making lately? Helen Shan : Hi, thank you for that question. I'll take that one. So, I think one of the other points that helps drive our outperformance was our analytics business which accelerated, and some of the deals that perhaps had taken a bit longer, really coming to fruition. And we continue to see that as we think about -- look at the pipeline going forward. So, I don't think, I would say there's wholesale change yet in terms of the decision making that really is case by case. But I will say that as we settle into much more so of the virtual environment, clients are really focused on their own digital transformation they need to improve. And as a result, some of the things that we've had for a while that got pushed were realized. And we'll continue to see that going forward. Trevor Romeo : Great. And then, just in terms of the deep sector content investments that you've been making. We're just wondering if there are any particular sectors or industries, where you've kind of seen the strongest uptake at this point. And then going forward, which ones you might expect to see in the most investments? Thank you. Phil Snow : Yeah, so, I think the three that we have released are financials, we've done some good work in insurance, real estate. So we're seeing really good usage across all of those. And we're beginning to make progress on some of the other sectors. So, I'd say it's pretty broad-based. Trevor Romeo : Alright. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on the components of ASV growth in fiscal 2022. You've had several larger wins in 2021, and also some larger legacy cancels. So as you look ahead to fiscal 2022, what kind of ASV growth do you expect across your realigned research analytics in CTS businesses? Phil Snow : I don't think we're giving explicit guidance, George, on those three business lines. But I would say it's well balanced between all of them. CTS, I would expect will continue to have a high growth rate, just given the trends in the market and the opening up of the platform. Analytics, as I've mentioned is setting up well versus last year, and not a lot has changed in terms of the components of that business line. And we're very optimistic about research, but just based on what we've seen over the last year and our ability to close new logos and meaningfully increase the number of users affects that across a lot of different firm types. Helen Shan : George, I would take a look across the geographies as well. I mean, if I look at the pipeline, quite frankly, Americas which has been very strong in 2021. We expect to have continued strength, but we saw double digit growth in Asia-Pac and Europe picking up as well. So, I think it's really quite broad-based. I think it's what gives us not only a lot of pride of what we've just done, but also the confidence as we go forward, which is reflected in our guidance. George Tong : Got it. Very helpful. And then on pricing, what kind of pricing assumptions are you reflecting in your guide? How much do you expect pricing to go up by in the forthcoming year, particularly as you think about how much competitors are raising their prices by? So do you think you're raising prices in line with the competition ahead of or below the competition for next year? Helen Shan : Sure, I'll take that one as well. I mean, we are very -- we could see that our clients value our products by what we were able to capture this year. And we'll continue that into next year. I think we will be in line with many of our competitors as well. So we would expect to see that similar impact, if not more. We've spent a lot in enhancements in the value that we can clearly tie back to what we've done for them. So George, I would expect to see it in line in not only in the market, but in the previous year. George Tong : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is open. Q \u2013 Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Hey, good morning. In terms of your momentum with sell side customers, to what extent would you ascribe that growth to new customer wins or new product sales, as opposed to your existing customers growing their headcount? Phil Snow : Hey, Patrick, it's Phil. So just in terms of new logos, we did better this year on the sell side that we did last year. I think we were actually down in terms of new logos on the sell side, and we were up this year. So we're certainly adding new clients and some of that, as you can expect, is being driven by just the investment that we've made, particularly in the content area. Q \u2013 Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Okay. And then, I guess, speaking of the headcount theme, FactSet\u2019s headcount growth has slowed, I think it was 4% in the fourth quarter year-over-year, I think closer to 3% ex- acquisitions. Was that an intentional deceleration of headcount growth? Or does it reflect challenges in terms of hiring and retaining talent in this environment? Phil Snow : Well, I think we've done very well in terms of the employee value proposition at FactSet over the last year. We've done a lot to really make sure that our employees feel like they're taken care of, that they have flexibility in terms of how they work, and so on. So I think, we have a lot to be proud of there for our employees. Like lots of firms, right, we're going to be faced with a lot of movements. I think, on the talent side, we believe that creates a good opportunity for us in the marketplace. We think we'll be able to retain the talent we need at FactSet, but also attract some really good new talent to the company. So, I think we're probably in line, frankly, in terms of what we planned in terms of headcount growth there. I don't know Helen, if you've got anything you wanted to add? Helen Shan : Yeah, no, and I think what we've seen is in our own productivity and efficiency improvement as we've gone through, I think we've talked before around workforce mix. If I take a look at where, while our headcount has gone up, the mix of that is also quite key. And then when we talk about the operating leverage or labor productivity, you've seen that come through as well. And please note that, especially since we've invested quite a lot in the technology front that is meant to help us in terms of having the type of work that our folks do. So I wouldn't necessarily look at people count as the driver here, as we think about our opportunities going forward? Q \u2013 Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Thank you. Helen Shan : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Owen Lau : Thank you for taking my question. Going back to the driver of CTS, could you please remind us some of the use cases of CTS? And as this segment continues to evolve, do you see a scenario that customers will like mostly need API in data feeds, but not so much on the desktop? Or they will still come hand in hand because desktop can still provide a good distribution channel to customers? Thank you. Phil Snow : Yeah. Good question. Thank you. Yeah, so traditionally FactSet has sold a lot of data workflow solution through CTS to quants. But that's not the only workflow that we've sold to. So we still do very well selling to quants. But we're also thinking about how do we expand our market share by getting into more workflows across the middle and back office. And as we've opened up our platform and invested in new contents, it's created some great opportunity for us to help clients manage their own data, with our entity data map and our concordance services. Managing data is expensive, and FactSet is really expert at that. So that is one area that we're seeing really good growth from, particularly as we make those services available through new channels, such as, cloud providers that we already spoke about. We've done traditionally well with performance workflows as well, this was a very good year for us, with our benchmark data feeds. So FactSet does a lot of work to integrate all of the different benchmarks and indexes that are out there that feed into a client's own performance system. So that could be our own performance system. But we're not the only performance system out there. And so there are lots of opportunities here, real times and other opportunities, sort of that trading workflows. So as we've developed more of our own capabilities that we view that as a good opportunity. Helen Shan : And just to add to that, when we talk about the sell side, Phil alluded to before, the growth there is also on the feeds side. And so, we're seeing interestingly, that being a driver for our CTS business, so I think that's an important piece to consider as well. Phil Snow : Just to finish off your second point there is a valid one. We do think there's going to be a very healthy balance out there for how people want to consume value. So it could be through a workstation or a web, where we tee up the next best action for a particular user. But increasingly, firms are going to want to consume data in new ways as they analyze things in new ways. And that could be just a research analyst deciding they want to program in Python, or use Tableau or some other types of systems to sort of do their analysis. So it could be the same type of user, but through a different workflow, or it could be just feeding directly into a system that a client has like a CRM. Owen Lau : Got it. That's extremely helpful. And then, going back to the research, I think we touch on a lot about the growth there. But there are lots of news out there that many investment banks are raising the salary of the junior bankers on the banking side. Do you see like, in terms of the new \u2013 is there any like additional subscriptions from these clients? Do you think they also increase the hiring and FactSet can benefit from that as well? Thank you. Phil Snow : Yeah, I think that's what we just saw in Q4, as we saw the banks, if I'm understanding your question correctly, hire a lot of new talent. And when that happens, very often FactSet will just get deployed automatically onto those desks. Helen Shan : I think also, in addition to the number of analysts to your point, Owen, what they're looking for us to be able to provide their analysts the tools that are needed. And I think that's what we're finding, and that's why I think our retention has improved as well. What we're finding is getting the tools of FactSet to the analysts, to allow them to do their work in a more efficient way. So they are not spending 100 plus hours. I think all of that comes into play. Owen Lau : Got it. That's my questions. All right. Thank you very much. Helen Shan : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of David Chu with Bank of America. Your line is open. David Chu : Thanks, guys. So you highlighted strong performance from the sales teams throughout the call. Helen, are there any key changes to the strategy since you took on a new role? Helen Shan : Thanks for your question. One of the things, quite frankly, is how proud I am and the fact that how we have executed. And I think the areas of focus, if anything is more of an enhancement at this juncture, I think what we will focus on is our go to market strategy. I think we will focus more on driving the enterprise discussion with senior client executives, it really allows us to provide our platform for their own digital transformations. And in terms of major changes, I would say, no other than really, again, enhancing on the areas that we think we can leverage across the firm types, or quite frankly, operationally, where we can provide them more bandwidth to spend more time with clients. David Chu : Got it. And then just on the wealth side, are there any meaningful RFPs coming up, let's say in the next 12-months? And, how would you characterize your win rates now, when you go into these RFPs? Phil Snow : Yeah, we're not going to comment on that. But there is, I think, a steady drumbeat of these opportunities coming through each year. And, we do exceptionally well when we get into an RFP, just based on the product we have, and the legendary FactSet service. Those are two things that really give us an advantage when we're competing for those businesses. David Chu : Okay, got it. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Keith Housum : Congrats on a great quarter. Just looking at the pipeline that you guys have talked about in the past has been fantastic, I remember back to last quarter. How would you talk -- how would you characterize the pipeline coming out of the fourth quarter compared to I guess the third and second quarter? Phil Snow : Well, the way that I would look at that, Keith is just sort of versus the first-half of last year. And, we got off to a pretty rough start last Q1. We were definitely digging out of a hole there and just came storming back in the last three quarters. So as I mentioned already a few times, the first-half, which is typically the period that we have the most visibility on, is setting up quite nicely, particularly on the buy side with the analytics team. Keith Housum : Great. If we talk about the growth that you guys are experiencing, would you talk about it as more market share gain, or more an expansion of your overall products set and expansion of the overall market? Phil Snow : I\u2019d say combination there, I think we do very well competitively. And our strategy we believe is differentiating in terms of opening up the platform and investing in new content sets in being neutral, in terms of what data we provide the market. So that is resonating particularly well with our clients, as they tried to differentiate themselves and become more efficient. And, we get a lot of upside from expanding clients, when we continue to build out our solution, our clients trust us, and we've got great service. And when trends are good like this in the market, we're able to really capitalize on that. Keith Housum : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Your line is open. Craig Huber : Yes. Good morning. My first question as you remember two years ago, you guys three year investment plan and stuff with I guess, on the back end that you're expecting to be able to get to high single digit ASV growth in the back end of that. Is that still the plan here a year out or has been pushed out some, as you've alluded to, in prior calls, because of this pandemic? Phil Snow : Thanks, Craig. So we're entering the third year of that original three year plan. And I think you can see our performance this year, and what are guidance is for next year. So we certainly -- high single digits is certainly something that's achievable. I believe back then we articulated that we would exit the year with a 33% margin, which is, I think, I believe the middle of our guidance here for this year. And, our aspiration was to get to double digit EPS growth. I think if you look at the midpoint of our guidance, it's high single digits. But that doesn't mean, if we execute well, we can get to that thing. So I couldn't be prouder of our company. We've all worked exceptionally hard over the last two years. And it's really great to see this level of performance. And we're really optimistic as we go into FY \u201822. Craig Huber : And then my follow-up, please, on the cost side related to that three year investment program. I think originally you thought you're going to spend $15 million each of the three years, it's changed. Maybe you could just update us on those numbers, please? I think it was higher last year, do you have that number? Helen Shan : Sure. I can talk broadly on those points, Craig. Yes. I mean, as discussed earlier, we are on target in terms of our plan. There are things that we probably accelerated in terms of spend, and in some cases where we've adjusted along the way, that's what you would expect in a three year plan. So from a technology perspective, we probably spend a bit more, and we're able to make that up as you can tell from our performance this year. To go back a little bit to your point on us having pushed it out. I think what's really, I think admirable, is the fact that with the situation that we had with the pandemic, we were trying to be as transparent as possible. And the fact that we were able to achieve what we have, and we're indicating for the third year, really does mean that we were able to meet what we had originally given guidance on. Craig Huber : Thank you. Operator : I'm showing no further questions at this time. I\u2019d now like to hand the conference back over to Mr. Phil Snow, for closing remarks. Phil Snow : Thank you all for joining us today. In closing, I want to reiterate how pleased we are with our performance this fiscal year. We also made substantial progress on our internal ESG strategy. Steps we have taken this past quarter alone include joining the UN Global Compact and Principles of Responsible Investment, publishing our global diversity figures and committing to becoming MLT black equity at work certified, in addition to completing our sustainability plan, which outlines our ESG goals and aspirations. I'm very proud of all FactSet has accomplished this year, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. In the meantime, please call Rima Hyder with additional questions. Operator, this ends today's call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Kendra Brown, you may begin. Kendra Brown : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FactSet's first fiscal quarter 2022 earnings call. Before we begin, I would like to point out that the slides we will reference during this presentation can be accessed via the webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at factset.com. The slides will be posted on our website at the conclusion of this call. A replay of today's call will be available via phone and on our website. After prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions from investors. To be fair to everyone, please limit yourself to one question plus one follow-up. Before we discuss our results, I encourage all listeners to review the legal notice on Slide 2, which explains the risks of forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the appendix to the presentation and in our earnings release issued earlier today. Joining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer; and Linda Huber, Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, I want to let you all know that we are planning an Investor Day in early April, and we will be sharing more information soon. So stay tuned. With that, I will turn the discussion over to Phil Snow. Phil Snow : Thank you, Kendra, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Before I begin, let me start by welcoming Kendra, who recently became FactSet's Head of Investor Relations. Kendra has worked at FactSet for more than two decades, most recently serving as my Chief of Staff. She brings a deep knowledge of the Company and industry expertise to her new role. I look forward to working with Kendra to continue growing our Investor Relations program. I'd also like to welcome Linda to her first earnings call as a member of the FactSet team. We are excited to have her here and have already begun leveraging her deep financial and operational expertise as we continue to execute our growth strategy. Turning to our performance. FactSet is off to a strong start to fiscal 2022, and I'm pleased to share that this quarter had the highest Q1 incremental ASV on record. Building on the momentum from Q4, we grew organic ASV plus professional services by 9% year-over-year in Q1. The strong performance of our sales and client-facing teams carry forward from Q4, increasing the pace of our go-to-market strategy. These teams continue to drive increased retention and expansion rates among our existing clients while achieving a high number of new business wins. The biggest contributors to this quarter's growth were institutional asset management clients as we continue to see strength in our workstation and accelerating growth in our analytics workflow solutions. The last two years of accelerated investments in content and technology continue to drive top line growth. We are seeing increased demand for differentiated content and workflow solutions. FactSet's leading open content and analytics platform is allowing us to meet this demand and capture more share of wallet with our clients. By client type, wins were broad-based. We saw double-digit ASV growth rates from our banking, wealth, hedge fund and corporate clients as well as private equity and venture capital funds and partners. Our investments in content and technology, including deep sector, wealth and analytics solutions continue to support client retention rates and renewals across the board. Overall, we are pleased that our performance resulted in a 13% increase in adjusted EPS from the prior year period. Our adjusted operating margin of 33.6% exceeds our guidance. Linda will walk you through the details in a few minutes. We are now in the final year of our multiyear investment plan, and we remain on track to achieve our goals. Our focus is on our digital platform, scaling our content refinery and creating hyperpersonalized workflow solutions. Within our content refinery, ESG, data for wealth, private markets and deep sector are all fueling workstation growth. We continue to grow our deep sector data, launching real estate and technology, media and telecom in November. Deep sector and our investments in private markets have translated into growth and higher retention within sell-side firms. And our recent acquisition of Cobalt further advances our private market strategy by connecting differentiated data with tracking and portfolio monitoring, providing value to our private equity and venture capital clients. Our workflow solutions, which deliver efficiencies across the front, middle and back office continue to add meaningful ASV. Our analytics APIs are resonating with our clients, and we are increasingly integrating with cloud-based platforms. Earlier this month, we launched over 90 data sets and a number of APIs on Amazon Data Exchange, the first major data and analytics provider to do so. Our trading business continues to grow, bolstered by the recent addition of fixed income support for trade execution. This enables our clients to surface new insights and trade across asset classes with greater speed and efficiency, and was a significant contributor to the growth of our Analytics & Trading business during the quarter. Our product teams are focused on identifying, developing and implementing made-for client workflow solutions for each of our client types. This has been incredibly successful within wealth as our adviser dashboard maintains a healthy pipeline and solid client engagement for FY '22. We see this hyperpersonalization as a key differentiator and are committed to working with our clients to evolve our offering. Looking across our regions, we saw continued strength in ASV growth across all our markets. The Americas was the biggest contributor as organic ASV growth accelerated to 9%, supported by broad-based strength across our businesses. This was driven by strong retention and expansion among asset managers and asset owners. The region also benefited from capturing higher price increases. In EMEA, growth accelerated to 7%, consistently improving over the past three quarters. Research and Advisory had a particularly positive impact driven by improved retention among asset managers and wealth clients and strong workstation sales to new customers. Asia Pacific had another robust quarter with growth accelerating to 14% driven primarily by CTS. We again saw wins across many countries with hedge funds, asset managers and asset owners driving ASV growth. In summary, I am proud of the FactSet team for delivering such strong results to the start of the year. The first quarter, as you know, is historically a slower start to the fiscal year and not necessarily an indication of our performance for the rest of the year. However, our momentum from Q4 has continued, and we are well positioned to deliver on our targets for the year. As such, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2022 guidance and we remain confident in our pipeline and in the value we are delivering to our clients. Looking ahead, we continue to focus on three strategic priorities : scaling up our content refinery, enhancing the client experience through hyperpersonalized solutions and delivering next-generation workflow solutions for clients. And we believe that our people, culture and performance-driven mindset will enable us to execute on these priorities as we accelerate the pace of change. We are committed to investing in and developing the talent experience and the skills of our team as we build the industry's leading open content and analytics platform. Finally, an important milestone in our company's history occurred earlier this week when FactSet became part of the S&P 500 Index. Our addition was, in fact, predicted by our S&P 500 constituent's prediction signal on October 1. Our inclusion is a proud moment for FactSet and a testament to our tremendous growth and our efforts to help our clients do their best work. Our team's creativity, dedication and collaborative spirit make us a trusted partner, and I'm tremendously proud of their drive to create smarter, more innovative solutions for our clients. I'll now turn it over to Linda, who will take you through the specifics of our first quarter performance. Linda Huber : Thank you, Phil, and hello to everyone on the call. I'm really pleased to be here today as part of the FactSet team. I've been at FactSet for just a few months, but in that short time, it's become clear that the Company has been performing really well from accelerating top line growth and strong free cash flow generation to its long history of consistent and growing shareholder returns. And there's still a lot of runway ahead of us as the investments made over the past two years are paying off and driving growth. There is undeniably a great deal of talent across the organization. I look forward to working with the team to build on FactSet's history of outstanding performance while generating meaningful value for shareholders. Looking now at the first quarter, as you have seen from our press release this morning, we are pleased to report acceleration in our top line with high single-digit growth, both in terms of revenue and organic ASV plus professional services. I'll now share more details on our first quarter performance. First, on ASV, we grew organic ASV plus professional services by 9%. As Phil noted previously, we typically see a seasonal deceleration in Q1. Our performance reflects increased demand for our content and product, higher retention and our ability to realize higher pricing. The marketplace has been supportive with solid workstation growth in banking and greater demands for our portfolio analytics solutions. As market conditions continue to evolve, our subscription-based ASV will continue to support value-based pricing. GAAP revenue increased by 9% to $425 million, while organic revenue which excludes any impact from foreign exchange and acquisitions, increased 9% to $423 million. Growth was driven primarily by Analytics & Trading and Research & Advisory. All regions experienced notable year-over-year growth. For our geographic segments on an organic basis, Americas revenue grew 9%, EMEA also came in at 9% and Asia Pac revenues grew at 14%. Main drivers in the region were analytics, CTS and workstation growth. Turning now to expenses. GAAP operating expenses grew 13% in the first quarter to $302 million impacted by anticipated changes incurred during the period. We recorded a restructuring charge of $9 million to drive a more efficient and empowered organizational structure. Ongoing savings from this realignment will primarily be used for product reinvestment and key talent retention. In addition, we recognized $4 million of expense related to vacating certain office space in New York City. We recently pulled our employees on optimal work arrangements and consistent with what we see in the market, a vast majority prefer a hybrid or remote working model. Given this preference, we are reassessing our real estate footprint to better reflect our new work arrangements. Also in Q1, we incorporated the FactSet Charitable Foundation to facilitate our corporate social responsibility goals. Compared to the previous year, our GAAP operating margin decreased by 230 basis points to 29% and our adjusted operating margin decreased by 70 basis points to 34%. As stated before, this exceeds our guidance on this measure. Our increased expenses were partially offset by lower compensation expense. As a percentage of revenue, our cost of sales was 32 basis points higher than last year on a GAAP basis and 72 basis points lower on an adjusted basis. This reflects increased data and infrastructure costs and higher compensation expense for our existing employee base. These expenses also include our ongoing shift to the public cloud as part of our digital transformation and multiyear investment plan. Lower personnel expenses partially offset these increases. When expressed on a percentage basis of revenue, SG&A was 198 basis points higher year-over-year on a GAAP basis and 145 basis points higher on an adjusted basis. The primary drivers include increased employee compensation, higher bonus accrual and real estate exit costs. This was partially offset by lower stock compensation year-over-year. Turning now to taxes. Our tax rate for the quarter was 10% compared to last year's rate of 16%. This lower rate was due to a tax benefit from the exercise of stock options as a result of our record stock price. This caused the annual estimated benefit to be higher than expected. The lower annual rate was partially offset by higher-than-expected U.S. income. GAAP EPS increased 7% to $2.79 this quarter versus $2.62 in the prior year. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 13% to $3.25, driven by higher revenues and a lower tax rate. A reconciliation of our adjustments to GAAP EPS is provided at the end of our press release. Free cash flow, which we defined as cash generated from operations less capital spending, was $64 million for the quarter, a decrease of 9% over the same period last year. This was primarily due to the timing of tax payments, higher year-over-year employee bonus payments and a reduction in capital expenditures related to facilities build-outs. Our ASV retention remained at greater than 95%. We grew the total number of clients by 14% compared to the prior year, which continues to be driven by the addition of more wealth and corporate clients. Our client retention improved to 92% year-over-year, which speaks to the success of our products and investments and the efforts of our sales teams. For the first quarter, we repurchased 46,200 shares of our common stock for a total of $19 million at an average per share price of $403. We remain disciplined in our buyback program and committed to returning long-term value to our shareholders. We are reaffirming our guidance for 2022. And as we often say, our business is a tale of two halves. While it is clear that our momentum from Q4 has continued and we believe that we are well positioned to deliver on our targets, it's still early in the fiscal year. We remain focused on developing our content, technology and people and delivering value for our shareholders. And with that, we're now ready for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclay. Manav Patnaik : Linda, just a follow-up on that last comment on along, I just wanted to get the visibility you have and just in terms of the sustainability of the revenue growth that FactSet has kind of shown that acceleration over the last few quarters. Phil Snow : Yes. I'll take that one, Manav. So I think we feel very good about the sustainability of the growth rates. The investments that we made in both our digital platform as well as content are really paying off. So, on the content side, the investments in deep sector, ESG, wealth content, these are all driving workstation growth very nicely. And then on the technology side, just the opening up of the platform and the ability to serve up data to clients wherever they want it, whether it's in Snowflake, Amazon, through our APIs, you name it, that, I think, has a lot of runway. And then we just continue to invest in making sure that our software is the best in the industry and that we're creating an interface that is really pleasing to our clients where they can come in, sift through all the noise and really understand sort of what it is that's important to them. Manav Patnaik : Got it. I guess I was focusing a bit more, Phil, on just the acceleration you've seen in the sell side, most notably. And then obviously, this quarter, the buy side as well. So just -- I don't know how you guys are thinking about sell side continue that? Or are there any signs that's going to start slowing down just more along those lines? Phil Snow : We had a good quarter for the sell side relative to this time last year. However, what I'm most excited about is the acceleration in the buy side. So you can see that the buy side as a whole, the way that we measure it, grew, I think, 200 basis points. The largest segment within that for us, the largest fund type, they're just the institutional asset managers where we've seen, obviously, a lot of pressure over the last few years. But our solutions are resonating with them. They had a very strong quarter relative to the other phone types. I think it was the biggest contributor on an absolute basis relative to last year. So we're really bullish about the buy side and particularly our analytics solutions are beginning to take hold again. So, I think there was some pent-up, I think, demand there on the buy side. And I think as we're sort of learning -- all learning how to operate within a new environment, we saw a lot of deals that have been kind of pushed off beginning to come to fruition. Operator : Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : Perfect. And great speaking with you again, Linda. Just wondering if you could talk about how it's going so far and any best practices that you're bringing with you from Moody's and MSCI and really any sort of changes in capital allocation strategy as you think about it from what you've seen so far? Linda Huber : Thanks, Toni, and it's great to hear from you as well. So far, everything is going great. It's been about 10 weeks. And for this quarter, we've been able to pair some pretty terrific top line growth with our start on what we're going to do on working on the margin. So you probably saw, we did a $9 million restructuring charge as well as a $3.7 million real estate charge. And on the margin front, we've talked about the need to focus on four big buckets of cost, which would be compensation, technology, real estate and third-party data. So what you're seeing here is the out-of-the-box first efforts here to make sure we've got the margin plan moving along. And this is a best practice, obviously, that has worked in other places. So the $9 million restructuring charge, we were able to take about 5% off the compensation line. We increased spans of control for the managers, and we reduced the number of layers in the corporation by one. So that efficiency was very, very helpful to us. We've also been very careful about headcount additions. Headcount is about flat for this quarter. And we did invest some of that 5% savings from the comp line back into key talent and high potential employee performance compensation for those folks. On the real estate line, as we said, we've got to take a look at our real estate footprint given that a number of our employees are very excited about continued flexibility. The analysis here is to look at the real estate line, think about what we can best do to get the footprint rightsized. And we haven't come to a conclusion yet on that because we have to make sure that the offices work well for the employees. But we're starting on our margin journey here. You see that the margin exceeded the guidance for the GAAP operating margin. And on capital allocation, we've begun our discussions. No official decisions quite yet. We will be releasing our 10-Q early in January, and we'll see where we get to after that. But so far, so good, good focus on margin, good focus on capital allocation. And we're also looking to be more specific about the returns on our investments that we've made. Not quite there yet on that one, but Phil will be speaking some more about the fact that we've continued to invest through the pandemic, and that is really paying off for us now. We continue to invest where some others pulled back. So, so far, good, and thanks for the question. Toni Kaplan : Terrific. And as a follow-up, Phil, I just wanted to ask about sort of the product road map from here. You mentioned that the deep sector strategy is gaining some traction. And so I guess, what's next? And how are you thinking about -- I'm sure we'll get some color on that at the Investor Day, but just anything you're excited about into -- in this fiscal year. Phil Snow : Yes. Thanks, Toni. There is still quite a bit of work to do to finish off the work that we set out three years ago. So we're on track for deep sector. So we -- as I talked about in the script, we released a couple more industries there. So we've got a few more to go. We continue to build out our ESG coverage. So, we're very excited about the Truvalue Labs acquisition that's growing at a good clip. And one of our -- one of the things we do well when we acquire data like that is just continue to build it out in terms of coverage. So there's a lot of effort behind that. And then on the private market side, that's a relatively new area for us. We're super excited about the Cobalt acquisition. But we're just going to continue to build out what we can offer there from both the data and workflow standpoint. So I'd say on the content side, those are still very exciting and still a ton of runway, and we think we can take a lot of market share once we complete all of those. And then I would say on the software side, it's really this concept of next best action. So we've seen a lot of interest in our adviser dashboard, which has been sold to a number of wealth firms. And that really, as we've spoken about, allows an adviser to sift through the noise and sort of understand what he or she may want to do as the first 10 things on any given day. We're going to extend that concept to other firm types and other workflows. So it's still early days for that, but we do think that, that's going to be an important differentiator for us as a firm. Operator : Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Ashish Sabadra : Congrats on the solid results. I just wanted to hold down further on analytics. Phil, obviously, you mentioned pretty good pent-up demand and pretty good momentum, strong demand for your end products. I was just wondering if you could talk about how big is the opportunity where you are in exploring those opportunities. And then as we think about these implementations, are you replacing an existing third-party systems or in-house applications? I was just wondering if you could also talk about whether you're gaining market share. So, any incremental color on the analytics front? Phil Snow : Thanks, Ashish. And as you know, it's a broad portfolio of solutions and products we have there. So maybe I'll break it down. In terms of our front office solutions, what we have in there are our trading capabilities and we put our new Quant research environment in there. And both of those are doing very well. So we're seeing very good adoption of the front office solutions. And I think the release of our fixed income trading capabilities should provide some good upside in the future. So on the front office side, we feel good there. We've put a lot of effort into integrating those assets that we bought a few years ago. We've released our portfolio management platform, and we're seeing a ton of interest. In the middle office, we had a very good quarter as well. In fact, a lot of what drove analytics was good old portfolio analysis, and we saw very good uptick there, and that had been sort of flat for a while. So that's sort of a testament, I think, to us continuing to invest in that product and some of the work we've done there to just continue to execute well on the sales front. So, we just see a ton of opportunity. I mean it's, I think, around a $600 million business today. I think that's what we reported at the end of last fiscal year, but it's really nice to see the growth rate of that segment of our business, which has been differentiating for FactSet and should be moving forward. There's a lot of excitement amongst the team and that's what's been driving, I think, the improved relative performance on the buy side. Ashish Sabadra : That's very helpful color. And Linda, maybe a follow-up question. Thanks again for providing that color on the cost or cost takeout opportunity and margin expansion opportunity as well as capital allocation. I was wondering when do you plan to provide like an update on the mid or long term? Should we expect that at the Investor Day? And maybe if I can just ask on the margin front itself, how do you think about the margin expansion opportunity as you think about these four buckets of cost take out? Linda Huber : Ashish, maybe I'll start with your second question first. On the margin opportunity, it's quite clear that FactSet has some room to go and to improve on the margin front. So what we're going to do is we're going to look at all four of these buckets very carefully, benchmark them and see what action we should take. And what you've seen this quarter, as I said, is a start on that path. So our guidance for this year is 32.5% to 33.5% adjusted operating margin. We're ahead of that for this quarter, which is really good, very hard to predict the margin sequentially. So we're just going to stick with the annual guidance. And we have a very sharp eye on the margin focus at this point. On capital allocation, I think you're right, as we move toward Investor Day, which is currently scheduled for April 5, we'll see what happens as every day is a new day with COVID. We would like to talk a little bit more about this. I think directionally many of the companies in this space are sort of investment-grade companies in the BAA, BBB space. I think we'll think about that a little bit further, and we'll give you a little bit more guidance as we move through the next earnings call and Investor Day. Ashish Sabadra : That's very helpful color. Yes. No, it was very helpful and congrats once again. Linda Huber : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Alex Kramm : I think you mentioned, Linda, value-based pricing opportunities a couple of times in your prepared remarks. Can you flesh that out a little bit more? I think you've talked recently about the inflationary environment potentially helping you. But when I look about the next quarter, that's usually when you have your Americas increase, I think that added 1.5% to pricing last year. So clearly, I don't think you can reprice across the whole book. So maybe talk a little bit about how much of your ASV actually is -- you can reprice? And then obviously, how you feel about that 1.5% from last year, this year in a higher inflationary environment? Linda Huber : Sure, Alex. Let me start and then Phil will pick up from there. So one of the things that is important to note is that most of our contracts indicate that we can take price increases if warranted at 3% or up to the rate of inflation. Now we're not obviously going to price up to the rate of inflation, which recently has been quite a bit higher. But I think it's important to note that the sales team, led by Helen Shan has done a good job of upping the realization on the price front for us, being very careful to provide appropriate value to our customers. So with that, I'll probably turn it over to Phil and let him speak a little bit more about what we see in the future for price. Phil Snow : Yes. Thanks, Linda. Alex, yes, so I think we have got good pricing power and Linda mentioned that Helen did -- she put in a massive amount of work, frankly, in the last two years to sort of rationalize a lot of the SKUs that we had on FactSet. In fact, I was told at one point that there were more FactSet SKUs than molecules in the universe, which worried me a little bit. So we've done a great job to rationalize that. And Helen is certainly for new business, making sure that we're using these new packages. And it has made the lives of the salespeople so much easier. It's -- they have less to worry about in terms of making sure the packages are customized for clients. It's helping us be more efficient. I think it's providing more value in the marketplace and sort of clients are sort of -- it's an easier choice for them. So, I do think its early days on this, and we're not going to jam it all through at once, but we're just going to move our way through this in a systematic way and make sure that we're keeping the health of our clients and the great relationships we have with them as a top priority. Alex Kramm : Okay. Great. And then I guess, secondarily, just coming back to the margin, obviously, decent severance action taken this quarter. And you said some of these savings are going to be reinvested. So any other color you can give us in terms of how quickly you're going to reinvest these savings? I mean, I look at last year, and I know your margin was decent in the first quarter, but it was down year-over-year. And I don't know what the cadence for the rest of the year is going to be. But I guess my question would be, should we expect the near-term margins to come up a little bit as you realize these savings and then they get reinvested later on this year. So any help you could provide us would be helpful here. Linda Huber : Yes. Alex, it's as I said, tough to predict the margin quarter-over-quarter. This first quarter has run exceptionally strong in terms of sales, as Phil has detailed. One of the things that we noted as a result of that, which makes it difficult to talk about the margin quarter-over-quarter is the performance plans and the bonus plans associated partially with the sales team and with the rest of the corporation. So for example, last year, we put up $15 million for the performance plan. And this year, in fact, that number is $21 million, just to show you the difference in the strength between Q1 this year versus last year. So we will continue to work hard on making progress on the margin. We took some of these charges earlier in the year so that we are hopeful that the run rate will improve as we move through the year. But in terms of headwinds, we've got some choppiness coming from what the Fed has discussed and potentially as the semicon situation continue. So, we think we're doing and taking the right actions on our part, Alex, but it's kind of hard to tell with this market environment being as choppy as it is. But we're really pleased with the first quarter and the progress that we've made, and we've taken the tough steps here. So, we're optimistic and keeping a close eye on everything. I don't know, Phil had anything more he wanted to add. Phil Snow : No, that's good. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Phil, maybe you could talk a little bit more about the margin journey. Just historically, FactSet had a certain philosophy in terms of reinvesting incremental margin over a certain level to drive long-term revenue growth. With the discussions today and talking about room for margin to go up, is there -- is that a -- is that same philosophy continuing, but the idea is that we have a higher margin level that we're kind of -- or range we're targeting? Or is there some kind of different approach that you're taking towards the margins in terms of balancing the margin versus the target revenue growth for driving long-term value for the Company. Phil Snow : Yes. So thanks, Shlomo. Good to talk to you. Yes, we will continue to reinvest in our product. We've done that over the last four decades. And as a technology and content company, it's so important that we do that. So we took that step back a couple of years ago. We're marching back to levels that we had back then. But I do believe that a big piece of the thesis here was to invest in the technology in a way, which would make FactSet more efficient. So we do think there's a lot of efficiency to be gained by what we put in, in terms of the tech stack. And we just have to balance over time how much of that we leverage in terms of margin versus reinvesting in the business. Linda Huber : And Shlomo, I would add, we've increased on the margin by 50 basis points for this year. We would hope that, that would be a trend to continue, but stay tuned year-over-year. I think one of the other things we're going to have to watch and if we can't fight measure yet is the management of the product portfolio efforts under Christi. And with that, we're going to focus a little bit more on how profitability. Is there anything we need to trim or prune and just make sure that we have the product focus correctly in order. Phil may want to say a little bit more about this. But we suspect that if we get that piece right, we may be able to find some more margin. And we're just not sure yet you just announced this change recently. Phil Snow : Yes. So I think maybe in your follow-up conversations with Kendra and Linda later, they can provide more detail here. But part of the restructuring, we also reorganized the Company in a way where we're thinking about product management a little bit differently. So we elevated the Chief Product Officer role under Christie Canopy and that did result in some changes in terms of how a different function well organized. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, great. And just for my follow-up, can you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of just employee churn. I just did note that some of the investment is to make sure to invest in retention of key personnel and it's a secret across Wall Street that there's a lot of movement going on right now. What are you seeing internally? I mean there was only in you mentioned in terms of headcount, you cut a tight rein, I don't usually see a net new additions in one quarter of just six people. I was wondering how much of that was purposeful and how much is really trying to manage the churn that might be going on? Phil Snow : Yes, Shlomo, I think a lot of that just has to do with us becoming more efficient as a company. Linda mentioned that we went through the spans and exercise where we added one span of control on average for managers, and we removed one layer from the organization. So I would attribute most of it to that. But like any company, right, we're very cognizant of the war for talent. We're really focused on making sure that the employee value proposition affected is as strong as it's always been and making sure that we're hiring and retaining the critical roles and functions that we need to succeed in the future. Operator : Our next question comes from David Chu with Bank of America. David Chu : So deep sector has obviously been a key driver of both retention and new business definitely appears to be helping the corporate channel. Just wondering, if you can discuss the competitive landscape for these data assets? And just wondering how unique your data is relative to other providers and how it is differentiated? Phil Snow : Well, one of the differentiators, David, is I think just a great job that FactSet does connecting any data that we have on our -- in our refinery to the other data sets. So there's a ton of value to just making sure that we're linking all of this deeper data to everything with our entity data map. And we just see very broad-based demand, obviously, for more detailed data as people are looking for alpha in terms of their investment process. So, we're not just seeing demand for this in banks. As you pointed out, we're seeing demand for it in corporations. We're seeing demand for it on the buy side. So I would just say we're just competing generally in the market with us, but we're moving quickly. The visualization that we provide for the content is going over very well with our clients. We're making the data available through feeds and APIs, which is important as well. So we're just sort of treating it maybe as the next generation of fundamental data essentially for our clients. David Chu : Okay. Got it. And then just on the real estate side. So my sense is that any reduction is not in guidance today. So would any savings represent potential upside to the margin guide? Is that fair? Linda Huber : David, it's possible that, that would be the case. I would just caution that some of the leases that we have are longer term. And so it's going to take us a bit of time to think about the collection of leases that we would want to change. So directionally, yes, and we may have some more to say about this as we finish our analysis as we move forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Owen Lau : Just a quick one from me. Could you please provide some update on the opportunities in ESG and the progress of offering this service to clients? Phil Snow : Yes. So thank you, Owen. Yes, we see a lot of opportunity, like I think many firms do on the ESG front. So we acquired Truvalue Labs about a year ago. We've done, I think, well, continuing to sell that product. And we've also done a good job of integrating it into the FactSet ecosystem. So you can now use ESG as an overlay, for example, in your portfolio analytics process. And just to remind everyone, the differentiator for Truvalue Labs is really that it's an outside in look at a company, and it's more of a real-time evaluation of how that company is doing. So we're really stepping on the gas here in terms of building out the coverage for this, which we think will be important. I'm just very optimistic about using ESG like throughout the system, like depending on the business or firm type or workflow, everyone's going to want to look at it one way or the other. So it's still relatively early for us, but we're very pleased with our progress. Owen Lau : Sorry. So just for me to understand that, do you think it's better to build in-house? Or do you think it's better to buy the service from an outside party? Phil Snow : Well, we offer both. So I think in true FactSet fashion, we're Swiss about this. We're very open. We probably have up to 20 different ESG providers within FactSet. So what I see mostly when I talk to clients is the -- more than half of them are building their own solution, but they're using different elements of different providers, ESG solutions. It's still not clear sort of exactly where we're going with ESG just in terms of regulation and so on. So I think there's still a lot of opportunity here. So most firms are building their own dashboards. If they want to just take Truvalue Labs, that's fine with us, but more often than not, they're integrating more than one. And because it's all on FactSet and it's connected with our entity data map, we make that very easy for them, right? They don't have to manage all of these fees themselves. And that's one of the things that make us so sticky. Operator : Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Mario Cortellacci : This is Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamza. You guys mentioned Omicron earlier, just sound like it's on the margin side. But maybe you could walk us through how to think about Omicron in terms of, I guess, delayed office reopenings. Does it could potentially push out maybe sales or the implementation of analytics packages? Or is there any indication on any impact to the sales cycle? Phil Snow : I don't think so. I mean we've obviously performed exceptionally well over the last two years. So we figured this out to do it remotely. And we do want to offer our employees the best balance in terms of their own lives. So it's a moving target for everyone. We -- our offices are open for business, and our employees can come in if they're vaccinated. And then I think we've probably got to take another pause here and just sort of make sure that we're paying attention to local regulations by city, state or country and just doing the right thing by our employees. But in terms of us running our business and working with our clients, I don't see it's going to change anything. Mario Cortellacci : Great. And then just my follow-up is around sales force productivity. So maybe you can give us a sense for how it's trended or how it's trending today? And I guess how much more room there is for improvement there? You guys mentioned that you guys -- your employee base is being very efficient, but maybe, again, any indication there? And then also, what are your sales hiring plans for the remainder of the 2022 fiscal year? Phil Snow : So our sales productivity, I believe, is going up, and I do think there's more runway there. So Helen certainly hit the ground running as Chief Revenue Officer. She's doing a great job there. She's made a few moves to sort of restructure the sales force by firm type where we can and focus on different types of clients. So we've invested a lot in our information systems over the last few years. As I mentioned, we've done a lot to sort of rationalize the packages on FactSet. Helen is putting some great incentives in there in place for the sales team, which I think were effective in Q1. So there's a lot of levers that we're pulling. And obviously, it's great. The sales team is having a lot of success. So we've got a great team at FactSet on the sales front and client service. It's a big team. It might be an order of a couple of thousand people that we have facing off against our clients, but they're all working very well together, having fun and it's great to kind of see this momentum. So we will certainly keep hiring, but we have essentially created a lot of really good salespeople at FactSet from people that come up through the consulting and specialty ranks and what makes FactSet salespeople so effective is just how well they know our product. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas of William Blair. Trevor Romeo : This is actually Trevor Romeo in for Andrew. First, I just wanted to touch on the retention side. It was nice to see client retention increased to 92%, which I think was the highest in several years. Just wondering if you think you have room for that metric to increase further and maybe what might be a realistic target for client retention? Phil Snow : So it's great to see the improvement. And again, this is really just the dedication and focus of the sales and client service teams and how well they've been able to operate in this environment. So I know that retention has been something that Helen has been stressing extremely strongly with the sales team, and she's thought about sort of how to distribute that work there, how to kind of allocate the work amongst teams and it's really paying off. And again, it just points to, I think, the strength of our products, how well we've worked with our clients in this environment. There's multiple reasons why that number is increasing. And FactSet is just becoming stickier and stickier and a critical part of so many of our clients' workflow. Trevor Romeo : Okay. Great. And then I think you touched on this a bit in the prepared remarks, but the ASP growth in Asia has been quite a bit stronger than the other two regions in the past few quarters. Is there just anything you can call out there that's benefiting the Asian markets, in particular, more than the others? Phil Snow : I would just say that, that market has grown faster than the other two for a long time. It's -- FactSet is a mature company. We just entered the S&P 500, but Asia is still our newest market. And we do see a lot of opportunity out there in terms of leveraging some of the solutions that we've built. And I think active management, it seems to be more alive and well in every region, but I think it's probably a little bit easier to be an active manager in Asia than it might be in some other regions. And in FactSet, that we have solutions for everybody, but we have great solutions for active managers. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Kevin McVeigh : And congratulations on the S&P admission. That's a fantastic outcome. I don't know should be for Phil or Linda, but -- so can you unpack the ASP a little bit? I mean it sounds like you're going to be in a period of probably better pricing and the retention is going up. I mean, should that imply some upside to that? And then just can you unpack the pricing a little bit? How much of it is just kind of the rate of inflation as opposed to maybe the remixing of higher value-added services, right? Because there's obviously the core pricing, but then maybe there's a service component to it. So can you help us understand that dynamic a little bit? Phil Snow : Sure. So I think for the first question, our success or acceleration was very broad-based this quarter. So we saw strength across every region and we saw relative strength across all three of our business lines. And as I mentioned, we saw very strong growth, double-digit growth in many of the firm types that we sell to. So I would just point to the investments that we've made in technology and content apply to all of these different areas. That's one thing. And then in terms of price, usually, our major price doesn't go in price increase until Q2 for clients in the Americas, in Q3 for EMEA and Asia Pac. So I would just say, up to this point, it has to do with price realization across these new packages that we've created. Hopefully, that answers your question. Kevin McVeigh : It does. And then just real quick, because obviously, the cloud is kind of transforming your business. Where are you focused internally on that? And then more importantly, like where are your clients, right, because obviously, you enabled a lot, but from a cloud adoption perspective, can you help us frame where you folks are internally? And then where your client are externally in terms of cloud adoption? That may be stock, but is there any way to frame that a little bit? Phil Snow : Yes, I can't give you percentages for the clients. I mean for FactSet, we're more than halfway through our program to move to the public cloud. It's a multi-cloud strategy. And we're also, as you know, partnering very well with firms like Snowflake and Amazon, which we've both been public about that. So the reason that we're moving so quickly there is our clients are moving quickly to the cloud. Almost every single firm you talk to is going through some form of digital transformation. So the fact that we're so focused on this, and we've made so much progress, really allows us to sit down with these clients and have our tech teams face off and talk about the technology stack, what we can do to help them and what we can do to help them rationalize their spend across content technology providers, but also content providers. So I think it's sort of non-negotiable. We all have to be doing it. I'm very excited that we sort of decided we were going to do it aggressively two years ago. And again, I think that just speaks to some of the success that we're seeing now, particularly over the last few quarters. Operator : Our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Keith Housum : A question for you on the growth. I guess, Phil, can you talk to the growth that you guys experienced this quarter and how it compares to prior quarters in terms of growth from existing customers versus new customers that you're adding? Phil Snow : Yes. So I think we saw relative to Q1 of last year, we saw improvement in terms of expansion, retention and new business. So again, I think it was very broad-based. On the new business front, you can see we added a lot of new logos this quarter. A lot of those were driven by corporates, but we did see a good uptick across some other firm types as well. But again, I think it just speaks to that we're firing on all cylinders here and every way that you look at our business and how we're measuring it, we're seeing good momentum. Keith Housum : Great. And I just kind of want to kind of reconcile that in the past two to three quarters, you've spoken to the strong momentum that you're seeing in the pipeline. Perhaps talk about the pipeline this quarter perhaps compared to the fourth quarter we just passed. And then how does that kind of compare with, I guess, recognize some comments that Linda made in terms of caution with Omicron and the other reserve. Is your optimism the same level you've had in the past few quarters? Phil Snow : Yes. I think I feel very, very good about our pipeline. And as we've mentioned historically, sometimes it's hard to see out more than six months. But I would say relative to this time last year, Q2 and Q3 are looking good, and looking good across institutional asset management, which, again, I view as sort of a key firm type for us. So we've got, think, decent visibility on the next six months. But because Q4 is such a big quarter for FactSet and it's a little further out and some of the things that Linda mentioned and the fact that it's Q1, we just feel that it's important that we sort of give ourselves a little bit of time before we revisit guidance. Operator : Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. George Tong : And Linda, welcome to FactSet, and excited to work with you again. Linda Huber : Thanks, George. George Tong : Yes. So maybe first question for you, Linda. FactSet previously had a longer-term target of high single-digit annual organic ASV plus professional services growth. What are your qualitative views on FactSet's longer-term ASP growth outlook given your experience as CFO of other info services companies in your time so far at the Company? Linda Huber : Yes, George, I think the numbers that we put up probably speak more strongly than any of our opinions and the fact that we've been able to do 9% this first quarter has really been a very strong statement to the growth potential for the Company. Phil's also been really modest and hasn't mentioned that, that growth is very broad-based. This is not being done on the back of one or two mega deals or anything like that. It is singles and doubles again and again and again with clients who are telling us that the investments that we've made over the past two years when many other providers stood still or pulled back, that time has really given us -- and the money has given us the opportunity to really have the best-in-class products for our clients, which is really very, very exciting. Secondly, in terms of how we did this quarter and if you bring it down to the EPS line, looking at our comparison of this year over last year, it's a pretty impressive performance. Last year, on the adjusted diluted EPS, we were at $2.88. This year, we're at $3.25. And we looked at some of the flash reports and a lot of that was attributed to tax and a lower tax rate because of options exercise. That's true. But if you take the beat of $0.37, about half is from the operating side and about half is from the tax side. So even if we had no change in tax rate, we would have beaten by about $0.20. So we feel pretty good about that, and we think it's a testament to the strength of the business. So the next steps are increased focus on the margin, which I talked about, increased focus on the capital allocation and just really make sure that we're running the Company as efficiently as we can. It hasn't been spoken to, George, but last year, in addition, we had $18.5 million in CapEx we spent in the first quarter. This year, it's down to $8.6 million. Part of that last year was the build-out of our Manila office. But with that gone, CapEx has come down a bit. So as Phil said, we kind of see the hump here in terms of this investment program that we've had. But while there were a lot of doubters two years ago, it seems to be paying off. So we're pretty excited about all of that. I hope that helps. George Tong : Got it. Yes, very helpful context. And then, Phil, in fiscal 2021, research, organic ASV plus professional services growth was 5.7%. And this was meaningfully higher than the average of 1% growth between fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2020. So far in fiscal 2022, can you elaborate on the trends within research that may be similar or different to those that you saw in fiscal 2021? And whether you believe mid-single-digit plus growth is sustainable within research? Phil Snow : Yes. Thanks, George. So yes, research had a very -- a tremendous quarter. So I think we've continued to see strength with sell-side analysts in Q1. It wasn't the primary driver of ASV by any means, but it certainly helped. And I think it just really speaks to all of the great work. The research and advisory team has put in over the last few years just to get more content into the platform and to build out just fantastic reports for all of you that use our product. So I am optimistic about this part of the market. I think when we started talking a few years ago, right. We talked about having that great balance between enterprise and analytics solutions and the desktop. But it's really nice to see the core FactSet workstation really coming back strongly. And there's just a ton of opportunity out there for us in terms of desks that we feel we can go capture now. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Craig Huber : In your buy-side set of clients, you obviously include corporations in there and other, what percent overall now of your revenues are corporations? Maybe how is that piece doing versus a year ago, please? Phil Snow : We don't break that out, Craig, as a number, but I can tell you that it's growing very quickly. It's probably the fastest growing firm type we have. And again, I think because of the investment that we've made in new content sets, I think we can appeal to more workflows within corporations than we might have historically. Craig Huber : But also, can you go a little bit deeper in the deep sector data that you guys are providing. You talked about some new sectors you want to roll out here, I guess, sooner rather than later. What sectors have you rolled it out for so far? And what are your aspirations there? Phil Snow : I think that's probably -- so we've spoken publicly about those. It's a pretty long list. But I think in your follow-up conversations later today, I think we can certainly give you more detail. Operator : And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to Phil Snow for any closing remarks. Phil Snow : Great. Thank you all for joining us today. In closing, I want to reiterate how pleased we are with this quarter's performance. As a company, we are ending the calendar year strong. We saw the highest incremental Q1 ASV in the Company's history. And we celebrated the fantastic achievement of joining the S&P 500 Index. And we also welcomed Cobalt Software and its talented team to FactSet. Please be well this holiday season. And if you have any additional questions, call Kendra Brown, and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Operator that ends today's call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",

After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Kendra Brown, SVP, Investor Relations. You may begin. Kendra Brown : Thank you, and good morning everyone. Welcome to FactSet\u2019s second quarter 2022 earnings call. Before we begin, I would like to point out that the slides we will reference during this presentation can be assessed via the webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at factset.com. The slides will be posted on our website at the conclusion of this call, and a replay of today\u2019s call will be available via phone and on our website. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions from investors. To be fair to everyone, please limit yourself to one question plus one follow-up. Before we discuss our results, I encourage all listeners to review the legal notice on slide 2, which explains the risks of forward-looking statement and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the appendix to the presentation and in our earnings release issued earlier today. Joining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer, and Linda Huber, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the discussion over to Phil Snow. Phil Snow : Thank you, Kendra, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Before I begin my remarks, I want to remind everyone that we are hosting an Investor Day on Tuesday, April 5th both in-person in New York City and via livestream. We look forward to sharing more about our business strategy, growth initiatives, and long-term financial outlook at this event. To register, please see our website. You may also reach out to Kendra for additional details. I hope to see many of you there. I am pleased with our impressive second quarter and first half results as we executed on our pipeline and built on our strong momentum from Q1. Our organic ASV plus professional services growth accelerated to 9% in the second quarter, led by growth in workstations and portfolio analytics and our capturing higher price increases in the Americas. We also saw several large renewals, which further affirmed the strength of our offering and investments in product and content. Our strategy continues to drive top-line growth and allows us to capture more share of wallet with our clients. Growth this quarter was strongest among our buy-side clients, with the biggest contributions coming from asset managers and wealth clients. All buy-side firm types experienced accelerated growth in the second quarter, with broad-based strength across all workflow solutions. We continued to see double-digit growth from banking, wealth, hedge fund, and corporate clients, along with private equity and venture capital funds and partners. Retention was a key driver this quarter, with our investments in content and technology continuing to resonate. New business accelerated globally, led by the Americas. While we had success with larger deals, we also continue to see a higher volume of small and medium-sized client wins. We are pleased that our performance resulted in a 20.2% increase in adjusted EPS from the prior-year period and an adjusted operating margin of 33.7%, exceeding our prior guidance. Our third quarter looks solid, with a strong pipeline for our second half. As such, we are adjusting our fiscal 2022 guidance to reflect 8% to 9% ASV growth, expansion of our adjusted operating margin, and adjusted EPS of $12.75 to $13.15. Linda will walk you through the details shortly. Our focus remains the same to build the leading open content and analytics platform. This quarter, we continued to scale our content refinery and enhance the client experience with personalized workflow solutions. FactSet\u2019s open ecosystem and cloud-enabled components provide flexible tools that enhance efficiency and connectivity across the front, middle, and back office. Our cloud program allows us to meet clients where they work with innovative products and technology. Partnerships with enterprise software providers are expanding the reach of our platform. And earlier this month, we announced a strategic partnership to integrate Portware, our leading execution management system, with BlackRock\u2019s Aladdin platform to provide clients with a seamless experience across multi-asset portfolio management and trading execution. Our content refinery also continues to drive meaningful ASV as we build out our offering, focusing on ESG, data for wealth, private markets, and deep sector. We see the acquisitions we\u2019ve made over the last year helping accelerate growth. And we are seeing continued success with private equity and venture capital clients, with our integration of Cobalt on track. We closed several new Cobalt deals over the quarter, and our Cobalt + Workstation offering is expanding our pipeline to new sales. Deep Sector was a driving factor in key sell-side renewals this quarter. As client dependency on content and workflow solutions grows, we also see new business traction with corporates as our Deep Sector offering expands our addressable market. Fiscal year-to-date, there have been over 30 key releases across seven sectors, including integration of BTU research into Document Search. Our investment in our digital platform is paying dividends. Advisor dashboard is driving expansion and new business, with its next best action capabilities providing tangible efficiencies and insights for wealth advisors. Hyper-personalized, workflow-driven solutions, fueled by our content, differentiate us in the market and provide continued greenfield opportunities. Goran Skoko, Rob Robie, and Jonathan Reeve will provide more details on our products and initiatives to drive growth for our Research and Advisory, Analytics and Trading, and CTS workflow solutions as part of Investor Day. I\u2019d like to officially welcome the CUSIP Global Services team to FactSet. I\u2019ve had the pleasure of meeting many members of the CGS team and look forward to continuing to build on their industry-leading brand. In addition, we are very pleased with our new relationship with the American Bankers Association, whose leadership we met with earlier this month in Washington DC. We look forward to a strong and collaborative relationship with the ABA. The addition of CGS aligns well with our multi-year strategy to invest in content and technology. This is a natural extension of our content refinery as we significantly expand the breadth and reach of our robust suite of data management solutions. We look forward to sharing more on CGS at our upcoming Investor Day.  As part of the CGS transaction, we came to market with our inaugural $1 billion senior notes offering. I am very pleased that this offering received investment-grade ratings from both Moody\u2019s and Fitch, reflecting the strength and consistency of our financial health. Looking across our regions, we saw broad-based strength across all workflow solutions. The Americas continues to be the biggest contributor to growth, with ASV growth accelerating to 10% over the quarter. Growth was driven by improved retention and new business wins with corporates, wealth, private equity and venture capital firms, and asset owners. The region also benefited from higher price increases across all firm types.  ASV growth accelerated to 8% in EMEA, marking the fourth straight quarter of consistent improvement. We saw strength from wealth and asset managers among existing clients and expansion among our banking clients. We also saw new business wins with corporates and asset owners. Asia Pacific also had another strong quarter with ASV growth of 14%. Asset managers, in particular, continued driving growth across the region with broad-based strength across our product portfolio with both new and existing clients. In summary, I am proud of our first half performance. Our momentum continues as we successfully invest in technology and develop our content refinery. Our pipeline continues to build as we head into the second half of our fiscal year, driven by demand from both new and existing clients. While we see some choppiness in the market today, FactSet has a proven history of growth in volatile markets. Our products and solutions are mission critical for our clients, particularly in times of market volatility, as we help the investment community generate alpha and identify the next best action faster. We continue to see increased demand for our solutions, which reinforces our conviction that our strategy is delivering and will continue to deliver sustainable growth. We believe that our culture and performance driven mindset creates a strong advantage both in how we serve our clients and as we focus on attracting, retaining, and developing top talent in this competitive and dynamic environment. We are dedicated to investing in our people and giving our team the support and flexibility they need to navigate and be successful. I could not be more proud of our constant team effort to deliver personalized, innovative, and efficient solutions for our clients.  Our focus on our people is part of a larger effort to become a more diverse, thoughtful, and impactful organization. We are committed to sustainable growth for our clients, employees, investors, and communities. And the principles underpinning this commitment are built into all aspects of our business. We recently released our fiscal 2021 sustainability report, which highlights our progress \u2013 including creating a sustainability plan and signing the UN, PRI and Global compact, among others. The report also outlines our commitments to the future. I encourage you to take a look. Finally, the ongoing invasion of Ukraine is top of mind for us, just as it is for the rest of the world. During these troubling times, the safety and security of our team is a top priority. In light of the situation in Ukraine, FactSet has decided to discontinue all commercial operations and delivery of products and services to clients inside Russia, and we are terminating all contracts with vendors in Russia. These actions will not have a material impact on our business or client relationships. Linda will now take you through the specifics of our Q2 performance. Linda, over to you. Linda Huber : Thank you, Phil, and hello to everyone on the call. We\u2019ve been extremely busy in the second quarter, as we worked to close the acquisition of CGS, went to market with our investment grade inaugural senior notes offering, negotiated our new credit facility, and put the finishing touches in place for our April 5th Investor Day. I join Phil in recognizing the efforts put forth each day by our FactSet employees. Our teams have done amazing work. It has been an exciting time in the company's evolution. As you have seen from our press release this morning, we are pleased to report acceleration in our top line, with double-digit revenue growth and high single-digit growth in organic ASV plus professional services. I will now share more details on our second-quarter performance. Consistent with our definition of organic revenues and ASV, we will exclude any revenue and ASV associated with CGS when reporting organic-related metrics for the 12 months following the acquisition date. As Phil stated earlier, we grew organic ASV plus professional services at 9%, an acceleration reflects increased demand for our digital solutions, disciplined execution on our sales pipeline and pricing strategy, and a supportive external environment with tailwinds from the capital markets and overall economic growth. Benefits from our investments in both content and functionality are validated by our annual price increase. For example, in the Americas, our price increase yielded $21 million, $7 million more than the prior year. While an inflationary environment did enable us to raise the rate of price increases above our historical 3% to 4%, we also realized these price increases across a wider base of clients. GAAP revenue increased by 10% to $431 million for the second quarter. Organic revenue, which excludes any impact from foreign exchange, acquisitions and deferred revenue amortization also increased 10% to $431 million. Growth was driven primarily by our research and advisory and analytics solutions. All regions saw notable growth. For our geographic segments on an organic basis, revenue growth for the Americas was at 10%, EMEA grew at 9% and Asia Pacific came in at 14%. All regions primarily benefited from increases in analytics. Increases in research and advisory solutions provided an uplift in the Americas, while content and technology solutions was a key driver in EMEA. GAAP operating expenses grew 12% in the second quarter to $308 million, impacted by several changes incurred during the period. As we spoke about during the last quarter, most of our employees are working in a hybrid or remote capacity. This quarter, we recognized $10 million in impairment charges as we focus on rightsizing our real estate footprint to reflect our new work environment. We anticipate additional impairment charges related to real estate in Q3 of this year as we exit office space in various locations worldwide. We expect that this charge will be about $45 million in the third quarter. In addition to real estate impairment costs, we also incurred $5 million in transaction expenses related to the CGS acquisition. Given that we closed the acquisition on March 1, the first day of our fiscal third quarter, there will also be additional charges for the acquisition in the third quarter. We expect this charge to be about $14 million in the third quarter. Compared to the previous year, our GAAP operating margin decreased by 100 basis points to 28.6%, and our adjusted operating margin increased by 110 basis points to 33.7%, exceeding our guidance on this measure. Improvement was largely due to lower employee compensation expense as a percentage of revenue and lower content costs as a percentage of revenue. As a percentage of revenue, our cost of sales was 365 basis points lower than last year on a GAAP basis and 295 basis points lower on an adjusted basis. This decrease was primarily due to lower employee compensation as a percentage of revenue and lower technology-related expenses as a percentage of revenue, including our ongoing shift to the public cloud. When expressed as a percentage of revenue, SG&A was 470 basis points higher year-over-year on a GAAP basis and 185 basis points higher on an adjusted basis. The primary drivers include real estate exit costs, expenses related to the CGS acquisition, increased employee compensation expense and higher bonus accrual. Moving on, our tax rate for the quarter was 10%, compared to last year\u2019s rate of 16%, primarily due to lower projected levels of income before income taxes and a tax provision reduction related to the lower rate. GAAP EPS increased 13.6% to $2.84 this quarter versus $2.50 in the prior year. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 20.2% to $3.27. Both EPS figures were largely driven by revenue growth, margin expansion, and a lower tax rate. A reconciliation of our adjustments to GAAP EPS is included at the end of our press release. As noted in our press release, EBITDA increased to $146.8 million, up 11.1% from the same period in fiscal 2021. We are now providing this EBITDA measure to allow added transparency for both our equity and debt investors. And finally, free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations, less capital spending, was $110 million for the quarter, a decrease of 15% over the same period last year, primarily due to higher estimated tax payments.  Our ASV retention for the second quarter remained greater than 95%. We grew the total number of clients by 18% compared to the prior year, driven by the addition of more corporate, private equity and venture capital, and wealth clients. This quarter we reached the milestone of more than 7,000 clients for the first time in our history. Our client retention remains at 92% year-over-year, reflecting the strength of our product portfolio and exceptional execution by our sales teams. As announced in our January CGS Investor call, we\u2019ve suspended our share repurchase plan for the remainder of fiscal 2022 to prioritize excess cash flow for repayment of debt to reduce our leverage levels. We are committed to reducing our outstanding debt as quickly as possible. We are therefore extending our pause on share purchases at least until the second half of FY 2023. While we will continue minor share repurchases to offset the dilutive impact of stock option grants, we expect to keep our share count relatively flat throughout this period. Finally, we anticipate our dividend program will continue to deliver value to our shareholders as it has in the past. Given our outstanding first-half performance, the acquisition of CGS, and visibility for the rest of the year, we are updating our guidance for fiscal 2022. We expect organic ASV growth of $130 million to $150 million, raising our midpoint by more than 8% from our initial 2022 guidance set in September of $105 million to $135 million. This represents an acceleration of our organic growth rate of 7% from fiscal 2021, reflecting our conviction in FactSet\u2019s continued momentum.  While CGS is not included in our organic ASV guidance, we expect CGS to contribute about $5 million in ASV in fiscal 2022. Keep in mind that our August 31st fiscal year means that we are only including CGS results in our last two quarters of this fiscal year. We will see an expected deceleration in GAAP operating margin given our real estate footprint rationalization, restructuring costs from Q1, and M&A costs. However, GCS is accretive to our adjusted operating margin, as reflected in the 50 basis points of planned margin expansion from the previous midpoint. And finally, we expect Adjusted EPS to be $12.75 to $13.15 versus $12 to $12.30 we have stated previously raising the midpoint by 8.6%. We will be providing medium-term goals for growth and margin at our Investor Day, but we will not be addressing this longer term view on today\u2019s call. As we look to the second half of the fiscal year, we are encouraged by our pipeline, our ability to capture value-based pricing, demand for our digital platform, and high retention with our client base. We have confidence in continuing to see a higher volume of deals, with a healthy mix of large, medium, and small wins. However, the macro and geopolitical environment remains more uncertain than usual. We do not know the full impact of the Ukraine conflict, which could potentially lead to a recession scenario. In addition, there is variability in our bonus pool, the exercise of stock options, and our tax rate, all of which can make a significant difference in our financial results. Even with these challenges, our guidance reflects our belief that we are well-positioned for the future. And with that, we are now ready for your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik of Barclays. Your question please. Manav Patnaik : Yes, hi. Good morning. Linda, just on the CUSIP contribution to guidance, $5 million of ASV. I guess can you just help us bridge the nature of their revenue contracts? I thought the contribution would be a little larger. And similar question around the margins, 50 basis points. Is there some other kind of integration costs that you're assuming in there? . Linda Huber : Sure, Manav. I think we probably should be just a bit clearer about what's happening with CUSIP here. First of all, our organic measure of ASV, of course, does not include CUSIP. So, what did we buy when we bought the CUSIP business, which closed on March 1st? And the ASV from CUSIP for a full year will be $159 million. And looking at the half year, in other words, the two quarters that we're getting from CUSIP, we expect to see about $80 million of ASV as -- for the last two quarters of this year. On the revenue line, which is a little bit different, we saw about -- we'll see about $180 million of revenue coming from CUSIP; about $80 million is recurring and about $10 million is one-time. So, the $5 million that we quoted, we should have wrote -- written a bit more effectively in the script to explain that, that $5 million is additional incremental growth above and beyond what we bought in CUSIP when we closed it on March 1st. So, the ASV run rate initially, $159 million. Growth for the back half of the year above that from CUSIP will be $5 million. And contribution to you as well. So, sorry if we weren't as clear as we should have been about that, Manav. Manav Patnaik : That's super helpful. And then just maybe if you could talk about -- I think you alluded to it, but just what the potential FactSet downturn playbook could look like should the macro get weaker for all of us? . Linda Huber : Yes. Sure, Manav. We don't have an official downturn playbook yet, but I think there are a couple of things that we would look to do. We've been investing pretty strongly in our business. And I think we would think about which of those investments are most core if we did find ourselves in a downturn. As you can see, and I'm sure we'll talk about a little bit later. We've been pretty thoughtful about our real estate footprint change. We've taken a $10 million charge this quarter. We took about a $9 million charge last quarter. And we're letting everyone know that we expect a $45 million charge in real estate as we get to Q3. So, the real estate footprint, when we're finished with all this, we'll have reduced the run rate on real estate costs by about 40%. We'll talk a bit more about this in Investor Day, which, again, matches what our employees want with a hybrid work environment. Of course, if we hit an air pocket, our bonuses would proportionately come down, and I think we look a little bit more carefully at some of our other costs. But pretty typical stuff, take a look at core investments, take a look at the real estate footprint, bonus pool comes down, and I think we'd reprioritize a bit. Manav Patnaik : All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Your question please. Toni Kaplan : Thank you. I wanted to actually follow-up on that adjusted operating income margin guidance. You raised it by 50 bps for the year. I would have thought that CGS would have added about 100 bps since it's only in there for six months, and you've been running above guidance in the first half as well on margins. So is the organic margin guidance in second half lower than what you were previously expecting, or is there conservatism, or what's driving the only 50 basis points increase in the margin guidance? Linda Huber : Toni, let me take a shot at that, and Phil will add some comments to it. I think we're being thoughtful about this, but we would note that this is an historically very difficult to predict sort of time frame here for the back half of the year. Obviously, the geopolitical situation is tense and changing every day. And with the Fed, obviously, looking at 5%, 6% increases in interest rates, we do have a period here, which is unsettled. We've been thoughtful. We've been a bit conservative that might be fair, but we've only owned CUSIP now for 23 days. So, we're still trying to figure out what we have there and how that business will react to these conditions as well. So, we have obviously increased the guidance. We are optimistic, but we're also thoughtful that we are not in control of either the Fed or world events. And with that, I'll pass it over to Phil. Phil Snow : Yes. So, thanks Linda. I mean what I might also add to that, Toni, is we're being thoughtful about our employees as well. So, we did invest quite a bit in compensation and equity for some employees in Q2. Our attrition is ticking a little bit higher than it was pre-pandemic. So, nothing to be too concerned about, but we definitely recognize that there's a lot of movement on the talent front. So, we want to make sure that we're prepared for that and doing everything we can for all that FactSetters that are adding great value to our company. Linda Huber : And Toni, one other thing with CUSIP. Quite honestly, we built in several million dollars of expense for transition costs for CUSIP. Some of that around the technology transfer and some of that around the movement of the employees over to FactSet as a critical part of the financial system, obviously, the CUSIP system, has to remain working perfectly. And because of that, we were sure that we funded that well enough so that the transition goes smoothly and that we have no hiccups. Toni Kaplan : Yes. Great. Linda Huber : I think that sums that up. Toni Kaplan : Perfect. I just wanted to also touch on -- you mentioned the recent volatility in the market. There's been a slowdown in M&A. I know, Phil, you highlighted how the product is actually really valuable during these types of times. Just wanted to understand if you've had any sort of change in client conversations in the recent weeks since we've seen this a little bit more uncertainty. And I know you talked about small and medium-sized client wins during the past quarter or so. Is that something that's a little bit more at risk going forward, or I just wanted to hear about if anything has changed yet or if you think it just won't. Thanks. Phil Snow : Nothing much yet, Toni. So I've spoken to Helen a lot about this. So I think as you highlighted, FactSet always does very well in times of volatility. And where we're beginning to see some more strength, which is very encouraging, is within the institutional asset management client type. So actually, that drove a lot of the acceleration this quarter from a firm type standpoint. And that really wasn't from seats necessarily. It was more from analytics and enterprise solutions. So that ongoing trend of our biggest clients wanting to rely on less partners and consolidate on to platforms like FactSet is certainly out there. And I believe in times like this, it really forces that conversation and really is to our benefit in terms of the relationship we have with them and all that we've done to invest. So nothing to be concerned about yet, and we've got a very broad portfolio here to win with. We might expect a little bit more, I think, if it was to hit anywhere, it'd probably be Europe in terms of decision-making, but so far, so good. Linda Huber : Toni, just to follow up on that. Rebalancing of portfolios is going on at quite an intense rate right now. And as we see the increases in interest rates, that would potentially make fixed income more attractive. So what we do is provide tools to help investors and investor owners look at those transitions. The other thing is many of our clients are banks. And as interest rates move up, net interest margin, or NIM, for banks is growing. So banks are in a relatively healthy place with that addition to NIM. And the fact that there is volatility might be helpful to active managers as opposed to indexers and that may be helpful to the uptake on our products as well. So volatility is not necessarily a problem and, in fact, may be a tailwind for FactSet. Toni Kaplan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas of William Blair. Your line is open. Andrew Nicholas : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one I had was on a comment you made, I think, Linda, on price realization in the Americas in the quarter. Just wondering -- or I think more specifically, you said that you were getting a wider range of clients with price increases. Could you flesh that out a bit more? Where were you able to get price this past quarter that you hadn't been able to historically? And maybe what you would attribute that to? Was that inflationary pressures or specific value-based enhancements from some of your investments over the past couple of years? Any more color there would be great. Linda Huber : Yes, I'll take a shot at it, Andrew, and then Phil will add. We've been working very hard on value-based pricing and appropriate bundling of our services as we move forward. The 3% to 4% price increase has been sort of our rack rate. Our realization has been somewhat less than that because of various factors. And with additional discipline and focus and really good communication and training of our sales team, our realization has gotten better. We've moved first in the US regarding this sort of activity. And we'll move on to the rest of the world as we get into the third quarter and later in the year. So the fact that our realization is going up is very, very important to the top line, and we're quite happy with this effort. But a lot of it involves better analytics for clients, better information and data on usage and those sorts of things. So pricing is important. Value-based pricing is important, but the effort will continue around the globe and expand as we move into the third quarter. But we're quite happy with what we're seeing in the investments in our product, our products that's really made them more valuable to customers. And maybe, Phil might want to add a bit more about that. Phil Snow : I think you said that perfectly. Not a lot extra to add there, Linda. Andrew Nicholas : Great. No, that's helpful. And then, maybe for my follow-up, and I apologize if I missed it. I think I cut out a little bit during the prepared remarks, but could you update us on how you're thinking about the balance sheet and optimizing the balance sheet, having now gone through the debt offerings. Is there any better sense for your level of comfort on the leverage front or a range for us to think about in the medium to long term? Thank you. Linda Huber : Sure. We're pretty excited that we were able to purchase the CUSIP business. It provided strong cash flow to us, and we were able to go to the public markets with a $1 billion bond deal split into five and 10-year tranches. And we did that on February 15 prior to the geopolitical situation getting worse. We were noticing, if we did that deal today, rather than at the time that we did, the 10-year has moved about 36 basis points and spreads have widened about 25 basis points. So our timing was fortunate and we felt really good about what we've been able to do. So a couple of comments on leverage, so everybody can, kind of, follow along here. Our gross leverage, that is leveraged before we take into account cash balances, is about 3.9 times right now. And we've made commitments that we will reduce that leverage as quickly as we can. So our plan is basically to look at paying back about $125 million a quarter. That may vary a bit. And so, our thinking is that, that leverage will come down to about 2.5 times gross leverage by this time next year. And at that point, it would be right to start conversations about what we would think about resuming share repurchase. With 2.5 times gross leverage, we're much closer to typical investment-grade leverage. So our target is 2 to 2.5 times gross leverage and we think we can get there over the next year. We've made commitments on that, and we're quite serious about getting there. The other piece for this, which is interesting is, on our floating rate exposure, we've hedged -- excuse me, 80% of that. So our bond pieces are fixed rate, and we've hedged our floating rate pieces at the balance of 80%. So we think that puts us in a pretty good place as interest rates continue to move up. So we're pretty happy with that posture, as the yield curve is moving around, flattening out. But we think for an inaugural offering, we did pretty well, and we're pretty pleased about it. So I hope that helps you with a full and complete answer. Andrew Nicholas : Very much so. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra of RBC. Your question, please. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to follow-up on the CGS acquisition. Based on the prospectus, it seems like the CGS margins were high 50%. And I understand there's some investments that you're making in trying to make sure you transition some of the technology and back office work within FactSet. But as we think about normalized margins for that business once you've done the transition, how should we think about those margins? And any thoughts on accretion now that you've owned it for less than a month, but as we have better clarity on the funding costs and margins, how should we think about the accretion on an annualized basis going forward? Thanks. Linda Huber : Sure. I think you're in the right ZIP code. One attractive feature of the CUSIP business is that it does have fulsome margins. I think the answer to your question though, Ashish, is we're going to have to see. We need to finish the transition process with the integration. As you've heard, we're running a technical services agreement with the seller of the business that could last up to a year's time. We're hoping we're able to transition off of that a little bit more quickly. And potentially, at that time, we might have a better view on what additional accretion would be. But I think we're going to have to -- we're going to have to live together now that we're married. And so we're going to have to see how that plays out. But for right now, I think you're in the right ZIP code. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks Linda. And then maybe just a quick question on analytics. You flagged that analytics was strong across all regions. I was just wondering if you can talk about the pipeline there going forward and give any additional color on -- if there are certain products within the analytics, which are driving the strength of certain areas, end markets, which are driving that strength in analytics. Thanks. Phil Snow : Hey Ashish, it's Phil. Yes, so I'm happy to talk about that. As I pointed out, I believe, on the last earnings call, we have good momentum in analytics. I see that carrying through into the second half. We certainly have a very high-quality pipeline for the second half, and a lot of that are greater than $1 million deals and analytics has a big part to do with that. In terms of what drove analytics this quarter, I'd highlight our portfolio services product. And also, we had a very good quarter in risk. Those are the two that I think stood out to me in terms of driving the acceleration from Q2. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks Phil and congrats on a solid quarter. Thank you. Phil Snow : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Owen Lau of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Owen Lau : Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Linda, sorry to go back to CUSIP, but I recall from the last presentation slide. This business generates about $175 million. And I think you just mentioned you expect the revenue to be $159 million. I'm just wondering what drove the delta? And how should we think about the growth of this business going forward? Thank you. Linda Huber : Sure. Owen, I think the difference there is the $159 million is the annual subscription volume for the business. The $175 million that you mentioned is the annual revenue that comes from the business. So, these are two slightly different things. For the half year on the revenue, I mentioned that $80 million comes from subscription revenue and $10 million, basically, for the half year comes from new CUSIPs that are assigned. I think it's that difference that you should think about. And the growth rate that we've talked about is $5 million on ASV, which is incremental. So the growth rate we've talked about as being in the mid to high single digits, similar to FactSet's core growth. And again, as we get more experience with this, we'll be able to talk a little bit more in detail about what we're expecting about that growth rate. Right now, we're just starting to look at new business opportunities with CUSIP. And we need to spend some more time on that, think about it, get those implemented very carefully and then see where we go. So I hope that explains a little bit more clearly. Owen Lau : Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you, Linda. And then on another topic, could you please talk about whether FactSet is interested in like things like the crypto data display business. And I think at least one of your competitors have started to provide more crypto data on their desktop. I'm just wondering whether FactSet has any interest in this area. And have you heard of any demand from the clients in this product? Thank you. Phil Snow : Owen, it's Phil. Yeah, so it's certainly of interest. We're actually taking a very close look at that now as part of our annual strategic refresh. So we've got a group looking at that. And at a minimum, I think you would expect to kind of be able to see some quotes on the system. And of course, we're beginning to see a crypto show up in all the client portfolios or some of the client portfolios that are on our system. So just making that work within the analytics suite would be important. And then beyond that, I believe there's some good opportunity. But we'll have probably a little bit more to talk about that, I would say, probably closer to the end of this fiscal year when we get through our strategic planning process. Owen Lau : Got it. Thank you very much. Phil Snow : Not a ton of demand yet from the clients, but we anticipate it's going to become more of a topic, for sure. Owen Lau : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Huber of Huber Research Partners. Your line is open. Craig Huber : Great. Thank you. Linda, I'm just curious, I'd like to hear your thoughts on this after six months at the company. Maybe you could just tell us where you think the biggest opportunities are from your seat, which your overall impression so far given your 20-plus year industry experience here? What are you seeing so far that you can share with us? Linda Huber : Thanks, Craig. It's been a great six months at FactSet. We've been able to do some pretty terrific things on the balance sheet. And frankly, I was hopeful when I joined that we'd be able to find a strong cash flowing acquisition to get rated and be able to access the public markets. So we're ready for when interest rates move up. So I think we've accomplished that really, really well. On the product side, it's pretty exciting to see how the clients are reacting to the investments that we're making. I think deep sector where we're basically building out incredibly deep and broad information, starting with financial services and now moving on to different industry groups, energy and health care with some beta clients on in that area. That's pretty great stuff and better product, I think, than anyone else in the industry can offer. There's some housekeeping things we have to do here. You heard me talk a little bit about making sure the price realization comes through, and that we have good discipline on pricing. I think we're making some great strides on that, Craig. Retention is very high. The products are very sticky. And the client obsession really allows us to continue to have a lot of loyalty from the clients even when some of the junior bankers move on to other firms. They still want to use FactSet, which is really, really great. So I think we're on a really good trajectory. We're looking forward to providing some more guidance on Investor Day, growing the top line is first and foremost, and we're making progress and some margin expansion, of course, will be something we're looking to, and we'll have more to say again on that on Investor Day. And for right now, no share repurchase, but we hope to get back to it once we get our leverage levels back down to where we were. So, lots to do, but all good so far. Craig Huber : That's great. My final question, if I could. You guys talked an awful lot about the non-traditional areas of your clients' private equity, venture capital, wealth, hedge funds, corporations and so forth, and said a lot of those were growing north of 10% here. If you add that whole group of clients up right now, I'm curious, what rough percentage of your overall revenue does that represent right now? Phil Snow : Yes, that's not something we've traditionally broken out, Craig. We'll give some more thought to that, but I appreciate the question. Craig Huber : Okay. Thanks guys. Phil Snow : Welcome. Linda Huber : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Kevin McVeigh : Okay. Thanks so much. Hey, Phil, I may have misheard you on the call, but I thought you talked about a lot of the outsized growth coming from the buy-side. But when I look at the supplement schedule, it's actually pretty interesting, because it looks like the ASV growth, if I'm reading it right, the sell-side is outpacing the buy-side. Am I right on that, or is that -- was that current quarter maybe revenue versus ASV, or just any thoughts, because it seems like the ASV on the sell-side has started to come on pretty strong. Phil Snow : Yes. So I think we saw a little bit of a downturn on the sell-side growth this quarter, and we saw more strength in the buy-side. There are a lot of different client types in the buy-side. So I was talking about institutional asset management, in particular, which is the biggest piece of that, for sure. And the piece that is not growing in double digits, but I'm very encouraged by the strength that we saw within our largest client type and the one that we've spent a lot of focus on in terms of the portfolio life cycle. But in terms of the attribution to those numbers, I think if you have a call later with Kendra, I think, she could probably get into that in a little bit more detail for you. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Great. And then just can we talk about the partnership with Aladdin, because that seems pretty interesting in terms of integrating Portware into Aladdin. And is that a template for something that continues, or -- and what are the economics like how does that work in terms of the partnership with Aladdin? And can you use that as a template for like State Street, so on and so forth? Phil Snow : Sure. Yes. Thanks for the questions. So we do have -- as part of our buy-side number, we do have a pretty big business with partners, and this would be a good example of that. And there are lots of instances in our industry, as you know, where we would sit alongside Aladdin and lots of other firms in our space. So we have a good relationship with them, and we're going to coexist at a lot of clients. So if they want to use our execution management system, we want to provide that choice in the industry. And we are definitely talking to lots of firms about this type of partnership. I mean, another example is what we've done with Snowflake and Amazon, for example, but this is really, I think, a very good example of all of the work that we've done to invest in our technology and open up the platform and become more plug-and-play in the ecosystem. So I'm very excited about the partnership and some of the other conversations we're having. And I just think it just gives us more channels to monetize the value that we're creating at the company. Kevin McVeigh : Totally does. In terms of like what's the revenue recognition on it, just so we get a sense of how it kind of sits within FactSet? Phil Snow : Yes, we won\u2019t \u2013 so whenever we do these partnerships, there's a whole different variety of different ways that both firms will benefit from this, but we're not going to talk about the specific economics of any given deal, but I think both sides are excited about it and it certainly gives more choice in the client base. Kevin McVeigh : Thank you. Phil Snow : Welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. You mentioned that pricing is stepping up this year. Can you discuss how much you expect pricing to contribute to full-year growth and how pricing increases compare with input cost increases that you're seeing? Phil Snow : Hey, George, it's Phil. So I think it was in the script but we increased pricing from 3% to 4% this year, within the Americas in Q2, I would expect something similar for the EMEA and Asia-Pac regions which hits in Q3, so we did see a bit of an uplift in Q2. I think it was $6 million or $7 million from price above and beyond what we did last year, and as Linda mentioned earlier, we're getting better price realization through just how we sell normally, so we don't capture all of that typically, because we'll have another contracts that are out there, but that's typically what's in the majority of the smaller and medium-size deals, so we do have a lot of pricing power. I think we've been pretty conservative with our clients. We want to build that long-term relationship and continue to cross-sell, so a little bit of an uplift from this year, and I think the ratio would be similar to what you might have seen in prior year's between Q2 and Q3. Linda Huber : Yes, and George, it's Linda. Nice to hear from you. On margin expansion, we have seen some of the drivers include the strong top line this quarter. Our compensation costs have been a little bit lower, particularly on the salary line, which has been down a few million dollars, whereas the bonus line has been up a bit and the equity line has been up a bit. The reason for that as Phil said, while we've moved through this time when it's a bit tougher to hire, we've moved a little bit more slowly in terms of the number of people we've been able to hire and we expect that to grow as we move into the back half of the year. On the bonus line, we've put up about $21 million for bonus for second quarter. It was the same in the first quarter, but we're running strong. We're looking at about $85 million for the full bonus line for this year. But if we do continue to punch above our weight in terms of what our guidance has been. We, of course, have to take that bonus line up. So just keep an eye on that. But our cost for content have been managed pretty well. To this point in the year, we've been happy that they've actually come in a little bit lighter than we expected. Now as others are looking to increase their prices, we're going to have to manage that very carefully. And of course, we look really closely at do we want to build and capture our own data or do we want to buy it or rent it from others. So as prices go up, we have to think about that a little bit more carefully. But for right now, under good control. George Tong : That's very helpful. Thanks for the color. And maybe sticking with the topic of margins. You talked about some of the puts and takes, some of the accretion from CUSIP investments that you're making. Is it possible to provide a bit of a bridge for margins, quantifying some of those puts and takes in terms of basis points impact?. Linda Huber : Sure. Let me try to do this compared to where we were at this time last year. And the incremental EPS from this quarter last year is $0.55. And the main drivers of that are $0.27 due to revenue increase and $0.10 due to margin increase. That's pretty important. We're getting the uplift from the business and from working on the margin. The tax rate has helped us to the tune of $0.19. But again, the bulk of that $0.55, $0.37 of it is coming from the business. So I just want to be very clear about that. At this point, George, one of my homework assignments is to better tie investments to what's going on with ASV growth and margin. Don't have great detail on that at this minute. It's something the FP&A team is working on. But suffice it to say the evidence is there that the investments are paying off really nicely. We've got to do a better job of ticking and tying that though for you. So point taken. George Tong : Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Keith Housum : Thank you. Appreciate. Just, Linda, expanding on the previous commentary there in terms of the benefit from the lower taxes this quarter, this year. How should we think about that going forward? I mean, should we expect your effective tax rate to creep back up to prior levels, or is this lower tax rate sustainable? Linda Huber : Sure. I think, Keith, you're going to have to go with what we guided toward for the rest of the year. ETR of 12.5% to 13.5%. Now we've got some tricky things in here. Part of it is what is going to be options exercise, tough to know. It depends on where the stock price goes. Part of this also goes to where the bonus calculation goes. And you see that we're taking some charges in terms of real estate and the acquisition cost, which will bring the rate back down. So please work with 12.5% to 13.5%. One of the things we're not going to do at Investor Day is give any longer term guidance on the tax rate because we don't control the tax rates, it's pretty bouncy. So let's work with 12.5% to 13.5% for the rest of the year and just kind of keep it there. We're pretty happy with that, but it's a tough thing to predict for the longer term. I hope that's helpful. Keith Housum : It is. It is. Just in terms of your customer service and travel, I mean, one of the things that FactSet has always been known for is it's great customer service and it includes getting into the offices of its customers. And, obviously, this has changed during COVID. But as you guys think about your travel strategy going forward and your customer service, is there a pronounced change in your efforts to -- or your, I guess, permission is that big travel as it was, or how do you guys think about travel going forward and perhaps the impact it has in the overall business, both from a revenue generation as well as expense line? Phil Snow : Yeah, I think -- well, we've learned that we can do everything virtually fairly well, you can see that in terms of our growth. But that is a big piece of FactSet's culture and our clients really appreciate that high-touch service we give them. So I think we'll see a good balance there. I don't expect we'll get back to anything like what we used to have from a T&E expense. But I recently just visited all of our US offices and spoke to a lot of our new hires. So people are jumping at the bit to get out there. Some of it is just based on what the clients are comfortable having us in their office, but that's going to continue to be a big piece of what we do as a company. Linda Huber : Yeah. We had run about $15 million on G&A for the year. The first half of the year, the spending on that is less than $3 million. We're redirecting a little bit of the T&E spend to some other things we need to do in enterprise solutions to make sure we're able to do everything, Helen and the sales team needs to do for price realization and usage tracking amongst other things. So we're making very good use of slightly lighter T&E dollars. But we want to get everyone back to face-to-face meetings is still set as soon as we can. So, hopefully, that gives you some sense of the dimension of the spend as well. Keith Housum : Hey guys. I appreciate the color. Thank you. Phil Snow : I assume you're a FactSet user, and we'd be happy to visit whenever you like. Keith Housum : We are. We are. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Your question please. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Adam on for Shlomo. Commentary in the press release with around 413 sequential increase in clients is primarily due to the corporate. We had close to 200 increase in user count was due to the research and advisory. Is the implication that the higher user count is largely coming from increased hiring at existing clients? Phil Snow : The client -- the users, sorry? Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Phil Snow : Yes, it was a little unclear that I couldn't hear you very well. But yes, the users -- so we had a big uptick in users. We had actually a very large wealth deal that closed and the users are using the product that's been deployed and we'll recognize the revenue for that, I think, later in the year. So, it wasn't a driver of the quarter in terms of revenue. But the user count you're seeing that came from pretty big wealth deal and some other great wins on the wealth side as well as an uptick in corporate clients. So, that was what was driving the user count number. And then on the client count number, it was a nice mixture of corporate, private equity, venture capital firms, and wealth clients. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And for the CUSIP contribution, can you talk a little about the impact on the ASV side, any kind of -- how much of the guidance raise was from -- on the EPS side, I think from CUSIP? Linda Huber : I think we'll talk a little bit more to spell that out at Investor Day, Shlomo, that would be okay with you. Frankly, we've had to move through all of this pretty quickly. So, we'll speak about that a little bit more and give you good reason to come see us on April 5th, if you could. I wanted to make sure we get a couple of housekeeping matters out of the way here before we close the call. Just wanted to remind everyone that we typically look at our dividend in the third quarter. So, please factor that into your thinking. We have talked with the rating agencies about our thoughts on dividend and so all of that will move along. On bad debt, it's ticked up a bit. Some of that is a result of Russia, about $200,000, more of it due to a bit slower payment from China, about $500,000, and it's part of the cycle of when we bill. So, nothing unusual there, but bad debt is something we're keeping a close eye on here as we move through the Russian situation. So, please think about that a little bit. Also on the facilities situation, as we reduce this cost, the charges that we've taken, we're hoping we're going to be able to increase investment availability by about $10 million to $14 million over the next three to five years. The idea is we're taking money away from funding large square footages of real estate. I'm going to put some of that back in to some of the investments we need to make. So, a redirection there of our real estate costs. I think that's about it. And I thought maybe it might be helpful in closing if Phil could do a little bit of a commercial for our ESG business plays through True Value Labs because we haven't received any questions on that. Phil Snow : Yes. So yes, so our ESG business is doing well. It's grown about 75% since the acquisition, which I think was in the last -- the end of calendar 2019. So, we're excited about that, and we've got some nice products that are in the pipeline that are that are coming to market soon. Phil Snow : So, I guess, I'll just wrap up here. So thank you all for joining us today. In closing, I want to reiterate how proud I am of our accomplishments in the second quarter. As a company, we accelerated the top line and had a stellar first half with strong momentum that will carry us into the third and fourth quarters. We worked across the organization to close the acquisition of CGS, our largest acquisition to date, financed in part by our investment grade in overall senior notes offering of $1 billion. Finally, we continue to invest in our greatest asset, our people. I look forward to seeing many of you on Tuesday, April 5, please come to our Investor Day. In the meantime, please call Kendra Brown with additional questions, and we'll speak to you next quarter. Operator, that ends today's call. Operator : Thank you, sir. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker host, Kendra Brown, Head of Investor Relations. Kendra Brown : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FactSet's third fiscal quarter 2022 earnings call. Before we begin, I would like to point out that the slides we will reference during this presentation can be accessed via the webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at factset.com. The slides will be posted on our website at the conclusion of this call. A replay of today\u2019s call will be available via phone and on our website. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions from investors. To be fair to everyone, please limit yourself to one question plus one follow-up. Before we discuss our results, I encourage all listeners to review the legal notice on Slide 2, which explains the risk of forward-looking statement and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the appendix to the presentation and in our earnings release issued earlier today. Joining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer, and Linda Huber, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the discussion over to Phil Snow. Phil Snow : Thank you, Kendra, and hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I am pleased to share our strong third quarter results as we delivered another exceptional quarter with double-digit ASP growth. As we enter our fiscal fourth quarter of 2022, we are building on our momentum and are well positioned for the year-end. Given this outlook, we are guiding to the high end of our previously discussed financial ranges, except for the tax rate, which will be at the low end of the range. Linda will speak more about this in a moment. Our organic ASV plus professional services growth accelerated to 10% in the third quarter, with strength across all workflow solutions and regions. Growth was primarily driven by analytics with success globally from asset managers and asset owners as well as large partnership wins and increased demand from wealth management firms. Our sales and client-facing teams continue to outperform, increasing the pace of our top line progress. We saw acceleration in year-over-year growth from all client types, reflecting our success in building the leading open content and analytics platform. We once again saw the continuation of double-digit growth in banking, wealth, hedge funds, corporate clients, partners and private equity and venture capital funds. Stronger retention and accelerated expansion drove demand for our content and digital solutions for existing clients. And for new business, growth was driven by our workstation with solid performance in the Americas and EMEA and continued small and medium wins across all regions. Adjusted EPS increased 38% from the prior year period given our ASV growth and disciplined expense management. Our third quarter adjusted operating margin also expanded 500 basis points year-over-year to 36.6%. About two thirds of this margin expansion came from the addition of CUSIP Global Services, or CGS, while the remaining one third came from our core business. Our fourth quarter pipeline continues to look strong, providing a tailwind for the remainder of fiscal 2022. Our third quarter performance is the result of intense focus on the strategic initiatives we showcased at Investor Day scaling our content refinery, delivering next-generation workflow solutions and enhancing the client experience with an open platform and hyper personalization. These key differentiators drive top line growth, and enable us to capture more of the addressable market. FactSet's open platform powers the portfolio life cycle with market-leading solutions. Our portfolio analytics and trading products for the front and middle office drive broad-based growth on the buy side. Ongoing investment in the front office is paying dividends as the momentum and acceleration of our front office capabilities continues to grow. These multi-asset class portfolio analytics continue to see healthy client demand, thanks to our differentiating buy-side attribution and risk capabilities. Our content refinery is driving growth in Content and Technology Solutions, or CTS, our off-platform business. As you may recall from Investor Day, this business delivers proprietary and third-party content to clients in several ways, including data feeds, APIs or increasingly, the cloud. FactSet suite of off-platform solutions offers our clients the flexibility to decide where and how they will consume their data and our ability to concord or connect data is a real differentiator. As clients increasingly want to consume data programmatically, we're expanding our robust suite of data management and workflow solutions. CUSIP Global Services, a CTS business component is a great example of this expansion. I'm pleased with the performance of the CGS team, its integration with FactSet has gone very well. Together, our teams are working to expand the business, focusing on private companies, ESG, digital assets and issuance trends, and these opportunities are promising, but several will take time, so it's still early days. Linda will discuss CGS' performance in more detail later in the call. In the current volatile market, our investments in content and workflow solutions put us in a resilient position. Our clients clearly recognize the value of our diverse product portfolio, and we are committed to increasing the pace of these investments for the next few years. We will continue to invest in our content refinery, building on our offerings in ESG, deep sector, real-time, private markets and wealth. And as we discussed at Investor Day, our investments drive client demand and will be a driver of growth in the years to come. Looking across our regions, we saw broad-based acceleration across all our markets. The Americas continues to be the biggest contributor to growth with organic ASV growth accelerating to 10.1%. This was driven by research and advisory with the workstation driving new business, especially among corporates, Expansion was driven largely by wins at wealth clients. In EMEA, ASV growth accelerated to 8.3%. Workstation sales drove growth with asset managers and banks. We saw increased ASV capture in the region due to the international price increase better price realization and workstation expansion. New business also contributed to growth, driven by increased workstation sales within wealth funds. Asia Pacific's performance remained strong with ASV growth at 14.3%, driven by demand from asset managers and asset owners. We saw higher retention and expansion among existing clients across many countries, both CTS and analytics contributed to growth with higher expansion with asset owners and asset managers, respectively. In summary, I'm very pleased with our third quarter performance. We continue to invest in our business and platform, which is paying off, giving us good momentum as we head into the fourth quarter. Looking ahead, we are confident in our strategy and ability to navigate volatile markets. We remain committed to the medium-term outlook we shared at Investor Day of 8% to 9% ASV growth, 11% to 13% EPS growth and 35% to 36% adjusted operating margin. FactSet has a proven history of growth in volatile markets. Our subscription-based model provides stability and fosters client retention. We're prepared for potential downturn scenarios with specific levers to reduce our spending if necessary, even as we continue to invest in our business, which Linda will discuss in more detail. Ultimately, our open platform, content refinery and personalized workflow solutions will continue to set us apart. Underpinning all our efforts is our incredible team. Our culture is a key differentiator in this competitive environment, and we're committed to attracting, retaining and developing top talent. Like many of you, our leadership team has increased our in-person interactions. It's been great to meet with clients again, have visitors in our offices and engage with FactSetters face-to-face. We provide flexibility for our employees with our hybrid work model, which has been very well received, and I'm proud of the work our team does every day to deliver on our goals and constantly improve our products. I will now turn it over to Linda to take you through the specifics of our Q3 performance. Linda Huber : Thank you, Phil, and hello to everyone on the call. As you've seen from our press release this morning, we are pleased to report continued acceleration in our top line with double-digit growth year-over-year in revenues, organic ASV and adjusted diluted EPS. I'll now share some more details on our third quarter performance. Consistent with our definition of organic revenues and ASV, we will exclude any revenue and ASV associated with CGS when reporting organic-related metrics for the 12 months following the acquisition date. We will, however, provide some specifics on CGS so you can track its initial performance as part of FactSet. As Kendra previously noted, a reconciliation of our adjusted metrics to comparable GAAP figures is included at the end of our press release. We grew third quarter organic ASV plus professional services at 10% year-over-year. This acceleration reflects disciplined execution of our sales pipeline and pricing plans. In addition, investments in content and workstation functionality continue to support both retention and better price realization. For example, our third quarter international price increase contributed $10 million in ASV, an increase of $3 million or 30% from last year. Third quarter GAAP revenue increased by 22% from the prior year period to $489 million. Organic revenue, which excludes any impact from foreign exchange, acquisitions during the last 12 months and deferred revenue amortization, increased 10% to $442 million over the prior year period. Growth was driven by our research and advisory and analytics solutions as well as by the acquisition of CUSIP Global Services. All regions saw robust growth, benefiting from acceleration in all 3 workflow solutions. For our geographic segments, organic revenue growth over the prior year period for the Americas was 7%, EMEA at 13% and Asia Pacific at 24%. Turning now to expenses; GAAP operating expenses grew 39% year-over-year to $392 million impacted by several charges incurred during the period. First, as previously discussed, we have been resizing our real estate footprint to match our hybrid work model. This quarter, we recognized $49 million in impairment charges. While we will continue to evaluate our real estate needs, this initiative is largely complete. We do not anticipate similarly sized real estate impairment charges in the quarters to come. Also in the third quarter, we incurred $12 million in onetime acquisition costs related to the CGS acquisition. In addition, we recognized $13 million in acquisition-related intangible asset amortization during the quarter. Going forward, this intangible asset amortization will be a recurring charge. Given these charges, our GAAP operating margin decreased by 956 basis points to 19.9% compared to the prior period. Adjusted operating margin increased by 500 basis points to 36.6% compared to the prior year, exceeding our guidance on this measure driven by lower compensation expenses, lower tech and content costs and lower facilities expenses. As a percentage of revenue, our cost of sales was 582 basis points lower than last year on a GAAP basis and 792 basis points lower on an adjusted basis. This decrease was primarily due to lower employee compensation and lower technology and content-related expenses, including our ongoing shift to the public cloud. When expressed as a percentage of revenue, SG&A was 536 basis points higher year-over-year on a GAAP basis and 292 basis points higher on an adjusted basis. The primary drivers of the increase include CGS acquisition costs, increased employee compensation expense and higher bonus accrual. Moving on to tax. Our tax rate for the quarter was 12.2% compared to last year's rate of 11.9%. This was primarily due to lower projected levels of income before income taxes and a tax provision reduction related to the lower rate compared with the 3 months ended May 31, 2021. GAAP EPS decreased 26% to $1.93 this quarter versus $2.62 in the prior year primarily due to real estate impairment charges, acquisition expenses and higher interest expenses, partially offset by higher revenues. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 38.2% from the prior year to $3.76, largely driven by revenue growth, margin expansion and a lower tax rate. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $173 million up 30% year-over-year. And finally, free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending, was $177 million for the quarter, an increase of 45% over the same period last year. A key driver for our increased cash flow is the acquisition of CGS, which has performed well since closing on March 1. Speaking of the CGS acquisition, we are now 100 days in, and CGS is tracking ahead of plan on all fronts. Its financial performance was robust in Q3, with both sales and margins exceeding expectations. As we discussed on our second quarter earnings call, we're on track to realize $5 million in ASV in fiscal 2022 from CGS. It is a resilient business with steady top line and good cash flow even in a potential market downturn. While CGS' issuance fees are more sensitive to market activity, these fees make up only 15% of CGS' revenue. Functional integration of the CGS operation is well along, and we now expect to exit our transition services agreement ahead of schedule. Our ASV retention for the third quarter remained greater than 95%. We grew the total number of clients by 19% compared to the prior year, driven by the addition of more corporate and wealth clients. user count increased by more than 2,000 since last quarter, thanks to an increase in research and advisory users. Year-over-year, user count grew by 12% and our client retention remains at 92% year-over-year, reflecting the strength of our subscription revenue model. Turning now to our balance sheet. On March 1, we issued our inaugural investment-grade senior notes. These notes comprised $500 million of 2.9% 5-year senior notes and $500 million of 3.45% 10-year senior notes. At the same time, we entered into a new credit agreement, updating our term and revolving credit facilities. We're pleased that our fixed rate senior notes are well priced, given recently increasing interest rates. In addition, as you may recall, we've hedged 80% of our total debt from floating rate exposure for 24 months, largely protecting us against rising interest rates. And as we have said before, we're proud of our investment-grade ratings. In the third quarter, we made a planned prepayment of $125 million on our term loan, bringing our gross leverage ratio down to 3.5x from the initial 3.9x level when we acquired CGS. We expect to make three more payments of $125 million in each of the next three quarters, enabling us to reach our gross leverage target of 2x to 2.5x in the second half of fiscal 2023. During this time, while we may continue minor share repurchases to offset the dilutive impact of stock option grants. We do not intend to resume our share repurchase program until at least mid-2023. Lastly, we'd like to remind investors that we increased our regular quarterly dividend in the third quarter for the 23rd consecutive year of dividend increases. The increase was 8.5% for a per share dividend of $0.89. Next, I'd like to discuss planning for our downturn playbook scenario. First off, it's important to note that FactSet remains committed to top line growth supported by our investment plans. We would expect to maintain these investment plans even under a downside scenario. As Phil mentioned, historically, FactSet has fared well in volatile markets as our subscription business model provides stability even in challenging times. With more than 40 years of consecutive revenue growth, we've successfully navigated several down cycles. We significantly outperformed the S&P 500 on revenue, operating income and EPS in 2007, 2008 and 2009. In fact, in 2008 and 2009, FactSet EPS was positive, while S&P 500 EPS was double-digit negative. That said, its sound financial practice to be prepared for all scenarios. As part of this planning, we've identified 2% to 3% of our $1.2 billion in operating expenses or $24 million to $36 million that we could potentially reduce to maintain margins in the event of a severe downturn. First, if we experience lower ASV, our bonus pool would adjust accordingly per our preestablished performance targets providing the largest share of expense reductions. Lower ASV would also proportionately reduce variable third-party data and content costs. Lastly, we could potentially reduce T&E expenses through virtual engagement. This is a planning exercise we will undertake quarterly in order to rebalance resources given prevailing market conditions. To confirm this exercise is just scenario planning. As we look to end our fiscal year on August 31, FactSet is on track for a strong finish. Given our performance this quarter and robust pipeline, we reaffirm our previously communicated guidance for fiscal 2022. We expect growth at the upper end of the previously provided ranges for most of the metrics in our annual outlook. The exception would be the effective tax rate, which is expected to fall at the lower end of the previously communicated range. As a reminder, CGS is not included in our organic ASV guidance. However, as we discussed earlier in the call, we expect CGS to contribute approximately $5 million in ASV in fiscal 2022. All in all, we are encouraged by the demand for our content and workflow solutions. Our investments continue to drive growth in our digital platform. Our sales team continues to provide excellent execution, and we're continuing to improve our price realization. Although there is uncertainty in the macro environment, we believe our diverse product portfolio and stable financial position will serve us well for the longer term. With that, we're now ready to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Now our first question coming from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. Good morning. My first question is just around the guidance. Given the current quarter numbers in the momentum thus far, it sounds like you should be able to very comfortably touch the high end or even beat the guidance. So just curious as to why perhaps you didn't change or raise those numbers? Are you starting to see any feedback from your clients, perhaps just given the macro slowdown if that's flowing through to them and I just was looking for some commentary there? Phil Snow : Thanks for the question. It's Phil. So I'll kick off here, and I'm sure Linda will have a few additional comments. So yes, in terms of the fourth quarter pipeline, we're definitely confident in the range that we guided to in the last quarter and the high end of that range. So it's a very high-quality pipeline. I would say in terms of what's in there. We're seeing very good strength on the buy side, and analytics has had a very good few quarters in a row here. So we're seeing good strength and visibility on the buy side. With banking, obviously, there was a very good uplift last year from sell-side hiring. We're anticipating good sell-side hiring, maybe not as high as last year, but it's certainly, I think, more positive versus previous years. So in terms of the top line, that's what we see going out at least today. And I'll allow Linda here to kind of get into a little bit more of the other pieces of guidance Linda Huber : Manav, we feel really good about where we are. The swing factor here is really the tax rate as we go into the fourth quarter. We've got a couple of discrete items that may swing either way. In fact, we may end up doing better as we get through the end of the fourth quarter. But given the market conditions right now and the way the market is bouncing around, I think it's prudent to be confident, but not cocky. And so we thought that this was the best way to go. But thank you for pointing that out. Manav Patnaik : Got it. And just in terms of pipeline, like maybe more on the product side, I think last recession, like you pointed out, you guys grew through it, but I think you were a smaller company, a lot more share, et cetera, to be had. Can you just talk about the product pipeline and how that might help you do the same thing in the event we do go through a slowdown? Phil Snow : Sure. Yes, happy to do that. And Yes. I mean, we've lived through these and many of our sales leaders and specialty sales leaders have been through these types of cycles. So we're very experienced here. And the really good news is we have more product and ways to help clients than ever before. So it's a very good story to go into a client and really talk to them about what it is they're facing and what problems we can solve for them. And sometimes it's to our benefit because it really brings people to the table sometimes a little bit sooner than they might have traditionally done that. So I would probably put this into 3 camps or 3 categories, Manav. The first is the portfolio life cycle for the buy side is really getting some good traction here. The analytics team has had significant acceleration over the last year, and we're seeing strength come through in risk our quant products. So we now have programmatic access to the platform, and that's been very well received. And our trading products have done very well as well. And when there's increased volatility in the markets, that's certainly helpful. And that's just bolstered by like the excellent performance of the performance and the reporting parts of that business. So analytics is firing on all cylinders. And because we're a more open platform now when we plug it in more places, it really just puts us in a great position on the buy side. And I think that open theme is important as well. So not just for the buy side, but for all kinds of clients. We're finding ways that we can integrate with CRMs, for example, and other pieces of our clients' workflows. So I recently had a bunch of visits with clients, and it feels a little different, frankly, than 2 years ago. They're really understanding our story now and seeing the differentiators that we bring to the table. And it's very exciting to be in those conversations with CTOs and CIOs at some of our largest clients. And then just the workstation. I think we've got a kind of a renaissance in the work station, that's how I like to think about it. We really have good momentum here, and we're growing our business across a lot of different firm types. So it's very broad-based. And lastly, the investments that we've made in content are really paying off. Deep sector has already paid off but we're beginning to see private markets and ESG come through, and we're also investing in real time. So there's so many weapons that we have now for our salespeople to go out there and help our clients. And what I'm encouraged by is across every business line we have, and it's across every region and it's across every firm type. So we're very well distributed here in terms of our opportunity. I think better prepared than ever for any sort of downturn in the market. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : Just continuing on the downturn theme. Hoping you could remind us how professional services act during downturns. And now you have the non-subscription part of CUSIP, it's under 15% of that business. Could you just remind us what's in there and how discretionary, I guess, that is? That's my first question. Phil Snow : Sure, Toni. Yes, so it's a small piece of FactSet, and most of the professional services that we offer are really to implement our analytics suite, which, as I just mentioned, is having very good momentum here. So we didn't really have a big professional services team during the last downturn, which was, I think, a little over 10 years ago. But I anticipate that we'll have the people we need to implement these products, and I wouldn't imagine that that's a headwind for us at all. Linda, I don't know if you've got any additional. Linda Huber : To follow up on your question on CUSIP, Toni, the 15% of revenues that comes from the assignment of new CUSIP numbers for new securities, you're correct about that. That is not recurring revenue. The other 85% of CUSIP revenues are, in fact, recurring. So if we do have a bit of a slowdown in capital markets activity, we may see a slight trending down of that 15% of CUSIPs revenues. But I'm not sure that you're going to notice that overall in the total mix of the company, and we would expect that, that would just be if capital markets do take a downturn. So again, that piece is pretty minor as well. Toni Kaplan : Yes, makes sense. I wanted to ask on the expense side. So Linda, you mentioned the real estate opportunities are sort of largely done. I know you're looking into third-party data costs for savings as well. Is that ahead of us? Or is that complete? And just overall, how should we think about normalized operating margins just post the real estate savings, headcount savings, all of that? Linda Huber : Sure. On real estate, you're correct, Toni, we're pretty much through this. We've reduced our real estate footprint overall by something close to 40%, which works really well with our hybrid model. We have said at Investor Day, savings that come off of that are going to take some time to materialize as we have to still consider the leases that we have. So we're looking at $10 million to $14 million of reinvestable funds over 3 years. So perhaps not quite as much as you would think. On the margin front, we're incredibly happy with the margin progress that we've made. 500 basis points is a lot. 2/3 of that comes from CUSIP, the other 1/3 from the base business. So it's important to note the base business is doing well also. On the second bucket of personnel costs, we noticed that we came out about where we had expected this quarter. Salaries are a little bit lighter because it has been challenging to fill all of the open positions that we have, but our bonus accrual is higher because we've done well. So we did $31 million of bonus accrual in the third quarter. In the first and second quarter, we were at about $21 million and $22 million. So we're running $75 million through 3 quarters, and you should expect that the fourth quarter would probably be an average of those 3, so $25 million, $26 million. So we're looking at what we expect to be potentially even $100 million bonus pool this year. So that is heftier than what we've done in previous years. So bonus pool upside kind of offset the salary line running a little bit light. On third-party data costs, this is a tricky one. We are in inflationary times. We've worked quite hard on this, and we will continue with our procurement group to negotiate effectively. I think we would see this line moving up sort of 3-ish percent, maybe a little bit more. This one, we're going to have to watch and we'll have more information for you. But we have looked to beef up the procurement activity to make sure that we've got that right. And technologies come in about where we had expected. We expect technology costs will move up, though, as we said, great success with the cloud with our clients, which has resulted in greater cost for greater utilization. And we're building more of our own software. So amortization continues to move up as a trend. But basically, we've handled the acquisition expenses for CUSIP. Those have come through. And the trends are looking pretty good. You had seen the margin guidance over the longer term, the margin goals of 35% to 36% adjusted and we feel like we're making very good progress on that. So I hope that is a fulsome answer to all your questions, Toni. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Ashish Sabadra : So my first question, I wanted to focus on the comment around that large partnership win that was highlighted upfront, as well as pension and wins at wealth clients. I was wondering if you could provide further color on those -- both of those, just the pipeline for further partnership as well as pipeline for wealth management. Phil Snow : Absolutely, Ashish. Yes, we have a very strong partnerships business. And as our platform has become more open, and we have more to offer from our content refinery, it gives us a good opportunity to distribute what we have on the shelves through different ways. So we did have a very nice deal in Europe that was driven by a lot of our core content. So that was a big contributor to Europe's growth and CTS' growth this quarter. And on the wealth side, it's very well distributed. So I think quarter after quarter, you see the new logos and the increase in our workstations wealth is usually on the leaderboard there, if not at the top of it. And there's just a steady pipeline of larger deals that we're just systematically knocking our way through. So it's hard to sort of scrape a ton of these over in any given year, just how long those contracts are and how big a decision it is for some of those firms. But I have every confidence in the world in our wealth team. They're doing exceptionally well. We're really killing it within the space that we're focused on, and we do think there's a greater opportunity in wealth to capture more of the wealth advisers workflow as we look forward. Ashish Sabadra : That's great color. And Linda, thanks for providing the detailed color around incentive comp and details around real estate savings. But I just wanted to drill down further on the guidance piece. If I look at the implied fourth quarter guidance, that implies a significant moderation of margins in the fourth quarter. And so I was wondering, is there any particular puts and takes that we need to be cognizant of for the fourth quarter? Or is that just, as you mentioned earlier, just conservatism baked into given the economic environment? Linda Huber : Well, I think it would be fair to say, Ashish, that we are being conservative given the economic environment that is fair. A couple of things to think about if we are able to hire more heavily in the fourth quarter, you may see some increase in the salary line. That would be something to keep an eye on. And again, the accrual will be a bit higher in the fourth quarter for the bonus pool, which is an important thing as well, given that the company is performing really well. The guidance, again, turns on what happens with the tax line. And again, we've got a couple of discrete items that we're keeping an eye on. And it is possible that we may find ourselves with higher EPS, but we're going to have to watch that and we're going to have to see. So I hope that is helpful to you. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Alex Kramm : Hello. Just want to come back to the pipeline comments that you made earlier and I guess the unchanged guide for ASV. So I think you mentioned earlier, yes, maybe the sell side is a little bit softer. But obviously, you're still pointing towards a pretty big step down year-over-year in the fourth quarter. So my question here is, is there something about seasonality that has changed? I think I've had some discussions with you guys that maybe you changed the -- well, I think you've changed some of the sales incentive structure a little bit. So just wondering if that has perhaps pulled forward some sales into earlier quarters than you're actually trying to smooth out the seasonality a little bit. So maybe you can just talk about this a little bit, not -- so we're not surprised that maybe the quarters are just a little bit different than they were historically. Phil Snow : Thank, Alex. Yes. So I think there is something to the second part of your question there. So I did -- I've had conversations with Helen. I think Helen and Linda have really teamed up to make sure that we have incentives there for the salespeople earlier in the year. And obviously, if we can get the ASV in early, it means good things, right, for all the other financial metrics. So we're certainly trying to do that and not have a lot of chips on the river basically on the last quarter of the of the year. And this is going to be a strong fourth quarter for us, particularly, I think, if you compare it to years prior to last year, we did get a very strong uplift in Q4 towards -- within the last month of last year. And it's a little hard to predict whether or not that's going to happen again. And a lot of that did come from banking. So we see strength in banking, but it's hard to say that we're going to get the same effect that we had last year. So that's how I would characterize both parts of your question. Alex Kramm : Great. And then second quick one here. This may be a little bit in the weeds, but one of your large competitors, Bloomberg to name them, I think there's a change happening on July 1 that is creating a little bit of movement. I guess, if I'm characterizing this correctly, I think there are some changes to how people can reuse Bloomberg remotely, which I think during COVID, they were very helpful and now they're turning this off. And from what I understand, a lot of the sell side, in particular, scrambling to find alternatives. So those people who are no longer going to be able to get to those share terminals. So just it sounds to me like that FactSet in particular, has been front and center on this and trying to help a lot of the sell side with that and those could actually be some meaningful new users that maybe you didn't have an opportunity to get before. So again, I know it's a little bit in the weeds, but just wondering if you've seen that if this could actually be a meaningful new kind of competitive win here that we're seeing in the fourth quarter and how meaningful that could be? Phil Snow : Well, we always want to be helpful for our clients is certainly the case. So I wouldn't expect any, I think, big tailwind from that this quarter. But obviously, we're focused on the competitive environment and sometimes it's hand-to-hand combat sort of 1 desk at a time, but we do feel that all the investments we're making, particularly in our workstation now for front office professionals, is becoming differentiating. So I'm very optimistic about our long-term prospects there, Alex. Operator : Our next question coming from the Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Hamzah Mazari : My first question is just if you maybe update us on what pricing is trending? I think you had said 3% to 4%, but realization may have been lower. I think that was last quarter. But any changes to the pricing model that you're thinking of in this environment? I know historically, you've talked a little bit about simplifying it, and you've also referenced sort of value-based pricing. So just any thoughts on pricing would be helpful. Phil Snow : Yes. Thanks, Hamzah, a couple of things. So yes, we did set out to capture an additional 100 basis points of pricing this year, and I think we were very successful at that. In addition, all the work that Helen has done with the product teams to simplify our packages is resulting in us capturing a lot more value through that effort. So both of those things have been very positive this year. And clearly, we're in an inflationary environment. So we're thinking carefully about the right balance for our clients next year, but we do believe FactSet is a sticky tool, and we've invested a ton in the product where there's a lot more value in there than there was even 2 years ago. So we do feel like we've got good pricing power going into this environment. Linda Huber : Yes. Hamza, it's Linda. So 4% across the platform, and we've just dealt with our international price increases, as you know, we've kept those consistent internationally and in the U.S. Internationally, we saw $10 million in ASV uplift $3 million of that year-over-year increase or 30%. So price realization has been extremely important for FactSet. As Phil had said, discipline is improving. Our pricing desk has been very helpful to make sure that we don't overly modify various packages that we're showing to clients. And we're really pleased with this effort. We'll have to see what inflation looks like for next year, and we do feel that the value of the products is allowing us to provide that value-based pricing to clients, but pricing discipline has really been very helpful to us and a real tailwind. Hamzah Mazari : Great. That's very helpful. And just my follow-up, I'll turn it over is really around -- I know you talked about the downturn playbook and gave good detail on sort of the cost opportunity. But just looking at it from a revenue standpoint, I guess maybe just frame for us, has your visibility become better in the portfolio as you've moved sort of more to our workflow business relative to historically? Has there been any change in your subscription contracts around cancellation clauses or anything just visibility-wise that whether you have more or less visibility versus history? And I think you referenced some of your customer conversations, maybe you can just remind us what some of those conversations have been what you're hearing from customers, just in terms of the environment. Phil Snow : Sure. Well, I will say the pipeline is very high quality, and we have more and more discipline, I think, in terms of how we do that consistently globally. So -- but I'm not sure that we can ever at least for now, look out more than six months, right? -- with any huge degree of confidence. So that's sort of been consistent in terms of my messaging is usually a couple of quarters out we can predict with a high degree of certainty. We do have a large percentage of our clients, though, under multi- or ASV under multiyear contracts. So that does provide us obviously some visibility there for those clients that are not in the last year of that contract. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Andrew Nicholas : The first question I wanted to ask was just kind of on upside to your own internal expectations. Obviously, you've raised guidance already this year. Now you're looking to the top end. It looks like there could be some conservatism in that number. I'm just curious what has surprised you positively? What is has more momentum than you had expected? And any other color on exactly what is driving that? Phil Snow : Well, I'm not too surprised. I think we've got a very good team here. We've had a consistent strategy over the last three years. It's just really nice to see it all come through and come through in so many different places. And I'm very encouraged by our workstation growth. I think that -- I think there were a lot of questions probably within the analyst community about whether or not we could continue to capture more desks and overcome the trend from active to passive. So it's just very encouraging and rewarding for the whole team to see the results. So I think that's how I would answer that. We're confident. We've got an engine now that's firing on all cylinders. There's a lot more coming through. So I think we're going into this environment with a lot of confidence and our ability to execute. Linda Huber : Andrew, I think we would also say the addition of the CUSIP business is very helpful to us. It's come in a bit stronger than we had even expected. You have to keep in mind that this was a little bit of a challenging thing to bring on board. We moved through the acquisition process and looking at CUSIP in sort of an eight-week period, it was a very quick sale process. And the seller did not account for CUSIP as a separate entity. So there are a lot of accounting allocation things and so on that we weren't exactly sure how all of this would lay out. But as we've brought it over, the integration has gone really, really well. and it has performed even a bit better than we had expected as we noted. So very pleased about that. Its margin addition is helpful to us. It allows us to continue a robust investment program and get some other things done. So we're very pleased with that acquisition, which was financed in an attractive way at a great time. So all of that is working together now, and we're just very happy with how we're firing on all cylinders. Andrew Nicholas : Great. That's all helpful. And then maybe for my follow-up, maybe just a bigger picture question. A lot of talk now about kind of a downturn playbook. How the business would perform, how would you expect the competitive marketplace to change any more challenging time for the end market? Do you think that the share gains that you've seen over the past several years are easier to continue getting? Or is it more difficult? Or just kind of any thoughts on how a more challenging backtrack economically for asset managers and your clients might impact your ability to win business relative to others in the space. Phil Snow : Yes. So I saw it on the buy side. So if their assets are down and their revenues are down, of course, they're going to be looking closely at their budgets. But again, it's a good opportunity to proactively talk to them, reeducate them about everything we have, bring them to the table. And there is this ongoing trend, which has been going on now for a while where the larger buy-side firms, in particular, are really looking to consolidate and cut in half the number of content and technology providers they work with. And there's really a very limited number of firms like FactSet. They can go in and offer so much across their workflow. So for us, we welcome this. I think it's a great opportunity for us, and we have a long history of working with clients that really trust us and want to partner with us. So -- we'll go through these cycles. We've been through them before. And I anticipate we'll do very well on a relative basis like we have historically. Linda Huber : Yes, Andrew, we are very focused on what we're able to do for productivity for our clients. And anecdotally, we've heard some of them say that moving to FactSet has provided 20% greater productivity. We're sharpening up our marketing pitch on that just to make sure that we've got that right and we can bring that to the fore for existing clients and potential clients. But the ease of use our products and the elimination of the need to flip back and forth between screens and so on is really a very big help, and we feel a very up-to-date way to conduct business and to handle the workflows. So productivity is really important, and we think we can really be a big driver of that for our clients. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Craig Huber : I wanted to focus on the corporate part of your business, the sell-through there and how you're doing it. It seems like it's doing quite well. Maybe you could touch on that, maybe you could tell us with you the growth rates are there. And I'm always curious here what the percentage of overall revenue is. So why don't we start there? Phil Snow : Sure, Craig. Yes, we don't break it out, but it is 1 of our fastest-growing client types. And like wealth, it's typically on the leaderboard in terms of new logos. So we have a very, very strong product for Investor Relations. We also do very well with the M&A or business development groups at our clients. And all of the new investments we're making in content around deep sector private markets. All of this opens up new clients to us and more workflows as well. I already mentioned that we're beginning to very effectively get into the CRM workflows of different types of clients. So this isn't an area that traditionally FactSet is focused on a lot because they typically weren't big wins. But with our investments and all of the efficiency now that we have in terms of our sales for us. It really allows us to do volume, I think, in a way that makes sense for the company. So I have a lot of I feel very optimistic about what we can do in the corporate space and continue that to continue to be the growth driver and a more meaningful part of our business over time. Craig Huber : And then my follow-up question, please. To talk about the client retention rates. Obviously, you have retention rate or a percent of clients 92%. It's very, very high, obviously. It held up quite well as you alluded to back in '08, '09. I'm just curious, given the macro environment, what is your sort of thought on how that might progress here in the coming quarters here, given the macro environment? Phil Snow : It's hard to predict, but we've seen very, very good trends in client retention, and I give a lot of credit to Helen and the sales team in terms of how they've organized and how they've really focused on client success and placed a very heavy emphasis on making sure that our clients are well served. And it's -- if you can retain clients, it really is a very good foundation. So there's a ton of great work that's gone on. I think I saw in one of the analyst reports a question about how we're doing -- reorganizing by firm type where we've done that primarily in the Americas for now. But that's been a very good program, and we've essentially now segmented the sales force in a way where they really just focus by firm type rather than by geography. And that means we understand our clients even better than we did before. So there's multiple efforts going on that are going to help with retention. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Faiza Alwy : Linda, I wanted to go back on the 4Q margin guide specifically. Because obviously, you had a really good margin quarter at 36.6%. And your fiscal '22 guide of 34% implies a 4Q margin of around 32%. And I know I was listening very carefully when you were answering prior questions, and I didn't hear anything specific in terms of what might impact margins in 4Q. So I just wanted to give you 1 more opportunity to tell us that you're being conservative. Linda Huber : Thank you very much, Faiza. We may have, as we said, a bit higher expenditures on hiring and also on bonus. We have guided for the full year. And keep in mind that, that guidance applies to the full year, and we've done quite well in the third quarter. So we do hope that, that continues. And I think it is fair to say that we're trying to be prudent here. We were pleased with what CUSIP provided to us, and we're hopeful that we'll be able to come in ahead of our guidance we're going to have to wait and see. Very much appreciate your appreciation of our having good work done on the margin this quarter. We're keeping a careful eye on our costs. And as long as the ASV continues in the trend that we're seeing, we're quite hopeful. So we will see how the year wraps up. Faiza Alwy : Great. And then I just wanted to follow up generally on ESG and TruValue. I know there you have a slightly differentiated offering as you provide more of an outside in perspective. So wanted to see if you could share some color on what type of feedback you've received from clients. Is the product offering where you'd like it to be? Or is there more work to be done in terms of integrating the product within the fact set, whether it's workstation or other APIs and maybe how you see the offering evolving over time? Phil Snow : Sure. It's been about 18 months, and I'm very happy with the progress we've made, Pfizer. So yes, it is integrated into the FactSet workstation. That's one thing. We've also done a good job of integrating the majority of the TBL process into the core content platform, and we're extending the coverage of ESG from public markets into private markets. And that's been but undertaking that's beginning to have some real success. So our methodology is different. We think it's differentiating and good, and it requires some education of the clients. But we do have a very good growth rate for that business within CTS. And it's a big piece of our focus as we go into the next 3 years in terms of where we're going to be investing and how we can really bring, I think, more clarity to this for our clients in the marketplace. Linda Huber : Yes. And Faiza, it's Linda. Our data collection efforts have really picked up in pace. And we've been very, very pleased with how that has gone. ESG is one of the heaviest areas of investment. We've just come through our investment decisions. And ESG is where we're directing a good chunk of our investment pool. So lots to do there. Pleased with how it's gone. We've tripled sort of the run rate on ESG coming out of TruValue Labs since we've integrated the acquisition and please watch the space. We're quite excited about it. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Phil, just a quick question on what's going on with the equity markets and the decline of all these asset values? Is this impacting your ability to close deals or swing any of the sales cycle of the sales cycle or anything like that? Are you seeing the clients at this point in time reacting in a way that would indicate that maybe things are slowing? Or is it really just kind of they're taking it and just kind of watching it but not really changing their MO right now? Phil Snow : We haven't seen a lot of change, Shlomo. The one from type where I would say we've seen a little bit more of a slowdown is in the hedge funds, which, as you know, is a smaller piece of our business, maybe around 5%. And that's had a pretty good growth rate over the last year or so, and we expect we'll still be able to grow the hedge funds. But that's really the only part, I think, where we've seen any sort of real sign that the sort of delays in decision-making. We don't want to be naive here. We think, obviously, clients are taking a good look at their budgets going into next year. But for all the reasons we outlined on the call already. I think we're in pole position here to make sure that we're there to help them and continue to invest and grow. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. And then just one maybe for Linda, just a little kind of housekeeping thing. Was there a materially high level of AR DSO at CUSIP when it was purchased. There was a commentary around the press release about how ability to make collections in both the core business and in CUSIP. And if I look at the RDSO, it's up both sequentially a little bit year-over-year. And that kind of implies that maybe you bought a business that had a lot of outstanding receivables. I was just wondering if that's something to think about. I'm just trying to think about how to model the free cash flow going forward. Linda Huber : Yes. Shlomo, you get a best student gold star because you have a correct observation. Yes, accounts receivable has popped up by quite a bit. The CUSIP team has done a great job at a lot of things, but we've got to sharpen their pencils there on the accounts receivable collections. So we're well aware of that. And we will make sure that we get to it. But your observation is correct. That's one of the types of things when you acquire a business from another firm, and you're still working with a technical services agreement that we've got to do some work on to get that number down, but very good catch, Schlomo. Thank you. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Thank you very much. Linda Huber : We wanted to just do a few housekeeping details here just to make sure that everyone is modeling correctly. And I would like to just note that you should take a look at the fourth quarter bonus accrual, which should be as we had said, sort of on average of the 3 quarters now that we've made a heavier accrual in the third quarter. So $26 million, $25 million, something like that would be helpful. Please also note that we've increased our dividend. Sometimes that's not always picked up. And we are going to do some work on our accounts receivable. And I think with that, we've pretty much taken care of everything on the housekeeping front. Phil Snow : Well, thank you all for joining us today. In closing, I want to reiterate how pleased I am with our third quarter performance. We accelerated the top line to double-digit growth with strong momentum as we move into the end of the fiscal year, and we remain confident in our ability to drive sustainable growth through focused expense management and continued investments in our people, product and technology. With over 40 years of continuous growth, FactSet has a proven history of navigating volatile markets successfully. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. In the meantime, please call Kendra Brown with additional questions. Operator, this ends today's call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.

After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker for today, Kendra Brown. You may begin. Kendra Brown : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FactSet\u2019s fourth fiscal quarter 2022 earnings call. Before we begin, I would like to point out that the slides we will reference during this presentation can be accessed via the webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at factset.com. The slides, as well as a replay of today\u2019s call, will be posted on our website at the conclusion of this call. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions from investors. To be fair to everyone, please limit yourself to one question plus one follow-up. Before we discuss our results, I encourage all listeners to review the legal notice on slide two, which explains the risks of forward-looking statement and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is in the appendix to the presentation and in our earnings release issued earlier today. Joining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer; and Linda Huber, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the discussion over to Phil Snow. Phil Snow : Thank you, Kendra, and hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I am pleased to share our strong fourth quarter and full year results. We ended fiscal 2022 with organic ASV plus professional services growth of $158 million, accelerating nearly 200 basis points year-over-year to over 9%, topping the high end of our guidance. We achieved annual revenue of $1.84 billion and adjusted EPS of $13.43, with both metrics also above the high end of our guidance range. Our strategy to become the leading open content and analytics platform is resonating with clients and driving our strong performance as we continue to gain market share. We saw growth across fund types, with corporates, private equity and venture capital firms, wealth managers, hedge funds and banking continuing their trend of double-digit organic ASV growth. Specifically, we saw improved retention with most clients this year with further growth coming from better price realization. Our investments in content and technology supported both stronger retention and expansion, as well as significant acceleration in new business. Year-over-year buy-side and sell-side growth rates have increased by 200 basis points and 180 basis points, respectively. On the buy-side, the success of our portfolio life cycle products has been key to our expanded footprint with institutional asset managers. We continue to capture more of our addressable market by increasingly connecting our analytics, content and delivery capabilities across the front, middle and back office. Fiscal 2022 was not only a strong financial year for us, but also a milestone year for FactSet. We completed the largest acquisition in our history with CUSIP Global Services, issued our inaugural senior notes with investment grade ratings from both Moody\u2019s and Fitch, joined the S&P 500, and advanced our sustainability efforts with the commitment to the Science Based Targets Initiative and the 2040 net zero emissions goal. In addition, we continue to expand our content and technology offerings with several key partnerships. It also marked the culmination of our three-year investment plan. Our foresight to invest in content and technology is paying dividends, accelerating topline growth by over 400 basis points since 2019. These investments fueled the largest content expansion in FactSet\u2019s history. Today, we have deep sector coverage for eight sectors. We are making strides in our private market strategy with private company coverage across our content refinery, workflow solutions for private equity and venture capital firms, and cohesive connected workstation integration. We expanded our ESG content through the acquisition of Truvalue Labs and now partnered with more than 45 other ESG providers to aggregate a comprehensive set of data and solutions. And in wealth, our market-leading workstation, Advisor Dashboard and Portfolio Analytics Tools are helping advisers work more efficiently while driving new business wins for FactSet. We also invested in and accelerated our digital transformation. Our digital platform is a competitive differentiator, enabling clients to access our content and analytics via open, modern solutions. We are now a preferred partner for clients on their cloud migration journeys. Our acquisition of CUSIP Global Services aligns very well with the strategy and is a natural extension of our content refinery capabilities. The performance of CGS has exceeded our expectations with the integration progressing well and we see opportunities to expand further by innovating and building new products. While early on in these efforts, we are currently exploring new business opportunities to extend CUSIP identifiers to additional entities. We continue to invest in our people, helping us retain the best talent and stabilize retention even in this competitive market. We have embraced a hybrid work model that trusts our employees to select the work paradigm that allows them to be their most productive selves. We have invested in technology for home offices to ensure all employees regardless of location have setups that facilitate collaboration and efficiency. We have instituted global wellness days to give employees time to reconnect and charge. And we have also seen an increase in traveling and in-person engagements as our leaders encourage employees to meet one another and clients face-to-face wherever possible and we have invested in compensation. To combat the effects of inflation, we have proactively increased salaries for critical roles and extended participation in our bonus and equity pools. Headcount increased year-over-year, thanks to our recruiting team, who did an amazing job of backfilling critical open positions and sourcing new talent to support our investments. We also progressed as a firm with diversity, equity and inclusion. Central to our culture is the commitment to hiring and supporting talent from diverse backgrounds and experiences. With the addition of Kate Stepp as our Chief Technology Officer, women now comprise half of our executive leadership team. That\u2019s just one example of our success and an achievement that makes us proud. As we enter our next phase of investments, our focus remains the same; scaling up our content refinery to provide the most comprehensive and connected set of industry, proprietary and third-party data for the financial market; enhancing the client experience by delivering hyper-personalized solutions so clients can discover meaningful insights faster; and driving next-generation workflow specific solutions for asset managers, asset owners, the sell-side, wealth management, private equity venture capital and corporate clients. We are committed to investing in our people and our products and have invested about $40 million or about 360 basis points of margin in this effort during fiscal 2022. These investments are split pretty evenly between people and products, and will ensure the continued healthy growth of FactSet\u2019s revenue. As we move forward, we will continue to take the same strategic approach to our investments, investing at a similar pace for FY 2023, while delivering on our commitment to margin expansion. This includes the continued build out of deep sector data, real-time, ESG, private markets and wealth data as core parts of our content strategy. In addition, we will continue to invest in our digital platform and in our people. The connected nature of our content and products gives us continued confidence in meeting our medium-term outlook of 8% to 9% organic ASV growth, adjusted operating margin of 35% to 36% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 11% to 13%. Turning now to our results. In the fourth quarter, ASV plus professional services grew 9.3%, revenue growth in the fourth quarter was 21%, driven by both organic revenue and contribution from CGS, and adjusted EPS increased almost 9% from the prior year period. Our fourth quarter adjusted operating margin decelerated slightly year-over-year to 31.5%, primarily due to higher personnel expenses and technology costs. This quarter\u2019s strong performance was driven by continued expansion in Analytics & Trading and Research & Advisory. New business growth also accelerated as we added small and medium wins, as well as some notable larger wins, including the expansion of our relationship with Raymond James. This win reflects the significant investments we have made on the wealth management side, where we are recognized for having market leading products. Now looking across our regions, we continued to see broad-based organic ASV growth over the last year. The Americas continue to lead ASV performance, contributing more than half of fiscal 2022\u2019s total ASV growth and surpassing $1 billion in total ASV. In the Americas, we grew organic ASV by 9% over the past 12 months. Research & Advisory and Analytics & Trading performed particularly well this quarter with strength from our banking, wealth, private equity and venture capital clients and asset managers. In EMEA, our organic ASV growth accelerated to 8% this quarter with strength across the product portfolio. Specifically, growth was driven by Analytics & Trading wins at asset managers, combined with capturing Research & Advisory and CTS opportunities at banks, wealth managers and corporate partners. In Asia Pac, we saw organic 12% ASV growth driven by Analytics & Trading, with particular strength from asset managers and owners. Growth from wealth managers in the region also accelerated driven by higher retention. Now turning to our businesses, Research & Advisory was the largest contributor to our organic ASV growth this year with a growth rate of 9%, driven by banking, wealth and private equity and venture capital firms. We saw diverse wins from the workstation with new products such as Advisor Dashboard and Cobalt\u2019s portfolio monitoring capabilities gaining traction. We increased Research & Advisory workstation users by 12% this quarter versus a year ago with growth across both the sell-side and buy-side clients. ASV growth from sell-side clients was 13.8%, reflecting increased price realization, strong seasonal hiring and increased wallet share from our solutions. Analytics & Trading ended the year with an impressive 10% organic ASV growth rate, demonstrating continued momentum in our portfolio lifecycle strategy. This quarter marks 6 consecutive quarters of accelerating LTM ASV growth for analytics. We saw an uptick in larger wins, driven by portfolio reporting and performance, with gains among asset managers across all regions being led by the middle office. Performance and analytics professional services also contributed to this acceleration. As we look ahead, we believe demand for our market-leading analytics, expanding asset class coverage and leading technology, on- and off-platform, will continue to drive growth. Finally, CTS grew organic ASV by 11% with wins across asset managers and partners being key contributors. We saw strength in core company data, data management services, benchmarks and security data. In the fourth quarter, we saw several ESG wins with continued client growth. Real-time also gained traction with our all cloud solution appealing to clients looking to reduce costs. In summary, I am proud of our fourth quarter and full year performance and the results of our three-year investment plan. As we look ahead, we remain confident in our strategy and our ability to weather volatile markets. We are entering fiscal 2023 in a position of strength as our clients recognize the value of our solutions. Our fiscal 2023 guidance reflects our ongoing confidence in the business and Linda will provide more detail shortly. I want to wrap up by thanking our incredible FactSet team. We couldn\u2019t have achieved the strong quarter and year that we did without them. We have the best team in the business and remain committed to attracting, retaining and developing this top talent. I will now turn it over to Linda to discuss our fourth quarter and full year performance in more detail and take you through our fiscal 2023 guidance. Linda Huber : Thank you, Phil, and hello, everyone. I join Phil in congratulating FactSetters for an outstanding fiscal 2022. As I approach my one year anniversary as CFO, I am excited by everything we have been able to accomplish together. Our 9% organic ASV growth, adjusted operating margin expansion and 20% adjusted diluted EPS growth, not to mention our largest acquisition, investment grade ratings and successful financing, are a testament to the hard work of our talented teams. I look forward to continuing to work across the organization in fiscal 2023 to build on FactSet\u2019s history of strong performance and returning value to shareholders. Our growth rate for organic ASV plus professional services beat the high end of our guidance range due to our investment in product and excellent execution by our sales team. Retention moved the needle here, with higher price increases across a larger base of clients, reduced erosion as demand for our products increased across client types and successful cross-selling opportunities. Full year revenue also exceeded the high end of our range with help from CUSIP Global Services. Adjusted operating margin was in line with the higher end of our range. Our margin increase was driven by effective expense control in the core business, as well as the addition of the CGS business, resulting in 500 basis points of margin expansion. Our decision was to reinvest about 360 basis points of this margin growth back in our people and products, while allowing the margin for shareholders to rise about 140 basis points. As Phil stated, we are committed to balancing investment at a similar pace for the next few years while delivering our commitment to margin expansion. Finally, we generated solid earnings, exceeding the top end of our guidance range, through strong revenue growth, disciplined expense management and operating leverage. Let me now walk you through the specifics of our fourth quarter performance. As you have seen from our press release this morning, we are pleased to report the acceleration of organic ASV plus professional services and revenue. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that consistent with our definition of organic revenues and ASV, we will exclude any revenue and ASV associated with CGS when reporting organic-related metrics for the 12 months following the acquisition date. However, we will provide some specifics on CGS, so you can continue to track its performance. As Kendra noted, a reconciliation of our adjusted metrics to comparable GAAP figures is included at the end of our press release. We grew fourth quarter organic ASV plus professional services by 9%. This increase reflects momentum across our product portfolio. With current levels of market volatility, we see higher demand for our products as clients focus on driving alpha, as well as finding efficiencies. Fourth quarter GAAP revenue increased by 21% from the prior year period to $499 million, growth was driven by our Research & Advisory and Analytics & Trading solutions and CGS. Organic revenue, which excludes any impact from foreign exchange, acquisitions during the last 12 months and deferred revenue amortization increased 10% to $453 million over the prior year period. We saw organic ASV acceleration across all workflow solutions in each of our regions. For our geographic segments, organic revenue growth over the prior year period for the Americas was 9%, EMEA at -- was 8% and Asia-Pacific at 18%. Turning now to expenses, GAAP operating expenses grew 25% year-over-year to $367 million, impacted by several charges incurred during the period. First, this includes the recognition of $13 million in intangible asset amortization related to CGS in the fourth quarter. As we spoke about last quarter, this intangible asset amortization will be a recurring charge. Also, we saw a higher bonus pool in line with stronger than anticipated ASV performance. In the fourth quarter, our bonus accrual was $37 million, bringing the total bonus pool to $111 million for the fiscal year. As previously stated, we invested $40 million in people and product this year. This is also consistent with commitments we made at Investor Day to continue to grow these buckets to sustain growth. Looking ahead to fiscal 2023, we expect a similar level of investment. Given these expenses, our GAAP operating margin decreased by 240 basis points to 26.5% compared to the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin saw a slight decrease of 10 basis points year-over-year to 31.5%, driven by higher personnel expenses, increased technology expenses and transactional foreign currency impact. As a percentage of revenue, our cost of services was 50 basis points higher than last year on a GAAP basis and 130 basis points lower on an adjusted basis. Primary drivers include higher technology and content related expenses, including expenses related to our shift to the public cloud, as well as amortization of intangible assets and other costs associated with CGS. When expressed as a percentage of revenue, SG&A was 169 basis points higher year-over-year on a GAAP basis and 142 basis points higher on an adjusted basis. The increase is primarily driven by growth in compensation, comprised of higher salary expenses for existing employees, higher bonus accrual in line with stronger ASV performance and higher stock-based compensation expense as we distributed equity more broadly throughout the organization. Moving on to tax, our tax rate for the quarter was 10.3% compared to last year\u2019s 14.7%. This was primarily due to lower pre-tax income and a tax benefit related to finalizing the prior year\u2019s tax returns. GAAP EPS increased 2.3% to $2.69 this quarter versus $2.63 in the prior year, primarily due to higher revenue and lower taxes, partially offset by higher interest expense and margin compression. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 8.7% from the prior year to $3.13, largely driven by higher revenue, offset by the impact of higher interest expense from FactSet\u2019s investment grade senior notes and outstanding term loan. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter increased to $158.5 million, up 16% year-over-year. And finally, free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending, was $136 million for the quarter, a decrease of 20% over the same period last year, driven by higher working capital, which includes the timing of estimated tax payments and deferred revenue movements related to CGS. CUSIP Global Services exceeded expectations, adding $6 million in incremental ASV since the close of the acquisition on March 1, 2022. In Q4, CUSIP\u2019s diverse asset class coverage partially offset a weaker issuance market with significant year-over-year gains in time deposit CDs and private placements. In the fourth quarter, our ASV retention remained above 95% and our client retention improved to 92%, highlighting the continued and stable demand for our solutions. Compared to the prior year, we grew our total number of clients by 17% to more than 7,500 clients, largely due to the addition of more wealth and corporate clients. Our user count grew 12% year-over-year, growing to almost 180,000, primarily driven by sales in our Research & Advisory solutions, particularly amongst wealth management users. And turning now to our balance sheet, we continue to progress on the prepayment of the term loan related to the acquisition of CGS. In the fourth quarter, we made a planned prepayment of $125 million, bringing our gross leverage ratio down to 3.1 times from the initial 3.9 times level when we financed the CGS acquisition. We expect to make two more payments of $125 million in each of the next two quarters, enabling us to reach our gross leverage target of 2 times to 2.5 times in the second half of fiscal 2023. As a reminder, while we may continue minor share repurchases to offset the dilutive impact of stock option grants during this time, we do not intend to resume our share repurchase program until at least mid-2023. Lastly, we would like to remind investors that we increased our regular quarterly cash dividend in the third quarter for the 23rd consecutive year. The increase was 8.5% for a per share dividend of $0.89. Turning now to our outlook for fiscal year 2023, we are guiding to incremental growth of $150 million to $180 million for organic ASV plus professional services. The midpoint of this range represents a 9% increase, reflecting continued momentum in our business and our commitment to our medium-term outlook. Please note that CGS is not included in our organic ASV guidance at this time, given that it will not impact organic ASV until the last two quarters of the 2023 fiscal year. We expect adjusted operating margin of 34% to 35%, with the midpoint providing 60 basis points of margin expansion, which aligns with our medium-term outlook of 50 basis points to 75 basis points of margin expansion each year. Finally, we expect adjusted EPS of $14.50 to $14.90, representing almost 10% growth at the midpoint. Given our outperformance in fiscal 2022, we are still on track to deliver 11% to 13% EPS growth over the medium-term. We are confident of our ability to continue to grow in the face of market uncertainty. Our subscription model, diverse product portfolio and enterprise solutions make us a stable long-term investment. Looking ahead to fiscal 2023, growth will be driven by improved retention. We expect two-thirds of our topline acceleration to come from existing clients with low double-digit expansion offset by normal erosion plus increases in price realization. In the past, the majority of our growth came from cross-selling. However, given the incremental improvement in pricing this year, we anticipate the split will be more even between the two. We expect the balance of growth will come from new business, with continued growth in wealth, private equity and venture capital firms, as well as corporates. Our continued investment in technology and content should drive growth in new markets and cross-selling opportunities for existing clients. Drivers include continued commitment to the digitization of our platform. Kate Stepp, our new CTO, is taking a fresh look at our digital strategy. Example areas of focus include scaling the use of cognitive technologies, expanding our API program and driving improved capabilities and productivity in our use of the public cloud. Next, continued evolution in our content refinery, as discussed previously, we plan to make direct investments toward deep sector, real-time, private markets and ESG, development of these content sets are intended to drive retention and expansion across firm types, and finally, workflow solutions for the front office, wealth manager and private equity and venture capital firms will be key. In closing, we are pleased with our performance in fiscal 2022, as we spoke about during Investor Day, we are seeing the benefit of our strategic investments and we feel we have a long runway ahead of us. We believe we are strategically placed to deliver on our targets for fiscal 2023, as well as our medium-term outlook. While we acknowledge the uncertainty in the macro environment, we believe that our focus on investing in our people, content and technology will continue to drive growth over the longer term. And with that, we are now ready for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. We expect Ashish you are on mute. Ashish, your line is open. One moment. All right. We will move to the next one. Ashish must be having phone problems. One moment. Please stand by for our next question. Ashish Sabadra : Hello. Operator : Ashish, are you there? Your line is open. Ashish Sabadra : Hi. Can you hear me okay? Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. Operator : Yes. Ashish Sabadra : So we saw some pretty strong momentum across all three workflow solutions and thanks for giving some clarity around the growth drivers going forward in terms of pricing, cross-sell and new wins. But the question that we get from -- that we are getting is around that $150 million to $180 million of ASV growth outlook in the light of the market volatility and concerns about potential layoff on investment banking and pullback on spend by asset managers. So I was wondering if you could just provide some more color on the confidence around the ASV growth for 2023? Thanks. Phil Snow : Sure. Hey, Ashish. It\u2019s Phil. Thanks for the question. So similar to what we saw in 2022, we believe that our growth will be broad-based again in 2023. So there\u2019s pretty even distribution of goals between the different business lines, as well as the different regions. And I think that\u2019s really good news, you have got a great portfolio here, everything is firing on all cylinders. And when we look out at the first half, which we typically have good visibility on, we see a very good pipeline versus last year. So it\u2019s a very high quality pipeline. So in terms of what we can see in front of us, we feel good. We don\u2019t want to be naive. We understand that our clients obviously are going to be facing some pressure here on the budget side, but that plays into our strengths. And we have a great sales team, they are fully equipped to go out and really kind of communicate the value of FactSet\u2019s proposition -- value proposition and there\u2019s a lot we can do to help clients on the efficiency side, as well as obviously alpha generation. One piece of our business that I really want to call out this year is the analytics business. So if you go back to 2021, you can see that business was growing at 6% and it reached double digits this year. So that\u2019s 400 basis points of acceleration in analytics and that is not workstation based growth, primarily. So we are having huge wins across the portfolio life cycle. In the middle office, we have talked a little bit about that in the script, but we are very encouraged by the conversations we are having within institutional asset managers to help them think about how they manage data and their workflow. So that\u2019s just one thing that gives us more confidence going into next year. Ashish Sabadra : That\u2019s very helpful color, Phil. Really appreciate that. And maybe on my follow-up, just on the margin front, particularly as we look at 3Q versus the 4Q margins. Again, Linda, you provided some really good color around reinvestment. But I was just wondering, as we think about how much of it was maybe higher compensation versus more hiring, we obviously saw a big step-up in hiring in the fourth quarter. How should we think about for -- going into 2023 and in this particular inflationary environment, how do we think about salaries and compensation going forward? Thanks. Linda Huber : Sure. Thanks, Ashish. As we had said on the third quarter earnings call, if we did well in the fourth quarter, we did flag that we were going to put up a higher bonus accrual for the fourth quarter. So I am somewhat surprised, frankly, that people were surprised by the level of what we did in the fourth quarter in terms of the bonus. The bonus accrual for the fourth quarter was $37 million and in the third quarter it was $31 million. Our total bonus pool, as we said, was $111 million, which was up considerably over last year. We also increased stock-based compensation and that\u2019s important. We are pushing equity to more people in the corporation, both broader and deeper. So that\u2019s an important change, as well as we try to get our compensation balanced properly. Technology expenses were also up and we had talked about this also at Investor Day, that as we move to the cloud, we are seeing higher utilization of the cloud so that costs a little bit more as well. So most of this was around the increase in the like-for-like compensation, Ashish. We did hire some more people, same balance of 65% in centers of excellence and 35% that are not in the centers of excellence. So nothing too dramatic there, most of that goes to content collection as we are looking to invest in deep sector, as Phil said. But really nothing particularly exceptional, other than that we had a really strong year and a strong fourth quarter and we had a bonus catch-up as I had said we were going to do on the third quarter call. So I hope that helps you. Ashish Sabadra : That\u2019s very helpful color. Thanks again. Linda Huber : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Faiza Alwy : Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thank you. So I just wanted to talk a little bit more around margins, Linda. I am curious how much CGS contributed to margins this quarter. I know you had mentioned last quarter that it was -- it contributed about two-thirds of the expansion. So I am curious what the contribution was this quarter and maybe if you can tell us how much you expect it to contribute too in 2023? Linda Huber : Sure. So over the course of the year and I am not going to go into fourth quarter, CGS gives us about 500 additional basis points of margin. And as we said in the script, we reinvested 360 basis points of that margin and we increased our margin over the course of the year by 140 basis points, which we think is pretty significant amount and far in excess of the 50 basis points to 75 basis points that we had guided toward. So as we roll forward, we have increased margin that comes from CUSIP, but we are going to be thoughtful about how we deal with that margin. And again, we would see that we will reinvest about two-thirds and probably about a third will drop down to the bottomline. So we would expect that that will continue at sort of the same pace next year. Faiza Alwy : Okay. Understood. And then just on, you mentioned pricing, I am curious how much incremental pricing you are embedding for fiscal 2023 versus what we saw in 2022 and it doesn\u2019t sound like you are getting any pushback on that pricing, but just wanted to ask sort of how -- what\u2019s the receptivity to that incremental pricing? Phil Snow : Hi, Faiza. It\u2019s Phil. So, yeah, in 2022, we went out with a 4% price increase and we anticipate we will be asking for a little bit more than that going into 2023, which is completely appropriate given the level of investment we have made in the product and obviously our costs. We don\u2019t expect to be market leading in our price increase, right? We want to be conservative here and make sure that we are thinking about our long-term relationships with our clients. But based on what we were able to do in terms of getting realization from 4% this year, we feel pretty confident that we can get a bit of an uplift going into 2023 with price. Linda Huber : And Faiza, please note that Phil has said before, none of that made its way to his desk in the past year. So we think that price increase went pretty well. It\u2019s been reported in the media that some of those in the competitor space maybe pricing considerably higher. We don\u2019t intend to go all the way up to that, but we do expect that we could do a good bit better than we have been able to do in 2022, because we do have market-leading products. So we are quite optimistic about that for FY \u201823. Phil Snow : I\u2019d also add on that in terms of price realization, we have been able to -- well, I really simplify our rate card and go-to-market and I think capture price for new sales much more than we had in the past. So that\u2019s really helped us in terms of how we execute and the sales force has done a tremendous job in taking a much more simplified set of packages to market. And it\u2019s made the client\u2019s lives easier, it\u2019s made our lives easier, it\u2019s really helped all around. So that\u2019s part of what we think about when we think about price as well. Faiza Alwy : Great. Thank you so much. Phil Snow : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Please standby for next question. Our next question comes from the line of Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Owen Lau : Yeah. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Phil Snow : Yes. Hi, Owen. Owen Lau : Hey. So on the stock-based comp, I think, three months ago, we were still talking about the downturn playbook and I think FactSet can adjust the comp accrual to control the expense. I am just wondering, given the current market conditions, are you not winding up that downturn playbook anymore, have you changed any of your view in terms of giving stock-based comp going forward, any more color would be very helpful? Thanks. Linda Huber : Sure, Owen. We are prepared for the downturn playbook if we need to bring that into action. Right now we don\u2019t see any need to do that. Things are holding up very well. Sales are very strong. And as Phil said, this is a high recurring revenue business. So we have pretty good idea of what revenue will look like for the first half of next year because we have already got the ASV in-house. So that\u2019s really, really good. So the numbers are for the course of the year. Last year, we found that we did $89 million in bonus and this year it was more like $111 million, $112 million. So that was a pretty high change given the performance of the company and that\u2019s all formulaic. So as we go back into FY 2023, that bonus pool will reset to roughly $90 million. So that\u2019s the first step. And then if for some reason we underperform, that bonus pool will adjust as well and will go back down, but this was a very strong year. Similarly, last year, we paid out $45 million in stock-based compensation. This year, we paid out $56 million in stock-based compensation. So the reset on that will be closer to the $56 million number, but again the bonus pool can flex and adjust. Our salary line, in fact, because we had slower hiring than we expected, was not up very much. So it\u2019s important that investors understand most of this comes from the flexible nature of the bonus pool increasing. So, in fact, in FY 2021, the salary line was $4.96 and in 2022, it was $5.07 [ph]. That\u2019s only a 2% increase. So we are keeping a very good handle on the salary line. Most of this flex has been in the bonus line, because we had a very strong year, as we talked about in the third quarter. In fact, we are pretty surprised with the reaction because we had signaled that this would be coming. So hope that\u2019s helpful to you and hope that answers your question. Phil Snow : Just probably reiterate something I said in my opening remarks, which is the numbers that Linda just mentioned have allowed us to go broader and deeper in the organization in terms of the number of employees that are participating in the bonus and equity pools, which is really great that we are able to do that, and obviously, has very good consequences for us in terms of talent retention moving forward. Owen Lau : Got it. That\u2019s super helpful. And then something related to that line, which is the adjusted EPS growth, expectation for 2023 it\u2019s 8% to 11%, which is slightly lower than your medium-term target of 11% to 13%. I know last year was strong, but given the market conditions, do you expect you can still meet your medium-term guidance over the next two year to three years or do you expect your EPS growth will run below that for -- in the near-term? Thank you. Linda Huber : Owen, it\u2019s Linda. I do think we are going to be able to meet that EPS growth expansion and one of the things to consider here -- actually, two things to consider. One is the tax rate, so we are guiding to 12.5% to 13.5% next year. Our history has been that we have had one-off items that have been flattering to our tax rate, so we may find ourselves in that situation again. Secondly, we can\u2019t predict what option exercise will be, which is beneficial to our tax rate as well and brings it down, so that one is hard to predict also. So the tax rate might be something that could be helpful to EPS. Thirdly, we have not modeled in any share repurchase for 2023. We thought that was the conservative thing to do. We are hoping to be able to go back into the share repurchase market once we bring our leverage down to where we need it to be, which is 2 times to 2.5 times gross leverage for the company and we are pretty close to that already. We have gone from 3.9 times to 3.5 times to 3.1 times at the end of our fourth quarter. So if that happens, share repurchase will be pushed more towards the back half of the year and it won\u2019t help us that much, but it would be some wind at our backs. So those are some of the various factors, and of course, if we do better on the margin line that will come down into EPS as well. So just some things to consider as puts and takes on the EPS outlook. Owen Lau : Thank you for the explanation. Thanks, Linda. Linda Huber : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. Linda, maybe just to ask another way, the 9% growth -- organic growth that you are talking about for the year, is that much different if you look at either the sell-side or buy-side ASV? Just trying to put it in context, it sounds like you guys don\u2019t see any need to go to the downturn playbook contrary to what the market is telling us. Phil Snow : Hey, Manav. It\u2019s Phil. Yeah. So we see strength in both the pipeline for the buy-side and the sell-side. So based on what we can see today, I think, our 9% buildup is a very healthy combination of different firm types and beyond those -- beyond the larger asset managers and banks, we obviously have some other firm types now that are smaller in terms of our base but are growing much more quickly. Manav Patnaik : Okay. And then the comments around not including CUSIP in the organic growth, I just want to clarify that. So in the second half of the year, I guess, of your fiscal year, it will be part of organic and so does that then -- if it\u2019s growing mid- to high-single digits, does that then drag down that number ultimately for the year? Linda Huber : Manav, that\u2019s correct. So we are looking about 9% growth for next year and you are correct that CUSIP does average down that growth a little bit. We factored that in for the full course of the year. We will be bringing CUSIP online a year after it has closed and so we will be talking more about that as we get there. But the 9% number looks pretty good, CUSIP may bring it down a couple of basis points, but we are only going to be including that in the back half of the year, as you noted. Manav Patnaik : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open. Alex Kramm : Yeah. Thanks. Hello, everyone. Starting with a couple of questions on margins, I think, they are related. But, obviously, when people saw the margin in the third quarter, some folks got ahead of themselves messaging or not from your end. But should the message really be, if we look over the next few years, that if you commit to 50 basis points to 75 basis points margin expansion per year, that\u2019s what you are going to be delivering, because obviously, you do it this year or next year. And if there\u2019s any upside, you will spend it away for growth, I guess, the question is, on the -- A, is that right, and then, two, is it also on the downside, you would still commit to that 50 basis points to 75 basis points over the course of the next few years? So really that\u2019s how we should read it. And then, secondarily, can you just make a quick comment on seasonality in margin for 2023, obviously, there\u2019s been a lot of movement in 2022, so just people don\u2019t get ahead of themselves? Linda Huber : Yeah. Thank you very much, Alex. I think you expressed it really very well. If we are guiding to 50 basis points to 75 basis points of margin expansion on average over the next couple of years to exit at 35% or so adjusted operating margin in 2025, that\u2019s what we are going to do. This growth in the topline doesn\u2019t come for free. We have invested to be able to make sure that we keep that topline growing despite the market conditions. And we feel we over delivered in 2022. We had said 50 basis points to 75 basis points. We put up 140 basis points. Our midpoint in the guidance for next year is 60 basis points. We may have that wrong. We may get 110 basis points. It\u2019s very hard to tell. There are a lot of things moving around right now. Currency movements are the most dramatic and volatile they have been in 40 years. The Fed action yesterday was not really expected that it would be that dramatic in terms of the tone. So we want to be a little bit cautious as we think about the margin going forward. But, yes, we will protect it on the downside, through the downturn playbook, we will make that adjustment. And on the upside, which is what we experienced in 2022, if we do better, our contract with our employees would be that we pay them higher bonuses because they performed and that will adjust the bonus line again. We will adjust back down to about $90 million as we go into 2023. So there seems to be a lot more dramatic response here than we had anticipated. But I will turn it over to Phil and let him talk a little bit more about the margin commitment. Phil Snow : Yeah. I think that\u2019s right, Linda, and just to kind of re-stress what you said at the beginning there. We are really focused on sustainable top line growth there. I think we can control our costs where needed. But our primary objective, as we stated back in 2019 is to get the top line back up to a much higher number and we have done that. We want to keep it there and we have got a long list of great ideas to invest in as well as some existing programs that continue to need feeding, as well as all of our great employees. So that\u2019s the balance at FactSet. We are a consistent performer. We feel really good about where we are right now, probably, the best we have felt in a long time in terms of our business model and our momentum. We feel like we are in a really good position to make the decisions that we have made and we feel these are the best decisions for the long term for our clients, investors and employees. Alex Kramm : Great. And sorry, on the seasonality for 2023 on margin, did you want to address that as well and I do have a follow-up. Linda Huber : Sure. Directionally, Alex, you should probably expect all of this hinges on our pacing of hiring. So all things being equal, the first quarter, it\u2019s a little hard to get all the hiring done exactly pro rata over the four quarters. So the margin might be a bit higher in the first quarter and perhaps the second quarter, and then in the back half, that hiring pace picks up. And if we have any catch-ups again on bonus next year in the fourth quarter, because we have done well, you would see the same sort of pattern occur. So, again, probably the margin trend would be a little higher earlier in the year, and perhaps, a little more muted later in the year, but it could lay out differently if the macro conditions are a little bit different as we move through the year. Alex Kramm : Okay. Great. And I will ask my real second question then. Thank you for the clarification. Just a quick one, when I look at your revenue growth targets and your ASV growth targets, I am a little bit surprised, just if I look at historical seasonality on how ASV phases in, the revenue target seems a little bit elevated. I guess what I am trying to say is, given that usually you get a lot of the ASV in the second half of the year, I am surprised how much revenue is coming through already for fiscal year 2023. So is there something different in seasonality that you are expecting, is it that confidence over -- about the pipeline here in the first half, that you actually think revenue starts off much stronger than it otherwise would? So just maybe a little bit of help on seasonality on revenues, because it seems a lot higher than historically speaking, given the ASV guidance? Thanks. Phil Snow : I will start and Linda please add on. So, yeah, we are not expecting anything dramatically different, Alex, in terms of the seasonality. We did do a really great job last year of pulling more into Q1 with some sales incentives. We have a similar program set up for this year. But I think we anticipate as usual that we would capture more than half of our ASV in the second half. I don\u2019t know, Linda, if there\u2019s anything you can do to kind of help answer this. Linda Huber : Sure. We work hand in hand, Alex, with Helen Shan, our Chief Revenue Officer, who\u2019s done an amazing job. And first quarter kickers are very helpful to getting the ASV in sooner and then we have the weight of that ASV over the course of the year, which is very, very helpful. Also, we have had very strong ASV in the back half of 2022, which converts to revenue that we can already see in the front half of 2023. So we feel pretty good about what we are seeing and we actually think that these market conditions will allow us to sit down and talk with a lot more clients about what they can do in terms of cost efficiencies, and that\u2019s where we feel that we really shine. Also, we are doing incredibly well with head-to-head competition. In terms of requests for proposals, we are doing very well and the investment in the product is paying off with a lot of wins. So looking at next year, it\u2019s hard to find what one shouldn\u2019t like about this guidance for next year, 9% topline, margin expansion and EPS growth around 10%. We think that\u2019s pretty healthy. So tax rate breaks a little bit our way. We get back to a bit more share repurchases. We feel pretty good about this guidance. So we hope that helps. Alex Kramm : Appreciate the color. Thanks guys. Linda Huber : Sure. Phil Snow : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Greg Parrish : Hey. Good morning. It\u2019s Greg Parrish on for Toni. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the recent wealth win, I don\u2019t know if you could size that at all for us, when should we expect that to be added to ASV? And then the second sort of part of it, if you could talk about the main differentiators that led to the win versus competitors, that would be helpful? Phil Snow : Hey, Greg. Yeah. I think I know the one you are referring to. So I believe that closed in August. So the impact to revenue is going to be pretty low for 2022, obviously, we will capture all of that in \u201823. It was a decent-sized win, but I would not say, it was a win that made the quarter, but it was a good multi-seven figure win and a lot -- thousands of wealth adviser desktops. So what\u2019s driving all of these wealth wins really has a lot to do with the core product itself, but also we have released something called Advisor Dashboard, which had an exceptionally strong Q4. So we had three key Advisor Dashboard wins in Q4. So this Advisor Dashboard is an add-on to kind of all of the advisers that have the regular FactSet product for wealth but just gives a lot more intelligence to the adviser in terms of how they might want to organize their actions for the day. So this is a great market for us as well. The wins at our back. We are growing it in double digits. It\u2019s becoming a meaningful part of FactSet\u2019s revenue. And it\u2019s one that we are going to continue to invest in. So Linda mentioned the RFPs. We get a lot of these. These are large decisions for these big wealth companies. So I continue -- I would expect to see a continued steady diet of these larger wins that we can execute on. It\u2019s hard to get more than a handful every year. But below that, we are doing a lot to close tons of family offices. We are beginning to close more RIAs. There\u2019s just a lot of great momentum in the space and it\u2019s a lot of what\u2019s driving our user count as well. Greg Parrish : Okay. Great. That\u2019s very helpful. And then maybe I just want to kind of ask about the broad market environment, maybe if you could like mark-to-market client appetite here, especially given the macro backdrop. I know you are expecting strength and it sounds like you are not really seeing any pressure yet, but obviously, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty out there. So how are client conversations going, are you expecting potentially maybe some deals get pushed out or is that not the case, if you can kind of just mark-to-market there? Thanks. Phil Snow : Yeah. We are seeing a little bit of, I think, extension in how long it takes to close a deal. We saw some of that in hedge funds. But honestly, a lot of our clients are going through the journey that we have been going through, which is digital transformation. These efforts are not stopping for our clients. You can\u2019t stop. You have to keep investing, I think, to transform your business in this market and we have so many picks and shovels now to help the clients in terms of being more efficient that we feel it\u2019s not a difficult thing to sit down with the C level at our clients, the heads of technology and really educate them about all the great stuff that FactSet can do. I am super excited for 2023. I think there\u2019s a premium opportunity here for FactSet to tell our story in an even newer and more exciting way for our clients in terms of the capabilities we have. We really believe that what we have done here to transform our business is market leading, the opening of the platform, the APIs that we offer our clients now that link in with their own tech stacks, all the work that we are doing with partners like asset services, that\u2019s really helping us. We have a new quant research environment where clients can come in and programmatically access FactSet. So we have been telling the story for years now, we are not just a workstation business. But all of these elements and these different ways that you can utilize our data and analytics just give us a ton of confidence that even if it\u2019s a tough environment for clients and their budgets are constrained, we are going to be at the top of their list in terms of partners they want to work with. Linda Huber : Greg, another point to note, and Phil can speak more about this, the kind of shorthand old school idea is very much based on seat count and even if seat count is somewhat reduced at some of the banks, we don\u2019t price most of what we are doing by seat count anymore. So that\u2019s kind of an old school idea and we just want to make sure that everyone understands that. We see these headlines that there\u2019s going to be some thoughtfulness regarding investment banking and so on, but the class sizes that we have seen so far haven\u2019t moved very much at all. I think what we see here is a delay in the capital market\u2019s pipeline and that will come back at some point. But the M&A deal market, as asset prices are returning back to earth, could be very much a bright spot. So this happens every 10 years or so and we don\u2019t think that the result for us is going to be particularly that dramatic, but maybe Phil might have some more to say about that. Phil Snow : Yeah. I mean just to build on what Linda said here. I mean in banking, we did more -- we closed more ASV in banking in Q4 this year than we did last year, which might surprise some of you and more for the whole year. So we have -- you have seen the growth rates. So that\u2019s held up really well. And within banking, where I think a lot of the concern comes from, from a seat count standpoint, we have really diversified what we sell to the banks now. So we have parts of FactSet that can get integrated into their CRM workflow. We are doing more on the feed side. So we are not just a one-trick pony anymore on the sell-side. There\u2019s a lot of other stuff we can sell to the banks that isn\u2019t related to just workstation. Linda Huber : And probably, lastly, as bankers might move away from the bulge bracket firms, generally they go to other places. They go to corporates, they go to PEVC, they go to hedge funds or they go more to the boutique firms. We have made really good strides with the boutique firms this year, because as those bulge bracket bankers might move on in their careers and move to other firms, they take FactSet with them, they take their preference for FactSet with them and that\u2019s a very important selling tool for us. So we have seen this happening naturally. It\u2019s a real wind at our backs. So even if bankers move around, that\u2019s not an unhappy story for us. It just kind of spreads the gospel that FactSet has the best products to more firms. So that\u2019s a space we are watching, but it\u2019s probably a little overemphasized from what we are seeing. Greg Parrish : Extremely helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. George Tong : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to go back to the margin topic, you mentioned personnel expenses, increased technology expenses contributed to the fourth quarter margin contraction and it was helpful to hear that the bonus pool reset numbers going from $110 million approximately this year to $90 million next year. So that I think helps frame that part. But how do you expect growth in investments into technology and content to evolve next year from current year levels? Phil Snow : Hey, George. It\u2019s Phil. So similar programs as we both highlighted in our opening remarks. I think, I\u2019d expect, again, a pretty even split between products and people and continuing to feed deep sector private markets, wealth, ESG. We have a couple of really cool ideas in terms of where we can invest with CUSIP Global Services in partnership with the ABA. So that\u2019s up and running. And then we also have our upturn playbooks, as well as our downturn playbook. So if things end up going better than we think, we have other investment ideas around different asset classes and workflows that were -- that we could fund as well. George Tong : Okay. Got it. Maybe turning to ASV trends, you are guiding to organic ASV plus professional services growth to decelerate to about 8% next year. CUSIP, as you mentioned, is slower growth, so as that becomes organic, it\u2019s going to weigh on the growth. What other factors may be contributing to ASV growth deceleration next year compared to this year? Phil Snow : Maybe just I will clarify something. So I think if you look at the midpoint of our guidance, which is $165 million and you divide that into the $1.84 billion that we ended the year at, that gets you closer to 9%. So the midpoint of our guidance is around 9%. I think if you then factor in CUSIP coming in like in the second half of the year, I think that\u2019s when we consider it to be organic. So I would think of it that way, George. So we don\u2019t really think of ourselves as decelerating that much, right? I think we ended the year at 9.3% or 9.4%, and the midpoint is around 8.9% or 9%. So that\u2019s how the math works on that. George Tong : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Huber with Huber Research. Your line is open. Craig Huber : Yeah. Great. Thank you. Linda, I\u2019d like to go back to the cost question again here. The way I look at these numbers, it looks to me like in the fourth quarter you had $360 million of cost, if we take out the onetime items up about $32 million sequentially or quarter-over-quarter up about 9%, 10%. I know you said that incentive comp was up about $6 million sequentially and stuff. Can you just break down or give me -- help me out here, what\u2019s the other $26 million increase in cost in the August quarter versus the May quarter, obviously, CUSIP was in both quarters fully. That\u2019s my first question, please. Linda Huber : Yeah. Sure. Most of it was technology expense and a couple of points there. We have had higher utilization of our cloud, our amortization because we are building our own software and more of it has come through. So fourth quarter technology expenses last year, just for hardware and software, this isn\u2019t all of it, but just hardware and software, was $21 million and this year it was $35 million. So that gives you some idea, that\u2019s a $14 million increase Craig of what\u2019s going on there. So as we talked about, this is pretty much all about what we did with the employees because of the bonus accrual, some more stock payments, but that\u2019s a lot less important and the technology expense as we are building more of our own software. Now that software amortization has kind of built from $10 million to $20 million and will even go to something more like $30 million just for software amortization next year. So that\u2019s something that everybody should factor in. And as we said in the script, we are taking another hard look at what we are doing with our cloud transformation and we may look again at some of the things that we do on the cloud that may be able to remain on-prem. So we are thinking about that. Kate Step, our new CTO and I are looking very carefully at that. So we want to make sure that we pace all of this accordingly. But it\u2019s -- that\u2019s the main stuff. Its compensation and technology spend. A little bit of T&E because we are able to come out of the last year\u2019s still in pandemic, last year at this time, T&E for the third -- for the fourth quarter was $3 million and for the year it\u2019s $9 million. So we would see that more as a normalized run rate going forward. So we think that that\u2019s probably most of it and just not really so much, Craig, that\u2019s going to make a huge difference here. As we think about housekeeping for next year, Craig, since I have got you on the phone, and I know that you like this, we should think about interest expense next year as about $60 million. But as we pay down that is going to be front-end loaded. So everybody should model interest expense a little bit higher. And we do have hedged 75% of our transaction exposure that has helped us a lot this year, but we cannot hedge according to GAAP translation exposure. So, for example, when you put up your bonus pool in the center of excellence kinds of currencies that we have to pay, the dollar has been moving around so much and strengthening so dramatically during the course of August. We found that, that exposure hit us by a couple of million dollars. So that\u2019s something we could do absolutely nothing about, because you can\u2019t hedge translation exposure. The rest of our hedges are working really, really well. So that would be another thing that added to costs in the fourth quarter and I think that\u2019s all we are going to say about that. For CapEx for next year, again going back to 2023, our midpoint number is probably around $68 million. We are looking to consolidate a couple of offices in Europe, where we have multiple offices from acquisitions in one country. So that\u2019s going to cost us some money and I think the CapEx number is higher because of this amortization view that I already spoke about. So that should give you a pretty good guidance for all your modeling for next year, Craig. Anything else we can do for you? Craig Huber : Yeah. I did want to ask, I mean, obviously, you sound very optimistic, as best you can in this tough environment with your pipeline here. Where are some of the weaknesses in your pipeline, if you could just talk on that end of the spectrum, if you would, please? Phil Snow : Hey, Craig. It\u2019s Phil. Yeah. So we don\u2019t get into that much detail in the pipeline. But as I mentioned earlier, we have got a very broad-based plan here to grow both our businesses and our geographies. So it\u2019s -- you can see that in this year\u2019s results in that the range of growth rates from research and advisory through to CTS was 8% to 11%, and the regions were about 8% to 12%. So we don\u2019t anticipate anything much different than that, so I think just stay tuned. Craig Huber : Great. Thank you. Phil Snow : Welcome. Thank you. Operator : Thanks. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Russell Quelch with Redburn. Your line is open. Russell Quelch : Yeah. Thanks having me on the call. I just wanted to go back to CUSIP quickly and I assume the retention rates are very resilient for this type of business. But I just wanted to know, is the pricing power higher, lower or the same as the rest of FactSet and I heard Phil spoke about the investments being made in product enhancements in this business. I was just wondering, what is the time to market for those enhancements and then will these weigh on CTS margins potentially in 2023? Phil Snow : Maybe I will speak to the investments first, and then I think Linda will have something to say on price. So, hey, Russell, so, yeah, these are new investments and we are just beginning to get these going. So they are not going to weigh heavily on margin by any means and I would not anticipate that we would be getting much of a revenue impact from them this year. Linda Huber : Yeah. Great questions that you have there, Russell. We would expect that CUSIP, we can think about pricing. Again, we don\u2019t totally control the business, we are in a transaction -- transition services agreement that can last for up to a year. That\u2019s up to March 1st. We hope to get off that sooner and there are a number of things that we need to do with CUSIP. One of those would be to look at its accounts receivable and one of the analysts was very correct in the third quarter that our days sales had gone up largely as a result of the accounts receivable from CUSIP. I am very, very pleased to note that we have reversed that trend. In fact, our days sales outstanding from the third quarter to the fourth quarter have gone from 42 days down to 37 days. We think that once we get the business completely in-house, we are going to be able to do more with that. And then we will think about pricing. But again, we run this business with the American Bankers Association, and we have to be very thoughtful and we have to think about what we are doing. So we don\u2019t see any margin implications at all, but we could do a better job of collecting our accounts receivable with the CUSIP business. So we will be looking at that and we have a plan ready to go once that comes in-house. Russell Quelch : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then just one clarification as well, the new 2023 margin guidance, does that exclude both the possible implementation of the $24 million to $36 million of the cost saves that Phil mentioned on the Q3 call, as well as the potential for higher prices that you spoke to earlier in 2023? Linda Huber : It does include higher prices for 2023, which is why we have confidence on the revenue line and we do have -- what we talked about on the third quarter call is we do have the potential for the downturn playbook if things get more difficult. Again, to reiterate that, bonuses come back down from sort of the $111 million, $113 million range back into the 90s and then if we don\u2019t perform, they can drop even below that. We have other things that are scaled to -- incentive payments are scaled to how well we do and we do think that that would provide the first cushion. The second would probably be travel and entertainment, if we do need to look at tightening things. Thirdly would probably be discretionary project spend, particularly in the technology area and we would look at that as well. So we see 2% to 3% flexibility on pricing if we need it. But this is a growth business and we are pretty excited with how things are going and the market share we have been able to take. The fact that we have invested has allowed us to build cutting edge products that are winning in the marketplace. And that\u2019s really an important thing, and we intend to keep that going. Also, our employees are doing great things and our sales team performed just out of the park in FY 2022. So those sales payments are -- had been a little bit higher, we will see what happens with those in 2023. We are rooting for the sales team to have another good year. Hope that helps. Russell Quelch : Yeah. That helps. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is open. Adam Parrington : Hi. This is Adam Parrington on for Shlomo. Let\u2019s say, I think, Linda, preemptively answered the question already on the CUSIP AR. Last one would be on the, given the strength of the U.S. dollar, why was FX benefited the company\u2019s revenue from looking at the revenue rec tables taken from reported revenue to organic? Linda Huber : Yeah. Adam, I am sorry, I answered the question that Shlomo correctly pointed out on days sales in the wrong place, that\u2019s my fault. And again, we give him full credit for noting that and he maintains his third quarter gold star for having noticed that. The issue there is\u2026 Adam Parrington : That\u2019s the one\u2026 Linda Huber : The issue is this translation exposure as we put up the reserves for our bonuses. We have a lot of employees in emerging markets and then as the dollar strengthened, that situation was one that we couldn\u2019t hedge. So that\u2019s basically what\u2019s going on there. One thing I forgot to say also regarding the bonus payments, which might have not been evident to everyone. We had some bonus payments that we owed as a result of some of the acquisitions that we have done that have performed pretty well. So that was another couple of million dollars on the bonus line for some of those acquisitions where we had agreements with some of the principals of those businesses. So, with all of that, we hope that, that explains things pretty well, and as we said, we are pretty pleased with our guidance for next year, 9% is the midpoint on the topline, that does include pricing power, which is very helpful to us, margin expansion of about on average median 60 basis points, if things break our way, that might be better. But as everyone has noted, we are conservative and will probably stay that way. Tax rate of 12.5% to 13.5%, we may find ourselves with some one-offs that are helpful to us there and we will see what happens with EPS if we are able to resume our share repurchases, those will have a marginal impact because they will be back-end loaded. So I think that\u2019s about it. I think we have covered all of our housekeeping items. And with that, I think, I will turn it back over to Phil. Phil Snow : Great. Thanks, Linda, and thank you all for all the great questions today. I am very proud of what we have accomplished this year and we are not done yet. We have great momentum heading into 2023, as we remain focused on executing on our strategy and creating long-term value for all our stakeholders. While we recognize the uncertainty in the market, FactSet has a proven 40-plus-year of history -- 40-plus-year history of successfully navigating volatility. Thanks to our business model, innovative product mix and the central role we play for our clients. Regardless of the macro environment, I am confident in our ability to drive sustainable growth given the investments we have made in our businesses. And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. In the meantime, please call Kendra Brown with additional questions. Operator, this ends today\u2019s call.

After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would like to hand the conference over to your host today, Kendra Brown, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kendra Brown : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FactSet\u2019s first fiscal quarter 2023 earnings call. Before we begin, I would like to point out that the slides we will reference during this presentation can be accessed via the webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at factset.com. The slides will be posted on our website at the conclusion of this call. A replay of today's call will be available via phone and on our website. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions from investors. To be fair to everyone, please limit yourself to one question plus one follow-up. Before we discuss our results, I encourage all listeners to review the legal notice on Slide 2, which explains the risks of forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the appendix to the presentation and in our earnings release issued earlier today. Joining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer; and Linda Huber, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the discussion over to Phil Snow. Philip Snow : Thank you, Kendra, and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I am pleased to share our first quarter results. We grew organic ASV plus Professional Services by 8.8% year-over-year achieving adjusted diluted EPS of $3.99 and an adjusted operating margin of 38.3%. These results demonstrate our continued momentum coming out of fiscal 2022 and lay a solid foundation for executing on our full year targets. Last year's Q1 ASV growth was a record for us and this quarter's performance is a strong result for what is usually our seasonally lowest revenue quarter. The biggest contributors to this quarter's growth came from banking, asset owners and private equity and venture capital clients, all of which exhibited double digit growth rates. Small and medium sized deals across client types drove ASV growth this quarter. Our investments in content and technology including deep sector private markets, APIs and analytics solutions continue to support client retention rates and expansion. It's important to acknowledge the continued uncertainty in global markets. While conditions have been supportive, we are starting to see a more challenging environment for our clients and we are closely watching for signs indicating a prolonged change in conditions. These signs could include reduced client budgets, elongated sales cycles, material layoffs, and a reduction in new firm creation. However, FactSet has a proven history of stability and growth in volatile markets and we remain confident that our strategy and ability to execute will position us well even in a choppy economic cycle. As we look ahead, we remain focused on building the leading open content and analytics platform, reinforcing our position as an anchor partner for clients, allowing us to grow our share of the addressable market. At the foundation of our strategy is our commitment to further scaling our content refinery. We continue to grow and invest in critical content. For example, within our content and technology solutions business, our cloud-based real-time solutions are gaining traction with the launch of ticker plants in Europe and Asia, and our recently announced relationship with BMLL for enhanced tick history. The connectivity of our data powers hyper-personalized solutions that puts key information and analytical tools in the hands of investment professionals, enabling them to generate alpha across all market conditions. FactSet is an essential partner for our clients as they advance their digital transformations to increase efficiency and be more competitive. These transformations are critical and clients are prioritizing investments in technology and data to drive performance, giving us further confidence in the resilient nature of our business. Turning to our performance for the quarter, we continue to see strength in ASV growth across all our regions. The Americas remains the biggest contributor with organic ASV growth of 8.5% and growth was diverse across firm types, driven primarily by higher retention in banking. Private equity and venture capital clients also drove growth with Cobalt, our leading portfolio monitoring solution, plus the workstation securing client wins. Organic ASV growth accelerated to 8.8% in EMEA marking the region's strongest Q1 in recent history and the seventh quarter of increasing LTM growth. Performance was driven by higher retention among asset managers, asset owners and banking. Asset managers also saw a higher expansion across the product portfolio, and we also continued to see healthy demand for our wealth solutions with Advisor Dashboard driving key wins. Finally, in Asia Pacific, we delivered organic ASV growth of 11.1%, driven primarily by expansion among asset managers and new business wins with asset owners. However, we also experienced headwinds in the region from macro factors including regional COVID policies, which resulted in slower decision making among clients. In summary, I'm pleased with our first quarter results. We recognize the uncertainty in the market and are closely monitoring the macro environment for any signs of weakness. As we head into the start of calendar 2023, we expect to get a clearer picture of our second half as client budgets are finalized. Using our downturn playbook as a guide, we are focused on disciplined expense management and later in the call Linda will share the actions we've proactively taken. FactSet maintains a long-term view of our strategy and we will continue investing to sustain growth. We have a healthy pipeline of opportunities and as such we are reaffirming our guidance. I'll now turn it over to Linda to discuss our first quarter performance in more detail. Linda Huber : Thanks, Phil and hello to everyone on the call. As you've seen from our press release this morning, we reported high single digit organic ASV growth and double digit year-over-year growth in revenue and adjusted diluted EPS. I'll now share more details on our first quarter performance. Consistent with our definition of organic revenues in ASV, we exclude any revenue in ASV associated with CUSIP Global Services when reporting organic related metrics for the 12 months following the acquisition date. We will, however, provide some specifics on CGS, so you can continue to understand its performance as part of FactSet. Beginning March 1, 2023, the first anniversary of the CGS acquisition, it will be included in our organic results as a component of our CGS business. As Kendra noted, a reconciliation of our adjusted metrics to comparable GAAP figures is included at the end of our press release. We grew organic ASV plus Professional Services by 8.8%. As Phil stated earlier, this is a strong start to our fiscal year as compared to our typically lower revenue first quarter. Our performance reflects increased demand for our content and solutions, higher retention and continued expansion. We saw strength in the workstation for banking, key client wins with our Enterprise solutions and our subscription-based ASV continued to support value-based pricing. GAAP revenue increased by 18.9% to $505 million for the first quarter. Organic revenue, which excludes any impact from foreign exchange and acquisitions, increased 8.3% to $460 million. Growth was driven primarily by CGS and our Analytics & Trading and Research & Advisory solutions. All regions saw notable growth. From our geographic segments on an organic basis revenue growth for the Americas was at 7.6%. EMEA grew at 7.2% and Asia Pacific came in at 14.9%. All regions primarily benefited from increases in Analytics & Trading and Research & Advisory solutions. GAAP operating expenses grew 10% in the first quarter to $333 million. Let me now review our expenses based on our primary cost buckets. Starting with people, our expenses grew 4% year-over-year, primarily due to increased salary expenses for existing employees and higher stock based compensation expense. As a percentage of revenue this was 572 basis points lower year-over-year, demonstrating our continued focus on achieving a sustainable balance of investment in our talent and productivity. Next, real estate costs decreased by 21% year-over-year, driven by the right-sizing exercise we performed in fiscal 2022. As a percentage of revenue this was 181 basis points lower year-over-year. Third, technology expenses increased this quarter by 11%, driven by increased cloud spending. As a percentage of revenue growth was 51 basis points lower year-over-year. And finally third party direct content costs decreased by more than 12% year-over-year, driven by our continued focus on financial discipline and data governance. As a percentage of revenue growth was 156 basis points lower year-over-year. While this is a good result for the first quarter, we expect the annual rate to grow at 5% to 6% in line with the outlook we gave at our April 2022 Investor Day. Compared to the previous year, our GAAP operating margin increased by 517 basis points to 34.1% and our adjusted operating margin increased by 471 basis points to 38.3%. Improvement was driven by higher revenue, lower personnel costs as compared to revenue and lower content and real estate costs. These expenses were offset by higher technology expenses and costs related to the integration of CGS. Regarding our first quarter margin, I want to remind everyone that our first quarter margins tend to be seasonally higher than in subsequent quarters. While we've had a strong first quarter margin performance on both a GAAP and adjusted operating basis, we remain committed to balancing investment in our business with returning value to shareholders. As such, we continue to anticipate 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion for the full fiscal year 2023. Further, we expect our fiscal 2023 adjusted operating margin to be between 34 and 35%. This means we anticipate that margins will likely be lower in the subsequent quarters of fiscal 2023. You'll find an expense block from revenue to adjusted operating income in the appendix of today's earnings presentation. As a percentage of revenue, our cost of sales was 380 basis points lower than last year on a GAAP basis and 450 basis points lower on an adjusted basis. On a GAAP basis, SG&A was 140 basis points lower year-over-year as a percentage of revenues and 20 basis points lower on an adjusted basis. Moving on, our tax rate for the quarter was 13.4% compared to last year's rate of 10.2%. Our higher rates primarily due to higher pre-tax income and an increase in the UK statutory tax rate from 19% to 25%, which will continue for the foreseeable future. GAAP EPS increased 26.2% to $3.52 this quarter versus $2.79 in the prior year. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 22.8% to $3.99. Both EPS figures were driven by higher revenue and margin expansion and were partially offset by increased interest expense and a higher tax rate. As noted in our press release, adjusted EBITDA increased to $200 million, up 38.2% from the same period in fiscal 2022. And finally, free cash flow, which we defined as cash generated from operations less capital spending, was about $89 million for the quarter, an increase of 37.8% over the same period last year. This was due to higher net income, partially offset by increased capitalization costs related to internal use software. Before moving on, I want to provide additional financial housekeeping items to help with modeling. First CGS continued to perform well, adding $3 million in incremental ASV for the quarter. We expect it to grow in the mid-to-high single digits. As a reminder, we will update guidance next quarter to include CGS. Once it is included as part of our organic results, we will no longer report on CGS separately. Next, interest expense for the quarter was $16 million. For the full year, we expect to end fiscal 2023 with interest expense of about $66 million. As a reminder, we paused share repurchases to prioritize debt repayment following the CGS acquisition. As such, no additional shares have been purchased since the first quarter of 2022. As of the end of November, 2022, our weighted average diluted share count was 39 million shares. Moving on to the bonus accrual, given our performance so far, we expect the bonus pool for fiscal 2023 to be about $100 million. Our operating income benefited from the strength of the U.S. dollar versus major currencies we hedge. However, we expect exchange rates to be volatile throughout the year, so the impact will fluctuate. As a reminder, 95% of our revenue and most of our expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. Next, we ended the fiscal quarter with capital expenditures of about $18 million up $9 million from the prior year period. This was driven by increases in capitalization as well as technology expenditures. As we discussed on our last earnings call, we expect an increase in CapEx this fiscal year to be about $68 million at the midpoint as we move to our hybrid cloud strategy, increased focus on capitalization and consolidate our offices in Paris as part of our real estate strategy. And finally, we expect our dividend program to continue delivering value to shareholders. Fiscal 2022 March 23 consecutive years of growth and we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.89 on December 15. Our ASV retention for the first quarter remained greater than 95%. We grew the total number of clients by 13% compared to the prior year, driven by corporate wealth and private equity and venture capital clients. Our client retention remains at 92% year-over-year reflecting the stickiness of our Content and Digital platform. Turning now to our balance sheet, we continue to pay down the term loan related to the acquisition of CGS. In the first fiscal quarter, we made another planned prepayment of 125 million, bringing our gross leverage ratio down to 2.7 times from the initial 3.9 times level when we financed the CGS acquisition. Following our next planned prepayment of $125 million in the second fiscal quarter, we expect to be within our target leverage ratio of 2 to 2.5 times. The strength of our net income and adjusted EBITDA has allowed us to move faster than expected to reach this target. As a reminder, while we may make minor share repurchases to offset the dilutive impact of stock option grants during this time, we do not intend to resume our share repurchase program until at least the third fiscal quarter. Next, I'd like to discuss our downturn playbook. As Phil mentioned, we are still experiencing supported [ph] end markets and FactSet has historically fared well during periods of volatility. Should anything change, our downturn playbook gives us levers to reduce our operating expenses by 2% to 3% or $24 million to $36 million. Given market uncertainty, we have proactively implemented parts of our downturn playbook to protect margins and prioritize investment. Actions taken to date include limiting travel to client engagements and essential business needs, revisiting our real estate footprint and focusing on the continued reduction of third party content costs. In addition, we are also monitoring our open positions to ensure focus on roles that are essential to our business. Finally, we've restructured our cloud budget as part of our hybrid cloud strategy, which will use both cloud and on-premise computing to run our core platforms. This change will save more than $20 million over the next five years, including $7 million this fiscal year. In closing, we are confident in our ability to navigate the changing market conditions. While it's still early in the fiscal year, we have confidence in our pipeline as we look ahead and as stated before, we are reaffirming our guidance for 2023. With that, we're now ready for your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. Good morning. Linda, you gave us kind of the, what to expect from margins. I guess looking forward, I was just wondering, was there, is there any cadence for ASV throughout the year based on what you see in the pipeline or is there any seasonality to pricing perhaps that we should keep in mind? Linda Huber : Sure, Manav. Let me talk a little bit about margin and our expectations and then I'll let Phil go back on ASV and pricing, if that's okay. So to set the stage on margin for the first quarter, we had 570 basis points of margin expansion on, excuse me, 470 basis points of margin expansion as compared to last year, and about half of that has come from CUSIP. In looking forward, as we get past March 1st we will have lapsed CUSIP, so we won't have that additive margin increase from CUSIP. The rest of the margin increase came from the organic business which is great, and it is performing well. If we look at our cost buckets Manav, a couple of things that we note here. Our third party data costs are doing very nicely and in fact have moved down. Our real estate costs have moved down as well. Our tech costs are up, but we've had a good re-planning of our cloud strategy, which will result in $7 million of savings this year. So the big bucket to watch here is our people expenses. So we've got to keep a close eye on headcount and on compensation. So we will look forward to staying within our adjusted operating margin guidance of 34% to 35% for the year. But as we said in the script, we expect that margins might be lower for the next three quarters of this year, than they've been for the first quarter. So I hope that answers the margin question. Sorry to go a bit backward, but Phil can now handle ASV and price. Philip Snow : Great. Hey Manav, thanks for the question. Yes, so for the rest of the year at least what we're looking at today, we're still looking more positive for Q2 and Q3 and Q4 than we were this time last year. Some of that is definitely supported by price. As we, as I indicated on the last call we said we were going to go out at more than a 4% price increase and conversations are going well with clients. Clearly they're all going through their own introspection about trying to figure out what's happening in the markets and budgets and I believe are getting finalized now. So we'll have more visibility, but it's hard to argue, frankly, with the amount of investment FactSet has put into our platform over the last few years. So we've got great relationships with clients. Conversations are going well. We do believe that we'll be successful in executing on the price increase. And there's a lot going on in the markets right now. I'm cautiously optimistic. Our strategy is a good one and we'll get more information, particularly as we head into January in terms of what the rest of the year looks like. We have better visibility on Q2 and Q3 and as you know, Q4 is such a big quarter for us. We need a bit more information in terms of how that's going to play out. Manav Patnaik : SICOM: Philip Snow : Sure, yes. So the sell side continues to accelerate. That may surprise some of you, but we're really healthy there. So we're not as exposed to capital markets as some other companies. And most of our users, as you know, are in investment banking. And in the conversations I've been having, it doesn't feel like the banks are laying off massive amounts of staff in investment banking. Maybe they're hoping for a soft landing here and within like the next six months or so, M&A activity will pick up. But I'm, again, I'm optimistic there that we'll be able to hang in particularly in that part of the banks. And as you pointed out, we've begun to diversify our solutions for the sell side. So I just took a look at this for the next six months, and it looks like we have a very good CTS pipeline on the sell side. So we're now going in and being able to take out the value that we create and integrate it into client systems for their back and middle offices. And this is a theme I would say across most client types is that the data that our clients want to see, they want to see consistency, right, in terms of the workstations they're using, whatever interfaces and the data that's going through the systems, and we're beginning to benefit from that particularly on the sell side. Manav Patnaik : Got it. Thank you. Philip Snow : Yes. Operator : Thank you and one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Toni Kaplan : Thanks so much. I also wanted to ask one on sell side really, really strong over the last six quarters, and I know last quarter you had called out upsell, and so I wanted to see if there were any sort of solutions that were particularly in demand. I know you just called out the CTS pipeline, but just anything that is just different now that you're able to upsell to sell side versus historically or things that they're demanding more than normal? Philip Snow : Most of it seats Toni. So I think what you're seeing there is the investment that we've made in deep sector and private markets. So those new or newer content sets for FactSet that are getting expanded out are allowing us to get into maybe different parts of the bank, more users than we might have historically and just give us a good competitive advantage. So that's really helping with renewals and it's helping us gain new users of the banks. Toni Kaplan : Yep. Okay, great. And, and Phil, you mentioned a couple times the uncertain environment and starting to see this more challenging environment for clients. Is it the hiring that's sort of driving your comments there or is it this like slower to pull the trigger slower sales cycle? I guess what are the things that are really going on there? Philip Snow : Yes, a bit of both. So we're going to I imagine see less hiring on the buy side. We're also within institutional asset management, I should say, and for the larger transformations clients are going through, we're not, we're not seeing a lot of this yet, but I imagine that some of them may be deciding to pause some of these transformations that they're going to go through. I don't think it's negotiable with them. They have to go through these transformations, so we're confident that the solutions we're providing are the right ones. But it could be as they're trying to figure out their own futures they may be pausing on some of these larger deals. Toni Kaplan : Very helpful, thank you. Operator : Thank you and one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is open, please go ahead. Andrew Nicholas : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I first wanted to just follow up on Toni's question and just ask if you're seeing any difference in terms of kind of end market health on a regional basis. There was obviously some disparate growth between the different regions, but just curious if your comments are pretty uniform across geographies or if there's anything to call out on a region by region basis? Philip Snow : I think they're pretty uniform Andrew. Europe did have an exceptionally strong quarter this quarter, but as I look out into the next six months, there are different puts and takes there by region. Asia looks a little bit stronger frankly, for the next six months maybe than the Americas and EMEA, but I wouldn't say that there's any one region that's dramatically different than others. In terms of where we might see more effects from recession, I would imagine that Europe just generally might get hit harder than other regions. But we haven't, we don't see a lot of impact from that yet. Andrew Nicholas : Got it. Thank you. And then for my follow up, I wanted to ask about the digital strategy, if, you know I know you hired a new CTO, Kate Stepp half the year ago, wondering if there are any major takeaways from her involvement with the strategy. Sounds like you're restructuring the cloud budget and that's going to result in some cost savings. Any more color on what's happening under the hood there that would be great. Thank you. Philip Snow : Linda's been spending a lot of time with Kate. Linda Huber : Yes. First of all, Andrew, Kate has been with the company for quite a number of years, so she has changed position, but she's not a new hire. What we did was we sat down and we looked at the cloud budget and we concluded that not everything needs to be on the cloud. So we have kicked up our CapEx, as I said in the housekeeping and we are looking to move a few items back into data centers. We've had to buy some new servers, things like that. But we think the long-term balance for the company is better with some on-premises computing core capability as well as cloud capability. So we've rebalanced that over the next five years we'll save $20 million. With that change, we'll save $7 million this year, which is very helpful. But again, it's just a rebalancing of what we're doing with the cloud versus on-premise computing. And Kate has been very helpful as we've thought through what we want to do with the technology budget. So hope that helps you. Andrew Nicholas : Yes, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you, and one moment for our next question and our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is John filling for Ashish. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just quickly on the people cost, it seems like head count is up around 7% over the last 12 months, really focusing Content & Analytics, Trading & Sales, could you maybe talk about any potential benefits you're seeing on just hiring technology talent as well as just the people bucket as a whole? Thanks, Philip Snow : Yes, I'll start and I'm sure Linda will have some comments. So this is a great market for talent, frankly and we've been very successful at hiring who we wanted to hire over the last few months and attrition has come down. So Linda and I am watching this day to day. We want to be careful that we're not running hot here, but it -- but we do have an opportunity here to continue to upgrade our talent and lean in and continue to invest. So we're hopeful, right, that we don't have to kind of slam on the brakes too hard here from a talent standpoint. But as we've done in previous cycles, if you're able to keep investing and not go through too much pain on the people side, it definitely helps you in the long run. Linda Huber : Yes, as Phil said John, we're watching headcount day by day. It's very important that we get that right and not run too hot. As Phil said, our attrition has come down very nicely. Some of that is the result of the market being a little bit more employer friendly and some of the moves we made in our compensation last year to make sure that we're rewarding our people and our high performers appropriately. So we got that right. You're right, we have increased headcount quarter-over-quarter for the first quarter. About 65% of that headcount is in centers of excellence, so our lower cost locations. And we've been very careful about bringing on that headcount largely to support our deep sector effort, which we've talked about before, to help with the sales effort and to assist with analytics and trading. So, so far so good, but the trends are attrition down and hiring has to be sized accordingly to make sure we don't get out over our skis. But we are seeing a much healthier retention picture than we did at this time last year which is a really nice thing. So hope that gives you a bit more clarity. Unidentified Analyst : Yes, that's great color, thank you. And maybe quickly, could you just talk about the wealth pipeline and maybe if there's been any change in tone around client conversations as well as the sales cycle? Philip Snow : Yes, the wealth pipeline continues to be healthy. We have a good mix of larger deals that we continue to work. And now in terms of markets, that's one of the markets where we just feel like in the long run we've got just such a great opportunity and more tailwinds. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you, and one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Alex Kramm : Yes, hey. Hello everyone. Just coming back to what you're seeing in different client segments or regional, can you also expand your comments on the pricing side, is it pretty uniform? Any sort of pushback you're getting? One of the things that we've heard, for example, is in Europe with all the FX changes year-over-year asking them for more in dollar terms, when the currency has devalued so much over the last year is increasingly harder. So just curious if there's anything you would call on, on pricing by customer set or region? Thanks. Philip Snow : Yes, nothing I'd call out yet, Alex. So similar to last year, not a lot of conversations have reached my desk, which is a good sign in terms of how the conversations are going. And as I've said it's very hard for clients to argue with the value that FactSet has put into the product. So my sense is that clients are understanding this. Everyone is seeing it everywhere in terms of inflation and we're coming in, I believe, at a very moderate place relative to what clients may be seeing from other providers, which gives us a great opportunity to capture more market share. We've certainly gotten some inbound opportunities as a result of that for sure. Alex Kramm : Oh, that's helpful, thank you. And then maybe just one follow up on the wealth side, and this may be too much in the weeds, but you called out in your press release Model Center launch, which I think was at the beginning of November. Sounds to me like when I look at what you're describing here, that this is something very much like a shelf, like something like an investment does -- has for example. So my question is a, can you talk about the revenue model in that business? Again, it's obviously very early days, but then is this a sign of you really expanding the scope of the workflows you want to order -- offer the wealth segment versus just obviously repurposing facts at terminal or other services to wealth, but really getting deeper into that end market? And then maybe talk about some of the things you envision yourself doing that you're not doing today. Philip Snow : Yes, it is absolutely a sign of that Alex and consistent across the other firm types that we're servicing. So FactSet is continuing to push beyond being just a workstation company. We've gone way beyond that already. But we're giving a lot of thought to within each client type what adjacencies can we get into and as we open up the platform and work with other partners, what more can we do for clients? Wealth, wealth is a relatively newer firm type for us, so there's a lot more, I think, room for us to expand than some other firm types where we're more well established. That's probably a good follow-up with Kendra later in terms of the detail on the Model. There's probably a little too much detail for this call and if you want to have a follow-up with our wealth team, I\u2019m sure they\u2019d be very happy to talk to you about what they\u2019re doing there. Alex Kramm : All right, sounds good. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. You noticed that clients are pausing on larger deals. Are there any large deals coming up for renewal this fiscal year or any competitive large RFPs that you\u2019re involved in? Philip Snow : There are, I mean, hey George, thanks for the question. There are deals like that every year. So I think this year and Kendra can or Linda can get into this later if we need to. But I believe there are less large renewals this year than we might have seen in previous years. So there are definitely a couple. And there are a couple of very interesting deals that we\u2019re working on that are larger in Q2 and Q3 and Q4 for this year, some sell-side related, some partner deals. George Tong : Got it. And secondly, you mentioned you\u2019re seeing longer sales cycles, a little bit slower hiring. Can you talk a bit about what you\u2019re seeing with overall client enterprise budgets, the direction that those are moving in? Philip Snow : Yes. So I said these are things that we\u2019re watching out for. We\u2019re not seeing a lot of them yet, right? So there are indications that it may be happening. And again, we\u2019re -- I don\u2019t know if you saw that Financial Times article, which was a good one, that came out a few weeks ago, but it was an article I think it was idle asset managers pull a money into technology platforms and really speaks to the investment that a lot of the -- a lot of asset managers are having to make to be competitive. And this plays really well into FactSet\u2019s hands in terms of all the work that we\u2019ve done on the PLC, all the work we\u2019ve done to open the platform, all the work that we\u2019re doing with partners in the space, some of which we\u2019ve been public about, some of which we haven\u2019t. So these transformations are not going to stop. Then clients are not going to completely cancel these. It\u2019s just a question of the pace at which they go. But overall, I\u2019m very optimistic about our position in the marketplace for these deals and our ability to execute. George Tong : Great, very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you and one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Craig Huber with Huber Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Craig Huber : Yes, good morning. First question, can you just comment some more on the marketplace, the traditional buy-side out there? Just talk a little more specifically about the pressure points maybe that might be building there for the longer potential sales cycles? Just what\u2019s going on with that traditional part of your legacy business? I\u2019ll start there. Philip Snow : Yes. So overall, it\u2019s pretty healthy, Craig. So we -- there\u2019s less hiring than there was last year, but I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s down significantly. The buy-side number that you see in our press release has a lot of components to it. So maybe it\u2019s helpful to sort of go through that so everyone understands what we\u2019re looking at. The two firm types where we\u2019re seeing the most headwinds now and less revenue than last year are corporates. So we did add a number of corporates this year. They make up a good part of the new firm creation for the quarter, but it\u2019s a lot less than it was in the prior year. And we had a really lumpy quarter with partners. So that\u2019s some of what -- that\u2019s what\u2019s in the buy-side number that you\u2019re seeing. Above that, I would say that institutional asset management, hedge funds and wealth are all kind of a little bit less than last year or on par with last year in terms of what we\u2019re seeing in the environment. And on the plus side, asset owners are doing exceptionally well. So asset owners typically have a much longer view, and we\u2019re crushing it in asset owners versus last year. That\u2019s very encouraging in terms of the work that we\u2019re doing there on the PLC and working with partners. And we\u2019re seeing great adoption of multi-asset class solutions from the asset owners, and we\u2019re seeing positive signs on the fixed income side. So -- but hopefully, that\u2019s helpful in terms of thinking about the overall buy-side number that we give you. Craig Huber : Okay. And then, Linda, if I could ask on the cost side of things, I\u2019m scratching my head a little bit here. Your fiscal fourth quarter costs were meaningfully higher than the third quarter costs or the quarter. You guys just finished here by roughly $30 million if you take out the various onetime items and stuff. I know you\u2019ve called out last time we spoke on this at about, say an extra $6 million or so was incentive compensation in August quarter versus the May quarter, but then the total cost here in the November quarter in a good way fell back down to the May levels and stuff from last year and stuff. The lumpiness here of the cost, maybe you could just talk about that, maybe just a little more specific about how we should think model out the costs for the rest of the year versus this lower number in the first quarter? Thank you. Linda Huber : Yes. Thanks for that, Craig. And your observations are correct. In the fourth quarter, we really worked hard to ensure that we had compensation right. So you saw a couple of things. You saw a merit pool, which was stronger than usual to deal with inflationary adjustments in a number of countries and the U.S. You also saw bonuses, which were quite fulsome because we had a very strong FY 2022. And then you saw that we also worked harder on equity, and equity-based compensation moved up as well in FY 2022. So the goal there while we were running strong, was to make sure we had a compensation picture correct for our employees coming off the great resignation. So as we move forward into this year, we\u2019re watching our costs very carefully. The entire situation has shifted, Craig, to one of conservatism around costs. I talked about our three buckets that are going well and are nicely controlled. I think the place where we watch here very closely is our people bucket, which includes both headcount and compensation costs. So we\u2019re watching those very, very carefully, as Phil said. A couple of things to notice on the revenue side for the first quarter. Last year, we had a record ASV level in Q1 that was about $17 million. This year, we\u2019re running at about half of that. So the timing change matters to us in terms of how the revenue comes through later in the year. So that makes my job just that much more exciting to make sure that we\u2019re managing correctly for the margin. So we\u2019re doing that. The other thing, Craig, to take a look at is the dollar had been very strong. Recently, the dollar has been retracing about one-third of that strength. So we have to be careful on the impacts of the later ASV, on timing and the conversion to revenue. And then we also have to be careful on what\u2019s happening with FX, which has been unusually bouncy as we have moved through the last couple of quarters. So hope that helps, but we\u2019ve got an eagle eye on those cost buckets and we did pretty nicely managing them in the first quarter. I\u2019m happy to have the 38.3% margin in the bank, and that will help us as we move through the rest of the year. So prudence is the name of the game here. Hope that helps. Craig Huber : Yes that's good. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please\u2026 Faiza Alwy : Yes, hi. Good morning. So I wanted to ask about the competitive environment. Over the last several years, my perception is that you\u2019ve gained share as some of your competitors have been busy integrating deals, and you\u2019ve been investing. But it looks like there\u2019s now, new products that they\u2019re rolling out. So I\u2019m curious as we head into a potentially more challenging environment, how would you characterize your competitive positioning across your various products? Philip Snow : Hi Faiza, thanks for the question. I\u2019d characterize it as being exceptionally strong. If you just start with the FactSet workstation, all of the investments we\u2019ve made in content are in there as well as we\u2019ve really upgraded a lot of the applications that our clients use in terms of ease of use, searchability, alerting clients. So you see that reflected, frankly, in our workstation numbers across a number of firm types, and that\u2019s grown significantly over the last five years. On the analytics front, we continue to do great things with the portfolio life cycle and work with asset servicers and other partners in the space to go in and really be the core of -- or anchor partner for our clients in terms of what they want to achieve from the back, middle to front offices. So that -- there\u2019s a lot of runway for that, frankly. The market is looking for accretive solutions. They\u2019re looking for companies that are ahead in terms of technology and innovation, and FactSet checks all those boxes. And on the CTS front, we\u2019ve done a lot to expand that product suite. One of the things we\u2019re very excited about is real time. That\u2019s a pretty small piece of CTS today, but there\u2019s billions of dollars of market share out there on the real-time space. You might have seen that we made a recent investment in BMLL, which is a very good tick history product, which you need to do -- you need to complement real time. So this is an area of great opportunities. So there\u2019s just more and more ways we can help our clients. And the investment we\u2019ve made over the last three years and continue to invest really put us in good stead. And I\u2019d be remiss not to sort of mention the FactSet relationships that we have with our clients. Many of our clients are trusted partners. They\u2019ve been with us for a long time. And this is the type of environment, frankly, where they need help. And we\u2019ve been there for them in the past, and we\u2019ll be there for them in the future. So I feel as good, frankly, is about our competitive position as I have in almost my entire 10-year at FactSet. Faiza Alwy : Great, thanks for that. And then just as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about capital allocation and the interest expense guide that you provided, Linda. Just want to confirm, are you assuming sort of no further debt pay down? Because I think you raised the interest expense guide, and I understand that rates are a little bit higher, but I feel like you\u2019ve also been paying down debt, so I just wanted to clarify sort of any assumptions behind that guide? Linda Huber : Yes. Faiza, I think we've mentioned this a bit in the script. So let\u2019s talk about our leverage levels and go back and think about that. So when we purchased CUSIP, our gross leverage level went up to 3.9 times. We\u2019ve made a number of pay downs of $125 million basically per quarter. Now our gross leverage ratio is 2.7 times. We\u2019re looking to get back within what would be considered typical for our level of investment grade rating, which is 2.5 times to 2 times. So we have one more payment to make, which is what is anticipated to get inside that leverage level. And then we may not continue at the exact same pace of pay down prepayment on that term loan as we had done before. At that point, we\u2019re going to speak to the rating agencies, be clear to resume our share buybacks and we\u2019ll think about what we want to do with that. The remaining Board authorization, I want to be crystal clear here, authorization is $181 million. That doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to spend. That means that\u2019s what the authorization is, so you can note that. And we\u2019re going to think about what we want to do with this after we have those conversations. So the interest expense presumes all those things that I had mentioned. And if we do get back into the share repurchase market, please note that\u2019s going to be back-end loaded and it won\u2019t move the average share count all that much for FY 2023 as a whole. It will be helpful as we move into FY 2024. So hope that, that gives you all the detail that you need, Faiza. Faiza Alwy : Yes, thank you Linda. Operator : Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Kevin McVeigh : Great, thanks so much. I just want to circle back. On the downturn playbook you were very helpful. Of the $24 million to $36 million, can you tell us how much you\u2019ve implemented? Like is it one-third? And then the $7 million this year is obviously incremental that, Linda. Is that right? I just want to make sure -- I think you are clear, I just want to make sure I heard the comment right. Linda Huber : Yes. I think it\u2019d be good, Kevin, to think about sort of the midpoint of that amount. And I think it\u2019d be fair to say we\u2019ve probably implemented about one-third. We\u2019re taking a close look at what we want to do with T&E because, obviously, the top line is paramount here, and we\u2019ve got to get that right. So we\u2019re looking at some of the other things that we need to do mostly around people. We\u2019re being extremely cautious on new hires, as we had said and we\u2019ll see what happens with the bonus line. It\u2019s too hard -- too difficult to tell at the end of the first quarter how that will lay out. Just to be clear, the bonus line, we are expecting, as I had said in the housekeeping section, about $100 million. We have booked about 24 for the first quarter. Generally, that number is ramped up a bit as we move through the year. So maybe you go from 24 to 26 in the fourth quarter if things play out the way that they have in previous years. That\u2019s a question mark. So we\u2019ll think about what happens with that. If we don\u2019t do as well as we expect and the center point of our guidance matches what our bonus targets are, there\u2019s -- it\u2019s all very clear cut. If we come in light, perhaps our bonus line comes down by $10 million, which would save about another one-third. But it\u2019s way too early to talk about that right now. So the solution is to make sure we\u2019ve got it right in terms of the pace of hiring, keep that focus on the technology budget. And we\u2019re going to take another pass through our real estate footprint, probably as we get towards the fourth quarter. Any change we make in that real estate footprint, though, the expense saves will be something we\u2019ll see in FY 2024. For the most part, it will come in later in fiscal year 2023, so not going to be of too much help to us in that bucket. But as I said before, eagle eye on all these buckets, and we\u2019ve got to support growing the top line. Our second and third quarter pipelines look even better than last year, as Phil had said. Just want to reemphasize that. So mainly, we\u2019ve had a bit of a timing shift. So we\u2019re dealing with that and making sure we\u2019re matching the costs accordingly. So I hope that\u2019s helpful, Kevin. Kevin McVeigh : Very, very helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. I know you talked about the centers of excellence. Is there any way to think about how the kind of the current employee footprint is today and where you think that can get to over time? Philip Snow : Hi Kevin, it\u2019s Phil. So if you are talking about where the talent is located? Kevin McVeigh : Yes. Philip Snow : Yes. So the last few years have been very interesting, right, from a talent standpoint. We\u2019ve learned a lot. We\u2019ve taken the approach of having a hybrid work environment, which is why Linda is talking to you about real estate expense. So we do have more options globally. We have very good centers of excellence in India and the Philippines. Those continue to crank. But as we move forward, we want to make sure that we\u2019re -- we have the very best talent we can globally and that we\u2019re exploring all of our opportunities there. So we\u2019ve made some moves actually to make it possible for us to hire employees in more locations if we needed to and that\u2019s a piece of work that we\u2019re in the middle of right now. Kevin McVeigh : Very helpful. Thank you. Philip Snow : Yep, you\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Hans Hoffman : Hi, this is Hans Hoffman on for Stephanie. So for my first question, given you guys sort of noted sort of a more challenging environment, could you just update us on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of client cancellation trends? Philip Snow : Well, so far it\u2019s been okay and we\u2019re just being cautious as we go into the year, and clients are finalizing their budgets. You can see in the press release that we\u2019re net positive on users, and we\u2019re net positive on funds. So we\u2019re continuing to grow our business. The numbers are down from last year in terms of absolute numbers, but we\u2019re not seeing, like a lot of panic out there in the client base, and we\u2019re seeing that we\u2019re very competitive. So we\u2019re -- I want to emphasize that these are signs we\u2019re looking for. We\u2019re managing our business well, but we\u2019re \u2013 we feel really good about our ability to execute no matter what the market environment is and FactSet has a strong history of that as you well know. Hans Hoffman : Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then just for my follow-up, could you just talk a bit about where you sort of see the biggest opportunity in the sort of next stage of investment in technology and content? Philip Snow : There\u2019s a great opportunity given that we\u2019ve opened up the platform. So we\u2019ve done some press releases about partnerships we have, but really taking all of the components of FactSet and going in and being the anchor partner for the very largest firms is a big opportunity. When you look at the buy-side institutional asset management, we\u2019re doing very well in what we call our premier book. So our premier book also extends to the sell-side, but it\u2019s close to our top 100 clients. And that client base is doing actually very well on a relative basis to last year. So some of the weakness that we might see has to do more with smaller firms in the middle markets, and I think less small firms getting created or potentially some firms going out of business. But overall, within the clients that are much larger where we have a big percentage of our ASV and a big percentage of our opportunity, we\u2019re seeing very positive signs there. Linda Huber : No one has asked us about the CUSIP business to this point in the call, and I want to make sure that we\u2019re clear that we also see opportunity coming from the CUSIP business. It\u2019s not technology exactly as the last questioner had asked. But let me just point out some interesting points on CUSIP. So we\u2019re very happy with the acquisition. We\u2019re very happy with the team and we\u2019re very happy with our relationship with the American Bankers Association, which is going great. We were just down to see them a few weeks ago. So CUSIP\u2019s growth of $48 million contributed in revenue in Q1, about $42 million of that from subscriptions and the rest from the issuance business, about $6 million, which is a little bit slower, but still really good growth in the things you don\u2019t think about like municipal bond issuances and also certificates of deposits, which have grown very dramatically as interest rates continue to grow on those types of investments for individuals. o done very well with that. Overall, 7.6% growth, and we\u2019re very pleased with that. We see more growth opportunities coming from CUSIP. The retention grew about -- contributed about two-thirds of that growth and new logos, about one-third of that growth. Now we \u2013 as we\u2019ve said before, we see very good opportunities in a couple of areas : one is expanding CUSIP to the private markets; second would be expanding CUSIP to the leveraged markets; and third, potentially as different packages of the ESG, for example, carbon credits are traded, we see growth there. So CUSIP has done a really good job for us. We will lap it, as we said, the 1st of March. We come off our technical services agreement. The only blip there with CUSIP is the days sales outstanding. That has extended a bit. And as we move into the lapping on March 1, we are going to tighten up on those days sales outstanding. So hope that\u2019s helpful to everyone, our biggest acquisition to date and we\u2019re pleased with its performance. We have one more quarter where we will give you the details on CUSIP. After that it is subsumed in the CTS business, as we said. So with that, I may have front-run some of Shlomo\u2019s questions, but maybe we can move on. Operator : One moment for our next question. And our next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Thank you. Yes, Linda, you absolutely did front-run the AR DSO question. I was going to ask you about that coming back up again. But I want to shift to just a little bit. Historically, the sell-side has been a lot more volatile in downturns than the buy-side. Is there any difference in the combination or the composition of what\u2019s in the sell-side right now that would lead you to believe that the case would not be the same if we end up in some of the banks just decide not to hang on to people the same way? Is there some way that you would think that we wouldn\u2019t start to go \u2013 or start to see there be more of a drag on the growth as opposed to being a positive for the growth? Philip Snow : If there are large layoffs Shlomo, in investment banking, that certainly would affect us, but the \u2013 as I mentioned earlier, right, the CTS business, we\u2019re beginning to sell more than just workstations to the banks. So that\u2019s a very positive sign that there\u2019s other things we can sell them in terms of workflows and other departments we can go into. And again, the investment that we\u2019ve made in content for deep sector and private markets just put us in a much stronger position and potentially open up new users for us. The other thing that I haven\u2019t spoken about that\u2019s in the sell-side number is our private equity and venture capital firm type. So that\u2019s not massive, but it is growing very quickly. And over time, I expect it to be a meaningful contributor. So that is definitely something to keep an eye on. We called it out this quarter as being one of the drivers of the quarter. And as I look out into the next six months, it\u2019s private equity, venture capital firms, the sell side and asset owners that look the strongest. So I think the PEVC and the CTS piece, in particular, are just a couple of things that will be hedged if those \u2013 if big layoffs do occur in investment banking. Linda Huber : Shlomo, just a couple of things to note. The M&A pipeline is still very strong. So there might be some interest to making sure headcounts stay pretty fulsome at the investment banks. Also, some of the trimming you\u2019re seeing now, those firms have not engaged in that what would be more normal trimming through the pandemic. So it\u2019s been a couple of years since they did that, and you\u2019re seeing some of that happen. And again, there\u2019s the question of headcount versus compensation for them. So we\u2019ll see what happens next. But analyst classes look to be about the same size. The lesson learned through the pandemic is that those more junior employees are important. They have to be brought on and trained. So just a few more points there that might help you. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, thank you. And then just, I\u2019m trying to make sure I understand the tone, which sounds more conservative with some of the comments that you\u2019ve made about the strong pipelines. Is the cost actions that you took to implement some of the downturn strategy, just looking at the world around you versus what you\u2019re actually seeing happening with your pipeline and with your sales cycles, is that what\u2019s going on? Because it seems like the sales seem to be going pretty well, at least that\u2019s what the narrative sounds like. Philip Snow : Well, one is we\u2019re just taking a long-term view here to sustainable margin expansion. So Linda has I think, come in and really put in a good framework for us. Some of that is just sort of a multiyear effort to make sure that we expand our margin on a reasonable basis. Attrition has come way down because of all of the great actions we took through the year. And people expense is our biggest expense. So I think that\u2019s \u2013 the thing we\u2019re keeping an eye on the closest is just making sure that our headcount expense is moving ahead at the right pace. And yes, there\u2019s so much news out there right now about possible recession and layoffs and cost cutting. We\u2019re just \u2013 we\u2019re positioned well relative to a lot of other companies just in terms of our business model and our investment, but we just want to make sure that we\u2019re being conservative enough as we get into January when clients will be printing their budgets. We still don\u2019t have great visibility on what the budgets of our clients are going to look like. So that\u2019s the thing that I think will give us a lot more confidence in terms of the numbers that we can project. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, thank you very much. Philip Snow : Yes. Operator : Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is open Please go ahead. Keith Housum : Thank you. Good morning, Phil and Linda, I appreciate it. In terms of just trying to understand, and I guess going forward, if we do hit more of a downturn, where the risk is greatest for FactSet in terms of customers closing? I noted that PE and VC firms. If I would think we most likely would like to close, you guys are doing very healthy now. So where do you see the business risks of losing customers as we do go into this year downturn? Philip Snow : Well, I think yes, firms that are not being competitive, the smaller firms, there\u2019s risk of firm closure. Hedge funds could be one example. So for hedge funds, I\u2019d sort of put them in the medium middle of the pack here for us in terms of the next six months. The hedge funds seem to be doing okay. That\u2019s another firm type where we\u2019re doing well from a CTS standpoint. And I -- it\u2019s unusual that FactSet loses completely a large asset manager or a bank that\u2019s out there. We have some footprint. So really, for us to win -- and what we\u2019re focused on is just taking market share within those firms. So firm closure doesn\u2019t worry me so much. More of our -- but it\u2019s hard to control that, frankly. More of our focus has to be on the largest accounts that have the largest amount of opportunity for us moving forward. Keith Housum : Great. I appreciate that. And then in terms of your revenue stream, remind me \u2013 I know most of it is being reoccurring, but what portion of your revenue is nonrecurring? And how did that do in the quarter versus, I guess, obviously, recurring part? Philip Snow : It\u2019s a very small percentage of our revenue. I mean I think it\u2019s probably less than 2%. It\u2019s something we\u2019re taking a closer look at. And if that would be more helpful to break out, that\u2019s something we\u2019re certainly going to consider moving forward. I think it\u2019d have been a little down. Typically, it\u2019s going to trend with ASV, right? So -- and very much trends with the analytics business. So most of the professional services comes out of the analytics implementations. Keith Housum : Great, thank you. Good luck. Philip Snow : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our last question comes from the line of Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Owen Lau : Thank you for taking my questions. Could you please give us an update on your ESG initiatives? How should we think about the impact of your ESG initiatives to your revenue and expense this fiscal year? Thank you. Philip Snow : Hey, Owen. So FactSet\u2019s overall, our overarching ESG strategy is just to be an agnostic agent in the ecosystem for our clients. ESG is so fragmented. There\u2019s different focuses region by region globally. And we probably have the best selection of ESG in the market. And we integrate so many other providers. In fact, that adds its value in terms of concording that data so that firms that are creating their own ESG composites don\u2019t have to go through all the pain of managing the data. So building applications on top of that to provide clients their own tools to create their own view, that's primarily what we\u2019re focused on. It\u2019s not a meaningful contributor to ASV today. I think some of it probably doesn\u2019t show up directly as ASV as its own product, but there\u2019s a lot of value that we\u2019ve put into the workstation. So I believe most users that subscribe to a workstation can access whatever ESG products they\u2019re subscribing to in the market. So that\u2019s really where our primary focus is right now. Owen Lau : Got it. That\u2019s it from me. Thank you for taking my questions and happy holidays. Philip Snow : You, too. Yes. So thank you all for joining us today. We\u2019re off to a good start in fiscal 2023. While economic uncertainty persists, we are constantly talking to our clients and are really well prepared to respond to any market environment. I\u2019m confident in our ability to drive continued sustainable growth, and FactSet is a consistent performer with a proven history of successfully navigating volatility. We have a resilient business with an innovative product mix, differentiated content and diverse end markets. And we are only further strengthening our offerings as we continue to invest in our products to enhance our competitive position and the value we deliver to clients. Before wrapping up, I really want to thank all FactSetters globally for their continued high level of execution and engagement and hopefully, everyone at the firm is having fun. I know I am. I think most FactSetters are. We\u2019ve invested, and we have a great culture. So it\u2019s a good place to be right now. Please be well this holiday season. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. And in the meantime, feel free to contact Kendra Brown with any additional questions. Operator, this ends today\u2019s call. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Additionally, please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the appendix to the presentation and in our earnings release issued earlier today. Joining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer; and Linda Huber, Chief Financial Officer. We will also be joined by Helen Shan, Chief Revenue Officer for the Q&A portion of today's call. I will now turn the discussion over to Phil Snow. Philip Snow : Thank you, Kendra, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased to share our second quarter and first half results. Our Organic ASV plus professional services growth year-over-year accelerated to 9.1%, driven by a healthy expansion among existing clients and the successful execution by our sales team of our price increase in the Americas. We saw several large wins this quarter outpacing last year and allowing us to capture more of the addressable market. Our second fiscal quarter performance resulted in adjusted diluted EPS of $3.80 and an adjusted operating margin of 37%, exceeding our guidance and situating us well for the remainder of the fiscal year. Growth this quarter was the strongest amongst banking, asset owners and wealth management clients aided by larger wins across each of these client types. Acceleration was broad-based with double-digit ASV growth from our banking, corporate and private equity and venture capital clients and our investments in Content & Technology supported retention and expansion. We saw our core workstation drive follow-on opportunities for feeds and digital platforms and wealth and increased transactional revenue and demand for content from asset owners. In the first half, our end markets remained largely supportive. However, we are not immune to market volatility. As interest rates rise and macroeconomic conditions remain uncertain, we're beginning to see a more challenging environment for our clients. This includes reductions in AUM, constrained budgets and headcount rightsizing after increased pandemic hiring. We're also monitoring the recent instability across the banking sector, which accounts for 17% of our ASV. In this regard, there are several key factors to keep in mind. First, FactSet is not materially exposed to commercial banking. Second, no one single client represents more than 3% of our ASV. And finally, our multi-year enterprise contracts of our protections that includes seat minimums and longer cancellation notification windows. Given the evolving market dynamics, particularly in banking, we feel it is prudent to take a conservative view on the second half of the fiscal year. As such, we expect continued ASV growth, but with modest deceleration in the second half. We are therefore updating our guidance for fiscal 2023 to reflect organic ASV growth of $145 million to a $175 million, inclusive of CUSIP Global Services, which becomes an organic part of our business in the third quarter. At the midpoint, this is a $15 million reduction in core business ASV growth. We expect two-thirds of this reduction to come from the challenging conditions facing the banking sector and the remaining one-third is expected to come from lengthening sales cycles and constrained budgets for other firm types. This reduction in ASV will be offset by the addition of $10 million of ASV growth from CGS. Together, these changes represent 8% growth at the midpoint in line with our medium-term outlook. To preserve EPS, we will continue to drive disciplined expense management. As a result, we expect adjusted operating margin of 34% to 35%, as previously communicated. We maintain a long-term view of our business and are steadfast in our commitment to investing for growth and we will speak more about CGS and guidance later in the call. The demand for data and technology is increasing and we are a proven trusted partner for our clients for their digital transformations. In the second fiscal quarter, we remained focused on building the leading open content and analytics platform and several large deals reinforced our conviction regarding this strategy. First, within Research & Advisory, we were selected as the primary market data provider for BMO's Wealth Management division. This was a key contributor to almost 9% workstation growth year-over-year. Our ongoing investments in our digital platform and content refinery also resulted in wins across banking. The most notable was a seven-figure deal for a global bank sell-side research department, which included workstations and data feeds. Across the sell-side, we are meeting the needs of flexible integrated solutions, including feeds, APIs, CRM integrations and banker productivity tools. In Content & Technology solutions, we won a major real-time deal to provide our market data-as-a-service offering to a premier asset management client. This solution will replace its legacy on-premise infrastructure. Our ability to augment enterprise platform deployments with consistent data is accelerating growth and expanding our share of wallet for Content & Technology solutions. Finally, within Analytics & Trading, investment in our portfolio lifecycle suite has increased cross-sell opportunities with active asset managers and asset owners. Within the middle office, growth accelerated in our core analytics offering, which includes Portfolio Analytics, Quantitative Solutions, Fixed income and Reporting. We also see increased buy-side demand for outsourced performance and risk solutions, consistent with the trend toward investment firms outsourcing middle office functions. Our open platform and enterprise solutions have positioned us well to capitalize on this with several other opportunities in our pipeline. As we celebrate the first anniversary of the acquisition of CUSIP Global Services, I'd like to congratulate the team on a job well done. CGS has exceeded expectations with ASV growth of 8% since the acquisition. CGS's Core Securities Identification capabilities align well with FactSet's data management strategy. And with the integration now complete, we are focused on growth across asset classes, geographies and capabilities. We are working on expanding into loan data and private companies. For more than 50 years, CGS has provided mission-critical solutions to the front, middle and back-office. This work continues and in close partnership with The American Bankers Association we will continue to innovate. Turning to performance across our regions. Organic ASV growth in the Americas accelerated year-over-year to 9.3%, driven by strength in Analytics & Trading and Content & Technology solutions and the execution of our price increase. Our Americas price increase delivered $30.7 million in ASV, up $10.6 million from last year. In addition, the region benefited from improved expansion with banking, wealth management and asset management clients. We also had strong sales of middle office solutions. While new business decelerated overall for the quarter, we saw strength in new logos from asset owners. In Asia-Pacific, we delivered Organic ASV growth of 10.8%, performance was driven by research with improved expansion and retention in banking. Expansion also improved among asset managers and asset owners, although this was partially offset by client cancellations. Given the recent changes in COVID policy across Asia, we are starting to see improvement in the pipeline. However, we expect a light effect as the market normalizes. Finally in EMEA, Organic ASV growth accelerated to 8.1%. Acceleration was driven by Analytics & Trading, where we saw an improvement in expansion and retention among asset owners. Improved retention among private equity and venture capital firms and hedge funds also contributed to growth. However, we also experienced headwinds as the major markets in the region remain under cost pressure and the United Kingdom begins to see an adverse impact from Brexit. In summary, I'm pleased with our first half performance. We're confident in our ability to meet our medium term outlook, despite marketing conditions, and as we head into the second half, we have a solid pipeline, driven by our open platform, connected content and market-leading workflow solutions. And with more than 40 years of growth, FactSet, has a proven history of successfully navigating market volatility. Our greatest asset is our people and I'd like to wrap-up by recognizing their diligence and commitment to our strategic priorities. We were honored to be named one of Glassdoor's Best Places to Work in 2023 and I want to thank all FactSetters for helping create the culture that made this award possible. At FactSet, we're committed to growth for our clients, employees, investors and communities. We recently published our fiscal year 2022 sustainability report themes commitment to action. The report highlights the progress we have made in turning our commitments into action. And I encourage you all to take a look. I'll now turn it over to Linda to discuss our second fiscal quarter performance in more detail. Linda Huber : Thank you, Phil, and hello to everyone on the call. As you've seen from our press release this morning, we're pleased to report continued high single-digit organic ASV growth and double-digit growth of revenue and adjusted EPS year-over-year. I will now share additional details on our second quarter performance. Consistent with our definition of organic revenues in ASV, we will exclude any revenue in ASV associated with CUSIP Global Services when reporting organic metrics. Given the first anniversary of the CGS acquisition on March 1st, 2023, CGS will be included in the organic results of FactSet as a component of our CTS business starting in the third fiscal quarter of 2023. As Kendra noted, a reconciliation of our adjusted metrics to comparable GAAP figures is included at the end of our press release. We grew organic ASV plus professional services by 9.1% year-over-year and acceleration over the last quarter and a solid finish for our first half. Our performance reflects the strength of our recurring sales model and disciplined execution by our sales team as our clients look to technology and data to drive alpha. We saw improved retention and expansion among existing clients. Price realization also continues to improve as we executed a higher price increase over a larger client base. GAAP revenue increased by 19.5% to $515 million for the second quarter. Organic revenue, which excludes any impact from acquisitions and dispositions over the last 12 months and foreign exchange increased 8.9% to $470 million. Growth was driven primarily by CGS and our Analytics & Trading and Content & Technology solutions. For our geographic segments, on an organic basis, revenue growth for the Americas was 8.2%, benefiting from increases in Content & Technology solutions and Analytics & Trading. EMEA revenue also grew at 8.2%, primarily due to growth in Analytics & Trading. And finally, Asia Pacific revenue growth increased 15.3% due to increases in Research & Advisory and Content & Technology solutions. GAAP operating expenses grew 12.4% in the second quarter to $346 million. And I'll now detail the drivers based on our primary cost buckets. First, people, our expenses grew by 10% year-over-year in the second quarter, primarily due to increased salary and bonus expenses for existing employees. As a percentage of revenue, this was 350 basis points lower year-over-year, driven by slower salary growth as a percentage of revenue, higher labor capitalization and FX benefit. We saw headcount increase by 10.3% year-over-year, with two-thirds of these new positions located in our Centers of Excellence. And as a reminder, more than 66% of our employees are located in our Centers of Excellence. Next, facilities expense decreased by 7% year-over-year due to our reduced real estate footprint lapping of the previous year's impairment charge of $10 million and FX benefit. As a percentage of revenue, this was 360 basis points lower year-over-year. As we continue our intense focus on cost management, we expect to take another real estate charge of approximately $15 million to $20 million later this fiscal year. Moving on, technology expenses increased by 27%, driven by increased cloud spend, third party software costs and higher amortization of internal use software. As a percentage of revenue growth was 50 basis points higher year-over-year due to higher capitalization of internal use software. As we explained during last year's Investor Day, we anticipate technology costs being 8.5% to 9% of revenue over the medium term. Technology expenses will likely continue to increase as we invest for growth. And finally, third party content costs increased by 5% year-over-year. Our team is doing an excellent job of controlling third party data costs despite inflationary pressure. As a percentage of revenue growth in third party content costs was 70 basis points lower year-over-year. And now turning to the margin front. Our GAAP operating margin increased by 430 basis points to 32.9% compared to the previous year. Our adjusted operating margin improved by 330 basis points to 37%. Margin expansion resulted from higher revenue, lower personnel costs as a percentage of revenue. The lapping of the prior year's impairment charge and lower content and facilities costs. These savings were slightly offset by higher technology costs and expenses related to CGS. As a percentage of revenue. Our impairment expense was 230 basis points lower than last year's on a GAAP basis. You'll find an expense walk from revenue to adjusted operating income in the appendix of today's earnings presentation. As a percentage of revenue, our cost of sales was 50 basis points higher than last year's on a GAAP basis, largely as a result of increased amortization of intangible assets expenses related to CGS and technology costs. This was partially offset by lower personnel costs as a percentage of revenue. On an adjusted basis, it was 180 basis points lower due to lower personnel costs as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by expenses related to CGS and higher technology costs. And finally, on a GAAP basis, SG&A was 245 basis points lower year-over-year as a percentage of revenue and 150 basis points lower on an adjusted basis. This was primarily due to decreases in facilities expense and professional services. This was partially offset by an increase in T&E as our teams resumed essential travels. Turning now to tax. Our tax rate for the quarter was 16.1%, a 6.2% increase compared to last year's rate of 9.9%. The higher Q2 tax rate is due to higher pre-tax income and lower stock option exercise. Going forward, it's important to note that we expect more volatility in our tax rate. One driver will be foreign tax. In April, the UK statutory rate will increase from 19% to 25%, increasing FactSet's foreign effective tax rate and reducing the tax benefit of foreign income. Stock option exercise will also fluctuate with our stock price generally, resulting in lower tax rate when the stock price is higher and higher tax rate when the price is lower. Also, as we finalize our tax returns for prior years, we have the potential for one -time charges, which could also be helpful. Even with this variability and a higher tax rate for the second quarter, we expect to end fiscal 2023 with an effective tax rate of 13.5% to 14.5%. GAAP EPS increased 19% to $3.38 this quarter versus $2.84 in the prior year. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 16.2% to $3.80. Both EPS figures were driven by higher revenue and margin expansion, partially offset by increased interest expense and the higher tax rate. Also of note, Q2 EBITDA increased to $200 million, up 45.4% year-over -year due to higher operating income. And finally, free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending was $147 million for the quarter, an increase of 34% over the same period last year. This was due to higher net income, partially offset by increased capitalization costs from internal use software. We would note that strong free cash flow continues to be an attractive feature of FactSet's business model. Our ASV retention for the second quarter remained greater than 95%. We grew our total number of clients by 558 compared to the prior year, driven by corporate and wealth clients and channel partners. Our client retention remains at 92% year-over-year, demonstrating excellent execution by our sales and client support teams. Moving on to our balance sheet, during the second quarter, we completed another $125 million prepayment of the three-year term loan for the CGS acquisition. This was our fourth prepayment since the start of the loan. This brought our gross leverage ratio down to 2.4 times from 3.9 times level when we initially financed the CGS acquisition. This is well within our 2.5 times to 2 times gross leverage target and appropriate for our investment grade rating. Given that we are within our target range, we will slow the pace of repayment of the remaining 500 million outstanding balance of the term loan, which matures in 2025. Also, given our reduced leverage levels, we intend to resume share repurchases for the remainder of fiscal 2023. We currently have $181.3 million available for share repurchase under the company's existing authorization. We plan to allocate this amount equally in the third and fourth fiscal quarters. While bringing our repurchases back to previous levels will take time. We're focused on returning capital to shareholders. We will provide updates on our share repurchase program in the coming months. As Phil stated earlier, given our reduced core ASV outlook and the inclusion of CUSIP Global Services as part of our organic results, we are updating our guidance for fiscal 2023. We expect organic ASV growth of $145 million to $175 million, which is a $15 million reduction in core ASV growth at the midpoint. The decline is offset by the $10 million addition of CUSIP and remains within our medium term outlook of 8% to 9% organic ASV growth. Given the headwinds to ASV and lag timing of ASV in the first fiscal quarter, we expect revenue for fiscal 2023 to be in the range of $2.08 billion to $2.1 billion. At the midpoint, revenue growth is expected to be about 13%, a deceleration of 95 basis points from our previously issued guidance. Despite a slightly softer top line, we are confident that our disciplined expense management will allow us to protect margins and preserve EPS. Consistent with our downturn playbook, areas of focus include ongoing real estate rightsizing, rationalization of third party content costs and limiting hiring to essential positions. Based on forecasted performance, we also expect our year-end bonus pool to be in the range of $100 million to $105 million, roughly $10 million less than last year, which will provide an additional margin benefit. As a result of these measures, we are maintaining adjusted margin guidance of 34% to 35%, consistent with our Investor Day commitment of 50 basis points to 75 basis points of adjusted margin expansion on average per year. And finally, given the strength of our adjusted operating margin and revenue growth, we expect adjusted EPS of $14.50 to $14.90 for fiscal 2023 as previously communicated. Despite the uncertain environment, we remain confident regarding long-term growth. We have a diverse pipeline and are seeing higher retention, better expansion, improved price realization and increased demand for our products. In addition, our enterprise contracts and diverse end markets provide us with some downside protection in a turbulent market. As a result, we remain committed to our medium term outlook and are positioned well for the future. And with that, we're now ready for your questions. Operator? Operator : And thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is now open. Brendan Popson : Good morning. This is Brendan on for Manav. Just want to ask on, the ASV \u2013 obviously, not entirely unexpected with everything going on. I appreciate the disclosures there on where it's coming from. I want to ask, you talked about two-thirds of being from banking. Would have expected maybe some of it's coming from venture capital to, if you guys walk through where exactly you expect that impact to be. And maybe it's just -- it's venture capital just such a small part of ASV doesn't matter. But if you could quantify that for us too, that would be great. Helen Shan : Sure. Hi, this is Helen Shan. I'll take that question. So the end markets did begin to soften a bit at the beginning of the calendar year and obviously more volatile in the last few weeks. And as we said, two-thirds comes, we think, from banking and the third from the other types. And so we did plan for lower growth in banking after such strong years of growth post the pandemic. And actually, the first quarter was continued to be strong, but we did see some greater erosion in Q2 in part due to layoffs. And so that kind of got us to our number there of that two-thirds. PVC, we've not seen that. In fact, we've continued to see double-digit growth there. And so we don't feel that, that's going to be as big a factor. And it is, as you noted, somewhat relatively small. But for us, we'll have a lot to say more when we can see what happens in the hiring classes in in the fourth quarter. So that's really the driver of the banking piece. The rest comes from really just changes in client behaviour that we're seeing as Linda and Phil talked about earlier. Brendan Popson : Okay. And then just one follow-up pivoting over to margin. Obviously, a really strong performance in the first half. And I know that second half is typically seasonally worse, but it's still, the number you guys have there still feels a little conservative, even if ASV comes in a little lower. Is there something to call out? I mean, it sounds like maybe more real estate charges are coming in. I mean, it seems like it feels like the 30 even 35 seems pretty beatable. But just -- if I'm missing something, just let me know. Linda Huber : Brendan, it's Linda. And we appreciate your optimism on the margin front. A couple of things going on. We see ASV growth slowing primarily because we're now, excuse me, lapping the CUSIP acquisition. So growth, which had been as strong as 19.5%, will now come down toward 8%. And we see expense growth continuing at about 11% in the back half of the year. So those two things will combine to give us some margin compression. In the first half, we've had adjusted operating margin of about 37.6% and we do like our guidance of 34% to 35%. So if you do the math, you can see that adjusted operating margin will be closer to the zip code of 32% as we get to the back half of the year, we think. But we do hope that continued expense management will help us. The biggest piece that we're looking at here, as we said in the script, is potentially reducing our real estate footprint by another $15 million to $20 million as we get closer to the end of the year. Now that given the length of the leases that we have, provides another, call it, $3 million to $4 million back into the P&L for next year. And in total, last year, we did $62 million of real estate rightsizing. So with this, we'll be approaching $80 million in real estate rightsizing. So we think we've handled that quite well. Otherwise, we just keep our eyes on our downturn playbook. And we're managing all of this pretty closely. So hope that helps. Brendan Popson : Great. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Alex Kramm from UBS. Your line is now open. Alex Kramm : Yeah. Hey, good morning, everyone. Just quickly on the pricing, $30.7 million, clearly a nice increase from last year. But if I look at this correctly and I just look at your U.S. ASV, I think that works out to roughly 2.5%. I think you've been talking about the rec rate 6%. So just wondering, I know you don't get it on all of your book of business, but just talk about maybe if you saw a little bit more incremental pushback than you expected or how pricing discussions had gone relative to expectations and how we should be thinking about the European increase, which should be coming in the next quarter? Helen Shan : Hey, Alex, it's Helen. I'll take that one. We've made really good progress in capturing value, both because of our fit-for-purpose packages and our higher price realization. And as Phil mentioned, we did get to raise 31 million from ASV just in the Americas alone, which is 10 million higher than the previous year, and really a fifth of our total ASV growth rate. So to your point, this increase is in part due to higher rate, but also the fact that we are able to capture more clients. 60% of our book here in America was captured, which is actually higher by 6.4%. But the remaining part a lot of that is in our long-term contracts that we have negotiated step ups. And so we don't include that in the annual price increase or for those that we were able to recently renew or new clients in Q1. And then also keep in mind, because of our calendar year-end, Alex, that first quarter that folks are still on last year's rate increase. And then so you're really getting three quarters of it for this year. So that is part of the reason if you're trying to get to a math piece there. But our sales force has been terrific in being able to help clients understand with our -- the value of our increased investments and being able to get the higher price increase. We did not see more pushback this year than in previous years. So that is not at all the behaviour that we dealt with. Alex Kramm : Okay, great. Thank you for the color. And then second question, I'm not sure if I'm the right person to ask it, but I will anyways. I mean, obviously UBS is buying Credit Suisse and I think this is the first, I guess, bulge bracket marriage or forced marriage that we've seen since the financial crisis. So when I go back to 2008, 2009 performance, you certainly saw that impact. Phil, I heard you in terms of highlighting how big some of - or how big the biggest customers are. But could you talk about how something like that may impact you? I would assume this is more a fiscal year '24 event. And then if I think about the relative size relative to what you said earlier, I mean, it's like 15 million plus or minus the right ballpark for a client of that size. Or can you help us a little bit about a potential impact here? Philip Snow : Yeah. So, hey, Alex, it's Phil. I'm not going to talk about the specific size of any particular client, but I think you can assume, right, that FactSet has a good footprint within these large global banks. But it's not just the investment banking teams. Very often it's on the asset management side, and also there'll be wealth users as well. So we've got a very nice distributed portfolio across these firms. I think part of why we're being a bit more prudent here in the second half is, we do get a lot of banking ASV in Q4 based on the hiring of these banks. So we're not quite sure how this is going to play out, you know, whether or not there's going to be more consolidation or not. But typically we do okay, right, during these periods. FactSet's very sticky. We're there to help our clients. We're very trusted. We have a much more diverse portfolio than we had, you know, ten years ago, that's for sure. And usually, you know, if people leave these firms, they end up somewhere else and if they like FactSet, they'll -- they'll ask for it when they get that, which is always great. So it is hard to predict, but you know, we've handled this well in the past and we think we're very well equipped to handle it if there's even more uncertainty moving forward. Alex Kramm : Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. George Tong : Hi, Thanks. Good morning. Your ASV guidance plans for slower growth from the banking category. Can you describe what you're seeing with the sales cycles there and the broader pipeline? How much of the guidance reduction reflects what you've already seen versus conservatism around what you expect to see? Linda Huber : Hey, George. I'll take that. It's a little bit of a combination of both. I mean, obviously this quarter has been a terrific one given our 9% plus growth rate, but we are seeing some higher erosion. And so that's something we're taking into effect. Banking is a pretty large piece of our Q4, so there's probably a bit of conservatism there, but that's because we don't have that visibility at this -- at this time. But -- but knowing where we think hiring will go, that's where that -- that drives that two thirds piece. In terms of the rest of the -- the book, we are seeing that more deals it's taking longer to get some of the deals over the line. And quite frankly, what's the benefit is the fact that we see quite a few that are still in the commercial negotiation stage, meaning, they're in the right place, but it's taking a little longer. So that really speaks to the quality of the book, which is still solid. But given timing, it may take a little bit longer to -- to monetize. George Tong : Got it. That's helpful context. And as a follow-up on a turn to margins, you had mentioned before that you expect margins to move lower heading through the year and understand the seasonality of margins. If you look at year-over-year comparisons with margins, which essentially would wash out seasonality, how do you expect margin -- margins to progress year-over-year? And what are the key puts and takes as you think about margin expansion or contraction year \u2013over-year? Linda Huber : George, the seasonality and the pattern is -- is very similar to what it was last year in FY'22. And as we move forward, we would probably give you a little bit of outlook here on our four main cost buckets. People, we expect that cost will continue to increase as we go through the back half of this year. We have additional headcount, two thirds of it in offshore locations, but we do have additional headcount and we're offsetting that by higher capitalization. We've done very well across the firm to increase the rate of capitalization, which is appropriate. And in the first half of the year, I would note our capitalization was $35 million. But the back half, you're going to want to pick that up even a little bit more as the tech spend is heavier and thus the capitalization will be higher as well. On the technology costs more specifically, we still see that we'll be within the 8% to 9% of revenue for tech costs. But this is a growing business and we are increasing our tech spend to support it. We talked about real estate, another charge of $15 million to $20 million that we have planned. This has been an area where I think we've done a great job of rationalizing our costs and it's been very helpful to us with absolutely no impact on anything else that we're doing. Third party data similarly has had a slight growth 3%, but given the rate of inflation, that looks pretty good. So we're pretty happy about that. So what we're going to do is we're going to continue our focus on our downturn playbook. Right now we are looking at essential hires only. Travel is prioritized for essential trips, primarily around Helen's Sales team. And we've talked about real estate and we are negotiating hard on third party content. So all of that together we think is manageable. The last piece that we would note on people costs, our bonus pool, we're thinking is going to be sort of $100 million to $105 million. Last year we had a bonus pool, which was more like $115 million. So we're looking for about call it $10ish million savings on that if we perform at a 100% of our targets. So again last year was a very strong bonus year. This year we'll probably be a bit more moderate and we'll continue to update you on this as we move through the year. So hope that's helpful to you, George, and I hope I covered everything you wanted. George Tong : Very helpful. Thank you. Linda Huber : Sure. Operator : And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. Your line is now open. Andrew Nicholas : Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. I think, Phil, you mentioned CGS ASV growth of 8% here since acquiring it. And I think that's on the higher end of what that business had historically grown at least in terms of revenue. So I'm just wondering if you could speak to the sustainability of being kind of in that high single-digit range and maybe a little bit more on the progress of some of the new opportunities there on -- on private company data in particular? Philip Snow : Yeah. Thanks for the question. Yeah, we feel confident. You know, we've had this asset for a year now, so we're still getting to know it. It's a very steady, consistent business. We're executing exceptionally well. We've got a great sales team. Almost all of the employees that came over during the acquisition are still with us and very happy. And I think some of, you know, the growth can just be attributed to good execution, frankly, in terms of the contracts. And as new issuance comes out, you know, it is getting -- into issuing CUSIPS for new asset classes isn't a very quick process, right? There's a lot of parties you have to bring to the table and get on board to do that. So we're making good progress there on the two areas that I mentioned, particularly the loan entity IDs. So it's a consistent business. You know, I think you should see steady performance from it. But again, we're just getting to know this asset really well now that we've had it for a year. Andrew Nicholas : Perfect. Thank you. And then switching gears a bit for my follow-up. I wanted to ask you a question on wealth. Obviously another nice win there with the BMO add in the quarter. We're just hoping you could spend maybe a bit more time walking through the major reasons you're winning in that space. And maybe more importantly, from my perspective, when you're not winning deals, are there -- are there major gaps in your offering that -- that consistently come up? And as you think about those gaps, are those generally opportunities to -- to address those organically or would we eventually expect to see you acquire into those gaps? Thank you. Philip Snow : Yes. Thanks for the follow-up question. There are no gaps related to the product that we intended to take to market, so we're doing very well with the advisor workstation. And, you know, some of the reasons we're winning really are just the ease of use of the interface, the speed of it, the flexibility FactSet's, you know, superior analytics capabilities, integrating portfolios. The advisor dashboard that we've layered on top of -- of this for some clients really suggest the next best action for the advisors. That's been a big hit and just I think our open and flexible technology in addition to the interface itself, allows the firm to bring in feeds and other components that they may want into other parts of that business. So it continues to grow in double-digits. It was a double-digit growth for I think seven or eight quarters in a row now. So a very consistent performer and we still see a lot of room here to grow. The tailwinds in the space and as you pointed out, there are some obvious adjacencies that could -- fax it could get into -- could get into. So we're looking at those, you know, and if there's an opportunity to do something, either buy or build, we'll take advantage of that. Helen, do you want to add on? Helen Shan : Yeah, no, I was going to say that a lot of the -- our wealth clients are really investing into their own technology platforms. So exactly what Phil said, once we land with our workstation, quite frankly, there's a lot of room for growth with the advisor dashboard and other digital solutions. And since they're investing in their platform and because we have an open strategy, we are actually seeing tons of opportunity. So I think there's a lot there for us to -- to continue to grow on. Andrew Nicholas : Great. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Faiza Alwy : Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thanks. Phil, I wanted to ask about investments because it looks like the pace of investments is going to accelerate, which is -- which is typically the case seasonally. But I'm curious if, you know, given the recent volatility, if you're thinking around the types of areas that you're investing in has evolved at all? Philip Snow : Sure. Thanks, Faiza. I mean, it's a little bit early to comment on exactly what we'll be doing. This is the time of year that we look at our strategy and consider, you know, what we might want to think about for next year in terms of any changes. Many of the initiatives that we set out to execute on a few years ago, these are long initiatives. So we continue to execute well on our deep sector and private markets offerings. We're doing well in real time. I mentioned a very nice deal that we captured in Q2 as a result of that investment and we've actually tilted more investment towards that this year. We just see so much opportunity in that space. You know, one thing, I can sort of highlight or I'd like to highlight is, you know, FactSet has great content analytics and we're also a technology company and we've done so much work to invest in our platform with our hybrid cloud strategy partnerships. We've developed our API program. All of that is really beginning to bear fruit. And we do believe that the technology piece of what we do is going to help us more in the future. And you actually see that in CTS. So CTS had a very good quarter, grew in double-digits accelerated. And if you look at what CTS is providing to the market is Content & Technology solutions, but this quarter it really tilted towards the technology part, which is exciting, you know, sitting down with our clients, helping them manage data, helping them in other ways. So that's a bit of the evolution there, if that's helpful to you and maybe gives you a bit of a hint of sort of where we're headed into next year. Faiza Alwy : Great. That's very helpful. Just as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about capital allocation. So Linda you mentioned that you expect to slow the pace of repayments on the debt side. Maybe talk about how you're looking to balance debt paydown versus share buybacks like should we expect all buybacks to happen immediately this year? Or just give us a bit more color in terms of how you're -- how you're thinking about those things? Linda Huber : Sure, Faiza. The first order for FactSet for capital allocation is to reinvest in our strong and fast growing businesses as Phil just explained. Our investment pool is pretty much the same this year as it was last year. We've tracked our investments. They've done very well. We'll continue with the things that are going very nicely for us and maybe pick up a thing or two that's -- that's new. But investment comes first. And then we have our dividend, which as you can see, has been quite steady and has grown nicely over the years. We're about coming up to the time where we think about what will happen next with the dividend. And then on share repurchase. We have $181.3 million in our authorization. The plan is to spread that evenly over the remaining 5-ish months of the year, and we'll use a 10b5-1 in grid repurchase program. So we'll put that into place here sometime in the coming weeks. And we're -- we're pretty excited about resuming share repurchase. So I think that probably pretty much covers what we'll be looking to do In terms of capital allocation. I think we see this more as sort of getting back to what we've done before. On the pay down of the loans -- loan for CUSIP, we had been paying down 125 million a quarter. We may slow that down to even sort of half-ish of that pace. And you know all these things together I think should help us get some capital back to shareholders in a way that's more typical of -- of what FactSet has done in previous years. So we're excited about getting back to share repurchase. It is the back half of the year. It's not going to move the average share count all that much for 2023, but it will be quite helpful to us as we move into 2024. So I hope that detail was helpful to you, Faiza. Faiza Alwy : Yes, very helpful. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners. Your line is now open. Craig Huber : Great. Thank you. My first question, if you go a little bit deeper, if you would please, on the sales cycle that you're seeing on your buy side clients, both you know the asset managers, hedge funds, but also love to hear a little bit on the venture capital and private equity firms out there, how that sales cycle is tracking for you? Linda Huber : Hi, Craig. I'll take that one. Yeah, I think when we interestingly as opposed to specifically on the firm types, but as we're taking a look at sort of the size of firms, that's where we're seeing a little bit of a difference with regard to -- with regard to sales cycles. So what I mean by that is many of our larger clients are really going through their digital transformation. And because they've already spent probably 12 to 24 months investing, planning, our ability to continue with them, you know, when we think about deals that are taking longer, it's not in necessarily the largest of deals. It's actually more in the mid-size. So, as a result, we are, we feel some downside protection on that. But, you know, things will take a little bit longer. We can tell from the deals and how long they're taking and moving from one quarter to the next, not, not, not very, very long. But as we said, the trend is coming that way. And so we're just keeping an eye on it. Craig Huber : And then how would you characterize the -- the revised ASV outlook here in terms of conservativeness given -- given the environment, I don't blame you for being conservative there and but just how did you put that together in terms of as the question came up earlier, I just want to hear a little bit further about what you're hearing from clients versus what you layered on top of that, trying to anticipate about tougher economic and stock market backdrop? Philip Snow : Hey, Craig, maybe I'll say a few things and then I'm sure Helen will have some -- some stuff to add on. So, you know, for the second half, what I do want to highlight is the strength that we're seeing in Analytics and CTS. So when -- they've had both -- both had very good quarters and the pipeline for both of those lines of business look very good. So you think of these more as our enterprise solutions. So we see a very healthy appetite from our clients for these across a number of firm types. The conservatism is coming around our research area, which really has to do with the seats and, you know, primarily in banking. So that's a bit of the thinking. And then as I mentioned in my opening comments, you know, we see about two thirds of the correction that we made to banking and the other third to fund types. So, Helen, I don't know if you wanted to add on and sort of help with any. Helen Shan : Yeah, I think it's also important to keep in mind the shape and mix of our banking book. So, so first of all, we have seen acceleration in a lot of the cross-selling we're doing. So as banks are, we've had growth in data feeds, API integration, digital solutions in there. So it's not only around the workstation itself. And then the other piece is to really think about both the large banks, sort of the majors, as we call them, and then the middle market banking clients where a number of advisory boutiques actually are making opportunistic hiring decisions. And so that's helped keep the book in decent shape. So we do expect this sector to be slower than last year. But I think the diversification and what we're offering them and the mix of the client portfolio and of course the multiyear contracts that have minimums, two thirds of our book have minimums in there in the banking. So that gives us some downside protection. So I feel pretty good about our ability to manage through that -- that downturn. Craig Huber : Great. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to drill down further on the -- on the two areas which have been really strong Content and Analytics and that's mostly focused on the buy side, which is more than like 87% of your business. And in this environment, the buy side has been relatively resilient, at least as far as we can see. So question there was -- and I get the sorry the comments around elongation of sales cycle, but I was just wondering if you can talk about the pipeline itself. How is the pipeline comparing even compared to three months before? Are you seeing more deals come into the pipeline? And is it just a matter of maybe they get pushed out from fourth quarter to fiscal year '24 versus the ability to close the deal? Thanks. Philip Snow : Hey, Ashish. It's Phil. I'll start. So, yeah, we're seeing very good pipelines for both Analytics and CTS. And this really I think is just in line with the mega trends that we've seen on the buy side for the last few years. So all these firms are going through their own transformations. They want to do more with less partners essentially. So they're looking for those anchor partners like FactSet that they can work with that have the majority of what they need from a technology and content standpoint, and then they want to shorten the tail. There's also a shift to outsourcing. So we're seeing a lot of the asset services beginning to do more for asset management clients. You know, we think we're in about 70% of the asset services at different stages of working with them, but we've got very good partnerships there that's really built up over the last year or two where FactSet's superior middle office solutions, whether it's risk performance reporting or all the multi-asset class capabilities. We can deploy those now to the buy side either directly ourselves or through partners like asset services. So that's a big trend. We're also seeing very good strength in asset owners. That firm type accelerated this quarter for -- for some of the same reasons, just the strength of those solutions that we offer. So that's a trend. I think also, you know, Helen mentioned sort of the open technology that's working very well with wealth clients. That's true with, you know, asset managers as well. So there's lots of ways that we can help them. On the CTS side, the real time data had a very strong quarter. We had that key deal. We see a lot of opportunity there, a very strong pipeline for what we're calling market data-as-a-service. So FactSet is delivering this through the cloud, which is new. So for clients that have had very heavy on-prem solutions for real time, historically, we're offering a next generation solution for them that we think is very exciting. So that's one of the things I would highlight in CTS. Ashish Sabadra : That's very helpful color. Sorry, go ahead. Linda Huber : I was just going to add one quick thing. In this sorts of periods, the thing you want to focus on as well is retention. And our retention has continued to be incredibly strong. And as we think about the expansion with the buy side from a workflow perspective, we continue to see strength in the middle office with performance solution. And as Phil said back office with real time where we're the only provider with a ticker plant in the cloud and that's a differentiating factor that's very much resonating. And then to your last point, when we see delays, we are not seeing -- seeing those deals necessarily fall out, meaning they're not lost or cancelled. And I think that plays a bit into the comment made around when they will -- when they will come actually become monetized. Ashish Sabadra : That's great color. Thank you very much. And maybe if I can just ask on the wealth front, despite the BMO, when the wealth was not highlighted as a strength in the second quarter. So I was just wondering, does that come in the back half of the year or does that get classified as something else in terms of ASV? Thanks. Linda Huber : Yeah, no, wealth is a terrific growth area for us and Bank of Montreal deal is in this quarter, but it's just part one we believe as they continue on their complete digital transformation. In fact, it's in the statement that they gave in the press release, we'll -- we'll follow them through that. So but it is in this quarter. Ashish Sabadra : That's very helpful color. Thanks. Operator : And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Russell Quelch from Redburn. Your line is now open. Russell Quelch : Yeah, thanks for having me on. So I just want to go back to the point on margins. And if we go back ten years, your gross margin was somewhere around sort of 65%. Today that number sits just over 50%. Is it a function that you have to buy more third party data and that cost is increasing? I sort of heard your answer to George's questions in terms of near-term margin drivers, but is there more you could do to improve efficiencies in operations to improve the gross margin over time, again just noting that best-in-class here operate above 80% gross margin. Linda Huber : Russell, it's Linda. Yeah, best-in-class in our competitor set is above where we are. But there are different businesses. Some of the companies have an index business which has a 75% plus margin, and some of them have ratings businesses which have 55% plus margins. We have neither of those businesses. We think we're doing really well. On the margin increase front, we've said 50 basis points to 75 basis points on adjusted operating margin and that we will see that on average over the next few years. So we've been making really good progress on that. Are there more things we could do on margin? The answer is definitely yes. I spoke about what we're looking to do in terms of further reduction in our real estate footprint, and we're very proud of the cost control efforts that we've put in place already. I think the main part of the effort here that Phil may want to pick up on is what we're doing to automate our content collection. And that's kind of the -- the biggest opportunity that we have. And technology is changing very rapidly in that area. We are able to move much more quickly with content collection and do much more, much more quickly than we were able to do previously even a year ago. And I'm not sure that it's relevant to comment on what happened really ten years ago. This company was very, very much different ten years ago. So we're working on the margin. We have done what we said we will do even with a $15 million decrease in the core ASV growth, we're still holding margin for -- for the year with the increases that we had spoken about before. So maybe I'll turn it over to Phil here and let him talk a little bit more about some of the opportunities that we see particularly in the content area. Philip Snow : Sure. Thanks, Linda. Yeah, so yeah, Russell, we've been re-architecting our content collection efforts and really automating things more than we had in the past. So that's been an on-going effort. It was necessary for us to do that because of the deep sector initiative and some other content sets that we're beginning to collect at scale. So we're, you know, way less than half way through that. But we have a lot of content sets beginning to go through it. It looks very promising. And the question just becomes, okay, does that flow through to margin or does FactSet continue to invest in even more content, right, to help drive the top line? But there's a lot of automation opportunity, not just within content, but I think within different parts of our business moving forward. Russell Quelch : Okay. Yeah. Thanks. Okay. Just as a follow-up, in terms of client growth, the client growth has been under 100 for two consecutive quarters now I think. To what degree do you think that's due to just the backdrop or is there an element to which we're seeing the impact of increased competition particularly in financial markets, workstations from some of your peers? Philip Snow : I wouldn't attribute it to increased competition. New business is down because I think because of the environment. But we still are showing very strong growth in new logos from corporates. There'll be a big opportunity for private equity firms. This quarter we actually grew our institutional asset management clients I think by ten. So we're seeing growth, you know, across different firm types. So, you know, we are you know, we do exist in a lot of the large firms that are out there already. So, you know, the potential for FactSet really exists within a lot of the existing clients. But it is nice to get new names, you know, as firms get formed. Russell Quelch : Thanks both. Operator : And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse AG. Your line is now open. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thanks so much. Hey, Phil, you had a comment on the call where you talked about CTS tilting more towards technology as opposed to content. Can you maybe just disaggregate that a little bit? How much, if you can, how much does CTS today is kind of content versus technology and is there a meaningful difference in the growth there? And then is it kind of the -- the Snowflake relationships and Helen describing that technology adoption or is it to Helen's point earlier just the sophistication of the clients you're serving? Philip Snow : Yeah, hey, Kevin, the vast majority of this content. And when I talk about technology, it's probably being able to deliver that content in that same content in new ways. So if you went back ten years ago, we'd be shipping you a comma delimited flat file that you'd be putting into your internal systems and having to do a lot of work with. But now we do have, you know, delivery through APIs, through Snowflake, through lots of other partners and beginning to layer on some services. So one service that we have is something called concordance-as-a-service. So if you have some data, you don't want to go through all of the mapping of it yourself. FactSet is very good at that. That's what we built our business on. We will provide that service. So we believe there's opportunities like that. Moving forward to lean in real time, where I think I'm characterizing that as technology. You could say it's content as well, but the fact that we're -- we've put this technology up in the cloud. We think is really interesting from a technology standpoint and going to drive growth further growth for CTS moving forward. Kevin McVeigh : Super helpful. And then -- this may be obvious, but Linda, if you could just humor me. The difference in the ASV relative to the revenue. It looks like a $5 million tweak and I know CUSIP comes in versus the revenue looks like it's $15 million to $20 million. Is there any way to think about the delta between those two? Linda Huber : Yeah, Kevin, I think you make a good point. The conversion of ASV into revenue a little bit perhaps slowed as to where it was before because we had a little bit lighter first quarter in particular. But I don't think there's going to be anything there that's -- that's major. We feel pretty good about each of those estimates. And it's probably worth saying we're doing this, Kevin, as you know, it's been a pretty dramatic time. We have to revise guidance here four days after a very eventful weekend. So it is possible that, that maybe we're being overly conservative. We don't know yet. But, you know, as we -- as we watch going through the rest of the year, we'll be updating as to where we stand. But we did want to try to be very thoughtful about what we're -- what we're seeing right now. And good point on the -- the conversion to revenue. Thanks very much, Kevin. Kevin McVeigh : Thank you. Operator : And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Your line is now open. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Phil, can you elaborate a little bit on the cancellations you touched on? Is there something in particular? Is it people getting laid off? Is it some firm closures? Maybe you can just expand on that a little bit? Philip Snow : Can you help clarify the question? I'm not sure what cancellations I referred to. Shlomo Rosenbaum : I thought you were when you're discussing Americas, that you had some area that you said you were some of the positives or one of the negatives. I thought there was -- there were some cancellations that you had highlighted. Could be that I misunderstood it? Philip Snow : Yeah. I think you might have misunderstood that? Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Go ahead. Helen Shan : Hi, Shlomo. It's Helen. Yeah, no, we've actually had very good retention. There is erosion that's happening in cases on a bit on the banking side, which is why we are taking our more deliberate approach on thinking about that. But there wasn't anything material this quarter. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Thank you. And then, Linda, you talked a little bit about real estate potential, additional real estate that you're planning to do some more actions on the rest of the year. If you look at your downturn playbook, is there a lot more levers that you can kind of push in that downturn playbook beyond what you've kind of laid out for us in the last several quarters? In other words, if you -- if we do see that this kind of spirals more after, as you noted, was a very eventful weekend last weekend? Linda Huber : Yeah, Shlomo. Great question. We do have some additional thoughts on things we could do. For example, we've added back a bit to travel and entertainment, particularly for Helen's team, for critical client usage and for critical pipeline activity. So we could pull back on that again a little bit. But frankly, I'd rather not because we're trying to get the -- the make sure the top line is as healthy as absolutely possible. Real estate is one that we're going to do. Technology costs may come in, may come in a bit lighter. We'll have to see how that goes. And please keep an eye on the capitalization rate. And then with people, it's largely about keeping to this essential hiring and making sure that we're communicating clearly with you on where the bonus pool is going. So those are -- those are the major things. And at this point, we feel pretty good about the way we're managing the company. I wanted to anticipate a question you always ask Shlomo. You're always ahead of everyone on days sales outstanding. It has popped up a bit as we brought CUSIP in-house. Job number one was to get the technology changeover completed successfully, not break anything. And we did that. So now our focus will turn to days sales outstanding, Shlomo, and we hope that we have some nice lower results on DSO to speak to you about in the third quarter, but glad you're paying attention to that detail. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Thanks for pre-empting that. Linda Huber : Happy to do so. Operator : And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Toni Kaplan : Thanks very much. You talked about the elongation of the sales cycle already and wanted to understand the impact on not just new customers, but also cross-selling like does cross-selling or up-selling start to get more complicated in this kind of environment? I guess what -- what product sets would you anticipate being the most impacted? Linda Huber : Hey, Toni. I'll take a shot at that. I think for cross-selling, it becomes a little bit around client budgets. So we did talk about a longer sales cycle. It would be remiss of us to not also note that clearly folks are tightening their belts. So there is some of that coming into play. That being said, as I mentioned earlier, for our larger clients, many of them had set budgets. They need to continue to invest. So we've not seen some of the major changes on that front. There may be if they need to take something major in terms of change especially in certain areas right now because of changing from one provider to another. But in terms of add on, especially on feeds, we've seen very good positive momentum there. So I think the pressure will be more along the lines of material, new projects as opposed to expansion. Toni Kaplan : Great. And then I think you mentioned some strength on the risk side. I guess in terms of the offerings there, can you just refresh us on, you know, is this within the asset management client base that's -- that's purchasing it? And like I guess how much of an uptick do you typically see or is it just offsetting something they might have purchased otherwise? Philip Snow : Yeah, typically -- typically, our risk offering, Toni, is delivered through our analytics suite and that will be multi-asset class risk is really where the momentum has been for us over the last number of years. So we have a number of risk models on our system from third party providers that we integrate and then we do a lot of our own work on the risk side as well. So our FactSet really giving that choice and then very good analytics that are integrated with the rest of your portfolios, your performance suite, all of that has come together so nicely. With the acquisition of BISAM, Vermilion and getting those integrated into the core FactSet platform. So we just see, you know, when you go out and you're closing an asset owner or an asset manager risk usually is at the heart of their middle office system. And we believe that we've done such a nice job there. We have good momentum. It wasn't a particularly strong quarter for risk. It's a consistent performer, but it's always in the mix there with, you know, the rest of -- the rest of things. It's really at the heart of it. This quarter in analytics, we did very well with our quant product, which is which we're investing in, and we also did very well in fixed income. So it's nice to see fixed income have a good quarter as well. Toni Kaplan : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Owen Lau from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Owen Lau : Thank you for taking my question. Could you please give us an update on the momentum in Asia Pacific? And I think organic ASV grew at 10.8% off a low base. You talk about recent change in COVID policy there. What do you see the environment there right now? And do you think the growth can accelerate from here going forward? Thanks. Linda Huber : Thanks for that question. Yeah, we did see accelerated growth in the quarter, which is terrific. And in particular, some good demand in the first half in both Australia as well as in Japan. If I think about Australia, they had greater and improved retention and increased demand from asset owners in particular, as you know, they would be the super funds who are going through some consolidation and trying to gain efficiencies. And so they've got a lot of complexity on the data side. And as Phil just mentioned, our ability to help them manage through that, to connect their -- the different various data sets has really been a differentiator for us. So our concordance offering has helped them, for example, in creating an entity master. Now Japan has their own issues, but they've also expanded in terms of accelerated growth with asset managers. So we continue to see double-digit growth there in analytics. Now we do see that Hong Kong is still recovering. So I think we mentioned that last quarter, but activity has picked up a lot given post the relaxation of the zero COVID rule. So we think the pipeline there is beginning to book, but at this point, it's coming from, as you know, a bit of a low base. But we're very pleased to see the -- the improvement happening out in APAC. Owen Lau : Got it. And then and also another product which is related to ESG offerings and also the attraction there. And I think there are some noise about like some funds are moving away from ESG investing. Do you see these as a material trend or you don't see that as you know as like troubling as the kind of some people who have reported? Thanks. Philip Snow : Hey, Owen. It's Phil. So ESG is a very small piece of FactSet's business. Our strategy here is just to provide the picks and shovels that anyone in the market that wants to can build a view of ESG. You know, we'll provide choice of data that's out there, but we're not in the business of creating ESG ratings or anything like that. So, you know, we'll provide the tools that clients need, but it's not a huge focus for us. And you know what? I don't want to get lost today, right, with all of the volatility of the market is this was FactSet's strongest Q2 ever. We had a very good quarter and we had three deals across different parts of our businesses in the seven figures. We had a fantastic real time deal, which is new. We captured a large sell-side research deployment, which is very exciting. And then we had the BMO wealth deal that we've been able to be more public about. So all of this really points to the strength of our business, the diversity of it, and I think a reason for us all to be optimistic moving forward. Owen Lau : Thank you very much. Philip Snow : So in closing. Yes, sure. Thank you, Owen, and thanks everyone for your questions today. In closing, thank you all for joining us today. Please note that in conjunction with the first anniversary of our inaugural investment grade senior notes offering, we will be hosting a conference call for our fixed income investors on April 13th. Linda and I will give an update on performance and take questions from investors. Details can be found in our press release that we just issued on March 21st. In the meantime, feel free to contact Kendra Brown with additional questions and we look forward to speaking to you again soon Operator, that ends today's call.

Our slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the appendix to the presentation and in our earnings release issued earlier today. Joining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer and Linda Huber, Chief Financial Officer. We will also be joined by Helen Shan, Chief Revenue Officer, for the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call. I will now turn the discussion over to Phil Snow. Phil Snow : Thank you, Kendra and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I am pleased to share our third quarter results. Our organic ASV plus professional services grew 8% year-over-year. This was driven by double-digit ASV growth in analytics, where we saw strength with asset managers, asset owners and hedge funds and the successful execution of our international price increase. These gains were offset by headwinds to workstation growth among wealth, banking and corporate clients and deceleration in expansion among partners. Our investments in content and technology have strengthened our competitive position, allowing us to navigate market volatility successfully. In the third quarter, we saw broad-based growth across all firm types with double-digit ASV growth from our wealth management, banking, hedge fund, corporate and private equity and venture capital clients. In Analytics & Trading, we saw continued strength in the middle office as our suite of portfolio reporting, fixed income, performance and risk solutions accelerated growth year-over-year. Content & Technology Solutions also had double-digit ASV growth with demand for company data and data management solutions driving ASV this quarter. And in Research & Advisory, we see continued opportunities to capture additional desktops in banking and wealth. Workflow-driven capabilities also contributed to growth with our research management solutions suite accelerating year-over-year. We ended the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $3.79 and an adjusted operating margin of 36%. As we enter our fourth quarter, we are focused on operational efficiencies and disciplined expense management to support margin expansion, grow EPS and provide capital to invest in our strategic priorities. As part of this effort, we are working to reduce the run-rate of our expense base by about 3%. Savings will come primarily from rightsizing our workforce, which we expect also will decrease by about 3% and further reducing our real estate costs. As discussed last quarter, we are seeing a modest deceleration in ASV growth. And while the markets have remained largely resilient amid macroeconomic turbulence, our clients do remain cautious. Clients have also been executing their own downturn playbooks, resulting in delayed decisions and restricted spending. We also see continued staffing adjustments with firms on both the buy and sell side reducing head count, often targeting mid and senior level professionals. And while we have a stronger pipeline than last year, with a good mix of deals that should drive expansion in new business, client decision-making is taking longer. We are also monitoring developments in the banking sector. Early sentiment is mixed on fiscal 2024 class sizes. And while some clients are slowing hiring, others are adding junior bankers in preparation for a market upturn. Overall, our top 200 clients, including many of the leading global investment banks, make up two-thirds of our book. And the vast majority of these clients have multiyear contracts, including minimums and 90-day cancellation windows. Given these points and our high ASV retention rate, which is consistently greater than 95%, we believe we have effective downside protection. With this outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, we are reaffirming guidance for organic ASV growth and revenue, but guiding to the lower end of our previously disclosed ranges. In addition, we are increasing our guidance for adjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted EPS. Linda will provide further details on this later in the call. We are confident in our strategy and ability to execute. And like our clients, we are ensuring that we are well positioned as the market stabilize and the capital market cycle turns. We have a long-term view of our business and are committed to investing for growth and becoming a more efficient organization. As part of this approach, starting September 1, we are reorganizing by firm type to better align our operations with those of our clients. Analytics & Trading will become our buy-side organization, focusing on asset managers, asset owners and hedge fund workflows. Research & Advisory will become dealmakers in wealth, focusing on banking and sell-side research, wealth management, corporate and private equity and venture capital workflows. And finally, we are combining our Content and Content & Technology solutions groups to create one data solutions organization. This will create end-to-end management of our data from collection and acquisition to client delivery. We will provide more details on our progress and the performance of our firm types as we refine the structure over fiscal 2024. Technology is rapidly evolving. As an early adopter of cloud technology, we digitally transformed our platform and created flexible workflow-centric solutions. Now with the focus on generative AI, our open platform and connected content will strengthen our partnership with our clients. While generative AI is not new, FactSet has been using AI and machine language in our products for many years and the recent advances in large language models or LLMs present new opportunities. Our strategy is to build a generative AI foundation and capabilities, empowering our workforce to transform our end-user experience rapidly. We are investing in generative AI technology to drive next-generation workflow solutions. We will also continue to invest in the scaling of our content refinery. We have committed additional resources to LLM initiatives as part of our investment process and FactSetters are excited about these investments as we equip all products and engineering teams to use generative AI in their development work. Our early work in generative AI has focused on improving client support, automating content collection and transforming our products with improved search and copilot solutions. Here are a few examples. During our recent hackathon, almost one-third of FactSetters projects used LLMs to solve business problems or to improve the client experience. Teams worked on enhancing banker efficiency, pitch automation and discoverability using our modernized connected data. Earlier this month, we used ChatGPT to produce CallStreet earnings call transcript summaries, reducing summation time by more than 90%. This process is currently available for all S&P 500 companies and we plan to dramatically expand the coverage later this fiscal year. We are also testing AI-powered agent assist tools that understand FactSet proprietary codes. This use case is compelling. Questions about FactSet coding comprise half of our daily client call volume. And finally, we see significant opportunities to accelerate content automation using generative AI. We have several promising efforts underway to extract information that has previously been difficult to retrieve. Our differentiator remains our content, including our real-time and deep sector data for which we have also increased investment. FactSet has an incredibly strong moat of 40 years of proprietary content and data cleanly sourced, auditable and stitched together with our concordance and symbology. It is not easily replicable and is incredibly valuable to FactSet and our clients. Turning to our performance, we saw continued acceleration across all our regions. Americas\u2019 organic ASV growth accelerated year-over-year to 8%, growing through wins with premier asset managers and asset owners. These gains were partially offset by workstation headwinds with wealth, banking and corporate clients. EMEA was the biggest contributor to growth this quarter, with organic ASV growth accelerating to 7.4%. Growth was strongest in banking given improved retention with banking clients and improved retention and new business with hedge funds. Higher retention was also a key driver in the region as the ASV uplift from our price increase offset increased erosion. In contrast, expansion slowed as cost pressures created higher budget scrutiny, lengthening the sales cycle. Finally, Asia-Pacific delivered organic ASV growth of 10.5%. Performance was driven by wealth management, hedge funds and private equity and venture capital clients with improved retention and ASV uplift from higher realized price increases. Australia was the strongest contributor to growth with wins among asset managers and asset owners. However, sector consolidation and net negative seasonal banking hiring contributed to a small deceleration. We also saw acceleration in Japan and India driven by banking with a positive increase in workstation purchases for seasonal hires. In summary, we continue to execute well in challenging markets. As we head into the close of our fiscal year, our pipeline remains solid and we are unwavering regarding execution excellence and cost discipline. As we combine relentless client focus with exciting new technologies, I am confident in our ability to drive growth. I will now turn it over to Linda to take you through the specifics of our third quarter. Linda Huber : Thank you, Phil and hello to everyone. As you have seen from our press release this morning, we delivered solid operating results in the third quarter with continued growth for organic ASV, GAAP revenue and adjusted diluted EPS year-over-year. I will now share some additional details on our third quarter performance. As Kendra noted, a reconciliation of our adjusted metrics to comparable GAAP figures is included at the end of our press release. We grew organic ASV plus professional services by 8% year-over-year. While we are seeing lower expansion and higher erosion due to the macroeconomic environment, our performance reflects excellent execution by our sales team. Pricing realization continues to improve with our international price increase, adding $17 million in ASV this quarter, up $4.5 million from last year. Internationally, 7% more clients were subject to the annual price increase than in the prior year. Fiscal year-to-date, our 2023 price increase has yielded $18 million more ASV than last year. GAAP revenue increased by 8.4% to $530 million for the third quarter. Organic revenue, which excludes any impact from acquisitions and dispositions over the last 12 months and foreign exchange movements, increased 8.5% to $530 million. Growth was primarily driven by Analytics & Trading and Content & Technology solutions. For our geographic segments, on an organic basis, revenue growth for the Americas was 9%, benefiting from increases in Content & Technology solutions and Analytics & Trading. EMEA revenue grew at 7.5% primarily driven by Content & Technology solutions and Analytics & Trading. And finally, Asia-Pacific revenue growth came in at 7.9% due to increases in Research & Advisory and Content & Technology solutions. While GAAP operating expenses decreased 8.6% year-over-year to $358 million, adjusted operating expenses grew 9.4%. The drivers were as follows. First, people. Our cost rose 10% year-over-year in the third quarter primarily due to increased salaries for existing employees. As a percentage of revenue, this was 68 basis points higher year-over-year driven by higher salary growth as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by higher labor capitalization and lower bonus expense. For fiscal 2023, we still expect the bonus pool to be in the range of $100 million to $105 million. Head count increased by 12.9% year-over-year with most new positions in our Centers of Excellence. Overall, 65% of our employees are located in our Centers of Excellence. Next, facilities expense remained relatively flat, increasing by only 1.6% year-over-year as more employees return to in-office work. Our continuing efforts to right-size our real estate footprint mostly offset this increase. As a percentage of revenue, facilities expense was 24 basis points lower year-over-year. Moving on, technology expenses increased by 22.5% driven by third-party software costs and higher amortization of internal-use software, partially offset by lower cloud-related expenses and lower depreciation. As a percentage of revenue, growth was 90 basis points higher year-over-year. In partnership with our Chief Technology Officer, Kate Step, we have realized increased capitalization through improved time tracking and other efforts. Technology costs currently equal 7.8% of our revenue and will likely continue to increase as we invest for growth. As part of our medium-term outlook, we anticipate technology costs being 8.5% to 9.5% of revenue. And finally, our team continues to do an excellent job of controlling third-party content costs with expenses increasing by only 1.9% year-over-year despite the inflationary environment. As a percentage of revenue, growth in third-party content cost was 31 basis points lower year-over-year. Given the pressure on our top line, it is imperative that we focus on cost management. Using our downturn playbook, we took proactive steps to control our expenses, protect margins and preserve EPS. We are now going to further identify areas where we can reduce costs. As part of the efforts Phil spoke about earlier, we plan to take an approximately $45 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter. This charge includes approximately $15 million to $20 million for continued real estate rightsizing as discussed in last quarter\u2019s call. Compared to the previous year, our third fiscal quarter GAAP operating margin increased by 1,260 basis points to 32.5% mainly driven by the prior year\u2019s $49 million impairment charge and expenses related to the acquisition of CGS. Excluding both non-recurring transactions, GAAP operating margin was around 30 basis points higher than the prior year. Adjusted operating margin decreased by 60 basis points to 36%. This was largely driven by higher personnel costs and technology expenses partially offset by lower third-party content costs and lower facilities expense. You will find an expense walk from revenue to adjusted operating income in the appendix of today\u2019s earnings presentation. As a percentage of revenue, our cost of sales was 7 basis points higher than last year on a GAAP basis and 283 basis points higher on an adjusted basis largely due to personnel costs, expenses related to CGS and technology costs. As a percentage of revenue, our impairment expense was 994 basis points lower than last year on a GAAP basis as we lapped the prior year\u2019s impairment charge. On a GAAP basis, SG&A was 269 basis points lower year-over-year as a percentage of revenue and 46 basis points lower on an adjusted basis primarily due to decreases in professional services, partially offset by increased personnel costs. Turning now to tax. Our tax rate for the quarter was 16.9% compared to last year\u2019s rate of 12.2%. Our higher tax rate is primarily due to lower stock option exercises. Our current expectation is that we will end fiscal 2023 with an effective tax rate of 14% to 15%. While we continue to experience variability, which includes increases in foreign tax rates, we are researching strategies to help reduce the overall rate. GAAP EPS increased 79.3% to $3.46 this quarter versus $1.93 in the prior year driven by the lapping of the prior year\u2019s non-recurring items, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 1% to $3.79 primarily due to revenue growth offset by a higher effective tax rate and lower operating margin. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $205 million, up 15.6% year-over-year due to higher operating income. And finally, free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending, was $193 million for the quarter, an increase of 9% over the same period last year. This was primarily driven by cash generated from working capital changes and the timing of income tax payments. Our ASV retention for the third quarter remained greater than 95%. We grew our total number of clients by 451 compared to the prior year driven by corporate and wealth clients and partners. With client retention of 92% year-over-year, our sales and client support teams are to be commended for continuing to execute well despite market conditions. We remain committed to returning long-term value to shareholders. As previously discussed, we resumed share repurchases in the third quarter. We repurchased 165,950 shares for a total of $67.1 million at an average share price of $404.29. Under our current plan, which we anticipate completing in the fourth quarter, $114.2 million was available for share repurchases as of May 31, 2023. And additionally, this week, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization plan of $300 million that will take effect on September 1. Over the last 12 months, combining our dividends and share repurchases, we have returned $202.1 million to our shareholders and recently increased our dividend by 10%. This marks the 24th consecutive year of dividend increases. And finally, our guidance for fiscal 2023. While there are signs that the macro environment will start to recover over the next few months, the markets remain uncertain. Last quarter, we updated our guidance to reflect organic ASV growth of $145 million to $175 million, a slight deceleration from the guidance provided at the beginning of the fiscal year. This range reflects ASV growth of $135 million to $165 million from the core business and $10 million in ASV growth from CUSIP Global Services. We also updated our revenue guidance from $2.08 billion to $2.1 billion, which was a slight deceleration from the previous guidance. As discussed earlier, we are reaffirming our guidance for those metrics, but at the lower end of the ranges. For GAAP operating margin, we expect our one-time restructuring charges to decrease our guidance range to 29% to 30%, a 50 basis point decrease from the previous guidance. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $12.24 to $12.65. For adjusted metrics, we expect our financial discipline and cost management focus to drive an adjusted operating margin of 35% to 36%. This represents a 100 basis point increase from the previously communicated guidance range and meets our 2022 Investor Day outlook 2 years ahead of our 2025 target. Finally, we are increasing the range of adjusted diluted EPS by $0.25 at the midpoint to $14.75 to $15.15 for fiscal 2023. In closing, we are encouraged by our performance this quarter and our ability to execute on a solid pipeline as we finish the fiscal year. We are confident in our ability to balance macro headwinds with margin expansion and expense management to continue investing in our people and products. As the pace of innovation accelerates, our deep content moat and open digital platform will strengthen our partnership with our clients and allow us to capture additional market share. We are committed to sustainable growth and excited about the opportunities before us. And with that, we are now ready for your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is now open. Brendan Popson : Good morning. This is Brendan on for Manav. Just first off, I want to ask on the ASV guidance. And obviously, the high end is still there, but you are talking about it closer to the lower end. Is the higher end still possible? Did you leave it that way because there is a couple of deals in the pipeline? You are not sure if you\u2019re going to close, so that\u2019s not to count on that or can you just walk through the logic of the way you\u2019ve kind of framed the guidance update? Helen Shan : Sure. This is Helen. Thanks for your question. I am happy to kind of give you some further color on that. H1 was solid for us, but we had already seen end markets begin to soften, which is why we reduced the guidance last call of the $15 million, two-thirds coming from banking, as we said, a third coming from delayed decisions or reduced spend. Over the last 90 days, this past quarter, we\u2019ve seen those trends continue, first, in banking. For example, middle-market firms, which had been doing quite a bit of hiring picking up from other universal banks that were letting folks go, we saw that begin to slow down. And we did see some universal banks have some larger reduction as well.  Now given our 90-day notice period, client decisions that were made in Q1 of the calendar year or early spring get reflected more in this quarter, which is why you\u2019re seeing some of that net reduction. It gives us some greater visibility. And we also saw some erosion pickup on the buy side as well with clients looking for cost reduction. But the positive piece of it, as Linda indicated earlier, we\u2019re still above 95% ASV retention. And we\u2019re seeing that diversification of spend in banking, for example, as we sold more in analytics and fees as many of the firms there are looking to do more technology and off-platform solutions. So that\u2019s a positive. The second is timing. Client reviews are taking longer with more authorization on spend. We saw more deals move from Q3 into Q4 but also into FY \u2013 early FY \u201824. Part of the reason really is budget constraints. Clients want to pursue even cost-saving projects, but they don\u2019t have all the IT resources they need or some of that requires some initial upfront spend to accommodate. So for us, many of the opportunities that we see in the pipeline are open, but we can see and expect some of that to be delayed. But a clear trend is that clients are looking for more help in taking on some of their non-core activities. And that\u2019s going to provide momentum for us both in managed services as well as data management solutions. And then the last is reduced spend and some reduced hiring. In Q3, we had the same number of six-figure expansion and new logo wins in the previous year, but the average size was a little bit less, 4% lower. And so \u2013 and the expansion that we\u2019ve seen in the past from hiring has slowed down as well. And the same pieces are impacting our new business as well. But the positive sign is that we\u2019re not losing out on the opportunities. The number of deals falling out is the same as in previous years, and we\u2019ve had great strength in the middle-office solutions with performance and risk. So we\u2019re just trying to give our best thinking at this point. We\u2019ve got confidence in all of the client interactions and value discussions, but we want to be realistic as it relates to markets timing and ability to monetize. So it\u2019s about timing as opposed to our faith in the pipeline itself. Brendan Popson : Great. And then just \u2013 a quick follow-up, Linda, on the margin, obviously, last year, you were caught a bit by surprise, the Q3 to Q4 decline. Can you just help us with \u2013 we see updated guidance, but just help us with how you\u2019re thinking about that sequentially? It looks like the midpoint would be almost \u2013 not quite 500 bps, but almost, which is what it was last year. So if you could just help us with how to think about that? Linda Huber : Yes, Brendan, happy to give you some further color on that. So obviously, given the top line situation we had to focus a little bit harder on costs. And we\u2019ve had very good support from the organization to work on this. So you\u2019re right, sequentially, the margin will be considerably higher than it was before. And our guidance of 35% to 36% adjusted is what we have said would be the exit rate for 2025. So we\u2019re well ahead of schedule. In terms of what we\u2019re doing, there are really two concepts here. One is we\u2019re looking to take a charge in the fourth quarter to reduce our run rate going into 2024. And then we\u2019ve also taken some actions to reduce expenses already in \u201823. So let me talk about what we\u2019ve done in 2023 first. So the first thing that we did was we pulled back and pretty much almost slowed and then stopped hiring as we came through the second quarter. So that reduced the pace of salary ramp. And we kind of expect that over the course of the year, that will give us $15 million back. On third-party content, we have done really well. We\u2019ve held costs there very nicely. That\u2019s come in about $10 million lower than we had expected. The technology team has done its part. We\u2019ve increased capitalization quite a bit as you\u2019ve seen. And that has flattered the salary line, and it\u2019s shown up a bit more in the tech line. But still, the tech team has managed to save about $7 million. And then the facilities charges we took last year have come through a bit stronger than we had expected. So that saved about \u2013 that will save about $5 million so all that comes up to kind of $37 million, $38 million that by the end of this year we will be able to save. And then to position ourselves for next year, we talked about a charge we\u2019re going to take in the fourth quarter. These decisions are very, very difficult to make, and we\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking about them and trying to make sure that we\u2019re doing the right thing at the right time. So we\u2019re expecting, as we said, we\u2019ll be taking a charge of about $45 million. Please give us kind of $5 million of variability on either end of that because we\u2019re not done yet. We are expecting that we\u2019ll bring the workforce down by about 3% or less. Real estate will provide another $15 million to $20 million as we talked about before. We will also look to do a few other things which will be helpful. So a total of about a $45 million charge, which will help the run rate as we go into \u201824 to get everything right-sized. Again, these are very difficult decisions, and we really appreciate the support of the entire organization to try to get the cost basis correct as we deal with the air pocket situation in the top line. So I hope that, Brendan is helpful to you. Brendan Popson : It is. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. George Tong : Hi, Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the margin question. Based on your updated full year guide for margins, fiscal 4Q margins are tracking to contract year-over-year to approximately 30%. Can you talk about the reasons behind the year-over-year margin contraction? Linda Huber : Yes, George, I think you\u2019re light by about close to 200 basis points. I think we\u2019re going to be closer to something more like in the 32% range for the fourth quarter. This is the result of we do have more people and higher salary run rate cost than we did at this time last year. We also have a 12.9% increase in the number of employees that we have, though two-thirds of those are in lower-cost locations. So it\u2019s basically that. It\u2019s the increase in both employee primarily salary run rate costs and technology costs. But again, we\u2019ve taken some pretty dramatic actions here to bring the annual adjusted operating margin up 100 bps to 35% to 36%. The fourth quarter is traditionally our heaviest expense quarter, as you know. And we\u2019re expecting our bonus expense there will be somewhere around another $25 million. It\u2019s been pretty consistent over the first three quarters of this year. So as you know, the margin \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, the bonus adjusts depending on how our performance goes. So we expect it to be flattish this year as opposed to last year where we had a big uptick in the bonus accrual in the fourth quarter. So I hope that, that helps you. And I think we have made it clear we have a pretty intense focus on expense control. George Tong : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then your \u2013 you mentioned that the 35% to 36% is a pull-forward of what was originally targeted to be 2025 \u2013 fiscal 2025 margins. Have you provided an updated outlook for what EBITDA margins could be in fiscal 2025? And what would be a reasonable pace of annual margin expansion over the next 2 years? Linda Huber : George, it\u2019s an excellent question and one that we\u2019re spending considerable time on ourselves. I don\u2019t think I want to jump to 2025 when we haven\u2019t even finalized plans yet for 2024 or even given guidance on 2024. So let\u2019s say that we had spoken about, on average, 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion. We\u2019ve worked hard. We\u2019ve moved faster. We get a lot of comments on these calls about what we\u2019re doing with the margin. And I think we\u2019ve proved that we\u2019re working pretty effectively on it. So let\u2019s see how we go. We will have made very good progress this year. And if you have \u2013 if you\u2019re willing to be a bit patient with us, we will talk some more about this as we go into 2024 guidance next in our next quarter earnings call. So a bit of patience, and we will see where we get to. George Tong : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is now open. Alex Kramm : Hey, good morning, everyone. Two questions on ASV. I\u2019ll do them one by one. The first one is a little bit more near-term. Can you just \u2013 when it comes to the fourth quarter and the outlook, there was a question before, but when you think about the guidance here, if I assume the low end, can you actually just tell me what that means for the fourth quarter, what\u2019s implied? There were a lot of restated numbers. I think you\u2019ve done $84 million in organic so far this year. So that would imply, I think, $61 million by my math, but not sure if that\u2019s the right number. And if that is the right number, it\u2019s a slight reduction from last year, but given this environment and slowdown in hiring classes, it seems like it could be worse. So just maybe put that 4Q implied in the context of the environment. Helen Shan : Hi, Alex, it\u2019s Helen. I\u2019ll take a shot at your question here. You may be including \u2013 please keep in mind that CUSIP is included in our numbers. So I can\u2019t quite tie to what you\u2019ve just said. That might be a good question for Kendra later on. But I\u2019ll just talk about perhaps the Q4 pipeline overall, if that can be helpful to you. So when we think about the pipeline, as I mentioned before, it\u2019s a pretty solid pipeline equally weighted across our three workflow solutions. so in analytics, research as well as CTS. Most of the pipeline in the America\u2019s in CTS. And so at this point, given our notification period, we have a pretty good visibility into cancels. So we\u2019ve taken that into account. So the rest is up to execution. Our sales force, as mentioned by Linda, is doing a great job in trying to be diligent and working with clients to close the transaction. So the variables right now are on timing, on decisions. The mix of larger transactions, which tend to take more time \u2013 I mean nearly 70% of our pipeline is in six or seven figures. And bank hiring remains unclear because we\u2019re seeing both increased and decreased hiring classes across the larger banks. So the quality of the pipeline \u2013 and we have ample coverage to meet our ASV range, but there are dependencies on external factors that make this outcome a little bit more difficult than maybe in previous years to predict. So that\u2019s why we give a sense of the range of where we stand at this point. Alex Kramm : Alright. I\u2019ll follow-up on the exact number for the 4Q implied later then. In terms of my second question, this is maybe a little bit of an early look into 2024. But let me put it in context a little bit. If I go back to your investment phase, so basically before you \u2013 I think 2017 to 2019 or so, the ASV growth in average was something around 5%. And I would say when I go and look at that environment, it was a fine environment, not great. And then obviously, you went into a great environment in last couple of years. But now I think we\u2019re seeing layoffs. We\u2019re seeing, even on the buy side, staff reduction. So I would say the environment we\u2019re entering here is markedly worse than what we saw prior to your investments. So again, if I put that in the context of the 5%-or-so growth that you did in that period, like is that a good starting point to think about what\u2019s about to hit here or how would you describe the outlook, I guess, a little bit more quantitatively? Phil Snow : Hey, Alex, it\u2019s Phil. Thanks for the question. So we\u2019re really optimistic about the future. I mean, obviously, there is been a series of things that have happened that have caused clients to slow down their decision making and sort of think more about their businesses during this period. But we\u2019re hoping that with the debt ceiling now getting resolved that we\u2019re sort of at the bottom of that uncertainty. And we\u2019ve done so much to evolve our product over the last few years that we feel we have a completely different mix coming out of this. First of all, the opening up of the platform, that is providing a significant impact to our business and our ability to interact with our clients, co-develop with them, help them with their own digital transformations. And now with this sort of once-in-a-decade event with generative AI really catching hold, we feel like we\u2019re in pole position to take advantage of that. So that\u2019s one thing. And then the investment that we made in deep sector and private markets, which we\u2019re still in the early days of, we believe that\u2019s going to help us significantly on the sell side, Even if the head count numbers are down, it\u2019s going to really help us with retention and expansion. And these investments are also going to allow us to do more in corporate, private equity and other firm type. So overall, we\u2019re very optimistic. We feel that we made the right bets there. And with this new wave of technology, we feel like we\u2019re an even better place to disrupt the market. Alex Kramm : Okay. Fair enough. Helen Shan : Wealth has been the big driver for us as well. So I think we\u2019re really a different company than we were pre \u2013 back in 2017. Wealth has been a huge driver of growth for us and all the investments that we\u2019ve made, as mentioned by Phil. So I do, Alex, think we\u2019re fundamentally much broader, much more diversified than we were back then. Alex Kramm : Alright. Thanks, again, Helen. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Heather Balsky : Hi, thank you. I wanted to ask a couple of questions on the margin. So the first question is \u2013 and I know someone else previously kind of asked about how you\u2019re thinking about margins going forward. But I\u2019m curious in terms of some of the pullback on costs, how much of that is permanent? And how much do you think comes back as sales and ASV start to reaccelerate? And then I have a follow-up. Linda Huber : Heather, I think that\u2019s a difficult question for us to think about or for us to answer right now. Maybe if we ask you to stay tuned as we go into FY \u201824 guidance that would be important. I think the statement that is important here is we are committed to margin expansion, doing that at a reasonable pace with the appropriate balance, ring-fencing the investments that we\u2019re making in the company, that\u2019s very, very important to us. So I think we will continue to keep a very focused eye on the margin, keep the cost at an appropriate level. And we have the wind at our backs with some of the things going on with large language models, which should help with efficiency in our content collection. So I think we will look to honor that 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion on average over the next few years, but not every single year will look the same. And maybe I\u2019ll ask Phil if he has anything else he would like to add. Phil Snow : Well, I just \u2013 I think we have a long-term view of our business. So through all of this, we want \u2013 the top line is very important to us and a year or so ago, we talked about maintaining a high single-digit growth rate over the next few years. So there is certainly that \u2013 we keep that in mind. I think, along with what Linda has been talking about, about sustainable margin expansion. So we feel we can chew gum and walk at the same time, particularly with all of the advancements we\u2019ve made in technology. Heather Balsky : That\u2019s really helpful. And then as a follow-up, it\u2019s interesting to hear about how you\u2019re thinking about investing in AI. And you just mentioned that there is some efficiencies you think you can get from there. I\u2019m curious, essentially with it all being very new, how should we think in terms of investment versus savings? And I realize it\u2019s early days, but are there any plans to kind of ramp investment spend around that so you can realize the longer-term benefits? Do you think you can kind of realize both? I\u2019m just curious how that dynamic works? Phil Snow : Yes. Let me spend quite a bit of time on this. So it\u2019s an excellent question. So the first thing I want to do to frame this for everybody listening is that FactSet is probably one of less than five companies on the planet that has the decades of data that\u2019s important to this industry stitched together in a clean way. So that is so important. And I would argue that the value of even what was called commoditized data before has gone up. So we have that. That is a moat that we will continue to build on. And I talked earlier about the merging of our data \u2013 we\u2019ve created data solutions out of two groups at FactSet, but that is something that\u2019s so valuable to FactSet, the content refinery. We\u2019ve done a lot already to re-architect our data hub and how we collect data, but this is going to supercharge those efforts essentially. So that is the foundation, something that\u2019s critically important. FactSet is also masterful. It\u2019s stitching data together. So you\u2019re going to have to have well-coded data, quality data. You\u2019re going to have to have the trust of the clients in this market. You don\u2019t want to have products that are creating hallucinations or things that aren\u2019t true, right, for our clients. So FactSet has all of those components. We\u2019re going to be focused on three things. First of all, the product, we want to create that wow factor for our clients and the ability to come in and essentially surface anything or ask questions. And a lot of the examples that are out there today in the market, we\u2019ve been doing those few years. You can already go into FactSet into our search bar and type in sort of basic questions and get those answers back very accurately. We\u2019re focused on the next level of that. So that\u2019s important. We have a lot of people thinking about that. Content collection, which Linda just mentioned, this is something that we\u2019ve been doing for decades. We\u2019ve gotten more and more efficient at it over the years, and we continue to invest in that. So this could actually provide a great opportunity for more efficiency, but it could also create an opportunity to put more \u2013 even more data in the platform. So that is something we have to consider carefully. And the third bucket is really the support of our clients. I mentioned in my opening comments that about 50% of the help desk questions we get are around FactSet FQL language or FDS codes, which I\u2019m sure many of you are using and have used in the models that use to build FactSet and other things. So these are three areas of significant impact. The whole company is rallied around this. It\u2019s one of those things that really just gets everyone motivated. So it\u2019s a little less about like how many millions of dollars are we going to set aside to invest in this. It\u2019s how do we get the whole company thinking about this and making sure that this is part of the fabric of what they do every day. So we\u2019re so energized by this, and we feel there is a massive opportunity for us moving forward in both the product side and potentially the efficiency side. Heather Balsky : Great. Thanks for help. Phil Snow : Yes. You are welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Hans Hoffman : Hi, good morning. This is Hans on for Stephanie. Could you just update us on the pipeline in the wealth channel? And could you give us an update or an idea of the mix of the customer size in the pipeline? Is it mostly kind of large contracts that you could potentially win there? Or is there sort of a lot of smaller wealth advisers that can move the needle for you? Helen Shan : Hi, it\u2019s Helen. I\u2019ll take that. Thanks for that question. Many of the wealth firms right now are looking to modernize their platforms. We\u2019ve seen that most recently with RBC, Bank of Montreal, Rockefeller, Raymond James. And so to that end, we\u2019ve really helped develop our brand in the wealth space. And then the open and flexible technology solutions is really separating us from the competition, especially as it relates to adviser dashboard and the other FactSet components that really lock into a client\u2019s CRM or other platforms. So as a result, we\u2019re having a lot of robust efficiency conversations with both existing and prospects. And so the pipeline is quite strong. In fact, I would say it\u2019s as high as we\u2019ve seen in recent years. But this goes back to the same dynamics I\u2019ve talked about before that, especially on larger deals, the ability for a client to make a decision and to execute is taking more time and seeing your attention. We\u2019ve got several large ones, great opportunities, but they need to have the capacity on their end to execute. So as I mentioned, we feel very, very good about that, but that, that may take a bit of time. So to your question around the rest of the book and the sizes, it\u2019s really a mix. You\u2019ve got lots of small ones coming through last year. I would tell you that we had a lot more new logos in wealth, especially as they are hiring more teams. This year, that\u2019s been a lot softer. So we\u2019ve seen some net pullback there. But we remain very positive on our ability to continue to gain share in the wealth space. And it really is both on the large deal front but as well as on the smaller transactions. And we continue to grow at high single-digit and low double-digit levels. Hans Hoffman : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just in terms of revenue growth, could you maybe parse out in terms of how much is coming from price, cross-sell and new logo wins? Is it still kind of roughly one-third between those three buckets? Or is there maybe any one of those kind of driving growth here? Helen Shan : Sure. It\u2019s very much still similar. I would say for new logos, it is a little bit less than we\u2019ve had in the past. We\u2019ve usually talked about two-thirds coming from existing, one-third coming from new. I would say it\u2019s a little bit lower because of the market. Our price increase this year has been a terrific driver. So that\u2019s a bit of a bigger piece of our existing. And we\u2019ve had great acceptance in terms of the clients understand the new value that we\u2019ve added over the course of the year, and we\u2019ve not had much pushback as it relates to our ability to capture that amount. Hans Hoffman : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Toni Kaplan : Thanks so much. Wanted to go back to the topic of data. And so I guess there is two questions that I wanted to ask. So Phil, you mentioned the value of the data going up, and we\u2019ve definitely appreciated that as well. I guess, one, do you see that potentially impacting the cost of the data that you\u2019re getting going forward? And two, wanted to also understand maybe some additional color on initiatives in terms of creating the proprietary data. Just what are you getting that is not from public filings? Anything like that would be super helpful. Thank you. Phil Snow : Sure. I think Linda mentioned earlier, we do get quite a bit of data from third parties, but we\u2019ve done a good job of managing that. And as we move forward, I think \u2013 given the tools that we have totally, I think there is more that we might be able to do that \u2013 where we\u2019re self-reliant on that. So maybe sources that historically, we relied on third parties for that we didn\u2019t have the capacity to get or just focused on, it presents that opportunity. So there is going to be a balance there for sure. But I think we collect so much of the data ourselves, and there is a ton of value in that, that we feel like there is a good balance. And because of our platform, third parties are going to continue to need to pipe their data through platforms like FactSet, where clients want a consolidated, well-integrated approach where they get the analytics and support on top of it that they expect. So that balance for us, I feel very good about. I think net-net, we will be positive on that one. In terms of data that we get from non-public source or from sources that are more difficult to collect from, there is a lot of stuff that\u2019s easy to collect like the SEC filings obviously. But there is a lot of stuff that you can get from local municipalities that\u2019s in badly formatted Word documents or PDF files or other places that stuff is available. It\u2019s just historically been very manual and very difficult for companies to collect at scale. So those are the types of things that we can now scrape together in a much easier way. A lot of that you could attribute to sort of deep sector-type data. So that would be a good example for me. It\u2019s just continuing to go deeper in the current industries that we\u2019re looking at for deep sector and more and making sure, more importantly, that all of those data points are stitched together. So it\u2019s one thing to collect the data, but the other thing is how do you tie it together so that analysts like yourself can make sense out of the data and you have to spend less time on lining that up yourself. Toni Kaplan : Super helpful. And I know that it\u2019s a little bit early to start talking about price increases for next year. But I did want to just ask, you\u2019ve been working a lot on price optimization and bundling and a strategy around that. Just trying to understand that if we go into a period where it\u2019s just more challenging than it has been, I guess, how do you see price playing out in sort of a worse environment? Are you able to still optimize price well because of the strategies you have in place? Or does potentially next year, if things stay like they are now, is pricing a little bit less of a driver in that type of environment? Thanks. Helen Shan : Sure. I\u2019ll take that one. And it\u2019s a timely one given what the UK just decided this morning as well. So yes, you\u2019re right. With inflation coming down, that would impact our ability to raise our prices next year. But we are continuing to have that higher price realization from packaging, from bundling. We are selling very much from a firm-type perspective, which allows us to really bring a much more fulsome solution to the client. So the average size, what we\u2019re trying to aim for, Toni, is also a larger per transaction, and that will be one of the things that we look at from a KPI perspective. I will say, for existing clients, even this quarter, we continue to improve our price realization nearly 120 basis points. Now on new business, we\u2019ve seen that come down, and it\u2019s not surprising as you think about the environment that we\u2019re in and more competitive situations. So we\u2019re being smart about that. We might drop a bit in terms of the pricing for new business, but then we try to lock in for longer contracts. So that\u2019s the push and pull on that. But it\u2019s still a little bit early to talk about \u201824, and we will see where things land later on in the fall. Toni Kaplan : Thank so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse AG. Your line is now open. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thanks so much. I don\u2019t know if this would be Linda or Phil, but Linda, I know you mentioned some green shoots potentially forming. Can you maybe help us reconcile that to the 3% head count reduction? Is that a function of just more efficiencies or just reallocation? I wanted to start there, if possible. Linda Huber : Yes. I\u2019ll take a start and then Phil may have some more to say about this. So I think we have to adjust the business for the top line that we have now, Kevin. And I think there is sort of a lagged effect here on some of the decisions that banks made earlier in the year. So it\u2019s possible that this is the darkest point here before the dawn. We don\u2019t know. We hope that that\u2019s the case. So we need to rightsize the employee base and make sure that we\u2019re putting the right resources against the right products, for example. We\u2019re being very careful in how we\u2019re selectively pruning the employee base. Less than 3% is a reasonable change but not one that should have a huge impact on how we run the business. You\u2019ve heard from some of the heads of the global banks that they are seeing some green shoots, that capital markets activity is picking up, that M&A activity is picking up. So it\u2019s hard to keep the capital markets down for more than a year at a time. We will be looking forward to FY \u201824 and seeing what\u2019s going on there. But it\u2019s possible that we\u2019ve come through the most difficult time. As we said in the prepared remarks, we\u2019re seeing different situations from different companies. Some are preparing for what may be an upturn next year. Others are still in consolidation mode. So people are sort of all over the place, and we\u2019re managing our business prudently to make sure that we\u2019re dealing well with now and we\u2019re very ready for what comes next. Maybe Phil might want to add to that. Phil Snow : And maybe I\u2019ll just add, too, some thoughts on the core buy-side business at FactSet. So I know at the end of our press release, it shows our growth rates for buy side and sell side, and it shows the buy side going down, I think, 80 bps. So part of that really just has to do with the fact that we\u2019ve now included CUSIP in those numbers. So I think you can attribute about 75% of that change to just CUSIP being included, which is a mid-single-digit grower. But when we report the buy side, it includes, at least today, institutional asset management, asset owners, hedge funds as well as partners, corporates, wealth and private \u2013 not private equity, that\u2019s on the sell side. But the IAM hedge fund and asset owner firm types all did better this Q3 than last Q3. So despite this environment, we\u2019re doing really well with the buy side. And the middle-office solutions that we have in analytics are best-in-class now. And we feel like all the work we\u2019re doing to improve the front-office experience on the buy side is going to begin to pay off pretty soon. So we feel really good about that. So despite this environment, when you look at our user count, it went up this quarter. It didn\u2019t go up as much as last Q3. But every firm type that we have, we had an increase in users. So we do feel like we\u2019re sort of through the worst of it, but it does take clients a little bit of time to sort of feel that themselves and begin to speed up decision-making again. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to snap back immediately. But we do feel as we sort of work our way out of this that we feel good about our prospects going into next year. Kevin McVeigh : That makes a lot of sense. And then just, Linda, as a segue there has been a ton of M&A in your sector, right? Nasdaq just acquired Adenza, Deutsche B\u00f6rse in the process of acquiring SimCorp, really underscores everything that you folks have been bringing in the market for a decade now. Any thoughts as to where you focus it within that ecosystem? And then you had some decent detail on next-gen workflows, and I\u2019ve never thought of you folks historically as much on the back office. I guess, maybe any thoughts on M&A as you potentially consider it internally or potentially externally? I know that\u2019s probably a tough question, but what you\u2019re seeing in the market is really endorsing what you folks have been doing for a decade. So, just any thoughts around that? Phil Snow : Yes. So I mean, obviously, you highlighted two of the deals that recently came to market. So I don\u2019t \u2013 I think what Nasdaq is doing, that\u2019s \u2013 we don\u2019t compete with Nasdaq. And I think the business that they acquired, we don\u2019t \u2013 we won\u2019t really play in that workflow. But we feel very good about our strategy, our consolidated platform, our prospects. We feel like we have the scale to continue to take market share aggressively. Linda and her team have done an awesome job of sort of getting CUSIP integrated with the rest of FactSet and paying down our debt into the range that we committed to. So we do feel that we\u2019re very well poised here if we wanted to do something. And to sort of build on Linda\u2019s comments, we\u2019re beginning to see some activity, right? So some interesting things are beginning to bubble up. We\u2019re in a position to do them if we want to. And we\u2019ve been consistent in saying that the areas that make sense for FactSet are wealth, private markets those are at least a couple. We haven\u2019t changed our view there. It\u2019s just a question of when those assets that we\u2019re interested in are becoming available and if we can get them at a price that makes sense for the company. But it is something we\u2019re focused on, and it\u2019s a muscle that we\u2019ve continued to develop. Anything you want to add there, Linda? Linda Huber : No. I just, Kevin, wanted to point out, we levered up in order to do the CUSIP deal to 3.9x gross leverage. We\u2019re back down inside the 2.5, which would be sort of a more normal range for the investment-grade ratings that we have from Moody\u2019s and Fitch. Now we\u2019re down to 2.2x gross leverage. We\u2019re slowing down on repaying our term loan, sort of moving to $60 millionish a quarter of paying back that term loan. So we have room even within leverage levels for our current rating. And then we have a very good track record with the rating agencies that we took our leverage considerably higher and then we brought it down. We committed to doing that and we executed on it. So we feel that we could take that path again if there is something that Phil feels is strategically important to us and hits our hurdles of having appropriate growth rates and appropriate margins. So the finance team\u2019s job is to be prepared and provide capacity, and we think we have that. So I think we will continue to lean forward in our fox holes, and we will see what happens next. Kevin McVeigh : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is now open. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, thank you very much for taking my questions. Just from a high level, I just want to make sure I am understanding what happened in bridging the commentary from last quarter to this quarter? Last quarter, the discussion was that small to midsized clients were slowing decision-making, but the larger clients were really kind of on the same path that you guys had expected. Is what\u2019s happening now that your \u2013 the larger clients are also kind of slowing down on that decision-making? And then also in the banking clients, it seemed to be last quarter, you thought that, that was something that was very much tied to what you would have seen if there would have been contagion from Silicon Valley Bank and then First Republic. And we didn\u2019t really see that, but is it a matter of kind of the markets just being choppy so that the clients are still kind of hard to read in terms of where it\u2019s going to net out for hiring? I just want to make sure I am understanding that that\u2019s really what\u2019s going on behind it. And then I have a follow-up question about cost takeout. Helen Shan : Thanks Shlomo. This is Helen. I will try to get to all those points. If I miss anything, please call me back in. So, I think last quarter, what we indicated was that we were seeing slower decision-making across the other firm types, so not focusing on small or mid, but just separate from banking. So, I think that, that is what we are continuing to see as this last 90 days. So, it wasn\u2019t based off of size. It was more of an overall other than the banking firm type we were trying to pull out separately. If I think about banking overall, I would say that the impact of the layoffs is probably a little bit more than we had expected, really due to the market. You are right, we don\u2019t necessarily see the contagion from SVB necessarily. They were not huge clients of ours per se. Obviously, Credit Suisse is one. And so I think there is more of the general deal level, which as Linda alluded to, if that picks up, then we will likely ride with that. But until their confidence comes back, we are seeing a more muted hiring. Now, it does depend. Some of the firms are actually same as last year and some firms have come down. So, that\u2019s a little bit why the mix is a little bit harder to tell. So, that\u2019s the difference that we have seen, Shlomo. Since the last 90 days, we have continued to see some pullback on banking. And the rest is more, as I said, let\u2019s call it, 50% of the total, 30% is really due to delayed deals, and the rest is reduced size and some additional erosion. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. And then just I am not used to seeing FactSet doing more kind of general reductions in force. Usually, the company, at least in the prior downturns, I didn\u2019t see that very much. Can you talk about a little bit where you are taking the costs out? I mean how are you being surgical enough to make sure that you are not impacting the potential to grow the business? Phil Snow : Hey Shlomo, it\u2019s Phil. Thanks for the question. So, I will frame it for you this way. So, we have \u2013 I talked in my opening comments about a bit of a reorganization that we are going through. And we have started a bit of that. The rest of it will happen by September 1st. But part of this rationale is really getting better aligned by firm type, so some products move around within the business lines. All of the quota-carrying staff moved under Helen now. So previously, we had our sales specialists for the different product lines in the business line. So, they have now been organized by workflow. And then thirdly, we brought together the content and CTS teams because we were creating sort of an extra layer on top of the content to deliver it. But because we have made so much progress in how we collect the data and send it internally to our engineers, that makes sense to make one team. So, that\u2019s one thing. The second thing is, this year during our investment process, we went through the product portfolio and decided to de-prioritize some product lines that historically we have been very reluctant to do. So, it was a bit of a sort of reemphasizing what\u2019s important to us, what do we need to do less of and what should we be investing more in. And then as we have sort of evolved as a company, we looked at some roles that historically had made sense for us to have, but maybe we need a less of those now. So, it is less about just pure cost reduction even though it\u2019s obviously important for us to manage the margin and deliver operating income as we have described. But what I would say was the combination of those things. So, I feel very good about this and obviously we have grown our headcount significantly in the last year, right. We have grown our headcount by at least 1,000 people. So, we talked about reducing our workforce by less than 3%. So, I think this is just is sort of good annual managing of the business as we set ourselves up for the next year. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Thank you. Linda Huber : It\u2019s Linda. You had asked a question in your written work and we want to make sure we get all the questions answered. You had asked about what\u2019s going on with other income, and the answer to that is about $3.3 million on that line. We had some old CTS receivables which had been written off, but that money came through, so that shows up in other income just so you are clear as to where that\u2019s come from and thank you for noting the reduction in \u2013 of five days in days sales outstanding going from 46 to 41. So, Thanks for that and I think we will move on. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Owen Lau : Yes. Thank you for taking my question. So, going back to AI on both revenue and expense line item. On revenue, could you please talk about how Gen AI can potentially impact your revenue model? So, is it more like this is an add-on service that allows you to better negotiate for pricing or you can separately charge for AI-enhanced products? And then on the cost side, I mean there is a lot of excitement about the cost-saving opportunity. But could you please give us a sense of how much labor costs you can, let\u2019s say, save if you have a full AI implementation today? Thank you. Phil Snow : Sure. Hi, it\u2019s Phil. Thanks Owen. So, the way we are thinking about it at least today, right, is we are just going to significantly improve the search capabilities on FactSet. That\u2019s sort of one thing that we are focused on. We think there is other sort of research that we can produce from the content we have today that will be valuable to clients. So, we are still evaluating this. But my guess is, right, that we are going to just continue to improve that experience of the FactSet user that\u2019s using like some version of our product, which will allow us to take more market share from our clients and improve retention. So, I think that\u2019s how I would think about it for now. And on the cost-savings side, yes, it\u2019s easy to sort of put numbers in a spreadsheet and say, okay, we will get rid of half of this type of user. But it\u2019s obviously, not that simple an equation. So, data and technology keeps moving, it always has. You always need to produce more value than you did the previous year. So, the question for us is that balance between, okay, what are the cost efficiencies we can gain versus how much of that do we want to reinvest in the product. So, we are going to maintain that long-term view. And I think even if we felt we could take out significant costs, we believe, again, that the top line is important and reinvesting that in more functionality and more data is a good thing. So, we are at the beginning of this. It\u2019s moving very quickly. We are moving very quickly. And as I mentioned in my opening comments, we think that the big buckets of opportunity are within products, within content collection and with support. But we just \u2013 we don\u2019t know exactly where it\u2019s going yet, other than we feel really good about our position. Owen Lau : Got it. And then on the deep sector work, a few of you mentioned a little bit on that. Can you give us a little bit more color on the timing to launch more products. I know you have some beta products there. And then would that 3% labor reduction impact the pace of this deep sector work or no? Thanks. Phil Snow : No, absolutely not. Deep sector is one of our major product initiatives. It\u2019s gotten significant investment over the last few years. It\u2019s getting more through this year\u2019s investment process. And we are including it in \u2013 today in our products. So, if you are a FactSet user today, you will just see more and more functionality and more data appear, depending on what company you are looking at and what sector that\u2019s in. We are also creating feeds of this. So, the discrete product sales would be more feeds if you wanted to use that as part of your quantum research product. But it is having a nice impact for us, particularly in banking now with retention. And a lot of these \u2013 a lot of why you win or lose in banking is these large multiyear deals with the bigger banks, and we feel that we are in a better position than ever as those come up for renewal. Owen Lau : Alright. Got it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Phil Snow : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Your line is now open. Craig Huber : Great. Thank you. Can you talk a little bit further about the investment firms out there that your clients and talk about the pipeline, the tone of business and maybe separate it between the hedge funds, the mid-sized investment firms in the global investment manager out there. Is there much difference between that going right now? I know you touched on this before. I just want to hear a little bit further about the tone of business and the pipelines across the three separated out, please. Helen Shan : Sure, happy to do that. So, when we take a look at the investment management firms, I break them out into a couple of different pieces. Like you said, there is hedge funds. We call it \u2013 in our buy side, we have asset owners as well as investment management firms. The larger ones who have begun and really are committed to their digital transformation are the ones that we have the most success with because they are ready to go and they really are working with us, whether it\u2019s through blueprinting things that we have done with them or to really help put in some of the solutions for them. So, that pipeline has remained strong. And so when I talk about the fact that they are clients that are ready to make \u2013 move forward, but maybe are constrained either by bandwidth or by initial dollars, that\u2019s \u2013 those are the ones, Craig, that I am more referring to. I think some of the smaller firms, if they haven\u2019t really started that or gotten committed to that journey, then those are the ones that are pulling back right now and not necessarily spending where they would have done it last year. As it relates to hedge funds, we have actually done quite well with them. They continue to form new bids and actually are buyers of our data. And it doesn\u2019t even \u2013 when we talk about funds, it doesn\u2019t even have to be hedge funds. It can be for any of the asset managers. If they close a fund and open a new one, a new fund, we are able to capture that as well. So, that\u2019s really the state of what we are seeing in the markets. Craig Huber : Thank you for that. My final question, CUSIP, I heard you say somebody say briefly, you said growing mid-single digits. Is that what it actually grew year-over-year in the quarter we just finished here? And what\u2019s sort of your outlook for that business? And how has the integration gone from your perspective so far? Phil Snow : Well, so the integration has gone swimmingly well, and we believe that we are going to hit all of the metrics that we set out to meet on the numbers side by the end of the year. Issuance is a bit down. I think you probably saw that in quarter \u2013 in this quarter. But if you believe that the markets are going to come back, hopefully, we see an upswing there. But all of the commentary we made previously about this business, which we don\u2019t break out completely separately, none of that has changed. Craig Huber : Great. Thank you. Phil Snow : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Mazzoni with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. John Mazzoni : Hey. This is John filling in for Seth. Just a quick one, could you just remind us what percentage of the international book was captured during this round of price increases? I believe you said 7% more year-over-year. But what was that base? Helen Shan : Hi. This is Helen. So, the number \u2013 I am trying to get to your 7%, but we are up $17 million in price increases, which is $4.5 million higher than the previous year. And of course, this is on top of the $31 million that we captured in Americas in the last quarter. John Mazzoni : Okay. And then maybe just on a different note, if kind of the environment continues to be a bit sluggish. Could you just remind us around the different levers have been pulled? And really, if what area we are in, in terms of innings, in terms of the downturn playbook, and what those buckets could look like if we would potentially see another year or 2 years of kind of sluggish economic growth and potentially lower headcounts? Thanks. Linda Huber : Yes, it\u2019s Linda. I think we had talked about the headlines being we are looking to take approximately a $45 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter. And we are \u2013 we started with the easier to move buckets, maybe not easier, but the ones that probably have less implication for the employee base. So, we started with real estate. We have taken a total now of close to \u2013 when we get down in the fourth quarter, close to $80 million of real estate downsizing. So, that one has been worked through pretty well. When we talk about third-party data, an increase in costs of only 1.9% in a highly inflationary environment, that one has gone very well also. And on the technology budget, you know that we are keeping some capabilities on-premises, which saves $20 million over 5 years. And we have greatly increased capitalization through accurate time tracking. So, we have dealt with the tech budget as well, and we continue to do so, focusing on third-party software purchases and also on cloud usage, which is not for clients to make sure we have got all that right. So, then we get to people, and that\u2019s where it gets tricky. We took the steps of taking hiring just to essential hiring, then to hiring freezes. And only now are we looking to do somewhat of a reduction in the number of employees that we have. But as Phil said, we had increased the headcount by 1,000 people over the course of the last year. So, trimming by 3% seems to be a reasonable choice. Now, if the situation gets worse, we will have to think further about this. The big buckets are the technology spend and the people expense. So, we will continue to look at those. But I think we have done a pretty good job in pulling back on all our costs. That\u2019s why you see margin guidance going up 100 bps. So, a lot of good work being done across the organization to make sure we are right-sized and we have the right resources in the right places. Hope that helps. John Mazzoni : It does. Great color. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Faiza Alwy : Yes. Hi. Thank you. So, I know we have covered a lot of ground. I just had a couple of quick clarification questions. One is a follow-up on Alex\u2019 question regarding the ASV base, if you don\u2019t mind just confirming for us that the base for fiscal \u201823 for that $145 million increase is $2027.4 [ph] million, I think that would be very helpful for everyone. Helen Shan : Alright. The base, meaning the total amount of ASV that we have right now? Faiza Alwy : The total amount of ASV that you had at the end of fiscal \u201822 that you are going to grow off of by $145 million. Helen Shan : Got it. Kendra is going to come back to you specifically on that because we want to make sure that we are giving you apples-to-apples. Faiza Alwy : Okay. Phil Snow : If that\u2019s unclear, yes, in all of your follow-up meetings, I think we can hope we will get to that. Faiza Alwy : Okay. It sounds good. And then just a second, I guess it\u2019s a clarification question, and I might be stating the obvious. But what I am hearing is that given the overall macro environment, demand environment, we might be below the medium-term targets as it relates to the top line or the ASV growth. But we expect to make up for it on margins such that we are able to maintain the 11% to 13% EPS growth outlook that you had talked about at Investor Day last year. Is that the right way to think about fiscal \u201824? And if so, are there any parameters that you can put around it? Linda Huber : Yes. Faiza, taking this question first, while my colleagues are looking for those numbers to make sure we have it right, it\u2019s too early to talk about 2024, but we take very seriously the responsibility of rightsizing the cost base so that we could hit our margin targets and thus our EPS targets. I think it\u2019s pretty important to note that despite these difficult conditions, we have taken up the margin guidance for this year, which is a pretty important change for us. And you are correct on the margin focus and also the EPS number. I will turn it back over to Helen for any follow-up on the top line. Helen Shan : Yes. No, I just wanted to go back to your question to make sure that I understood it. So, if you are asking about the total ASV for FY \u201822, I think you said 2027.4, that is the number I would use. Faiza Alwy : Okay. So, we should expect that number to be up by $145 million to get to the fiscal \u201823 ASV? Helen Shan : Well, it depends on where we end the year. But yes, our ranges include CGS, and this would include CGS as well. Faiza Alwy : Okay. If I can just follow-up on that because it does imply that the three-month growth in ASV from 3Q into 4Q sort of accelerates given where you ended 3Q. So, I am curious, like is that just timing, or is there something else that we didn\u2019t talk about on the call that\u2019s going to help the acceleration? Helen Shan : I think probably this makes sense for you to follow-up with Kendra afterwards. I am not sure when you say accelerate. If you are asking whether our fourth quarter is larger than our third quarter, the answer is yes. Historically, it has always been larger, and it will be larger this time around as well. Faiza Alwy : Okay. It sounds good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. Keith, your line is open, please check your mute button. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is now open. Andrew Nicholas : Hi. Good morning. Appreciate you taking my question. I just have one because you covered quite a bit, and it\u2019s on the content collection side. It sounds like that\u2019s one of the major opportunities you have identified in terms of cost savings and one of the maybe operational benefits tied to AI. I am just curious, and I apologize if this is too technical a question. I am not an engineer. But is \u2013 what is it about the shift from \u201cregular AI\u201d or historical AI to generative AI that is making that a more realistic or outsized opportunity? Is it making kind of the coding that goes into content collection cheaper or more efficient, or is it the technology\u2019s ability to maybe understand language better? I am just trying to understand what has changed over the past six months that makes that a bigger deal today versus last year, as an example, especially considering you are a company that\u2019s invested in machine learning and AI for several years, as you noted. Phil Snow : Yes. So, I mean that\u2019s a pretty technical question. So, there are \u2013 the things that you mentioned certainly will help there. We are exploring all of the different things that could make it more efficient. Today, the content collection process is a combination of machine and humans. So, we feel for a lot of things \u2013 just obviously, you are still going to need a human in the loop for good judgment and so on, quality assurance. So, it\u2019s probably a little bit more of the tools themselves evolving to a way where we can get the information in front of the human in a more teed up way where it makes them just much more efficient. So, we use StreetAccount as the first example here. So, our StreetAccount new service, which many of you use, does an awesome job and it has historically of pulling together lots of different sources, getting it in front of a professional who then puts it into bullet points, which make it so easy for you to consume. And what took one of these very skillful people 30 minutes to do previously for an S&P 500 company took them two minutes, right, in this last iteration. And that\u2019s just like at the very beginning of trying something fairly simple. So, that\u2019s a massive efficiency. We still need that person to look it over, make sure that they are adding the added value that they will always add to get there. But that\u2019s just one very clear example. This is a rapidly evolving space. And we just \u2013 we are partnering with lots of firms here, and we are evaluating lots of different LLMs, including open-source. But we are very encouraged by the early signs that we have seen on both the content collection side as well as the coding side. Andrew Nicholas : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Russell Quelch with Redburn. Your line is now open. Russell Quelch : Yes. Thanks for having me on the call. So, in terms of generative AI, following on from what you just mentioned there, I guess we may be at the point where this starts getting reflected into relative valuations, and I think it likely comes through the multiple before the P&L. So, I was interested to hear, Phil, your comments that the FactSet is in pole position to be a beneficiary on this topic or in this area. And maybe a challenge to that view would be that generative AI is likely to primarily benefit proprietary data owners that have invested sort of label their data and have built their own LLMs in-house and popular, particularly if regulation stops financial service companies using open-source data and models. So, given some peers are more tilt towards proprietary data and have built their own fully labeled data sets and proprietary LLMs for financial markets, can you maybe explain a bit more your comment on why you think you are in a pole position in this area, please? Phil Snow : Sure. Thanks Russell. It really has to do with the data that we have on FactSet. So, we collect a ton of proprietary content ourselves. We also are very \u2013 are trusted to integrate third-party as well as client data. So, it\u2019s that amalgamation and that library of all that data that\u2019s well stitched together that investment professionals will need to use. And it\u2019s the reason they have used platforms like FactSet over the years. So, we are in a \u2013 that\u2019s what you need to really get going. I think if you are a firm that doesn\u2019t have that data already, I am sure you could start today and maybe be more valuable in the future. But recreating all of that history for a fundamental analyst, a quant analyst, if you are looking at client portfolios, it doesn\u2019t matter. That is one of the key things that folks are going to need. So, it\u2019s not going to matter how good your technology is unless you are pointing it at quality data. And there have been other instances in our industry of people trying to come up with cheaper alternatives of FactSet and other providers. And I don\u2019t think many of those have been successful, frankly. So, I do think that given the data we have, given the relationships we have with our clients, given all the investment we have made in our platform to sort of be AI first and open the platform and redo the content refinery, all of those things for us \u2013 and having the relationships and the trust with our clients, all of those things add up to me to be a very powerful formula. Russell Quelch : Yes, that\u2019s interesting. Thanks Phil. And maybe just as a quick follow-up in terms of different topic, ASV. Is there a risk to the medium-term ASV guidance? And will you be revisiting the medium-term guidance at Q4 in addition to providing 2024 guidance? Phil Snow : If you are talking about the medium-term guidance we gave out at Investor Day, I think it was last April, yes, we are obviously going to be taking a close look at FY \u201824, and we will give more color on that when we speak to you in three months. Russell Quelch : Okay. Thank you very much. Phil Snow : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Jeff Silber : Thanks so much. I know it\u2019s late. I will just ask one. You talked about the uncertain environment here. And I think, Linda, you said you might be optimistic that there might be darkest before the dawn. What are you looking for? And what should we be looking for to get some confidence that these guys are starting to open up a bit. Phil Snow : Hi. It\u2019s Phil. I will start and I will let my colleagues chime in if they want to. One of the things of these banking hiring classes, that will be very interesting to see. I think we have seen a bit of both already, but we don\u2019t really get good color on that until we get further into Q4. So, if the larger banks decide to hire classes of the size they did previously or larger, that is a very good sign to us. Continuing to look at our premier clients, as Helen mentioned, we have done very well within some of the largest buy-side firms. For me, that\u2019s one of the most important things that we can do. Some of the slowdown you have seen is just we have had less new logos from corporate clients, private equity, venture capital, those types of firms. But for us, just seeing that confidence and engagement from the biggest banks and the biggest buy-side firms, that for me is most important. And we have terrific engagement on both sides now. So, clients really want to talk to us. And the fact that we now have opened up the platform, we have a lot to say in terms of data and technology. We are getting a level of engagement that previously we hadn\u2019t. Something we did last quarter, which is worth mentioning, is we had something called Developer Day. So, we had over 200 clients log into a session of FactSet where they met with our engineers essentially and got educated about all the ways they can now code directly against FactSet and use us. And that\u2019s something new for us and I think a very good sign of things to come. Linda Huber : I would add that \u2013 it\u2019s Linda, in the past short period of time, we have come through 500 basis points of rate increases from the Fed, the banking issues that were happening in March, credit contraction that\u2019s resulting from some of those issues, and then the self-imposed debt ceiling issues that recently cleared. So, those are four macro factors that have been very disruptive to the capital markets that have absolutely nothing to do with the health of FactSet\u2019s basic products and business. So, the capital markets are cyclical. And for those of you who are newer to the industry and perhaps earlier in your careers, this sort of capital market slowdown happens every few years. And generally, when the markets reopen, things rebuild very quickly. The hiring and firing cycles at banks, Helen and I were talking about just the other day as two former investment bankers, they wax and wane. It\u2019s just the way the industry works. So, I would caution against overreaction, but I will turn it over to Helen and see what she has to say. Helen Shan : I will echo what Linda said. And I guess one other piece for you to consider, unfortunately, our banking book is built on multiyear contracts. And the bulk of the ASV, which is with the large global banks, have minimums. So, from a headcount perspective, in that specific situation, the cancel exposure is less than 3% of our total ASV. So, to the point that Linda is making, one of the things that we will be looking at is as hiring picks back up, we will see that pick up as well. Our focus during these periods of time is on retention. We want to keep what we have. And again, our high ASV retention, I think is a real \u2013 is emblematic of the long relationships, but also the work that we have been doing. And so when the \u2013 hopefully, the markets pick back up, there is greater confidence by clients, we will see that expansion and new pick up as well. So again, we are very comfortable with where we stand today. Jeff Silber : Alright. It\u2019s very helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Phil Snow for closing remarks. Phil Snow : Thank you all for joining us today and all the great questions. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. In the meantime, feel free to contact Kendra Brown with additional questions. Operator, that ends today\u2019s call. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Kendra Brown, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kendra Brown : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FactSet's fourth fiscal quarter 2023 earnings call. Before we begin, the slides we will reference during this presentation can be accessed via the webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at factset.com and are currently available on our website. A replay of today's call will also be available on our website and via phone. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions from investors. This call is scheduled to last for one hour. To be fair to everyone, please limit yourself to one question. You may re-enter the queue for additional follow-up questions, which we will take if time permits. Before we discuss our results, I encourage all listeners to review the legal notice on Slide 2, which explains the risk of forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the appendix of the presentation and in our earnings release issued earlier today. Joining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer; and Linda Huber, Chief Financial Officer. We will also be joined by Helen Shan, Chief Revenue Officer, for the Q&A portion of today's call. I will now turn the discussion over to Phil Snow. Phil Snow : Thank you, Kendra, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased to share our fourth quarter and full year results. We ended fiscal 2023 with organic ASV plus professional services growth of 7%, and we delivered annual revenue of $2.1 billion and adjusted EPS of $14.55. In 2023, we grew our business on the strength of our enterprise offerings that drove large strategic wins across several workflows. We expanded our presence with existing clients, while adding new logos and new users, both on and off platform. On the buy side, our industry-leading analytics and middle office solutions drove a significant performance deal, as asset managers and asset owners rely on FactSet to serve more of the portfolio lifecycle. Additionally, a large real-time deployment at an institutional asset manager underscored growing demand for cloud-native market data services. On the sell side, deep sector drove a key banking deal in the fourth quarter and continue to be a deciding factor in renewals, situating us well to increase market share in banking. Our strategy to deliver the leading open content and analytics platform continues to resonate and drive growth. But the pace of change is accelerating. While we have been innovating with machine learning and AI for a long time, the recent advances in generative AI have made it possible for us to step up our development. In the second half of 2023, we began moving significant resources to GenAI in anticipation of directing further investment to this area in fiscal 2024, putting it among our top initiatives. FactSet's content refinery provides us with a real competitive advantage. We have one of the most extensive suites of proprietary and third-party data in the industry, and we continue to invest in new categories of data to further power the workflows of our clients. On top of our content refinery, we are reimagining the FactSet user experience and actively exploring innovative solutions. For example, a conversational user interface that allows bankers to ask questions, discover and source information, and initiate tasks. Generative AI will also help us evolve our productivity suite, further deepening our competitive moat. Second, on the buy side, we are enhancing our portfolio manager bot to answer questions in conversation with asset managers. Thirdly, in the front office, we are harnessing generative AI to create code in FactSet's programmatic environment, reducing the need to know Python. This will make the power of that programmatic environment available to more users. For wealth managers, we are developing solutions to drive the next best action and to create portfolio summaries for proposal generation and client engagement, and we are establishing GenAI-ready data bundles, allowing clients to augment their own large language models, or LLMs, with our connected auditable data. We also see significant opportunity for cost savings as a result of GenAI projects targeting our efficiency. In fiscal 2023, we began to pilot AI coding initiatives to improve the productivity of our technologists. We also started using our agent assist bot to help with client queries and we are accelerating the collection of unstructured data across our content refinery with our recent acquisition of idaciti, giving us industry-leading expertise. As we enter fiscal 2024, we will build on our strategic investments in content, generative AI, and technology to drive growth and forge deeper client relationships. On the buy side, we intend to use our leading portfolio analytics and middle office solutions to grow our front office market share. We expect our new portfolio manager workstation and open programmatic environment to drive growth. We also see opportunities for FactSet to provide some targeted managed services based on our years of experience. On the sell side, we believe that deep sector and private markets offerings will drive workstation wins across banking, corporate, and private equity and venture capital clients. We see an opportunity to capture additional seats in underpenetrated areas with solutions for senior bankers and investor relations professionals, and we expect increased adoption of Cobalt, an anchor product for private equity and venture capital funds. In wealth, we anticipate capturing more market share as we focus on portfolio management, proposal generation, and intelligent prospecting to expand our addressable market. Our open and flexible platform will power business development and reporting solutions to connect advisors with clients seeking new sources of insight. Finally, we expect the demand for our off-platform solutions to continue to drive growth across firm types. Turning now to our fourth quarter results. Growth was driven by Analytics & Trading and CTS, with improved expansion across most firm types. Asset owners continue to have momentum with new logos, transactional revenue from Portware and data feeds. While macro uncertainty continue to contribute to elongated sales cycles and slower decision-making across all firm types, our sales team successfully executed on several large wins and renewals as we ended the fiscal year. And looking across our regions, organic ASV growth in the Americas was 7%. Performance was driven by asset owners and CTS wins among partners and hedge funds. This was offset by weakness among asset and wealth management clients where retention remained under pressure and expansion was lower. As expected, we also saw lower seasonal banking hiring, which was a common theme across all regions. In EMEA, our organic ASV growth was close to 8%. We saw growth in asset owners, driven by analytics, middle office solutions. Wealth growth was also driven by Wealth Workstation and Advisor Dashboard wins. Gains were partially offset by softer expansion in banking and asset management. Finally, Asia Pacific delivered organic ASV growth of 8%, driven by strong growth in Japan, where we saw an increase in large deals, analytic wins, and strength in channel partners. However, muted expansion in Australia and India from fewer asset management wins and lower seasonal hire in banking were headwinds to growth. Turning now to our workflow solutions. Analytics & Trading organic ASV grew by 9%. Growth among asset owners accelerated the most, driven by middle office solutions, workstations, and feeds. CTS, which is now part of Data Solutions, grew fastest, with organic ASV growth slightly over 9%. Performance was driven by channel partners and asset management clients, although partially offset by lower professional services and decreased retention in banking. Our data management solutions, company data, and real-time offering were the major contributors to growth. CGS also contributed to performance with healthy expansion and new business. Among asset managers, workstation erosion was offset by analytics and CTS wins, coupled with a higher price increase. Research & Advisory grew organic ASV by 5%. In banking, workstation and deep sector wins were offset by increased erosion. Private equity and venture capital clients continued their track record of double-digit growth despite market headwinds that offset improved pricing realization. For corporates, reduced client budgets were an obstacle. Looking ahead, we are focused on diversifying our solutions for our corporate clients. And finally, in wealth, we saw strong execution on several renewals in the face of clients' cost-cutting exercises. As discussed last quarter, we have reorganized our business by firm type to better align our operations with those of our clients. As of September 1, Analytics & Trading has become our institutional buy side organization, focusing on asset managers, asset owners, and hedge fund workflows. Also, as of September 1, Research & Advisory has become our dealmakers and wealth organization, focusing on banking and sell side research, wealth management, corporate and private equity and venture capital workflows. And we've combined our Content and Content & Technology Solutions groups to create one Data Solutions organization. Going forward, we will also be aligning our partnerships in CUSIP Global Services organizations for the purposes of discussing ASV, as they are both key parts of our growth strategy. You can find ASV and ASV growth rates from the perspective of our realignment in the appendix of today's presentation. As we look ahead to fiscal 2024, we expect the year will be a tale of two halves. Unlike previous years, where clients had higher budgets to spend before the calendar year-end, we expect continued caution for the rest of 2023. Starting in the new calendar year, we expect an improved operating environment to drive a strong second half. As such, we are guiding to organic ASV growth of 7% for fiscal 2024. Linda will provide more detail on guidance shortly. Looking forward, we have started seeing green shoots of market recovery, particularly in new business. New logos in the fourth quarter showed an improvement over the reduced deal volumes seen earlier in the fiscal year. We expect this trend to continue as the new business pipeline and potential ASV for wealth management, private equity and venture capital clients and partners are all outpacing the pipeline at the same time last year. As client sentiment improves and markets stabilize, we believe we are in a great position. Our new structure, best-in-class solutions and content sets us apart as the partner of choice for our clients. I'll now turn it over to Linda to take you through the specifics of our fourth quarter and full year performance. Linda Huber : Thanks, Phil, and hello to everyone. As you've seen from our press release this morning, we delivered Q4 organic ASV plus professional services growth of $145 million. With 43 consecutive years of top-line growth, FactSet has a proven history of stability during market volatility, which is clearly demonstrated in our performance. I'll now share additional details on our fourth quarter and full year performance. As Kendra noted, a reconciliation of our adjusted metrics to comparable GAAP figures is included at the end of our press release. The 7% growth rate for organic ASV plus professional services was in line with our most recent guidance for the year. Our sales team executed well, building on a strong first half and a higher price increase across a larger client base. However, during the second half of the fiscal year, the team had to deal with increased erosion, softer expansion, and a slight decrease in new business. Turning to revenue. Our full year revenue of $2.1 billion was also within our guidance range of $2.08 billion to $2.1 billion. To help offset the weaker top-line, we carefully and thoughtfully trimmed our headcount, which helped to expand our adjusted operating margin by 230 basis points to 36.2%. This increase exceeded the top end of our guidance range of 36% and our previous medium-term outlook goal of 36% by the end of FY '25. Finally, both GAAP and adjusted EPS were impacted by a one-time charge of $6.8 million and an approximately $20 million provision for confirmed and expected unrealizable tax assets. This higher tax rate provision had a $0.68 negative impact on fiscal '23 adjusted EPS, resulting in an adjusted EPS growth of 8.3% to $14.55. Without this one-time adjustment, adjusted EPS would have been approximately $15.25, or 13.6% growth. I'll provide more detail during the tax discussion later in the call. Turning now to our fourth quarter results, as Phil noted, we grew organic ASV plus professional services by 7% year-over-year, as higher price increases offset erosion and new business began to pick up. We also continue to improve pricing discipline, which is driving stronger price realization. For the quarter, GAAP revenue increased 7% to $536 million. Organic revenue, which excludes any impact from acquisitions and dispositions over the last 12 months and foreign exchange movements, increased 7% to $535 million, driven primarily by Analytics & Trading. For our geographic segments, organic revenue grew by 6% in the Americas, 9% in EMEA, and 10% in Asia Pacific. Growth was primarily driven by Analytics & Trading and Research & Advisory in the Americas and Asia Pacific, and by Content & Technology Solutions and Analytics & Trading in EMEA. GAAP operating expenses increased 14% year-over-year to $419 million, driven by higher facilities impairment expense and restructuring costs. Compared to the previous year, GAAP operating margin decreased by 460 basis points to 22%, primarily due to those non-recurring charges and higher technology costs, partially offset by lower third-party content costs and lower FX impact. Excluding both non-recurring costs, GAAP operating margin was about 800 basis points higher than the prior year. On an adjusted basis, operating expenses grew 4%, driven primarily by technology expense, which increased 26% year-over-year. This was mainly due to higher amortization of internal-use software, increased third-party software costs, and accelerated cloud spend as part of our hybrid cloud strategy. We also invested in our content refinery expansion and other strategic areas, such as generative AI. We have continued to invest in technology to drive growth, with technology costs now representing 9% of revenue, consistent with our medium-term outlook of these costs being 8.5% to 9.5% of revenue. People expense grew 3% year-over-year, primarily due to increased salaries for existing employees. As a percentage of revenue, our people expense was 168 basis points lower than the prior year, driven by a lower bonus accrual, partially offset by higher salary expenses. We ended fiscal 2023 with a bonus pool of $105 million and with 67% of our employees operating in our Centers of Excellence. Adjusted operating expense growth was partially offset by a reduction in our third-party content costs, which decreased 4%. Our team continues to do a stellar job proactively managing and negotiating contracts. As a percentage of revenue, growth in third-party content costs was 57 basis points lower year-over-year. Finally, our efforts to right-size our real estate footprint resulted in a 7% decrease in facility expense year-over-year. As a percentage of revenue, this was 50 basis points lower than the previous year. Overall, adjusted operating margin improved by 210 basis points to 33.6%. You'll find an expense walk from revenue to adjusted operating income in the appendix of today's earnings presentation. As a percentage of revenue, our cost of services was about 75 basis points lower than last year on a GAAP basis and 85 basis points lower on an adjusted basis, largely due to personnel costs, expenses related to CGS, and technology costs. And SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 385 basis points lower year-over-year on a GAAP basis and about 125 basis points lower on an adjusted basis, primarily due to decreases in professional services, partially offset by increased personnel costs. Facilities impairments as a percentage of revenue were around 440 basis points higher year-over-year on a GAAP basis. Turning now to tax. Our tax rate for the quarter was 39.9%, compared to last year's rate of 10.3%. This increase was due to several factors. First, we had higher pre-tax income, which increases the overall tax rate, as credits related to R&D and foreign earned income are less impactful. We also saw a diminishing benefit from tax incentives in our Centers of Excellence. Finally, the finalization of prior-year returns came into play. Our fourth quarter results include an out-of-period adjustment related to an ongoing review and analysis of certain tax positions, resulting in a one-time charge of $6.8 million and $20 million provision. We believe this $20 million provision represents the maximum remaining amount of net unrealizable tax assets. Upon completion of our review and prior to filing our Annual Report on Form 10-K, we plan to take a one-time charge with respect to this provision to reflect the confirmed actual amount of net unrealizable tax assets. The final amount of this charge is not expected to differ significantly from the current $20 million provision. At this time, we've concluded that this adjustment is not material to the current period financial statements. The adjustment relates to the accounting of tax balance sheet accounts, including deferred tax assets and liabilities. All local, federal, and foreign taxes payable have been paid in a timely manner, subject to normal audits of open years. The increase in tax provision was partially offset by higher benefits from stock option exercises and refunds from amended returns. Looking ahead, we expect that higher pre-tax income will increase our overall tax rate. In addition, our foreign tax rate is expected to be higher due to the increase in the UK statutory rate. We've taken strategic measures intended to offset our overall rate and are guiding to 17% to 18% effective tax rate for fiscal '24. GAAP EPS decreased 37.5% to $1.68 this quarter versus $2.69 in the prior year, driven by non-recurring charges and the higher tax provision, which had a $0.68 impact. On an adjusted basis, EPS decreased 6.4% to $2.93. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $172 million, up 8.6% year-over-year, due to higher income tax add-backs and impairment charges, partially offset by lower net income. And finally, free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending, was $156 million for the quarter, an increase of 15% over the same period last year. This was primarily driven by the timing of income tax payments, partially offset by higher capital expenditures. For the fourth quarter, ASV retention remained greater than 95% and client retention was 91%, which speaks to the stickiness of our solutions. We ended the quarter with almost 8,000 clients with 383 new logos added year-over-year. And user count increased by about 10,000, primarily within banking, corporate and private equity and venture capital firms. For the quarter, we repurchased 264,400 shares for $109.6 million at an average price of $414.63. At the end of fiscal '23, we had $4.5 million available for share repurchase. As a result, our Board authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $300 million, which became effective on September 1. We intend to continue our share repurchases in FY '24 with a target to repurchase $250 million spread ratably throughout the year. We remain disciplined in our buyback program and committed to returning long-term value to our shareholders. Combining our dividends and share repurchases, we returned $315.3 million to our shareholders over the last 12 months. As a reminder, we also increased our dividend by 10% in the third quarter, marking the 24 consecutive year of dividend increases. And finally, turning to our guidance for fiscal 2024, as Phil discussed earlier, we expect a weaker first half of fiscal '24 and a stronger second half, driven by improved client sentiment. As client budgets reset at the turn of the calendar year. We expect to execute on our existing pipeline. Given these expectations, we are guiding to incremental organic ASV plus professional services of $130 million to $175 million, reflecting 7% growth at the midpoint. And with respect to modeling income and expenses for the year, please note that for the full year, we expect interest expense to be $60 million to $65 million and capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $90 million to $95 million. We expect adjusted operating margin of 36.3% to 36.7%. At the midpoint, this provides 30 basis points of continued margin expansion. While we have already met our adjusted operating margin medium-term outlook of 36%, we are committed to balancing continued sustainable margin expansion with investments to drive top-line growth. Finally, adjusted EPS is expected to range from $15.65 to $16.15, which represents 9% growth at the midpoint. In closing, we are encouraged by the opportunities before us. In 2024, we anticipate that our investments in generative AI, connected refined content and digital solutions will drive expanded market share and increased retention. We are equipping our teams to harness the rapid pace of innovation to remain the partner of choice for our clients. We're now ready for your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Seth Weber with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Seth Weber : Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask for a little bit more color on the wealth business, if you could. I saw the ASP was really strong, up 9%. But then I thought I heard in your comments some comments about some client cost cutting. So, I'm just trying to understand really what the message is there. And if you could just give any more detail on larger accounts versus smaller and the broader competitive environment? Thank you. Phil Snow : Sure. Hey, Seth, it's Phil. I'll start, and I'm sure Helen has some additional comments. So, we're very bullish on the wealth space. As we've talked about before, we think there's a lot of opportunity and a lot of addressable market for us. We've been very successful with our core FactSet offering for advisors. We've layered on Advisor Dashboard. And we believe the bigger opportunity moving forward is to get into some adjacent workflows in the wealth space that traditionally we haven't served. So, we view it as a good opportunity. I'll start with that. I would say across most firm types this year we did see more pressure. Wealth was not excluded from that. So, I think we grew wealth probably close to 13% last year and maybe 9% this year. So, we still grew well. We didn't get as many new logos as we had. I don't think there was as new -- as much new firm creation in this environment. And we may not have had one of those mega deals that we might have had in previous years. But overall, we feel good about the space. And Helen, do you want to add on to that? Helen Shan : Yeah. No, thank you for that. Phil is exactly right. I mean, we do have a pretty healthy pipeline, and it is a mix. We have some very large opportunities with full deployments and then we've got smaller ones, which may be more seat-driven. If you compare it to 2022, where there was a lot more hiring going on, that's a bit of the difference. And as noted, we didn't have a mega deal this year per se, but there's a lot of opportunity in the pipeline that supports that. So, we feel very strongly about wealth. And quite frankly, if you look at where a lot of the clients are focused on, they're all focused on their wealth businesses also. Seth Weber : Okay. And do you feel like you're gaining share there? Is that still the opportunity as well? Phil Snow : Yeah, absolutely. We feel like we're gaining market share, yeah. Most of the wins are displacements of other competitors, yeah. Seth Weber : Perfect. Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is now open. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. Linda and Phil, I was hoping you'd just help with the '24 guidance a bit, particularly your comment that you assume that budgets improve in the second half. Let's just say they don't improve, I guess, how much of the impact is that that you've assumed in guidance? And if you could just clarify within the 6% to 8%, the confidence level and what the pricing assumption is? Phil Snow : Yeah, we feel good about the 6% to 8%, Manav, that's why we put it out there. I think if we break it down by firm type, we anticipate doing about the same level of growth on the buy side as we did this year. And as you know, we've been evolving into more of a solutions provider for our clients. So, despite headcount pressure, which we certainly did see on the buy side, we still think there's a great opportunity to take market share. We are anticipating slower growth within banking. There are some things in the pipeline that I think Helen might be able to speak to. But we're not anticipating a blockbuster hiring here in banking as part of our algorithm. We just spoke about wealth, so we're definitely anticipating some acceleration on the wealth side. And then, in the partners part of our business, which we're now separating out a bit, we're expecting a more constructive environment there. We actually had -- it wasn't a great year for us in that part of the business. I'm not talking about CGS, CUSIP, I'm talking about the rest of the partners business. So, Helen, do you want to give some more commentary on the pipeline? Helen Shan : Yeah. You made a -- Manav, hi. You had a question around pricing. I mean, we continue to have and been making good progress on capturing the value that our clients are receiving for our solutions. In '23, we actually improved our price realization across our workstation packages by over 100 basis points through the renewals in our new sales. So, we're continuing to resonate well there. And as you know, our annual price increase takes place in January for Americas and April for outside of the Americas, with contractual base of higher CPI of 3%. So, with inflation moderating and a larger book, we would expect some impact from price increases to be less than '23, but still a healthy contributor. So, we'll report more on -- out on that when we get to Q2 and Q3, as we've done in the past. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Jeff Silber : Thank you so much. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned that the adjusted operating margin guidance for '24 is already ahead of where you thought you'd be in 2025. I'm not going to ask you about your 2025 numbers. But maybe just longer term, how do you get that margin expansion going forward? What kind of levers can you pull? Linda Huber : Yeah. Hi, Jeff, it's Linda. We have made very good progress and we're quite proud of that. As we move forward, we feel that our workforce -- our people is a big potential contributor to this. So, as we said for FY '24, we think the growth in that bucket will be about 3% to 4%; real estate, probably 3%; and third-party growth -- data growth of about 3% to 4%. So, all of those are pretty modest numbers and we feel like we've made really good progress. On technology, it's a different story. We are a technology company. We're driving harder for AI. And so, we had talked about a 24% increase in the technology budget for FY '24. A lot of that is the increase in amortization for third-party -- for our own software, increased third-party data purchases and, most importantly, increases in cloud expense as we have some facilities now on-prem and we're getting ready for increased usage for GenAI. So, what I think will happen in the future is we'll see the technology line start to flatten out as we get to peak amortization and then things start to move down in that regard. But again, really, really great control over three of the cost items. And then in technology, we just have to continue to invest. So, hope that helps you out. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kelsey Zhu with Autonomous. Your line is now open. Kelsey Zhu : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, CTS, including CUSIP, grew by 9%. I was wondering what the growth rate would look like for the original CTS business and CGS. And then I think when you acquired the asset, you were guiding for a mid-to-high single digit growth for CUSIP. Is that pretty much still the goal going forward? Thanks. Phil Snow : Yeah. Hey, Kelsey, it's Phil Snow. Yes, I'm happy to provide those numbers. So, the CTS -- the Content & Technology Solutions business, which is now part of Data Solutions, that grew at close to 11% on a year-over-year basis, which actually, if you compare it to last year, it was a little bit lower, but almost the same. So, I would characterize this year as being a very good year for CTS and really speaks to the value of our data and the myriad of ways in which we deliver it to the market. The CUSIP Global Services business, or CGS, grew a little -- from an ASV standpoint, grew slightly under the growth rate of the firm. So, I think you'd probably have a pretty good idea of the size of that business based on data we've given in the past. So, I think you should be able to triangulate everything that you just asked me pretty well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is now open. Alex Kramm : Yes. Hi, good morning, everyone. Just coming back to the guidance for a second. You talked about these, like, two halves. So, maybe you can be a little bit more specific around maybe like the near-term trajectory here. I know it's early in this current quarter, but maybe what are you seeing? How are the pipelines shaping up? And then, maybe more specifically, clearly, some of these banks have delayed hiring. So, I'm just wondering, if we assume that some of these hires that didn't come in the 4Q maybe now come in the second quarter, is there a dollar amount that you feel like slipped in the fourth quarter that could come? So, just trying to figure out some of the swing factors maybe in the near-term here. Helen Shan : Hey, Alex, it's Helen. Yeah, I'm happy to try to answer that question, so thank you. You're right, we're early in the year, and -- but we have greater visibility, of course, in our first half. So, I'll talk to that specifically. We are expecting current market conditions in the first half, but I'm going to go by firm type here. So, when you talk about buy side, we actually finished the year quite strong with both asset owners and hedge funds. So, the three things that we see right now in the pipeline is, one, we're continuing to gain traction in the middle office. So, building off of some of the great wins we had in the asset servicing space, we would expect that to continue. Second, we're seeing strong demand in the data feeds business, so both for company data, as well as our data management solutions, where we're really leveraging the strength of our concordance for content for clients. We had two significant wins, one in real-time, one in tech data, both displacing competitors. And as a result, we're getting inbound discussions around that. So that's also filling up our pipeline. And then, third, as Phil mentioned earlier, the strength in offerings we have in the front office are also gaining traction. Part of our GenAI enhancements will be supporting that. And so, we expect to be able to get greater market share in that space. And we actually think that will help on the retention front as well. On the banking, you're absolutely right. We are seeing -- we're going to have a challenging H1 comparison, Alex, because the banking workforce reductions really didn't impact us until our second half, because they came through more in the early spring timeframe. And we also expect most of the impact potentially from any reductions from Credit Suisse to happen more in the early calendar year as well. So, that's going to impact our H1 results. There have been some positives in the capital markets activity, but we're not building a recovery in the first half. So, to your point, we do think that there will be a potential uplift in the second half, but not in the first half. We actually did fine in banking overall, because we had two huge wins : one in equity research in bulge bracket, and the other in a large investment bank. And then wealth, I already spoke to. We have more activity. Our land and expand strategy is working pretty well. We are finding when we're there, we're building on both feed and our CRM solution. So, we expect to see continued cost rationalization, but the pipeline looks decent as we are starting our new year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Faiza Alwy : Yes. Hi, thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask about GenAI. Phil, you mentioned a number of new products that you're working on. And so, I'm wondering, how you're thinking about the timing of commercialization of these products? And do you view this as a new product revenue opportunity? Or should we think about it more as something that's going to help improve retention? And relatedly, it seems like there is a number of smaller new companies that are out there that are introducing GenAI products that folks seem to be willing to pay for. How should we think about your approach to M&A to enhance your position within GenAI products? Phil Snow : Great. Yeah, thanks, Faiza. I was hoping someone would ask about this. So, I have a lot to say here. We're all in on GenAI and AI. The thing that I'll probably stress first for everyone is the value of data. We believe strongly that the winners in this environment are going to be the ones that have the broadest suite of data and the most well-connected data, the most trusted data, and the data that can be source-linked back to where the answers came from. And that's what FactSet has always been about and really at the foundation of what we're building here. So, to answer your question a little bit more, we believe it's going to be a combination of things. So, we are working on a lot of pilots, and I would anticipate that some of those will be coming to market this year. I do believe that it's going to radically improve the experience of most FactSet users that are using the workstation and, as you pointed out, really help increase retention and maybe drive new desktops, right, at the clients we serve. But we also think there's going to be an opportunity for new products. One of those really is just off-platform, essentially. So, we're thinking carefully about this. But there are lots of ways for us to take all of the valuable data we have, bundle it up with some GenAI capabilities and deliver it to clients. So, we're going to create a great experience for clients on our platform, where they're able to search, converse with FactSet, go mile deep for their particular workflow. But we also recognize that some of the larger firms out there are going to want to build some of their own environments. So, as we've always been, we plan to be a pretty neutral here in the ecosystem and provide the best of both worlds. But it's still early days. We're still thinking about this very carefully, but we're very excited about the potential opportunity for us. Operator : Thank you... Linda Huber : It's Linda. We've had an effort to go out to talk to many clients early on in this process, about 25 of them. So, maybe Phil and Helen, you might want to speak a little bit more about the clients. Phil Snow : Yeah, happy to do that. Thanks for the prompt. And yes, so in using GenAI [columns there] (ph). Yeah. So, we've had 25 to 30 under knees tables -- knees-under-table meetings with our clients. We've seen a lot of enthusiasm from all firm types. And a lot of that has to do with our capabilities, the data, the technology, and our relationships with clients. But there's a desire out there to codevelop some things. So, we're working very closely with some large banks. There's opportunities there for bank automation. I think everyone's always felt that, although the processes that are out there haven't evolved much over the years. But I think this is the time they will. On the buy side, I mentioned in my earlier comments, there's an opportunity to radically improve the life of a portfolio manager or a research analyst that's having to sift through so much information. And on, the wealth management side, we talked earlier about other workflows, right? So, can we get into proposal generation? Can we get into augmented prospecting for our clients? These are all great opportunities. So, we're very encouraged and we're moving very quickly. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. At the midpoint of your guidance for ASV plus professional services organic growth of 7% for next year, that guide is essentially unchanged from growth that you saw this year for fiscal '23. And you mentioned that the first half of the fiscal year, we'll see some pressure, followed by improvement in the second half of the year. Does that suggest that you expect trends to get worse compared to this quarter before they get better such that you land at that 7% growth at the midpoint next year? And can you talk about which areas of the business you're assuming undergoes the most inflection over the course of next year? Helen Shan : Hi, George, it's Helen. I'll take that. So, I won't -- I would not necessarily say it gets worse. I think what I mentioned in particular on banking is the comparison, H1 over H1. So last year, a lot of the hiring that was very, very strong, continued on. And so, if you may -- you probably recall how strong we were in our first half of last year. So, in comparison, the impact from the changes in workforce reduction will impact this current fiscal '24 H1. So, when we talk about a stronger H2, we are assuming that there is not an inflection, I will say, necessarily of a pick-up in banking back to '22 levels, but overall hiring and budgets being more open, and that's why we're talking about the fact that we had this fiscal year-end of August, their calendar year clients are generally starting to then make -- open up decisions in what will be our H2, and that's what we were referring to. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is now open. Andrew Nicholas : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to circle back to the GenAI topic, but focus maybe more on the cost side. It does sound like, Linda, that there is an increase in the technology budget to account for some of these investments. Are there any cost savings coming from GenAI maybe operationally within the SG&A line, or just some of the organizational infrastructure you have that you expect to come from these investments? And is that something that that would be embedded in '24, or is that a '25, '26 type benefit if it's there? Thank you. Phil Snow : Maybe I'll start and then I'm sure Linda will add some additional comments. So, we've been looking at how we work ourselves and thinking about how can we be more efficient ourselves internally. We have a lot of engineers at FactSet, a lot of people that code that are even client-facing. So, I think it's pretty common knowledge that there should be some efficiency here, right? So, we're piloting a lot of copilot solutions with our technologies to kind of understand what that means at different levels of the organization. We have a large client service and support group here at FactSet. We've released a tool to about 400 people that are the front-line support for our clients that assist them in generating answers for clients. So, that's in the beginning stages there. And then, of course, we collect tons of data. So, about half of FactSet's employees are in the Content or Data Solutions part of our business. So, we see a lot of opportunities there. So, we do see significant opportunity. The question is the timing and how much of that we'd like to reinvest, right, in terms of some of the new products that we're thinking about to drive growth. Linda Huber : Yeah. Andrew, it's Linda. It's a great point and a great question. I think your view on timing is largely correct. So, we're looking for internal efficiencies maybe to start showing up more in FY '25. Our initial focus will be client-facing in keeping with the way we think about everything here at FactSet. So, what we'll do is look to move some of those tools we're building for our clients and look to apply those to ourselves. But we do think that's probably going to show up in a bigger way in FY '25. You've heard the guidance for FY '24. So, hope that helps. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to go back to the ASV guidance and just better understand the headwinds and tailwinds. As I understand, when we think about some of the headwinds from like the investment banking and [CAS] (ph), as well as increased erosion and pricing normalization, we were thinking that could be in the range of like a 2 points to 3 points of headwind. And obviously, you've talked a lot about the new win momentum, the share gains. Just wondering, is that enough to offset the headwinds as we get into fiscal year '24? Thanks. Helen Shan : Hi, Ashish, it's Helen. Thank you for that question. I think from our perspective, I don't want to say we've hit a bottom. That's too strong of a word. But when I think about this year and last year, I would expect that two things to happen. One is that the erosion reduction will actually be more leveled off, and I think that's an important thing to sort of keep in mind. Banking is key, but we actually grew the number of seats in banking overall. Please keep in mind that part of that isn't just around the clients that we have, but the new clients that we win, and we have a couple of very good opportunities. So, we look at that as part of our -- when we talk to firm type. The second is pricing, which, in the past, I think we've talked about a third, a third, a third. I think from a pricing perspective, it actually added more this year from a percent basis than in the past. We see it continuing to add in 2024, although closer back down to maybe a quarter or less than a third. And I think that's probably more of the -- a bit of a headwind that I would look to than necessarily just thinking about seats. So, that's how I would take a look at some of what's built into our guidance. We have some large deals in there. We'll see if those come through. They got pushed from '23 to '24. And then, there will be, I'm sure, continued focus on costs by our clients. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Heather Balsky : Hi, thank you for taking my question. Just another question on the first half versus second half revenue outlook. You talked about the hiring assumptions. When you think about the back half versus the first half on the wealth and buy side, I'm curious what's kind of baked in your outlook in terms of customer sentiment. And you talked earlier about sort of formation of -- on the wealth side, whether or not that potentially picks up. Just what should we take into account? Thanks. Helen Shan : Sure, I'll take that. Thank you for your question. So, as it relates to the buy side, I think it's a similar piece. What -- our more complex deals take longer. And right now, with the offerings that we have, they are more complex. So, when I talk about delayed decisions, that's where you're seeing a fair number of them as it relates to the analytics business for the buy side. I would see -- again, more of the pickup on hiring will help us. We had erosion in both asset management and wealth. So, if we see increased hiring, which we would expect in the second half of the year, that's where -- that's the driver on that front. On wealth, wealth is an interesting one. Wealth, we have -- as I mentioned, some large deals are in the pipe. So, we could see that come through, but a similar situation, if the -- as the markets recover, we would expect to see the hiring to pick up again in the second half of the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is now open. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, thank you for taking my question. Main question is, I wanted to ask a little bit if you can go back to the comment about some green shoots that you're seeing. And if you can give us a little more specificity? Are those green shoots that you're seeing kind of macro-wise specifically within the clients that you have specifically in your pipeline? Can you just give us a little bit more color on that? And then, maybe just a housekeeping thing. Is there additional interest expense from idaciti acquisition? Is that the way we should think about that? Helen Shan : Yeah, I'll talk a bit about the green shoots. The areas that we are seeing some pick-up a little bit, which is always a bit of a harbinger for us, is on the new business. So, in Q4, new business started to make a bit of a recovery in terms of number of transactions. So, we see that as a positive. The one positive also, I would say, overall, even for new business, is that if I look at the average size of the transaction throughout the year, the volume was lower, but the average was pretty much the same. And that, I think, is a testament to the value that clients are seeing. So, we take that as a positive. The other area is around managed services, which we have seen an uptick there. I've been mentioning asset servicers as something that's a positive, but we will continue to see that as one. And then also, as I can see in the pipeline, what we call data management solutions has also been a driver -- we expect to be a driver for us, and that's been picking up as well. So, when you look at all those pieces, I think that that's really where the benefits come in. And of course, your second question, it's probably best to have that with Ali and Kendra afterwards. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Toni Kaplan : Thanks so much. I was hoping you could talk about your increase in employee count, was about 5% this quarter year-over-year. Is that sort of a normal increase for you now organically, or is it maybe a little bit light? And should we expect sort of around that level for '24? And maybe you could go into, are you hiring sort of more salespeople or technology or product development? Just trying to understand where the growth areas within the employee base are. Thanks. Linda Huber : Hey, Toni, it's Linda. You're right, headcount growth was actually around 5% for the quarter, you're correct. For the whole year, FY '23, it was 9.2%. For FY '24, we're expecting that we're going to continue to add heads at about that 5% rate. But the mix is very, very heavily leaning toward our Centers of Excellence, maybe up to even 80% of those additional folks in our Centers of Excellence. So, in terms of the people costs, we actually took them down by 3% through what we call our Project Blue. We talked about thoughtfully and carefully trimming a bit on the employee base. And we will be looking to do about 5% in terms of hiring for FY '24, but again, very, very heavily leaning toward the Centers of Excellence. I'll ask Helen to talk about any potential hiring for the sales organization. So, Helen? Helen Shan : Thank you. I'm going to ask our CFO if I can do more hiring. No, I think one of the benefits of what we've done this year, which is really to become closer to the client, is to have ourselves go to market by firm type and also by workflow solutions. And what that gives us is the ability to actually become more productive. So, our ability now is not covering different types of firm types and talking about things from a product perspective, but rather knowing the workflow and being able to leverage that across clients. And we've actually gotten some very good feedback from clients on that piece. And maybe I'll just add back to a point that Phil and Linda made around GenAI and our client discussions with a larger -- the top 25. What comments we got back, which I thought was very encouraging, is, one, which differentiates us from some of our competitors and some of these smaller upstarts, that the way we talk to them about how GenAI can help them was about their workflow, not about a product, not about something that they are yet to build, and then we were able to show them how we're already incorporating it into the products we have today. So, I think both of those resonate well, and that's going to help as we go to market with the current sales force that we have. Phil Snow : I'm going to pile on just for a second here on the talent front. So, we're finding this a great environment for talent. So, our retention has improved significantly. Our realignment has allowed a lot of FactSeters to take on new additional responsibilities. But we've also found this a great environment to find some exceptional technology and product management talent from the industry, which is going to be accretive, we think, moving forward. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Your line is now open. Craig Huber : Great. Thank you. Linda, question for you. Given you guys' outlook for revenue second half of the year being better than the first half on a year-over-year basis, I'm curious, on the cost side of things, how are you thinking about cost growth on a year-over-year basis? Is it pretty even you're thinking over the course of fiscal '24, or more back-half weighted? Thank you. Linda Huber : Craig, I think we'll look to our usual pattern of seasonality. Generally, the spend builds throughout the year. And as Helen said, we're looking for the back half to be stronger than the first half, so we'd like to sort of match that with our expense growth. So, I think what we want to do is be very careful on expense growth in the first half of the year. I think that's really important that we try to match up revenue growth with our expense growth. So, we're going to be very thoughtful in the first half of the year. The second half of the year, I think as we build into our technology budget and some things with GenAI start to catch, I think you should look for our normal trend, that expense growth would be heavier toward the back half of the year and, particularly, in Q4. So, hope that is helpful in terms of your phasing. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Phil Snow for closing remarks. Phil Snow : Thank you. Before we wrap up, I want to announce the return of our flagship user conference, FOCUS '24, in Miami next April. We're looking forward to bringing key clients and stakeholders together to network and share ideas on the theme of innovation. Innovation is our focus for the coming year, and I'm very optimistic about our opportunity. And in closing, I really want to thank all FactSeters and our teams for a job well done in fiscal '23. I'd also like to thank Kendra Brown for her excellent work, leading Investor Relations over the past two years. And going forward, she will be heading our Banking and Sell-Side Research business. And as previously announced, Ali van Nes will take over the Investor Relations role. You can contact Ali with any follow-up questions after today's call. Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Operator, that ends today's call. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

After the speaker's presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ali van Nes, SVP IR. Please go ahead. Ali van Nes : Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to FactSet\u2019s first fiscal quarter 2024 earnings call. Before we begin, the slides we referenced during this presentation can be found through the webcast on the investor relations section of our website at factset.com and are currently available on our website. A replay of today's call will be available via phone and on our website. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions from investors. The call is scheduled to last for one hour. To be fair to everyone, please limit yourself to one question. You may re-enter the queue for additional follow-up questions, which we will take if time permits. Before we discuss our results, I encourage all listeners to review the legal notice on slide two, which explains the risks of forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q for discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements. Our slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the appendix to the presentation and in our earnings release issued earlier today. Joining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer, and Linda Huber, Chief Financial Officer. We will also be joined by Helen Shan, Chief Revenue Officer, and Kristi Karnovsky, Chief Product Officer for the Q&A portion of today's call. I will now turn the discussion over to Phil Snow. Phil Snow : Thank you, Ali, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. In the first quarter, we grew organic ASV plus professional services by 7.1% year-over-year, delivering adjusted diluted EPS of $4.12 and an adjusted operating margin of 37.6%. This quarter we closed two marquee deals that serve as proof points for our long-term strategy even as macro conditions remain challenging. The first was a large wealth win at a major U.S. firm where we displaced a competitor as a result of this deal, our user account increased by more than 17,000 seats. The second was a significant trading win at one of the largest U.S. asset managers, highlighting the strength of our open platform and portfolio lifecycle solutions. We ended this quarter with almost 8,000 clients and 24 net new logos, ASV retention remained greater than 95% and client retention was 90%. Nevertheless, since our last earnings call in September, sales cycles have continued to lengthen challenging our near-term forecast. Client budgets remain restricted due to lower deal making volume layoffs and geopolitical uncertainty. So while the Recent Federal Reserve commentary may be positive for the macro environment, we are revising our fiscal 2024 top line guidance to reflect ASP growth of $110 million to $150 million or 6% growth at the midpoint. We will also be implementing a cost reduction program in the Q2 of FY \u201824. This program will support our investments in multi-year initiatives such as deep sector and real time and allow us to accelerate our AI strategic investments. We expect to review variable costs and personnel related costs with the goal of delivering adjusted operating margin within our original guidance range of 36.3% to 36.7%. Linda will say more about this later in the call. Turning now to our performance by region. Growth this quarter was driven mainly by the large wealth win in the Americas, as well as solid demand for data solutions, offsetting weaker results in other parts of the business. Americas ASV growth accelerated 88 basis points over the prior quarter to 7.9%, where outside of wealth, lower net hiring in banking and asset managers led to softer demand for workstations, compared with a year ago. In EMEA, organic ASV growth decelerated to 5.4% mainly due to a slowdown in our core buyside markets in the U.K. and France. Our clients are experiencing reduced revenues and margin pressures which led to delays in planned projects and slower sales cycles. Higher demand for data solutions partially offset these headwinds. In Asia Pac, we delivered organic ASV growth of 8% driven by solid gains with asset owners, partially offset by seasonal banking layoffs. From a firm type perspective, wealth accelerated the most compared with last quarter due to the marquee deal I mentioned earlier. While pipeline visibility remains limited and so the broader market recovered some momentum, ongoing C-suite conversations at several firms point to continued opportunity to displace wealth competitors. For deal makers, we added new logos in private equity and corporates, but not at the rate we saw last year. Churn and lower seasonal hiring led to erosion in banking. On the institutional buyer side, cost cutting and headcount reductions at institutional asset managers caused a deceleration in workstation sales. For asset owners and hedge funds, elongated sales cycles further dampened results. Finally, new business in the sales of data solutions drove growth with partners across regions. Overall, the tension was flat in the first quarter with the positive effects of the fiscal 2023 price increase partially offset by higher cancels and erosion. Over FactSet's 45-year history, new product releases have driven our strong market position. These included Universal Screening in 1986, Portfolio Analytics in 1995, and FactSet Fundamentals in 2008. Last week, we added to this list with the beta release of FactSet Mercury, our new conversational AI interface. FactSet Mercury is a large language model based knowledge agent. It uses natural language to request company information, provide supporting contacts, and also suggests next steps. Users can also ask for any chart using natural language, which is then prepared and delivered into Microsoft Office. FactSet Mercury is part of FactSet Explorer, a product preview program. We are working on Explorer with our leading banking clients and will soon offer it to institutional buyside and wealth clients. Also, last quarter, we released AI enhanced transcript highlights and news summaries, which received positive reviews from our users. These are just the first of many workflows that will use generative AI to improve our client's efficiency. And along with these AI initiatives, work continues on deep sector and real time, the wealth workstation and the portfolio life cycle. Each of these multi-year investments is driving growth, including last quarter's big wins in banking and asset management. Finally, the private credit market is growing fast and is almost the size of the leveraged loan market. It is well served by both our data solutions and our middle office analytics. For example, Cobalt can be used for private credit fund portfolio monitoring. We can also extend our fixed income capabilities to private credit risk assessment, benchmarking and performance monitoring. In summary, I remain confident in our strategy and the health of our business, and I am optimistic about the opportunity ahead of us. Demand for our high-value products remains strong, demonstrated by our marquee wins this quarter, and increased interest from global firms consolidating to FactSet\u2019s open platform. I'll now turn it over to Linda to discuss our first quarter performance in more detail. Linda Huber : Thanks, Phil, and hello to everyone. As you've seen from our press release this morning, Q1 organic ASV and revenue growth exceeded 7%. I will now share additional details on our fiscal first quarter performance. As Ali noted, a reconciliation of our adjusted metrics, compared to GAAP is included at the end of our press release. First, a few observations on macro conditions. Last Wednesday, the Federal Reserve decided to hold rates constant and signaled three quarter point rate cuts next year. Inflation has eased, but remains higher than the Fed's 2% target. Equities rallied on the news as rates fell across the yield curve. While this news was helpful, it will take time for capital markets and deal activity to pick up. As Phil mentioned, we expect that market recovery will come later than we anticipated in our September fiscal year 2024 guidance. For the quarter, GAAP revenue increased 7% to $542 million. Organic revenue, which excludes any impact from acquisitions and dispositions over the last 12-months and foreign exchange movements, increased 7% to $541 million, due to higher wealth sales and increased sales of data. For our geographic segments, organic revenues grew by 8% in the Americas, almost 6% in EMEA and 8% in Asia Pacific. Turning now to expenses, GAAP operating expenses increased 6% year-over-year to $353 million, driven by higher employee expense, technology costs, and royalties. Compared to the previous year, GAAP operating margin increased by approximately 80 basis points to 35%. This was due to a decrease in professional fees, personnel and facilities costs, partially offset by higher technology-related expenses. On an adjusted basis, operating expenses grew 9%, primarily driven by technology expense, which increased 28% year-over-year. We've continued to invest in technology to drive growth with technology costs now representing about 9% of revenue consistent with our medium-term outlook. Employee expense grew 8% year-over-year primarily due to increased salaries for existing employees. Third-party data content costs increased 12%, due to lapping a one-time accrual release in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, as well as higher variable fee expenses. Finally, our continued efforts to right-size our real estate footprint resulted in a 1% decrease in year-over-year facilities expenses. Looking at margin, adjusted operating margin decreased by 70 basis points to 37.6%, driven by the previously mentioned higher technology expenses partially offset by lower facilities, professional services, and T&E expenses. As always, you'll find an expense walk from revenue to adjusted operating income in the appendix of today's earnings presentation. As a percent of revenue, our cost of services was about 140 basis points higher than last year on a GAAP basis and about 220 basis points higher on an adjusted basis, largely due to technology and personnel costs. And SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 230 basis points lower year-over-year on a GAAP basis and about 150 basis points lower on an adjusted basis. This was due to decreases in professional fees, facilities expenses, and personnel expenses. Turning now to tax, our tax rate for the quarter was 15.2%, compared to last year's rate of 13.4%. This increase was primarily due to lower benefits related to stock option exercises and restricted stock vesting. The remainder of the increase was due to higher pre-tax income and a higher foreign tax rate, partially offset by foreign tax credits. Turning now to EPS, GAAP EPS increased 9.1% to $3.84 this quarter versus $3.52 in the prior year. This was driven by higher revenue and margin expansion, partially offset by a higher tax rate. On an adjusted basis, EPS increased 3.3% to $4.12, driven by revenue growth, partially offset by margin compression and a higher tax rate. EBITDA increased $219 million, up 9.3% year-over-year, due to higher net income and higher income tax add-backs. And finally, free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations, less capital spending was $139 million for the quarter, an increase of 56% over the same period last year. This was driven by significant higher net cash from operating activities, which was nearly $50 million greater year-over-year due to higher cash collections. Turning to share repurchases for the quarter, we repurchased 135,950 shares for $59.9 million at an average price of $440.67. We intend to continue our share repurchases during fiscal 2024 with a target of $250 million of purchases spread ratably throughout the year. We remained disciplined in our buyback program and committed to returning long-term value to our shareholders. Combining our dividends and share repurchases, we returned $378.6 million to our shareholders over the last 12-months. As a reminder, we also increased our dividend by 10% to $0.98 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. And finally, turning to our revised guidance for fiscal 2024, as Phil mentioned earlier, we expect that the market recovery will happen later in the year than anticipated when we first gave guidance for fiscal 2024. Given this revised view, we are guiding to incremental organic ASV plus professional services growth of $110 million to $150 million, reflecting 6% growth at the midpoint, down from our original 7% growth guidance. Given the headwinds in ASV and the lag timing of ASV in the first-half of the fiscal year, we are lowering our expected revenue range to $2.2 billion to $2.21 billion. At the midpoint, revenue growth is also expected to be approximately 6%, a deceleration of about 75 basis points from our previously issued guidance. We've reduced our GAAP operating margin guidance to 32.5% to 33%, which is down from 33.1% to 33.5%. However, it should be noted that we have not changed our adjusted operating margin guidance of 36.3% to 36.7%. At the midpoint, this provides 30 basis points of continued margin expansion. While we have already met our adjusted operating margin medium term outlook of 36%, we are committed to balancing continued sustainable margin expansion with investments to drive top-line growth. It is also worth noting that our effective tax rate guidance has been reduced by 50 basis points to 16.5% to 17.5%. And finally, adjusted EPS is expected to range from $15.60 to $16, which represents 7.8% growth at the midpoint and a $0.10 reduction from guidance at the midpoint. As Phil mentioned, we continued to execute disciplined expense management to support strategic investment to grow our top line. Accordingly, we expect to take a $10 million to $15 million charge in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Focus areas for expense reduction include both variable and personnel related costs. Despite the uncertain environment, we remain confident in our long-term growth. We have a diverse pipeline and are seeing improved price realization and increased interest in our products. In addition, our enterprise contracts and diverse end markets provide us with downside protection in an uncertain market. As a result, we are confident that we are positioned well for the future. We are now ready for your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Seth Weber from Wells Fargo. Seth Weber : Hi, good morning. Thank you. I guess I just wanted to ask, get a little bit more clarity on the updated outlook. Can you just talk about whether deals are falling out of the pipeline? Are deal sizes getting smaller? Any pressure on the pricing side? Or do you really feel like this is all just kind of getting pushed to the right just while your customers try to navigate the macro environment? Thank you. Phil Snow : Hey Seth, thanks, it's Phil. I'm going to say a few words and then I'm sure Helen has more detail. So I think clearly we had a good Q1. We had a great win there on the wealth side. Q2 looks to be a little bit weaker than we originally anticipated. And it's always hard to predict when market sentiment is going to turn around essentially. So we're still very optimistic about Q4, and as usual, we have a tail of two-halves. So I think we have the product, the strategy, the competitive positioning to really do well, but we are facing some headwinds in the market just in terms of clients, their budgets, obviously they're looking very closely with their own headcount. Helen Shan : Yes, and maybe I can add a little bit to that. Thanks for the question. So as Phil just said, I do think that the continued demand for our middle office offerings and data and middle office services has really been strong and similarly for data feeds. Right now the total cost of ownership has been the differentiator for us, but there are the exogenous events that are impacting budgets and timing and hiring. So what changed from 90-days ago? Let me try to break that down a bit for you. I would look at around 40 basis points coming from the impact from pricing pressures and lower price realization. We definitely see that being a part of the dynamic that's playing out. We're seeing some impact from higher erosion. That's about 30-some basis points and then 25 basis points coming from what we view as delayed decisions and spend. We're seeing more of that coming into the fourth quarter and from that perspective, that makes it a little bit tougher to gauge exactly when that will come to fruition. We have not seen a lot of fallout. So that again helps us think about the strength of our business, but not necessarily the timing of it. If you think about the reduction by firm type, the way we look at it is about half of it will come from deal makers, which is largely banking. And we can see right now weaker net hires, but it's very difficult to tell until we get into the second-half, as you know, for seasonal hiring. From the buy side, that's about 25% of our total. There we're seeing a bit of the higher erosion due to cost realization, cost rationalization rather, and also delayed decisions. We're actually seeing good opportunities in the six plus figure, but those take longer to come about. And then lastly, on wealth, strength like was mentioned, very strong on the wealth side of a great win this quarter -- wins this quarter. But if I take a look at what else is happening there is that we're seeing some slowdown in advisor hiring and then some losses on smaller firms. We still see a path to hit the higher end of our revised range would have put us back into the midpoint. Things such as higher conviction on the improvement in the capital markets, so that we would see more investments that are in flight go back into technology, higher investment banking flow that we think would drive higher seasonal hiring. And then we've got a number of large competitive opportunities in our pipeline, all in that six and seven figure deal range. And those can change and determine whether or not we hit the high end as well. So hopefully that gives you a sense of what drives the delta between our guidance. Seth Weber : That's great color. Thank you. I appreciate it. Helen Shan : Welcome. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : Thank you. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the price increase that you're implementing for the upcoming calendar year. I know Helen you just mentioned some difficulties in passing through price, but I guess what's the sort of list price increase and what your expectation is for how that flows through? Thanks. Helen Shan : Yes, sure. Thank you, Toni. You're right. We -- the Americas is done on Jan 1 and then our international, we'll see that come through in April. So interestingly, the actual rate cards we have not increased. What we do is we have an annual price increase based off of our contracts. And quite frankly, up till now, we've seen everything go through pretty well. In other words, clients are not pushing back on the price increase per se. They understand it. They understand the improvements we've made and the enhancements we've made. The issue that we have a little bit more of is clients are taking the opportunity then to perhaps go through a review of their list, so we see some erosion that comes from as a result. And also from a price realization perspective, so in other words, we're seeing some down shift. We have to kind of approve deals that are a bit lower on our price realization, about a point lower than we saw in Q4, for example. And that's driving some of that delta. So we expect to have to continue to be competitive especially on new deals and but the actual annual price increase so far has been received pretty much in line with what we've seen in the past. Toni Kaplan : Terrific, thank you. Helen Shan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes in the line of Alex Kramm from UBS. Alex Kramm : Yes, hey guys. Maybe a little bit too short-term focus here, but talking about the second quarter a little bit more in detail, you said that was the biggest change of your outlook. So when I look at last year, I think you added $54 million in the quarter organically. And I think $31 of that was pricing. So are you basically saying pricing should be fairly consistent, but then you may actually have negative elsewhere, or how would you think about the second quarter specifically? Because I know there's a lot of things going on, including at my firm? Helen Shan : Alex, hi. It\u2019s Helen. Thanks for your question and thanks for the specifics. So you've hit the nail on the head on a number of your points. So yes, last year we had a very strong Q2 and so this year, while we've not changed our rate card, the actual annual price increase is a little bit lower than last year. So that is part of the reason, so you're spot on there. The other is that we do know or anticipated a couple of material headwinds, one is the impact of the acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS and the downsizing that occur there. Now we might be a little bit conservative there, but that's going to have a pretty material impact to our growth year-over-year. And that's where the Q2, we will see a much more weak Q2 growth rate. Alex Kramm : All right, thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Faiza Alwy : Yes, hi. Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to follow-up on the cost savings that you mentioned. So maybe, Linda, can you talk a little bit more about the timing of those savings and how we should think about that as we go through the year? And maybe in general, sort of how do you think about just your flexibility as it relates to EPS and your flexibility around level of investments and what your priorities are? Linda Huber : Yes. Hi, Faiza. Yes, we are thinking through what it means to have at the midpoint a $15 million reduction in revenue. So obviously, we would like to offset that and it is our intention to hold adjusted operating margin where we said at about 36.5% midpoint. So we've got to adjust our expenses. We've talked about taking a charge which we will have more details on in the second quarter earnings call. So that's at the half year mark if you will. So we're shooting for about $30 million in cost cuts and we're looking at $10ish or so million dollars of cost cuts. The first thing you do is look at your variable costs. The easiest one is T&Es. We're looking at sort of a $1 million to $2 million of a cut there. Professional services is another one we're looking at. Call that $3 million to $4 million. So call that bucket sort of $5 million in total. And then we're looking also at our bonus calculations. So, we've just taken our guidance down a bit, and we would expect that our bonus pool will come down a bit as well, maybe about $5-ish million, but we don't know until we get to the end of the year. So that would be about a total of $10 million. And then we've talked about a $10 million to $15 million charge, which would probably lean more toward personnel and headcount reduction thoughts. We're working through that right now. We have not made any final decisions on that. And of course, that process has to be handled very, very carefully with an eye toward holding our investment funding, which is incredibly important to us, particularly given AI, which we'll be talking about in a bit. But we want to make sure that we bring our expenses back into line with our revenues. Now if you look at our buckets, we had talked before about if you look at our third-party data costs, they're up a bit in the first quarter, because we lapped a really good audit release last year, but those will be about flat for this year. And if you look at our real estate costs, we've taken pretty close to $90 million in charges to right size our real estate footprint. So on that one, those costs will actually be flat to down a bit year-over-year. Technology costs are going up. We've talked a lot about that. This is a technology company and three big drivers for the tech costs, amortization coming through because we're building more of our software as we've talked about, also more cloud expense and also more third-party software purchases. Footnote there on cloud expense, please watch that carefully. If Kristi and the team are successful with what they're trying to do for AI, cloud expense may go up. We have to watch that carefully, but that's an important area of investment for us, so we'll keep our eyes on that, which leaves people, which is about 65% of our expense base. So we're going to have to make sure we've got everyone in the right place for what we're trying to do going forward. And I think that probably would provide about enough detail. In terms of the ramp for expenses, we put up $338 million for the first quarter. We would expect that to jump up to the neighborhood of $350 million for the second quarter, and then as a result of the charge sort of flatten out through the rest of the year. And yes, our margin tends to be a bit higher in the first quarter. We would see it might come off a bit as we move through the year, so the sort of normal trend that you see at FactSet. So that's a lot of information. I hope that's helpful and really appreciate your question, Faiza. Faiza Alwy : Thank you, Linda. That's very helpful. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. I just want to follow-up on kind of the macro discussion. Usually when you have these times of cost pressures, budget pressures, et cetera, there's a lot of talk around vendor consolidation as well. So I was just hoping, are you seeing any opportunities in terms of, you know, maybe winning business from the lower end or maybe there's some M&A opportunities, you know, because of that? Just hoping you could address that. Phil Snow : Oh yes, hey Manav, thanks for the question, it's Phil. We certainly are seeing opportunity. So as we go through these periods of market uncertainty, it's always a great opportunity for FactSet to work with our clients, who typically want to do more with us and trust us. So that's become an even more sophisticated conversation as our product suite has expanded. And just in the last few weeks, I've heard a couple of very encouraging situations where it just feels like there's more of a top-down push now at the bigger clients to really save, to drive cost savings in our direction. So that is encouraging to me. I think at some firms, there was still a bit of choice given to users, but we are an anchor partner of choice for our clients based on our strategy and our open platform. Our investments in generative AI and our approach there is landing really well. So I just feel more optimistic than I have in a long time about the long-term prospects of FactSet and our competitive position. I'm happy to go through this firm type by firm type, either on the call today or some other time with you. But overall, I think it's just a timing thing for us and getting through this period of uncertainty in the markets and I think them are in really good shape. Helen Shan : Maybe I can just add a little bit, Manav, just along with Phil just said. So like he was talking about, clients are going through right-sizing exercises. That's been happening for several quarters and most clients, their budgets are more flat. But what they're being asked is to provide more sophisticated tools and reporting to their clients. And yet they have not enough people or dollars or their current technology and processes, some of which can be internal, just can't scale. And that's why we're so well positioned on that front. And that's why also from an open platform perspective you can do replacement pieces, not need the entire pieces -- entire workflow replaced, but pieces. And that's worked into our advantage as well. So that really goes to what Phil was just talking about which is there's a lot of good activity and timing is really the question of how complex they are. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Heather Balsky : Hi, Thank you for taking my question. I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about how you're thinking first-half versus second-half and the different drivers between the two? I guess, parts of the year. You know, in prior -- I guess, last earnings, you kind of had us think about the recovery into the back half. It sounds like it's maybe pushed out a bit, but when do you see capital markets come back? Kind of what's baked into the first-half versus the second half? Thanks. Linda Huber : Yes. Heather, it's Linda. I actually listened to an interview with Brian Moynihan on the way up this morning, so maybe we'll quote you back your own firm's information here. I think the question is the timing of the turn, and I don't think anyone can predict that particularly clearly. If they can, they should be, of course, running a hedge fund. But in any case, we have thought this might come a little bit sooner. What we're trying to say is that the turn is going to come a little bit later in the year than we had thought. It should be noted that investment banking and banking hiring is a lagging indicator, okay? So we've had 500 basis points of interest rate increases. Times got tougher and so hiring is in fact a lagging indicator There is a view that I also heard this morning, not from your boss, that Jay Powell shot the bears last week. So, how long will it take for capital markets to come back? If you speak to various institutions, they're saying they're seeing much greater activity right now. The tenure this morning was at 3.9, which beats the heck out of 5. So we would expect that things will turn up. How quickly will that happen? Very difficult to say. So we're trying to be realistic about what we think about the pacing of that turn. But we do particularly with the Fed announcement last week, we do think that it is coming. It just may take a bit longer than we thought. And there's a lot of focus on AI. We have incredible conversations going on with our clients, and we'll be speaking more about that as others might want to ask about it. But we do see the turn coming. It's just a question of when. So I hope that makes things a bit clearer, but we appreciate your boss's interview this morning. Heather Balsky : Thank you, I appreciate the color. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Linda, specifically for you, you talked about what you're doing in terms of cost cutting. But I was wondering, just as I look at various levers that might still be available, when I think about it, like how much can you gain efficiency by AI? I think a lot of the AI you're talking about are for clients. What about the company's own ability to influence some AI internally? I hear from other companies that they can gain efficiency that way? And then just again, the Centers of Excellence, you've got 68% of head count over there. Is that kind of peeked out over there or is that another lever that can continue to be pushed and where does that max? Linda Huber : Yes, Shlomo, I'll let Phil talk a little bit about how far we can go with the Centers of Excellence. But you're right, we have good representation in those Centers of Excellence and that's working really, really well for us. We do have our thoughts on efficiency coming from GenAI. Probably a little bit premature to talk about that. We're going to focus on the client side first and that's really where we're looking hardest right now, but efficiency for engineers is really important, efficiency for our you know our help desk kind of function is very, very important and in future calls we'll talk more about that. Shlomo, to answer a question you didn't ask, we did want to thank you for your noting that we had improved free cash flow and that we collected about $50 million more in cash collection than we did in the previous period last year. So in addition to our giant macro calls that we have to make, we also have to make sure we're collecting our cash appropriately. So appreciate your note on that, but I'm going to turn it over to Phil on COEs and also on the GenAI opportunity for ourselves. Phil? Phil Snow : Yes, thanks. Thanks, Shlomo. Yes, so I think there are three good buckets of cost opportunity internally for generative AI. One is engineering, so we have a lot of engineers at FactSet and we've successfully piloted GitHub Copilot with a number of groups and I think we're deploying that more broadly now. So like other firms we're seeing great efficiency just in terms of the amount of code that someone can produce in the same amount of time. So that is a good opportunity for us. On the content and collection side, there's also a good opportunity. And, you know, over the decades, we have continued to automate more and more of content collection. So this is just a bit of an inflection point. But I was in India, you know, a couple of months ago and sat down with a number of teams and all of them were able to demonstrate to me in some way, shape or form really good efficiency that they could get from collecting all kinds of different databases. And then on the sales front, similarly, I sat down with someone on a help desk and we have a copilot for them, which is really good about generating a code that a user might want. And 50% of our help desk calls tend to be coding calls. So you can imagine that, that's a great efficiency. So the question for us and for any other firm, frankly, if you ask anyone about this, is whether or not you have that efficiency go through to margin or if you use it in other ways, right? So we have a long list of things we'd like to do on the product side. So we're still, a, evaluating how much efficiency we can get and how we'd want to spend that money. Any real impact from those three things, I wouldn't expect to see until FY \u201825 next fiscal year, but we might be able to recognize some of it in -- like later in the second half of this year. The Centers of Excellence, we have great employees there. I think the question is, just can you continue to go up the value chain in terms of what you do in those locations? So we're always evaluating our people and location strategy. And I think we've all learned in the last three years that there are even more options open to us than they might have been in the past. So overall, I'm very optimistic about what we can continue to do to drive efficiency and drive the top line through more product. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. Andrew Nicholas : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask on kind of the M&A opportunity set and your appetite there. It sounds like with the market or I would expect the market being a little bit choppier in the end markets or client budgets rather being a bit harder to pin down that you might be seeing maybe some more opportunities or some more reasonable multiples for potential acquisitions. So if you could touch on that. And then maybe, kind of, bigger picture on the same vein. Do you think that AI and its ability to drive content collection? I think, Phil, you said it reached an inflection point. Does that have an impact on potential multiples as you acquire data assets? Are they easier to get? Are they more valuable now? Just kind of like a bigger picture question on the value of data assets? Thank you. Phil Snow : Yes, thank you. There's a lot in there. So on the M&A front, the three buckets that we continue to spend time on are wealth, wealth technology, private markets and filling out, continuing to fill out the portfolio life cycle. So those are the three areas of higher interest. We do look at other interesting content assets. And yes, your instincts are right. The market is beginning to throw a little bit. I think a lot of sponsors are beginning to bring assets to market as they need to show some returns to their clients. I don't know about the multiples coming down part, but still to be determined. But we're in a much better position than we were six months ago just because we've executed very well on the CUSIP acquisition and effectively gotten our leverage down to the range that we said that we would -- we did what we said we were going to do. So we're active. We're looking at tons of stuff. On the AI front, I mean, the -- I guess I'll answer it this way. The -- I think the winners in artificial intelligence are going to be people that own the data, right? So we're in a great position there, because we have a ton of data that we collect ourselves. We obviously have a lot of third-parties that contribute data into our ecosystem, and we connect that well. That's the real value there. And then clients are also trusting us with their data. So potentially, data -- the price of data assets may go up, but also it might be easier for some newer firms to collect data. Now newer firms that have data are going to need very often platforms like FactSet to monetize that. It's hard to go into a bigger bank or a bigger asset management as a small company and get their attention and get through all of the different things that you need to get through to have that sale. So we're in a great position here. And yes, we're actively looking at what's available in the market. Andrew Nicholas : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Goldman Sachs. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. You talked about restructuring to take out variable and personnel-related costs. Can you elaborate on which parts of the business this is affecting? So how much of this is coming from the desktop business, wealth business, data feeds, et cetera? And how these cost actions are spread out geographically? Whether the actions are more concentrated in certain parts of the world versus others? Linda Huber : Yes. George, it's Linda. We're not going to talk about headcount reductions via firm types. The main reason being that we haven't made our full decisions yet. We're looking to put our investments toward our higher value and our emerging opportunities. And obviously, we're looking really closely at products that we may have had for a while or opportunities that maybe have not lived up to everything that we had hoped for them. Also, in terms of where that headcount might come from, obviously, we have to look hard at our onshore locations to make sure we're getting the best use out of our resources there. But again, all this is in progress right now, and we'll have a little bit more information as we go into the Q2 earnings call. But we haven't made those decisions yet. And I don't think we're going to give that degree of granularity even when we get to that time. We're looking to take out $10 million to $15 million on cost. We're going to do it very thoughtfully. Senior management of the firm is looking at this with great caution to make sure that we're really thoughtful about what we're doing. This doesn't come easily to us. So we want to take the time and get it right. And I don't think we're going to go into too much more detail than that. George Tong : Got it. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners, LLC. Craig Huber : Great. Thank you. I was hoping you could give a little more clarity on the workflow breakdown in the quarter year-over-year by client type, dealmakers, partners, wealth and institutional buy side? And also curious are you basically assuming the second half of the year, which areas pick up significantly versus what we've seen in the first-half? Thanks. Phil Snow : Well, we won't give exact numbers. But what I can say is that banking was probably affected the most. And I think you saw that in our press release, right? We saw, I think, much weaker hiring or more churn on the banking side than we did last year. On the asset management side, things came down a little bit, not dreadfully. We did see definitely weaker penetration in the front office. So we've begun to see the buy-side clients, I think, reduced headcount a little bit more than they have in the past. But overall, the growth rates of asset management, asset owners and hedge funds didn't come down dramatically. Wealth went up quite a bit because of that big deal we had in Q1. And then some of the smaller parts of our business like private equity, venture capital and corporations in an environment like this, we did add new logos in both of those areas, but not at the rate that we might have had in previous years. So hopefully, that helps. Craig Huber : That\u2019s perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Kelsey Zhu from Autonomous. Kelsey Zhu : Thanks for taking my question. So on wealth, I think you previously talked about an acceleration of growth in FY '24 and the general expectations of expanding share and expanding TAM. Obviously, we've seen a large win this quarter, but I was wondering if you can tell us a little bit more about the key drivers and strategy behind that acceleration of growth? You've also talked about expanding into workflows outside of the Advisory Dashboard. So I was wondering if you can give us an update on that as well. Thanks. Helen Shan : Hi, Kelsey, it's Helen. Thanks for your question. Let me try to get to it. So when we think about wealth, as we mentioned, we had a very good win this quarter that helps us a lot. And so when we think about what wealth clients are trying to do right now is that they are looking really to improve and modernize their platform. They started with a lot of the large wealth firms, as you know. And now we're seeing that now with the midsized firms coming through. So that's where we're seeing more of that deal flow. Just as a reminder for the large clients that we have been able to win through competitive displacement that includes Merrill, Royal Bank of Canada, Raymond James and Bank of Montreal. And with this newest one, which actually for us is the one the longest or rather the highest total contract value, there was a displacement of a long-time incumbent. And so we look forward to building that relationship with them for the long-term since our contract with them is actually longer than average over five years. And so as wealth clients, now the mid-tier client -- wealth clients are now coming on board and wanting to modernize their platform because their clients are demanding more sophisticated digital technologies, and they don't have the platform to be able to scale, and that's where they're turning to us. Total cost of ownership is really quite key. And so the discussions that we're having include everything from -- and this is back to your question, whether or not they want to get the data from APIs, for example, which does require more development costs. They need people to put that in versus, say, one of the products we're seeing a lot of demand for us, which are widgets, which are easier to put in and therefore, quicker. So those are some of the dynamics we're seeing. That's where we're expanding beyond the wealth platform only and going into data and then also into the CRM side, which is allowing our wealth clients to focus on their top line and giving their advisers the tools to be able to drive top line growth. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Russell Quelch from Redburn Atlantic. Russell Quelch : Hi, Thanks for having me on. So you had good user count growth and a slowdown in the client growth. And I think that's because of those two large deals you called out. I'm interested in, is this a purposeful tilt in the sales strategy towards targeting larger enterprise deals? And therefore, should we expect ASP growth to be maybe more lumpy, more volatile on a quarterly basis going forward as a result of that approach? And I also wondered, can you be a bit more specific around what you've assumed to be the size of the impact from Credit Suisse in your ASP this year? And if that's all going to come in the second quarter, please? Phil Snow : Yes, I'm not sure we'll be able to speak to the exact size of that. But yes, I think the opportunity for us to do much larger deals is increasing. And what is really encouraging, Russell, is across wealth, which we just saw a big win in, we had a very nice win on the institutional buy side this quarter in trading. And the revenue for that doesn't really materialize until those trading systems get implemented. So that can take a while. We had a fantastic large win in Q4 on the managed services side for performance. And then in banking, we've had some significant wins where we've completely displaced a competitor because of deep sector. So I'm beginning to see in my conversations with the C-suite of our bigger clients a real appetite to engage more with FactSet. So yes, I hope stuff is lumpy, particularly on the upside, right? And when you get those eight-figure contracts or those seven-figure contracts, it can sway things. I think one of the beauties about FactSet's business model is our consistency though. And I think as markets return to more normalcy, we'll still get a lot of single doubles and triples, which will, I think, continue to hopefully smooth things out. But yes, we're always hunting for those big deals and the possibility of us getting those now is much larger just based on the product suite and our open strategy. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Jeffrey Silber : Thanks so much. I wanted to go back to AI. You had mentioned that your focus is more on the client side, and I believe you launched FactSet Mercury. Can we add a little bit more color on that and maybe what your plans are going forward? Thanks. Kristi Karnovsky : Sure. Hi, Jeffrey, this is Kristi. Yes, we're very excited about FactSet Mercury. But maybe it will be helpful if I talk a little bit about the whole AI Blueprint and just highlight the areas in there where I think FactSet is really differentiated in our approach to responsibly leveraging AI to deliver value to our clients. So the first pillar of the blueprint is all about what we call mile-wide discoverability. And FactSet Mercury, which we talked about in the press release, it's our conversational AI interface and it's designed to unlock discoverability of all of the content and functionality that FactSet has to offer for our users. And it's really going to become the mainstay of the FactSet user experience of the future, which is going to be a lot more personalized and insight driven. And I think what's really interesting with Mercury, it's really our approach to providing auditability back to the reports and documents in context, that's going to be a real time saver for users because it's going to enable them to act quickly on that information that they're getting back and then move on with a high level of confidence to the next steps that they're taking. So really, throughout the whole development process leading up to the data release, we conducted extensive user research. And through this, we really validated how important it is to deliver that auditability of the data back to our users. And we've already gotten great feedback on this and how we're approaching that in the client meetings that we've had as well as the other features that it offers like suggested and next steps to guide users to insights that they might not have even realized were available. The second pillar of the AI Blueprint is what we call mild deep workflow automation. So our strategy is really way beyond building an answer bot and kind of stopping there. So we're going user-by-user type, workflow by workflow to leverage GenAI and help streamline the workflows of each of our different client types that we know really well from over 40 years of supporting them. So you would have read in the release that the first release of FactSet Mercury is geared for junior bankers, but it will expand from there. But so for now, for junior bankers, in addition to being able to answer any questions that they have about companies, it can take a lot of steps out of the bank or pitch book building workflow process. So one great example of that is just by enabling them to simply ask for any chart in natural language and then have it delivered to them as a custom formatted FactSet Active Graph, which is then forever refreshable inside their pitch decks. So they don't need to search through a gallery. They don't have to adjust any setting. It's just super easy for them. And then the last pillar of our strategy is what we call mile-high innovation acceleration. We're very excited about what GenAI unlocks in our own product development process, and our teams are busy here, building some really amazing solutions. But it's also, I think, important for everybody to remember that we're developing those things in ways that can be leveraged as building blocks by our clients in their own products. And I think our open flexible approach to this is very differentiated and unique. And we've already begun to commercialize our data solutions in that way. And I think there will be more demand for these building blocks as clients make more progress with executing on their own AI road map. So those are the three pillars. And yes, we're very excited about FactSet Mercury launching into our FactSet Explorer's beta program last week. Jeffrey Silber : All right, thanks. That's really helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Owen Lau from Oppenheimer. Owen Lau : Good morning, Thank you for taking my question. So just a follow-up on the previous question about AI for client side. I know it's still early, but could you please talk about the demand and timing of monetizing Mercury or other AI products? How does it help the contract negotiations so far? And how much have you baked into your ASV growth guidance in 2024? Thank you. Kristi Karnovsky : I can talk -- this is Kristy. Thank you for the question. I can talk a little bit about the approach we think we're going to take here. What I was talking about with mile-wide discoverability with FactSet Mercury, we see that really as a natural evolution of the FactSet user experience. And so some level of conversational experience would be included with our different workstation packages. And I know that this is going to help users unlock more value and improve their efficiency. For what we call the mild-deep workflow automation in our AI Blueprint, things like pitch book building and automation with GenAI for investment banking or portfolio performance commentary for the buy side and other mild-deep workflows. We are currently working on the best commercial models for this. We're going to be able to significantly streamline these workflows and drive a measurable level of efficiency for our clients. So there's definitely going to be value there for them. And I think we're going to be able to share more color in future quarters as we make more progress and we get a little bit further along in the FactSet Explorer beta program. Yes, so hopefully, that gives a little bit more color. Helen Shan : Thanks. And Kristi, I'll add a little bit to what you just said to answer the second part of your question, Owen, which is monetization is one that everyone is trying to determine. I think that you'll see -- or we'll see rather the benefits certainly come through from increased retention. And in fact, it's allowing us to have some very interesting conversations with new clients. So we're going to see how those come through, but it is not baked specifically into certainly the guidance for this year. Owen Lau : Got it. Thanks a lot. Helen Shan : Welcome. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra from RBC Capital Markets. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks for taking my question. Just a question on the six, seven figure deals, which are in the pipeline. Are the closing of those contingent on opening up of the client budgets? And also on the last call, there was a reference around potentially client budgets opening up for calendar year '24. And I was wondering, based on your -- obviously, you had a lot of conversation on macro, but just based on the client conversation, what are the expectations for client budgets for next year? Any color on that front? Thanks. Helen Shan : Hi, thanks for that question. Yes, you're right. We -- as Linda had talked about, we thought a bit of the recovery would improve more quickly into the second half of the year, it's probably a little bit later. And so what we're hearing right now and clients are sort of finishing up their budgeting process that most budgets are probably more flat. And what -- but they're still being asked to do a lot more with what they have. And as I mentioned before, their ability to scale is still something that's top of mind. So to your point around the six to seven figure deals, yes, certainly, some of that will depend on budgets improving. As mentioned, some of the benefit we have in our open platform is you can do things in pieces. So you don't have to commit to the whole redo of a platform, for example. But certainly, as more dollars are being allocated to technology and GenAI, we feel we're pretty well positioned to take advantage of that. Ashish Sabadra : That\u2019s very helpful color. Thanks. Helen Shan : Welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind from Jefferies LLC. Surinder Thind : Hi, Linda, just a big picture question here. I guess if I'm interpreting your prepared comments correctly, it seems like you're attributing some of the change in your outlook to kind of the market recovery taking maybe a bit longer than that -- than what you guys had anticipated back in September. But I guess given how much sentiment has improved since that time or at least in the last 45 days, like can you help me understand why this is the case? Like could you not argue that from where we stand today, the outlook from a client perspective should be more positive now than when you initially gave guidance? Like -- it seems like there's a bit of a disconnect, and I'm not sure if there's some near-term dynamics here because I know October was obviously very negative from a sentiment perspective and then we had a complete reversal. So I'm just not sure if we're seeing the reversal yet in people are still kind of focused on the October -- the sentiment at that point in time. It just seems like there's a bit of a disconnect here. Linda Huber : Yes. It's a perfectly fair question and one that I sort of wrestled with as we were getting ready for this call. So we originally gave guidance on September 21. You will recall that then we had the very tragic events of October 7, which made the macro situation even more difficult. So we gave guidance before that piece happened. And sentiment, frankly, got worse. We're coming to the calendar year-end for a lot of our clients, budgets got thinner, they tightened their belts yet again. And then last Wednesday, we got what I think everybody considers to be a bit of a surprise from Chairman Powell. I like this expression of he shot the bears. The market has turned dramatically and hard. Is it ahead of itself? It could be. But what I said before is really very important. The hiring in -- for some of our clients is a lagging indicator. So we have to work through that, clear that, take the impact of what's going on with the Credit Suisse situation in our second quarter in a conservative way and then get back on track, which we are looking to do. And I think, yes, the unusual combination of our fiscal year-end. And when some pretty big news events have happened -- have caused what you might consider to be a bit of a disconnect, but I hope that the explanation has helped you. So we're quite optimistic, and I'm going to turn it over to Phil to sort of bring us in for a landing here. But we very much appreciate your point of view and your question and your notes on timing, probably pretty appropriate, but we are excited about what's coming next. And maybe Phil can comment on that. Phil Snow : Yes. Thanks, Linda. So yes, I mean, the sales cycles for our clients do take some time particularly for our enterprise solutions. So I really hope sentiment has turned and like we spoke about on this call that it's just a question of timing. So to summarize, we're very excited, obviously, about artificial intelligence. We have a lot of FactSetters out in the market, working with our clients and nothing beats sort of showing the product to the client and getting that wow back from them. So we're all really behind this. We've made a lot of progress in the last year, and I feel like we're really in good shape versus the competition based on what I'm seeing. We did take the guidance down just because the turn is taking a bit longer than we thought, which we just spoke to. Second quarter will be a little slower than planned just to summarize. So we may be taking a bit of a conservative view there. And we did mention the -- in particular, the Credit Suisse acquisition by UBS, which was well known. And then just to summarize, I'm going to give a bit of a plug for FactSet Focus. So we're having our flagship user event in Miami this April and the beginning of May. It's the first time we've done this in a number of years. We're bringing together top thought leaders, industry experts and key decision-makers from both the finance and tech sectors. We're really going to be focused very heavily on artificial intelligence and really demonstrating what we've done there. And hopefully, that will be really engaging for anyone that attends. So that's it. We'll see you all next quarter. Operator, that ends today's call. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

After the speakers' presentation, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would like to hand the conference over to speaker today, Ali van Nes. Please go ahead. Ali van Nes : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FactSet's second fiscal quarter 2024 earnings call. Before we begin, the slides we reference during this presentation can be found through the webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at factset.com. A replay of today's call will be available on our website. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions from investors. The call is scheduled to last for one hour. To be fair to everyone, please limit yourself to one question. You may reenter the queue for additional follow-up questions, which we will take if time permits. Before we discuss our results, I encourage all listeners to review the legal notice on slide two, which explains the risks of forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the appendix to the presentation and in our earnings release issued earlier today. Joining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer; and Linda Huber, Chief Financial Officer. We will also be joined by Helen Shan, Chief Revenue Officer, for the Q&A portion of today's call. I will now turn the discussion over to Phil Snow. Philip Snow : Thank you, Ali, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. In the second quarter, we grew organic ASV plus professional services by 5.4% year-over-year, delivering adjusted diluted EPS of $4.22 and an adjusted operating margin of 38.3%. Given challenging industry factors and continued market uncertainty, our results this quarter were mixed. You may recall that we anticipated the softer top-line growth from our December call. We ended this quarter with more than 8,000 clients, adding 75 net new logos, and our user count was 206,478, down 605 in the quarter, mostly due to consolidation following UBS' acquisition of Credit Suisse. In addition, please note that the ASV reduction impact of Credit Suisse is not reflected in our second quarter results. While we cannot share details about ongoing business discussions, our full year guidance continues to assume a conservative view of the Credit Suisse reduction as we indicated last quarter. Overall, ASV retention remained greater than 95% and client retention was 90%. In terms of market conditions, client caution continued to delay purchasing decisions. We saw increased pressure on client headcount as they seek further efficiency gains. As a result, we saw higher erosion this quarter. We had fewer large deals in Q2 and saw a lower impact from our price increase, both of which contributed to a slower growth rate. However, industry cost cutting appears to be stabilizing and we are starting to see pockets of recovery. As we signaled in our December call, anticipation of softer top-line growth drove our own difficult but necessary cost cuts, including headcount reductions during the quarter. Continued careful expense management will allow us to maintain margins and EPS growth along with investment in new products to drive future performance. Currently, we expect to finish the fiscal year at the lower end of our ASV growth guidance range of 5% to 7%. Turning now to our performance by region. America's ASV growth decelerated by 200 basis points from the prior quarter to 5.9%, mainly due to a large wealth cancellation, as well as banking erosion and lower price realization. The wealth cancellation resulted from a client's decision to move a custom non-standard workflow solution in house following a change in its business strategy. In EMEA, ASV growth decelerated 40 basis points to 5%, mainly due to headwinds from lighter institutional asset manager renewals, partially offset by new business acceleration. In Asia Pacific, ASV growth decelerated 240 basis points to 5.6%. Softer banking expansion coupled with a larger institutional asset manager loss offset wins with asset owners. While new business accelerated modestly across regions, it was offset by greater reductions in both retention and expansion. On the institutional buy side, we saw headwinds across all firm types due to cost cutting and continued headcount reduction. For example, in 2023, passive funds surpassed active funds in total assets under management. As a result, our institutional asset management clients are seeing continued increased fee pressure. To help offset this pressure, we have expanded our capabilities to address users' needs, including in the front office. Our managed services business is growing as our clients outsource more of their middle office workflows to FactSet. This helped drive some gains with asset owners. We have invested in our platform to reduce clients' total cost of ownership, or TCO. Given our ability to help clients do more with less, they are increasing their reliance on us despite fee pressure. As a result, we are investing in managed services given our growth in this area. We are leveraging our strength in the middle office to further power front-office solutions. This quarter, we displaced a front- office incumbent at an asset management in Asia, and we did this by connecting the client's entire workflow, including both OMS and EMS capabilities. We also won that business on the strength of our open platform. Simultaneously, we are developing GenAI-enhanced tools and copilots for portfolio managers and fundamental research analysts, which we believe will significantly reduce their time to insight. In dealmakers. We saw a higher erosion in banking and lower retention in private equity and venture capital. However, corporates are starting to see good momentum with investor relations users. At the same time, expectations are high around the effect generative AI will have on our industry. Initial client feedback has been extremely positive on our new GenAI solutions, including FactSet Mercury, a conversational way to generate answers and insights from documents and structured datasets that is in beta release as part of our FactSet Explorer program. We see early signs that large language models, working with our deep repository of well-curated data in our open platform, can power accelerated workflows for our clients. While we perceive that this trend will drive future growth, these initiatives need time to gain commercial momentum. In banking, our GenAI banker efficiency tools are gaining users. We had more than 200 GenAI meetings with our banking clients in Q2. Beta products in testing with clients include chart creator and investment banking office refresh API, which allows clients to automate cloud model updates. This is our first client-facing off-platform solution for banker automation and we believe it can drive a new revenue stream. Finally, Transcript Assistant, our GenAI-powered chatbot, is in full release as announced last week. Transcript Assistant accelerates analysis of earnings call transcripts with a conversational, interactive interface. Clients have the freedom to ask their own custom questions or choose from a FactSet-provided prompt. User uptake has been strong. We are now expanding event coverage and comparative analysis in parallel with the FactSet Mercury integration. You can read more about Transcript Assistant in our press release from last week. Turning to wealth. Activity was more subdued this quarter given one large cancellation and no large deals. However, wealth partnerships are creating stronger connections with portfolio and business development workflows, in turn increasing senior executive level client engagement. We have recently driven major changes in the organization to position ourselves for future growth, including moving to our firm-type focus and reducing costs. Given this rapid pace of change, I am extremely proud of how the company has risen to the occasion. This change process may have been challenging in the short run, but has positioned us well for a market upturn. Finally, I want to highlight our FOCUS client event in Miami at the end of April. This event brings together top thought leaders, industry experts, and key decision makers from the finance and tech sectors. Our theme for 2024 is the revolution of an ecosystem, discussing the potential of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Attendees can expect a thoughtfully-curated agenda with inspiring speakers, educational sessions, and opportunities for meaningful connections. Registration information can be found at focus.factset.com. I'll now turn it over to Linda to discuss our second quarter performance in more detail. Linda Huber : Thanks, Phil, and hello to everyone. As you've seen from our press release this morning, despite slower ASV growth, we improved margins and EPS in the second quarter. Second quarter organic ASV grew 5.4% while adjusted operating margin improved 130 basis points to 38.3% and adjusted diluted EPS rose 11% to $4.22. I'll now share some additional details on our fiscal second quarter performance. As Ali noted, a reconciliation of our adjusted metrics to comparable GAAP figures is included at the end of our press release. For the quarter, GAAP revenue increased 6% to $546 million on sales to asset owners, corporates, hedge funds, and private equity and venture capital clients. For our geographic segments, organic revenues grew by 6.5% in the Americas, 4.8% in EMEA, and 6.4% in Asia Pacific. Turning now to expenses. GAAP operating expenses increased 5% year-over-year to $364 million. This was driven by higher employee expense, net of $7 million decrease to our bonus accrual, as well as by increased intangible asset amortization. Compared to the previous year, GAAP operating margin increased by nearly 50 basis points to 33%. This was due to increased revenues, partially offset by higher personnel expenses, including an approximately $11 million restructuring charge. On an adjusted basis, operating expenses grew 4%. Looking at each of our four major cost buckets in turn, as we've frequently discussed, technology continues to be our main area of expense growth. Specifically, technology costs increased 11% year-over-year. Technology costs now represent about 8.4% of revenue, consistent with our medium-term outlook. In contrast, employee expenses grew only 1% year-over-year, driven by increased compensation expenses, partially offset by the lower bonus accrual. This small increase reflects some of the cost reduction efforts we took during the second quarter. Next, our third-party content costs increased 3% due to higher variable fee expenses. And finally, real estate expenses saw an 8% decrease year-over-year as we took early and significant steps to reduce this expense bucket. We believe we have now rightsized our real estate footprint. As we have mentioned before, thoughtful expense management is positioning the company for future growth while allowing us to continue to invest in technology and strategic initiatives. Turning now to margin. Adjusted operating margin improved by 130 basis points to 38.3%. This was due to lower personnel expenses, given the lower bonus accrual and higher capitalization benefit, partially offset by higher technology expenses and higher bad debt expense. As always, you'll find an expense block from revenue to adjusted operating income in the appendix of today's earnings presentation. As a percentage of revenue, our cost of services was flat year-over-year on a GAAP basis and about 90 points lower on an adjusted basis. And SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 40 basis points lower year-over-year on a GAAP basis. The decrease was due to revenues outpacing the increase in SG&A expenses and lower compensation costs, partially offset by an increase in bad debt expense. SG&A was about 40 basis points lower on an adjusted basis. Turning now to tax. Our tax rate for the quarter was 16.4% compared to last year's rate of 16.1%. This increase was due to higher taxable income, offset by higher stock option exercises and higher foreign credits, which reduced the tax rate. Turning now to EPS. GAAP EPS increased 8% to $3.65 this quarter versus $3.38 in the prior year period. This was driven by higher revenues and margin expansion, partly offset by a higher tax rate. On an adjusted basis, EPS increased 11.1% to $4.22, also driven by revenue growth and margin expansion, partially offset by a higher tax rate. Adjusted EBITDA increased $218 million, up 9.2% year-over-year due to higher net income, driven primarily by an increase in operating income, excluding the impact of depreciation and amortization and the impact of non-recurring non-cash expenses. Free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending, was $122 million for the quarter, a decrease of 17% over the same period last year. This was due to the timing of remitted payroll taxes related to employee stock compensation and higher income taxes payable, which are seasonally higher in the second quarter. Turning to share repurchases. For the quarter, we repurchased 113,050 shares for $52.3 million at an average share price of $462.23. Our fiscal 2024 share repurchase plan targets $250 million of repurchases. We have $188 million remaining for repurchases in the second-half of fiscal 2024. We remain disciplined in our buyback program and committed to returning long-term value to our shareholders. Combining our dividends and share repurchases, we returned $434.1 million to our shareholders over the last 12-months. And regarding leverage, during the second quarter, we paid down $62.5 million of our outstanding term loan, which brings our gross leverage down to 1.8 times. This is consistent with our plan to repay that term loan in full by the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Finally, as Phil mentioned, we've carefully managed our cost base while continuing to invest in GenAI and other strategic initiatives. We believe that we are well positioned for growth as the markets pick up. We are now ready for your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Faiza Alwy : Yes, hi. Good morning. So I wanted to talk a little bit about the pipeline and what you're seeing from here. Phil, I think you said that industry cost cutting appears to be stabilizing, and you're seeing some pockets of recovery. So maybe just start there and give us a sense of what you're hearing from your clients? Philip Snow : Yes. Well, from -- hey Faiza, yes, from my conversations with clients, it feels a way more constructive in the last three months than it did towards the last three months of last year. So just being out there with the clients talking to salespeople, it definitely feels like activity is picking up. We are seeing, I think, increased pressure on headcount of clients, in particular. But I would say our more enterprise solutions and our platform solutions is showing some good strength there. So I'm cautiously optimistic here that as we move into the second-half, we'll probably have a weaker Q3, but I'm cautiously optimistic that Q4 will be stronger than last year. I'm going to turn it over to Helen now for a bit more detail. Helen Shan : Sure. Thanks for your question. Yes, we're seeing sort of a health -- we are seeing a healthier pipeline in H2 versus H1. We're seeing higher deal volume. I would say that the pipeline is more along the lines of last year, if not a little bit stronger. The makeup is about half of it is coming from buy side, 20% in the dealmakers or banking, 20% wealth and the rest in partnerships. So we're seeing the pipeline accelerate since the beginning of the calendar year, really the strength in data solutions, in the middle office and in Quant Solutions. But as Phil was just saying, timing on decisions is a little bit difficult to gauge. And more of our pipeline, I would say, are in the later stages of the funnel, which gives us more confidence, but many of them are really more into the fourth quarter. Faiza Alwy : Great. Thank you. Operator : One moment for our next question. Helen Shan : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open. Manav Patnaik : Yes, thank you. Phil, so I just wanted to touch on the managed services comments you made, I think. If you could just help elaborate exactly what you were referring to in investing more in the managed services? What percentage of your revenues today is managed services? And is it fair to assume that's a lower-margin business? Just I was hoping you could elaborate more on that. Philip Snow : Sure, Manav. Thanks for the question. You're right. It is a much smaller piece of our business, and we're really stressing sort of the subscription part of FactSet. I think that's who we are as a company and how we continue. But what we have observed is as we've become more of an enterprise solution for clients, and we're delivering more mission-critical services for them, particularly with analytics and off-platform that you need sort of another level there to sort of help the clients. So we do think that there's a good opportunity for clients to outsource solutions to FactSet and leave it up to us to do what we do best. And a good example of that was last -- at the end of last year, we had that very large outsourced performance deal with one of our clients, where we really invested heavily in this group to build that out. And I think we're seeing continued momentum and interest in this. So it's a piece of our business that we think is necessary. You're right, it is typically, I think, a lower-margin business. But we think overall, combined with the solutions that we're including with it, which is the main part of the sale, that it's a good opportunity for us. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Kelsey Zhu with Autonomous. Your line is open. Kelsey Zhu : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you can share a little bit more color on how much pricing, cross-selling and new logo drove Q2 ASP growth, and how much do you expect them to drive growth for the full-year? Helen Shan : Hey, it\u2019s Helen. Thanks for that question. So this year's growth in the price increase on the Americas, it was $25 million this quarter, which is in line with FY \u201822, although lower than last year as we were able to take advantage of some of the inflation and CPI on last year's situation. But the overall price increase continues to provide that uplift. I would say the price realization against our rate card is about flat to last year. It does vary across firm types, plus or minus a few percentage points. As noted before, our price realization in new business is lower than last year, I think, reflecting that more competitive environment. But we've actually seen total new business ASV increase. So we've had higher new logos, although average -- a bit smaller on the average price. So I do think that it's continuing to provide that sort of same growth rate that we've seen in the past. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Your line is open. Heather Balsky : Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I was hoping you could talk about your expense cadence for the rest of the year. You had really strong margins this quarter. So just curious, your expectations around OpEx for the back half, and was there any timing shift from 2Q into the back half? Linda Huber : Thank you, Heather. It's Linda. We had talked about how our expenses tend to ramp up as we move through the calendar year. So I think it's fair to say that margins we've been fortunate enough to put up in Q1 and Q2 will decrease a bit as we move through the back half of the year. So we did adjusted operating margin of 37.6% in Q1 and 38.3% in Q2. So I think it would be fair to expect arithmetically something closer to 35% for the back half of the year to get us to the midpoint of our guidance of 36.5%. And again, it is our intention to hit the midpoint of that guidance on adjusted operating margin despite a slightly softer top line. So you should expect a little bit of the technology cost to continue to move up as we go through the year. And of course, we've taken some actions to ensure that we have the appropriate headcount and appropriate location for our employees going forward. So we think we're in a good place, and we are prepared to deal with the cost base so that it works for the lower end of the revenue range. So we've got all that in the mix and so a little bit lower in the back half of the year. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open. Alex Kramm : Yes, hello everyone. Phil, would love to come back to some of the commentary you made for the third quarter and fourth quarter outlook. It sounds like third quarter, you said fairly soft relative to last year. So maybe you can just flush out if that's, again, lower pricing expectations or just lower net sales. And then on the fourth quarter, you sound pretty optimistic. So maybe you can just back that up a little bit, because I think you made a comment that hiring was actually an area that's still pretty soft from what you can see, and I think the fourth quarter is very dependent on hiring. So it maybe flushes out, maybe you just have a great pipeline of non-hiring-related 4Q expectations. So a little bit more color would be great. Philip Snow : Sure. Yes, I'll start, and I'm sure Helen will have some additional comments. Thanks, Alex. Yes, I mean, Q3 is typically a smaller quarter for us anyway. What I can sort of point to is that we have a large number of seven-figure deals in the pipeline and probably a higher number than we had this time last year. So there's certainly an appetite out there for large enterprise solutions with all types of different firm types. So I mean, in your reports, you sort of point to the hiring on the buy side and the sell side, and it's certainly come down in both areas. The sell side was weak last Q4. I'm not sure that we're expecting anything different than that this year. But if rates do get cut and the banks feel optimistic, we could see a tailwind from that. But I'm not sure it's any more of a headwind, frankly, than we saw last year. On the buy side, I think we're going to continue to see increased pressure on headcount as we move forward, particularly with generative AI. But that's all baked into our thesis in terms of our enterprise solutions and what we're doing to product. And despite that, we've got 200,000 seats approximately today. There might be 9 times or 10 times that many seats out there in the industry. So we're -- we've doubled the number of seats on FactSet in the last five years or so. And we still feel even with increased pressure on headcount, there's a good opportunity for us to tie the front office to the middle office to the back office. And particularly on the buy side, we have the portfolio holdings of our clients. That's one of our key differentiators. And the firms that are going to win are the ones, I think, that can help the large firms continue to consolidate with a very good TCO conversation, which we're leaning way more into than we have in the past. Helen? Helen Shan : Yes. No, that's exactly right. Thanks for your question, Alex. As I mentioned, we do have a healthy H2 pipeline. Phil focused on the seven-figure deals. I focus on six and seven-figure deals. So that's up year-over-year, I'd say, almost sort of 5% in terms of total numbers. So I think that gives us some greater visibility and confidence. And because of these total -- these TCO conversations, a lot of the pipeline is focused on competitive displacements, which has been strong for us. So the ability for us to convert those will be important. The strength of the markets, both capital markets and flow of deals are important as you know, especially as it relates to banking and wealth. For right now, we're just -- we're not assuming that banking is all of a sudden going to pop up with sort of flat to last year, although we'll know more, as you know, in the Q3 and Q4. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas of William Blair. Your line is open. Andrew Nicholas : Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask about budgets and maybe cyclical sensitivity from like a business line or maybe even product-type perspective. It sounds like you've seen some stabilization. There's some pockets of recovery. But I'm just curious, are clients maybe more apt to push off platform or workstation purchases or decisions than they are on the data side or on the middle office side? Just curious if there's a difference in the way that people are prioritizing their budgets and their spend at that level or from that perspective? Helen Shan : Yes, I'll take that. That's a great question. So let me try to touch on that. I would look at it maybe not necessarily on firm type, but maybe even size. So in our premier book, which is our most key large accounts, make up about 41% of our total, then they're really looking for the ability to -- they have flat budgets. And so they're really looking for the ability to make some room to invest in gen AI themselves. And so I think that's where making large decisions becomes a little bit tougher. We're seeing a lot of demand. Part of the growth in our H2 is on the data solutions side, and I think that reflects some of what you would expect in the market. So I think what we're seeing is yes, the larger deals are related to platform. We have a good pipeline of them. We need clients to feel comfortable enough to be able to act on it. And -- but data continues to be a strong point and we think will drive our second-half. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Toni Kaplan : Thanks so much. Helen, you just mentioned a couple of questions ago the pipeline focusing on the competitive displacements and how that's been very strong. Is that directionally, I guess, stronger than it has been? And just any changes in the competitive environment maybe because of the challenges in the market has it been a little bit more competitive when you're sort of up against other players? Thanks. Helen Shan : Yes. No, thank you, Toni. So yes, I would say a couple of things. The type of total cost of ownership conversations is definitely higher. We've had a lot of C-suite conversations, which I would say is probably more than we've had in the past. And the need to find, I'll say, new alternatives is on top of clients' minds. So I'd say yes to that. As it relates to the pricing, as mentioned on new business, we're seeing greater pressure there. Is pricing overall coming down? I would say it depends on the firm type of large deals. I think you're seeing more of that leverage coming through. But so far, our price realization has been flat to last year. Philip Snow : To add to this, Toni, that I think we're in a very strong position competitively. When I think about the buy side and the fact that we've got portfolios on the system and clients want to work more with us, it's really giving us a good opportunity with these TCO conversations. And I'm seeing, for the first time in my career, much more of a top-down push for cost savings and giving some of the users a little less choice than they had in the past, which I think, in many cases, is tipping things in our favor. We're also seeing that some of our competitors' platforms are becoming -- are less flexible and less able to scale, which we're taking advantage of. So that's on the buy side. On the wealth, we're doing incredibly well there. We had that one-off thing this quarter, which I wouldn't be concerned about if you're thinking about sort of the longer-term trends for wealth. We still have a lot of large opportunities in front of us, some good ones in the pipeline. And we're beginning to expand the workflows that we're addressing for wealth, including things like prospecting and proposal generation. So I see a lot of opportunity on the wealth side. And then with our continued investment in content around deep sector, private markets and the technology investment we're making now around generative AI, I think there's a massive opportunity for us not just across banking, but across some of the smaller firm types that we deal with like private equity, corporates and even hedge funds where we may not have played as much in the past. So I think we're set up very nicely here. And I think -- when the market turns, I think we'll really be able to capitalize on this. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Owen Lau : Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. So I'm trying to reconcile some of the commentaries here. Could you please talk about the reason of anticipating lower ASV -- organic ASV growth and GAAP revenue to land at the lower end of the guidance? And I mean your comments about the pipeline was quite constructive, especially for the fourth quarter. I mean you said because of the UBS-Credit Suisse deal that lead you to lower your expectation. Or is there any specific event that drives your decision? And then one more, it's about your outlook, your updated expectation about the capital markets recovery. Could you please talk about how you incorporate that into your guidance right now? Thanks a lot. Helen Shan : Sure. Owen, I'll touch a bit on that. So I think there's a couple of things that we've taken into account. Yes, we do have a very strong pipeline, as mentioned. That being said, we also have the impact of the CS-UBS merger. We talked a little bit about that on our last call. Timing of that, of course, is not in our -- we don't control that. So that's being reflected in our lower end of the guidance. We also had the large wealth -- cancel that Phil just mentioned there. That is a one-off, but that also plays into our view as well. And we are a little more conservative in how we're looking at the environment. I'll let Linda talk about the capital markets piece, but we don't try to build in a bounce back into our numbers. Linda Huber : Yes. So Owen, just to be absolutely clear, in planning for this year's continuing revenue outlook, we have included what is going on with the Credit Suisse situation. We cannot tell what quarter that will occur, and there are ongoing business discussions. So stay tuned. We'll see how it plays out, but we've been conservative, and we have included that in our guidance. So now regarding capital markets, things changed again yesterday. Chairman Powell was quite dovish in his comments. As of today, the June rate cut probability is north of 70% for 25 basis points of cutting in June. The Fed is looking at three rate cuts over the course of the remaining calendar year. The probability of the June cut went up 15 percentage points from where we were Tuesday. So if you think about it, I think of Chairman Powell is metaphorically driving the family station wagon. And we keep asking, are we there yet, are we there yet for rate cuts? And he says, we're not quite there yet. So we're waiting. The trends are very positive. The Swiss National Bank cut interest rates by 25 bps this morning. The Bank of England held constant. And we saw some IPOs yesterday, the Astera IPO traded way up yesterday, which is a good sign. And Reddit priced at the high end of its range, which was $31 to $34 priced at $34. So seeing IPOs is a really good sign, and we are seeing better information on the timing of rate cuts. We now wait with a bit of a lag as to when that impacts our business. So again, there is a bit of a lag. So that's why Phil had talked about the third quarter, we're not hugely optimistic about that, but the fourth quarter is certainly starting to look much better. So hope that's helpful to you. And we keep asking the same question, are we there yet on the rate cuts, but we're going to have to wait. Thanks. Operator : Thanks. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeff Silber : Thank you so much. I wanted to focus on your client count growth. User count growth was really strong, but we're seeing client count growth slowing. Is there anything specifically going on there? Or is it just tough comps? Or any color would be great. Helen Shan : Sure. This is Helen. So yes, I think a lot of our client count growth is driven by new business. So I think you're seeing a bit of that take place right now as you're seeing that come down. But I don't think there's anything in particular that we're looking at. Typically, that's driven by corporates and wealth. This quarter, we actually saw some good growth in partners, which is a little bit more on the fintech side. So I don't -- we're not looking at the client count as something that -- to be focused on necessarily. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Your line is open. Craig Huber : Thank you. Linda, I want to go back to the question on the ramp for cost if we could in the back half of the year. It seems to me just looking at your guidance here, your revenue guidance, your operating profit guidance for the year that it's gutted you up quite significantly your cost in the back half of the year by roughly $60 million over the six months versus the first-half of the year and stuff? And if I got that math right, why is that? I mean obviously, in recent years, your fourth quarter has ticked up the cost versus what you reported in the second quarter. But prior to the last two years, that was not necessarily the case. So I just want to hear a little bit more color on that, please. Do I have that right, you are expecting cost up significantly in the second-half versus the first-half, which does seem a little strange to me. One more thing if I could add because you have had a pretty large restructuring charge in the second quarter, one of the larger ones you've had in recent years. That should help the cost of anything, obviously. So any thoughts, I'd appreciate. Thank you. Linda Huber : Craig, you're right. We will see a ramp in the back half of the year. Total expenses for the second quarter, $337 million, and we do expect that those will ramp. This is mostly driven by the technology cost. And Craig, what we're seeing is we have to build in more cloud costs as gen AI takes off and as we get increased demand on that front. So most of this comes from the technology budget. Personnel costs will remain quite flat. As we had said, we have rightsized those, and we reduced our bonus accrual by about $7 million. So the bonus accruals went for the first quarter, it was $30 million with some adjustment going on, $20 million in the second quarter. You should probably pencil in the low 20s for the third and fourth quarter, given what we're seeing now. And keep in mind that our employees are paid sort of half on top line growth and half on margin. So the margin piece is about where we want it. The top line piece, we're anticipating a little bit of slowness. So we've adjusted that down for the bonus calculation. On real estate, we've done quite well, bringing those costs down. And third-party data costs are about flat. So mostly it is about increases in the tech budget driven by increased amortization as that moves through and also the cloud expense as we look to fuel the gen AI efforts of the company and our clients. So hope that helps you there, Craig. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Russell Quelch with Redburn Atlantic. Your line is open. Russell Quelch : Thanks for having me on. We're starting to hear from some management teams in the sector around internal efficiency opportunities from generative AI. I was wondering if you could talk to how big an opportunity that might be for FactSet and when we might expect to see that in the P&L. I'm wondering if the opportunity is similar in size to peers or maybe a little smaller, given you have the majority of employees already in low-cost centers. Philip Snow : Russell, it's Phil, and I'll start and I'm sure Linda has some additional comments. So yes, we've been talking about three areas there where we've been focused. So as you can imagine, there's a lot of developers at FactSet. So they are currently being armed with tools that look very good in terms of being able to increase the efficiency of producing code. The question is like how do we apply that? Do we apply it to more product? Or do we apply it in other ways? So I think we're getting a good handle on what those efficiency gains could be and which parts of our tech stack and product it makes sense to apply them. We're also looking at content collection. But as you mentioned, we have quite a large number of our employees in low-cost locations. So we've done a lot to automate workflows for content collection over the years. This adds, I think, some more juice to that even. So there's some good opportunity there. Although the people of costs there are much lower, so the efficiency gains may not be as high as they are with engineering, for example. And then there's a big opportunity for us in terms of just supporting clients. So FactSet is a very good tool. Some people use it in different ways. Some people use it in a programmatic way. So there's a lot of coding that's involved if you really want to customize your workflow. So I think it can really help both clients and people that support those clients internally. So those are three of the bigger buckets. We do see opportunity. And we're going to be looking very hard at how we can apply that in our rolling three-year plan. So we're just beginning our efforts there to think about a budget for next year and the following years, and this will certainly be part of that equation. Linda Huber : Yes. Russell, it's Linda. You should look for those efficiency gains in our FY '25 guidance. We've only given these new tools to our engineers relatively recently. They're reporting good things, but it's a little early to put a number on it. We think the biggest advantage from this will be cost avoidance as we bend the cost curve. And perhaps as the engineers get more efficient, we can sort of ramp down some of our hiring. So we think that, that's a bright spot, but we're going to look to first direct Gen AI efforts outwardly to make sure that we're able to generate ASV with those efforts, and you'll see more of that at our FOCUS conference. And then in FY '25, the focus will turn more constructively to internal cost savings. We've been managing the cost of the company pretty darn effectively, I would say, and we're looking to ensure that we are able to continue to do that, but gen AI is only a portion of that. So thanks for the question. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Keith Housum : Thanks. A question for you on capitalized costs. It seems like the amortization cost is going up, the capitalized costs have been going up year-over-year as well. I guess can you give us a little bit of color about what you expect it to be in 2024 versus '23? And then how long are you amortizing this cost for? Linda Huber : Yes, great question. We are -- we've added some automation to our time tracking, which has helped us be more accurate. And I think for the year, we're looking somewhere between $80 million and $85 million, which is better than we did last year. I don't have that number right at hand, but it has grown. So you're going to see some more coming through in terms of that capitalization. It probably has not peaked out quite yet. But we feel pretty good about what we're doing there and that it's very helpful to everyone involved that we spread these costs generally over three years would be the normal situation there. So pretty much right down the middle of the road in terms of how you would think about the time period over which we spread those costs. So I think that should help you a little bit. As we move forward, we'll probably look at that capitalization percent of revenues kind of moving up to 3% to 4% of revenues. I think we have previously said sort of 2.5% to 3%. But again, with automated tools, we are doing a better job of tracking the cost of building software and then moving that through in a capitalized manner. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. You mentioned earlier that price realization against your rate card is about flat versus last year, and that price realization in new business is a bit lower, reflecting a more competitive environment. Can you talk a little bit about where you're seeing the most competition come from? And how would you describe pricing trends among your competitors? Helen Shan : Hey George, it's Helen. Yes, let me get to that. So I would say it depends, right? So I think when you're talking about some of the smaller deals, maybe in PVC and in some cases, in banking, it might be a little bit more competitive. I think some of the competitors sometimes leverage like we do on some of their stronger enterprise deals if they're able to do so. I think we're seeing benefit actually in places like in asset owners where our packages from a value perspective are really resonating. So I do think it depends. We're not seeing again any huge differences as much as everyone is just fighting hard for trying to get that new logo. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Shlomo, your line is open. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi. Thank you very much. Linda, I just want to focus a little bit more on the expense control. You've gotten nicely ahead of things. So even though revenues coming in softer, you're still going to hit the EPS range likely at the high end of that. I was just wondering if this environment continues for longer than you expected and let's say we're still sitting here in this few quarters and saying, are we there yet, you've done a lot of real estate. There's squeeze down on the bonus pool. But what -- operationally, what are the next steps that you take to kind of continue to move the margin up and invest in the generative AI and frankly, the product development that you're going to need to drive the top line? Like what do you focus on after this? Linda Huber : Yes. Shlomo, it's a great question and one that we discussed with our Board of Directors earlier this week. I think we've done a pretty good job on all the cost buckets. You're right, we wanted to plan to take these charges at midyear. So we adjust our expense rate in some areas down as we go through the rest of the year. So over the past few years, unfortunately, we've had to take three sort of different rounds of personnel actions, and we want very much for those to be done. We consider those to be done with the possible exception of a huge geopolitical event that we haven't planned. So we want to think that we have the cost cuts well in hand. And I think what we're looking for as we move into FY '25 is we have to look at closer to flat personnel growth. So we're going to try to ensure that we've got that model right. I think we've got our offshore balance about correct, which is about 68% right now. But we did want to get the expenses right for the rest of the year in keeping with the lower end of the range on the top line so everything comes out well. From here, I think we're in a pretty good place. I think we've done what we need to do. And we're hoping that are we there yet that we do get there soon enough that we can see some help from the top line. But we've got the costs well in hand, and I think we've thought it through and executed pretty well. So thank you for that, Shlomo. That's great. Operator : And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Phil Snow for any closing remarks. Philip Snow : Thanks, operator. So in closing, while results this quarter were mixed, actions taken this quarter position us well to capitalize on market shifts. Our focus at FactSet is on innovating for our clients' long-term efficiency, and that's the reason we really remain an anchor partner for them. And I'm confident in our ability to execute on the opportunities we talked about in the pipeline for the second-half. Operator, that ends today's call. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",

After the speaker's presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Ali van Nes, Head of IR, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ali van Nes : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FactSet\u2019s third fiscal quarter 2024 earnings call. Before we begin, the slides we referenced during this presentation can be found through the webcast on the investor relations section of our website at factset.com. A replay of today's call will be available on our website. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions from investors. The call is scheduled to last for one hour. To be fair to everyone, please limit yourself to one question. You may re-enter the queue for additional follow-up questions, which we will take if time permits. Before we discuss our results, I encourage all listeners to review the legal notice on slide two, which explains the risks of forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, please refer to our forms 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the appendix to the presentation and in our earnings release issued earlier today. Joining me today are Philip Snow, Chief Executive Officer; and Linda Huber, Chief Financial Officer. We will also be joined by Helen Shan, Chief Revenue Officer, for the Q&A portion of today's call. I will now turn the discussion over to Phil Snow. Philip Snow : Thank you, Ali, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Before I speak about this quarter's results, I just want to point out that we scheduled today's call on a Friday to allow for observance of the Juneteenth holiday earlier this week. We finished our third quarter with organic ASV and professional services growth of 5%. Adjusted diluted EPS rose to $4.37 for the quarter and our adjusted operating margin was 39.4%. This quarter we continue to see the impact of clients' tightened budgets and cost rationalization. Trends we highlighted last quarter that were echoed by others in the industry. These pressures extend decision making and lengthen sales cycles. Also, as you may recall, the third quarter is seasonally our weakest of the year. Against this backdrop, we continue to build on FactSet\u2019s history of 44 consecutive years of revenue growth and 28 consecutive years of adjusted EPS growth. And in these 44 years, we have successfully navigated through even more difficult market positions than we face right now. Despite challenged end markets, this is an exciting time in our industry, particularly for technology companies with valuable data assets. We are harnessing the power of gen AI to build cutting edge solutions and capture market share. For example, we held our 11th client symposium in Miami in April, showcasing new products and the value they bring to clients. These new products are driving requests for hundreds of product demonstrations, creating new leads for our sales team. Returning now to our third quarter, we concluded with 8,029 clients and nine net new logos. Our user count exceeded 208,000. Overall, ASV retention remained higher than 95% and client retention was 90%. Currently, we expect to finish the fiscal year with annual organic ASV plus professional services growth between 4% and 5.5%. Linda will provide further updates to guidance in a few minutes. Turning now to our performance by region, we saw slower growth in the third quarter due to continued market headwinds and the effect of the cancellation from the Credit Suisse, UBS merger, which impacted all of our regions. Overall, this cancellation accounted for approximately 30 basis points or two-thirds of our ASV deceleration quarter-over-quarter. In the Americas, gains from asset owners and wealth managers were offset by continued client cost rationalization, and the Americas region's organic ASV growth rate was 5.7%. In the EMEA region, growth was driven by a price increase, sales to asset owners, and higher ASV from the analytics product suite. The EMEA region's organic ASV growth rate was 4.4%. And in the Asia Pacific region, we saw acceleration from buy-side firms driven by front office solutions and growing transactional revenues. The Asia Pacific region's organic ASV growth rate was 6.1%. Looking now at trends by firm types on the institutional buy side, we had a notable win this quarter, displacing a competitor at a large asset manager in the U.S. This win was driven by our advanced fixed income analytics. We took an enterprise sales approach and the client chose our portfolio performance solutions and analytics capabilities. We had another significant win with a global asset manager. It moved to a multi-year agreement including middle office portfolio services. This contract aligns with the client strategy to consolidate vendors and to reduce total cost of ownership. These victories demonstrate our ability to provide tailored, high-value solutions to our clients. These clients also recognize that our ongoing management of their complex portfolio holdings positioned us well to do more for them. In banking we saw a decline from the Credit Suisse cancellation. This segment is still impacted by cautious hiring and a wait-and-see attitude toward overall capital market conditions. In wealth management, although growth was modest this quarter, the sector remains a tremendous opportunity for FactSet given our active pipeline. We're committed to enhancing our offerings to capture future growth and deliver compelling value to wealth advisors and their clients. A great example of this is our recent investment in Aidentified\u2019s, which was announced last week. By incorporating Aidentified\u2019s relationship management data into FactSet intelligent prospecting solution, we're able to accelerate new client acquisitions for wealth advisors. This brings us to the fast evolving technology landscape where FactSet is well positioned to lead. We have more than 40-years of meticulously curated and connected data. We are trusted by institutional asset managers and retail wealth advisors with 16 million portfolios on our system, representing more than $30 trillion in assets. And on the sell side, FactSet is well established as the platform of choice for fundamental research workflows. For users on both the buy side and the sell side, FactSet has a unique breadth of data curated for their specific use cases. Our rich data ecosystem is a singularly robust and safe foundation for harnessing the power of generative AI. Specifically, our clients benefit from the combination of our data, our knowledge of clients workflows, and our new generative AI tools. Together, they are producing unique insights and efficiencies for our clients. At FactSet, we are energized to help our clients find new ways to surface insights to set them apart from their peers. We're doing this with live demonstrations of our new products that are available right now. As a result, FactSet is the trusted partner of choice, given that accuracy requires both seasoned judgment and traceable data sources. At FactSet, we have both. A prime example is our portfolio commentary product released last month, which generates complete detailed investment performance summaries in about a minute. Portfolio commentary combines our comprehensive data and deep domain expertise to provide tailored and highly efficient outputs. We also launched the new portfolio manager hub, an end-to-end solution that integrates all elements of a portfolio manager's workflow, from news and research to analysis and trade simulation. PM Hub adds a gen AI back chatbot called Portfolio Assistant to tap into our data to provide precise, traceable answers all without leaving the platform. Enthusiastic client response to portfolio commentary and PM Hub give us confidence that we can extend our buy-side middle office presence to front office users. And on the sell side, FactSet Mercury optimizes the company research workflow for junior bankers. Using a single trusted conversational interface, we are working towards producing pitch books and charts on demand. We expect users to save another 10 hours per week using this tool in addition to the five to 10 hours per week that they said they saved with FactSet before we released Mercury. As banking conditions improve, we are confident that bankers will seek out FactSet Mercury to give them better speed, accuracy, and efficiency. Looking ahead, we have a multi-year strategic investment plan built on three key pillars. First, we are expanding our market data for deep sector, private markets, alternatives, and real-time applications. With real-time market data, for example, we aim to compete for market share by transitioning to cloud-based solutions. By enhancing our [Indiscernible] plans cloud capabilities and expanding content coverage, we can offer more scalable, reliable, and cost-efficient data services. We're well positioned to capture market share when clients demand modern cloud-based infrastructure. Secondly, client workflow. Beyond our middle office business, we are heavily investing in our front office capabilities covering both fundamental and quantitative research. Our offerings for the sell side, particularly in banking automation, are gaining traction with top global banks and boutique firms. Our wealth franchise also continues to grow with significant new opportunities in the pipeline. Thirdly, generative AI. This foundational strategic initiative, we believe, will begin delivering incremental ASV in fiscal 2025. As we mentioned, our new portfolio commentary in FactSet Mercury are already driving demand. And last week, we announced our off-platform AI solutions for technologists. These include a new generative AI data package, a conversational API powered by FactSet Mercury, and a new AI partner program to bring FinTechs and AI startups onto FactSet platform. Together, we expect to see ASV growth from tech savvy financial firms and hedge funds. In summary, I am extremely excited about our competitive opportunity. As demand for traceable quality data grows, particularly for financial decision making, we are adding critical AI tools to deliver real advantages for our clients. Our partnership-focused approach has made FactSet a preferred provider has positions as well for even greater success when market conditions improve. I will now hand it over to Linda to discuss our second quarter performance in more detail. Linda Huber : Thanks, Phil, and hello to everyone. As you've seen from our press release this morning, despite slower ASV growth in the third quarter, we improved margins and EPS, and we are increasing guidance on both of these for the fiscal year. I'll say more about that later. First, our results for this quarter. As Ali noted, our usual reconciliation of our adjusted metrics to comparable GAAP figures is included at the end of our press release. For the third quarter, organic ASV grew 5%, while adjusted operating margin improved 340 basis points to 39.4% and adjusted diluted EPS rose 15% to $4.37. For the quarter, GAAP revenue increased 4% to $553 million on sales to institutional asset managers, asset owners, partners, and corporates. For our geographic segments, organic revenues grew by 5.5% in the Americas, 2.4% in EMEA, and 3% in Asia Pacific. Turning now to expenses, GAAP operating expenses decreased 2% year-over-year to $350 million. This was driven by lower compensation expense, mainly due to a reduction of $8 million to our annual bonus accrual, as well as a reduction in salary expenses and payroll taxes, partially offset by higher intangible amortization and cloud-related costs. Compared to the previous year GAAP operating margin increased by approximately 420 basis points to 36.6%. This was due to increased revenues combined with reduced operating expenses as a result of lower compensation expense. On an adjusted basis, operating expenses decreased 1.2%. And now looking at each of our four major cost buckets in turn. First, as we have frequently discussed, technology continues to be our main area of expense growth. Specifically, technology costs increased 26% year-over-year. Technology costs now represent about 9.5% of revenue. Secondly, in contrast, employee expenses fell 8.6% year-over-year, driven by lower compensation expenses due to earlier cost reduction efforts and the lower bonus accrual. Third, our third-party content costs increased by 9%, due to the timing of changes in variable fee expenses. And finally, real estate and related expenses saw a 14% decrease year-over-year as we saw the benefits of early and significant steps we took to reduce this expense bucket. As we've mentioned before, thoughtful expense management is positioning the company for future growth, while allowing us to continue to invest in technology and strategic initiatives. Turning now to margin, adjusted operating margin improved by 340 basis points to 39.4%. This was primarily due to an adjustment to the bonus accrual, a one-time payroll tax adjustment, and lower salary expense. The bonus accrual was reduced by about $8 million for the fiscal year, given our lower ASV achievement. This change added about 160 basis points to our adjusted operating margin in the quarter. Additionally, earlier cost rationalization efforts resulted in another 130 basis points of the 340 basis point adjusted operating margin improvement. And as always, you will find an expense block from revenue to adjusted operating income in the appendix of today's earnings presentation. As a percentage of revenue, our cost of services declined by 90 basis points year-over-year on a GAAP basis. Cost of services was approximately 40 basis points lower on an adjusted basis. The decrease was primarily due to lower compensation expense, partially offset by an increase in intangible amortization and cloud-related costs. And in SG&A, as a percentage of revenue, it was 320 basis points lower year-over-year on a GAAP basis. SG&A was approximately 300 basis points lower on an adjusted basis. The decrease was primarily due to lower compensation expense, a reduction in bad debt expense, and lower facilities costs. Turning now to tax, our tax rate for the quarter was 17%, compared to last year's rate of 16.9%. This slight increase was primarily due to higher pre-tax income, partially offset by increased utilization of foreign tax credits and additional tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Turning now to EPS, GAAP EPS increased 18.2% to $4.09 this quarter versus $3.46 in the prior year period. This was driven by higher revenues, margin expansion, and a lower share count, partially offset by higher interest expense. On an adjusted basis, EPS increased 15.3% to $4.37, also driven by revenue growth and margin expansion, as well as reduced share count, partially offset by higher interest expense. EBITDA increased to $240 million, up 16.9% year-over-year due to higher net income. Free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations, less capital spending, was $217 million for the quarter, an increase of 13% over the same period last year. This was primarily driven by higher net cash from operating activities and reduced spending on property, equipment, and leasehold improvements. FactSet continues to be a strong producer of free cash flow. And turning now to share repurchases for the quarter, we repurchased 135,150 shares for approximately $60 million and an average share price of $442.12. Our fiscal 2024 share repurchase plan targets $250 million of repurchases. As of May 31, 2024, we had $128.1 million remaining for repurchases in fiscal 2024. Also, yesterday we paid a quarterly dividend of $1.04 per share, which represented a 6% increase in the regular quarterly dividend from the previous quarter. This marks the 25th consecutive year we have increased dividends on a stock split adjusted basis. We remain disciplined in our buyback program and committed to returning long-term value to our shareholders. Combining our dividends and share repurchases, we returned $430.1 million to our shareholders over the last 12 months. And during the third quarter, we paid down $62.5 million of our term loan, which brings our gross leverage down to 1.7 times. This is consistent with our plan to repay the term loan in full by the second quarter of fiscal 2025. As Phil mentioned earlier, given the delayed recovery in our end markets, we are now guiding to incremental organic ASV plus professional services growth of $85 million to $120 million for the fiscal year, reflecting 4.8% growth at the midpoint, down from our recent guide to approximately 5%. Revenues are now expected to be in the range of $2.18 billion to $2.19 billion for the year. On the other hand, our expectations for margin and EPS growth for the year have gone up. Specifically, GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 33.7% to 34%, up approximately 100 basis points from prior guidance. And adjusted operating margin is expected to be in the range of 37% to 37.5%, up 70 to 80 basis points from prior guidance. Adjusted EPS is now expected to be $0.40 higher than prior guidance in the range of $16 to $16.40. The effective tax rate guidance remains unchanged in the range of 16.5% to 17.5%. In closing, we continue to manage our cost base carefully so that we can deliver value to our shareholders, while maintaining investment in gen AI and other strategic initiatives. We believe that we are well positioned for growth as the markets pick up. We're now ready for your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. At this time, we'll conduct the question-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Toni Kaplan : Terrific. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask regarding ASV, the guidance seemed pretty wide in terms of the range. Are there sort of a wide range of array of outcomes that could happen? I think the midpoint sort of assumes that things maybe stay -- are flat sequentially and so therefore that would maybe be a little bit better than the last few quarters. So just want to get a sense of, you know, you talked about the challenging environment, like any green shoots there, and how we should be thinking about that? Thanks. Philip Snow : Thanks, Tony. It's Phil. I'll start and I think Helen will have a bit more detail here. So yes, we definitely have more visibility now on Q4. 4.75 is the mid-range now, mid of the range that we just gave you. We wanted to make sure we de-risked sort of the low end. So the low end is at 4. So we feel really confident about this range and feel confident about the middle of the range. There are though, I mean, it is our biggest quarter and there are a lot of swing deals in the quarter, a lot of seven-figure opportunities. So you never really know until the quarter's over whether or not you're going to get all of those. But I do think there's reason for optimism here. As I mentioned in my comments, we had some very nice wins in Q3 that was strategic, new kinds of wins for us across the portfolio lifecycle, really helping clients with total cost of ownership. So I'm becoming more encouraged in our ability to go out, help clients save money with the existing portfolio lifecycle set of products, as well as the tools that we're now building for generative AI. Helen Shan : Yes, no, I think as Phil had mentioned, we had some very good wins earlier in Q3. And so when we take a look at Q4, we've also had a number of deals that have longer decision cycles and that's moved us a bit as well. But if I look at the weighted pipeline for Q4, it's in line with last year and we've been able to sell at the same pace. It's really the end market that's been impacting us from an erosion perspective and cost decisions. So that's why we've gone for a wider range to allow for that, but we're very confident right now at this point that we've de-risked it. Toni Kaplan : Thanks a lot. Helen Shan : Welcome. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from a line of Alex Kramm of UBS. Your line is now open. Alex Kramm : Yes, hey, hello everyone. Phil, you talked about, I think three areas of investments here that you're excited about or that you're focused on, rather. If I go back a few years ago, I think we found ourselves in the same kind of situation. Growth had come down maybe from the environment and you felt like you needed to spend a little bit more to get the growth going again. So when you talk about these investments, if I think about the next couple of years, do you think the company needs another, kind of, boost of investments or do you think you can do all this in the current kind of cost base that you have in front of you? Thanks. Philip Snow : It's a fair question. Thank you, Alex. So, you know, I think the reasons for optimism are we have a lot of ongoing multi-year initiatives that are still being built out and we expect to drive growth in the future. So that would be deep sector, private markets, more recently real time. So a bit of an older vintage. So those things are still chugging along quite nicely and are promising. And in the last 18 months or so, we really have done a good job of freeing up incremental dollars to invest in generative AI and the data platform. And I think we've unleashed another wave of innovation at the company honestly in terms of how we approached this. So I do feel optimistic. It is a fair question though. So as we go through Q4 and we do our rolling three-year plan, I think we are going to evaluate whether or not there are some things that we'd want to invest more in, but we can't really give you any real guidance on that until the September call, but it's a good question. Alex Kramm : Fair enough. Thank you. Philip Snow : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Kelsey Zhu of Autonomous. Your line is now open. Kelsey Zhu : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So the industry data we track suggest that there are some early signs of capital markets activity recovery. So just curious, what are you hearing from your sell side customers and when do you expect sell side ASV growth to reaccelerate? Philip Snow : Well, thanks, Kelsey. So I think we certainly are seeing more activity on the M&A front with the bankers. I think we're seeing a little bit better hiring than we did. Helen might have some more comments on this. And I think if you look at the trends historically as banking fees go up, historically banking hiring has followed that and then historically FactSet\u2019s ASV on the sell side follows that. So if historical trends remain true, no guarantees, you know, I think there are some reasons to be optimistic there. Helen Shan : Yes, I'll add a little bit to that. I think what we're seeing from the large investment banks, the universal banks, the hiring has been pretty muted. So they're being more conservative themselves. We're seeing higher numbers from the middle market banks, the boutiques. So I would say that right now seasonal hiring for the quarter is for the first quarter this year -- for the first time this year, higher than the previous year. But we're not necessarily building that in as a big recovery into our Q4 numbers. Kelsey Zhu : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik of Barclays. Your line is now open. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. Good morning. I guess I just had a little bit of a run rate question and kind of a two part. One, on the top line, is the UBS CS impact now fully in the run rate? Or do you anticipate more impact? And then just specific to expenses as well, you know, all the headcount efforts and stuff you've made thus far. Is that -- is there more to flow through just trying to appreciate, you know, the dynamics on those two? Helen Shan : Sure, Manav, it\u2019s Helen, I'll take the first part. So I would say the majority of the impact from some of that transaction is reflected in this quarter. There's a little bit left in Q4, but it's much smaller. Linda Huber : Yes, and Manav looking at the margin improvement, I want to try to go through the detail of this so everyone understands what's one-time and what continues. So the total good guys on the margin improvement side and this is adjusted operating margin. We're about 540 basis points and then the negatives were about 200 basis points. So let me go through these. The lower bonus accrual of $8 million to get our annual bonus accrual in line contributed about 160 basis points to the good for third quarter and that will not be repeated. In other words, we had to do that adjustment. Lower salaries added about 130 basis points and that will continue. Lower payroll taxes added about 120 and that's a one-time thing. That's based on the CARES Act. It's a refundable tax credit for keeping people on payroll during COVID. Lower facilities expenses added 60 basis points that will continue. Higher capitalization added 40, which will also continue and lower stock-based comp amortization added 20 if that one is caught up and will not continue. So out of the 540 basis points about 280 are one-timers. And then on the negative side We had higher technology costs for 170 basis points and higher third-party data and other expenses for 30 basis points. So 340 basis points overall improvement. And on the good guy's side, about half of that will continue as we move through the year. Hope that helps. Manav Patnaik : Yes, thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from a line of Faiza Alwy of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Faiza Alwy : Yes, hi, thank you. Good morning. So I wanted to ask about the competitive environment. And I'm curious what you're seeing from competitors. It seems that over the last couple of years, you've seen competitors invest as well, relative to what had been the case previously. And I know you talked about price competition for new business, just give us a sense of how you would assess the competitive dynamics at this point? Philip Snow : Yeah, thanks, Faiza. So on the institutional buy side, I would say we have two key competitors there. And the name of the game is really total cost of ownership. So we feel very well positioned with the portfolio analytics that we have on FactSet, but even better position now that we have invested in our front office tools. So I mentioned that we launched PM Hub, which really connects very nicely the middle office solutions that we have with the front office. So I feel really good about our competitive position on the buy side and those firms really are I think feeling the most cost pressure and the ones taking costs out. So I think the firms that have portfolio analytics solutions are the ones that have the right to compete on the buyer side. And I think we're in good shape there. In wealth, similarly, we have the portfolios on the system. We've done an amazing job with our wealth advisor product and advisor dashboard. And you heard me talk about another workflow today, which is sort of the CRM workflow. So we're really focused very heavily now on building out additional workflows for the wealth space, but we couldn't feel better positioned in the wealth space. I think within banking, private equity, corporates, the hedge funds, that space admittedly is getting a bit more crowded. So there's lots of us in there with fundamental analyst products. I think the work we've done with deep sector, with private markets, the tools that we're building with generative AI, all of those I think give us a very nice position there on the competitive front. Helen Shan : And I'll just comment on your point around pricing. As we've mentioned before, there is some price pressure on new logos, but they're not widespread. Really, when it happens is when we're displacing competitors where we may need to reduce price to help match budgets, for example. But the good thing is that we are almost always in multi-year contracts, so we recapture the price and improve our price realization as the contract matures. Faiza Alwy : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Surinder Thind : Thank you. A question about gen AI and just the integration of the tools and the feature set. As clients begin to adopt more and use more, how does that impact the technology costs for you guys? Any code that would be helpful? Philip Snow : It's a great question, thank you. It's a bit unknown at this point, as Linda has spoken about, our technology expenses are going up and that's a good reason, because we're investing here. But yes, as clients use more of these tools, it's going to cost in terms of compute. So of course, we're thinking carefully about that. We have fantastic engineers at FactSet that are sort of monitoring this, and that will be baked into how we end up charging for these products. So it's an equation that will have to be figured out over time. But if we're delivering enough value in terms of saving clients time, which is really what we're focused on, it should outweigh the added expense that we or they would be incurring from the compute. Surinder Thind : Thank you. Philip Snow : Yes. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra of RBC. Your line is now open. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to clarify on the CS UBS headwind. Was that just the net impact or how do we think about like any potential cross-sell opportunity? Was there any cross-sell opportunity, which lowered that impact? And then maybe just a quick clarifying question on revenue versus ASV growth in the fourth quarter. If my math is right, I get at the midpoint of the revenue guidance, less than 2% revenue growth in the fourth quarter, which is almost a 3 point lower than the ASV growth at the midpoint? What's causing that delta, and how do we think about the exit revenue return rate and going into next year? Thanks. Helen Shan : Sure. Hi, this is Helen. Let me address the first part, and then I'll turn this to Linda. As it relates to the Credit Suisse and UBS merger, what we are talking about is on a net basis. So -- we were able to capture some of the cancellation back in selling to UBS. So that's a positive from our perspective. Linda Huber : Yes. And Ashish, you right, it's Linda. Generally revenue lags ASV. We had an unusual one-time acceleration of CUSIP revenues in the third quarter of last year. That increased the revenue attributed to Q3 of \u201823 and by comparison, because that's a tough lap, the Q3 \u201824 looks lower. So some of it is timing. And I think it is fair to note that in the third quarter, while we don't break out CUSIP, because it is core to our business, we had very strong performance from CUSIP, both in terms of growth and margins. So we're very pleased with how that business is doing. But it's -- you're correct, but it is a lapping effect that's causing that. Ashish Sabadra : Sorry, I was wondering if you could comment on the fourth quarter as well. That was helpful color on the third quarter. Linda Huber : Thank you. And the run rate exit at the fourth quarter Ashish, we are not going to give guidance on that. So we'll see what it looks like when we get there, I speak to you about it in September. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to get some additional clarity around the assumptions behind the updated ASV guide. Are you basically assuming that the sales cycles are elongating, so it's basically a matter of timing of when the deals get closed? Or does it reflect increased client events where the business is essentially structurally lost? And then secondly, can you talk a little bit about international pricing and believe fiscal 3Q is typically when you push through your pricing actions? And how does that pricing compared to the prior year? Helen Shan : Sure. Hey George, it's Helen. Let me try to answer. I'll do the pricing one first. So the international pricing increased, you're right, we do it every year in Q3. It was 16 versus 16.8 last year. So you can see that we were able to capture pretty much the same as last year. And that reflects an increase in the number of clients that we're able to capture. So we feel very good about that. And it's in line with our expectations. So we believe our pricing realization and value that we're giving clients remain the same. When we think about the Q4, the reason that we moved some of this as we think about the pipeline is that we are seeing deals continue to move, especially on the analytics the buy side in particular. So they're not falling out is a term that we use. So they're not lost. But since they've moved a number of quarters, because the larger the deals until clients have greater certainty about the end markets, and sometimes our own bandwidth, quite frankly, is more constrained. We're seeing that continue to move. So that's part of the reason. And I do want to make one point again, which I made earlier. If we look at what we expect for the year, the underlying demand for our products remains steady. On a gross basis, we are in line with last year. So we're selling as much as we were last year. So it's not a demand problem. But that being said, we have had a number of onetime cancels that we've talked about. So the impact has been on higher erosion, which we believe is in part obviously driven by market. George Tong : Very helpful, thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas of William Blair. Your line is now open. Andrew Nicholas : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Phil I think you mentioned that you believe AI will drive incremental ASV in 2025. I appreciate all the color there. But I'm just curious on kind of the other side of the coin, maybe in terms of internal cost savings. Is that something that you would also expect to materialize at least at some point in 2025? Or should we still be thinking about this primarily being kind of breakeven cost effort on the expense front. Thank you. Philip Snow : Yes. Thanks, Andrew. Great question. So as you could expect, like many firms, we've been looking at this, and I think there are good opportunities for efficiency and client service, quality assurance, content collection, even just engineer -- just code editing, code writing, so we're evaluating that closely. I think we will get efficiencies. The real question is, do we reinvest those in products sort of going back to Alex's earlier question. So there certainly will be efficiencies that we'll get. We're seeing that -- it's just a question of what we choose to do with that in the end. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Your line is now open. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi. Thank you for taking my question here. I wanted to ask a little bit just to clarify first on the questions that were asked before in terms of like CS and UBS, the fourth quarter guidance implies a down quarter in revenue, which is notable. I don't think we've seen this in about five years on a sequential basis. And want to know if you were to exclude what's going on with the UBS CS license is going away, would you show growth sequentially in revenue if were to kind of normalize for that? I'm trying to understand if that's -- if there's an environment thing or you're being overly burdened by that. And then just in general, there's been a slowdown in revenue growth and Linda I've asked you this before, but you've pulled a lot of levers in terms of expenses, and we're continuing to see the environment kind of meander around. And what left on the board for you in terms of if we don't see kind of a pickup. We're kind of hoping to see a little bit more, I think, from some green shoots that we noted last quarter. But if those don't materialize soon, what other levers would you pull. Helen Shan : Sure. Let me take a little bit of that first, and I'll turn this over to Linda. As it relates to CS, let me talk through, in particular, we mentioned this in our script around the impact, if we take that out as a one-time impact, that would be around 30-plus basis points. Now that's not going to impact revenue right away. That's over the period of time. If I take a look at some of the other one-time items that we've talked about in the past, I think it was back last quarter, that, that one large cancel that's helping to explain that delta. But yes, it is, in my view, again, let me go back. What we're selling is in line with how we've seen it in the past. There are some onetime items that are impacting the erosion and so I do not view this as an issue with our underlying business, but rather more market or again, some things that are a bit out of our control Shlomo. Linda Huber : So Shlomo, thank you for recognizing that despite the meandering market, which is a good adjective for it. We like that. We have been focused [Technical Difficulty] Philip Snow : Hey, Linda, we can't hear you here. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Philip Snow : One second, operator. I don't believe Linda was done yet. One second. Operator : Okay. Linda Huber : \u2026cost basis. And so our people costs are down 10% year-over-year in the third quarter, and our real estate cost down 14% that offsets an increase of 26% in our technology costs and third-party data up a little bit unusually in the third quarter. So we feel like we've got all our lines pretty well under control. The thing that was flattering to the margin in the third quarter was the reduction of our bonus accrual. And of course, that bonus accrual will match our performance with our ASV completion. So we've got a few more things that we can do. I think we've managed very, very carefully. But I don't think we see any major cost-cutting actions coming along. We're pretty happy with where we are. And we planned this all through to match what Helen is seeing for the revenue line for the fourth quarter. So we think we're in a pretty good place. And as you saw, our guidance for adjusted operating margin has gone up 70 to 80 basis points for the rest of the year. So we feel pretty good about our actions. And sorry about the audio issues here. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Huber of Huber Research Partners. Your line is now open. Craig Huber : Thank you. Back to just a broad question here. How would -- again, your thoughts here on the sell side and buy side customers that you have out there in the marketplace. Do you sort of feel like you're just sort of bouncing along at the bottom here that the worst is behind you? How you -- just broadly, again, how would you describe what you're going through right now? I mean, in other words, are you feeling like you're at the very bottom here, and it's just a matter of time before things start reaccelerating. Philip Snow : It's hard to predict that, Craig, I'll start, and I think Helen may have some comments here. I think for a lot of companies 2024 was sort of positioned as the year of cost cuts. So I think a lot of budgets were kind of set late last year and a lot of firms in a lot of industries, including ours, people were taking out costs. It does feel that things are getting more constructive with the clients and my conversations with salespeople and clients. It feels like those projects that were paused are beginning to come back to life. But I'm not sure I would bank on that any sort of -- real sort of tailwinds from the end markets until potentially next calendar year? I think what we're observing now, I kind of would handicap continuing through the end of the calendar year. Helen? Helen Shan : Yes. No, I would agree. It's hard to predict, obviously, market conditions. But I think the softness in banking and the high erosion due to cost consolidations from clients -- and then, of course, the delay in some of the larger projects. Right now, we're assuming that, that's going to remain through the rest of the year, as Phil just said. I will say, as I said before, this is the first quarter that we've actually seen net seasonal hiring banking be higher than the previous year, but I'm not sure we look at that and call it -- make it a call at the bottom. Craig Huber : Linda, could you just quickly give us a housekeeping question I have for you here. Just your bonus accruals, what was it each of the first three quarters this year? I think it was $24 million to $25 million quarterly last year. What was it the first three quarters this year? Sorry for the housekeeping question. Thank you. Linda Huber : That's okay, Craig. And I've just had my microphone replaced. I feel like Taylor Swift. So hopefully, it works. Our first quarter bonus accrual was $30 million. That included a $3 million top-up to sort of catch up a bit from 2023. Second quarter, Craig was $20 million. Third quarter is $18 million. In the fourth quarter, we're thinking it should be in the range of $15 million, $16 million depending on how we finish with ASV. So roughly $83 million for bonus for the whole year. Last year, we were running sort of $105 million for bonus for the full-year. So the unfortunate trend here is that we have to adjust bonus based on ASV achievement, which is about two-thirds of our bonus calculation and margin is the other third. So I hope that gives you the detail you're looking for, Craig. Craig Huber : Yes, that's great thank you guys. Linda Huber : Sure. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Russell Quelch of Redburn. Your line is now open. Russell Quelch : Yes, hi Phil and Linda. Just wanted to drill down into the private market space a little bit. A lot of your competitors are also targeting this area for growth. So could you just a favor and just detail your product ambition here, how you're going to win against the other guys who are targeting growth. And the other angle to this question is it was recently rumored that one of the big incumbents in the space is for sale. So is this something you might look at to accelerate your positioning growth in the area? Philip Snow : Yes. Thanks, Russell. So yes, we've not been shy about talking about this. And we have been investing steadily since 2019 in private markets. We've built out, I believe, our coverage from around $4 million to $8 million or $9 million. So we've doubled that. The quality is getting higher. We acquired Cobalt, which you'll remember. And we're just continuing to work with a lot of partners in the ecosystem. So I think this is an important area. Private credit, obviously, is important and something that we're taking a look at. And obviously, we can't comment on any transactions that may or may not be out there right now. Russell Quelch : Okay. Thank you. Philip Snow : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Balsky of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Heather Balsky : Hi. Thank you so much. I want to first ask with regards to ASV growth, if you could provide some color in terms of what you're seeing with regards to price versus volume right now and how that tracks versus, I guess, what you expected in the year. And then the other question, bigger picture, and I realized you just talked about kind of potentially the malaise we're seeing persist until the end of the year. I know this has been a really tough environment to kind of get visibility, but when you think about the recovery, based on what you've been seeing, how do you think things recover? Or do you think we can have a V-shape recovery -- do you -- do you get the sense that your clients are going to move very gradually, just given all the uncertainty in pad? Just any insight you have? Helen Shan : Sure. I'll start with that one, Heather, thanks. This is Helen. Thanks for the question. So overall, part of the reason that we see some of the deals that get delayed, because of their size. So when I think about volume and pricing, actually, interestingly, our volume, meaning number of transactions is considerably higher this year than last year. And I would say, in the low to mid figures is where we're seeing the biggest pickup probably as high as 20% higher if we -- as we think about the end of the year. So what that would mean on average, the volume is down in terms of the size of the transaction. So as you might guess, in order to grow that, you need larger deals. So these larger transactions, which we have a very high number of opportunities, but if they don't sort of convert them in that quarter, that's where we're seeing that right now. So I think that all ties together higher volume at an average price that's lower right now in terms of just opportunity size. As it relates to a little bit of where do we end up in the bottom, it's very hard to say. I think it varies by firm type. Typically, we've seen banking being the quickest to respond. I think we had thought that, that would be better in the second-half of this year. We're not seeing that. So we'll have to see how that goes as mentioned by Phil before, if capital markets picks up, where we end up in that. But technology is very much the driver right now. And so as clients are looking to upgrade and as we saw post-COVID, once they're ready to spend the decisions tend to move more quickly. So I think it's going to be very much dependent on the market conditions. Philip Snow : I do want to kind of add on and point out that it's up to us to make our own tailwinds here. So regardless of the end markets, we have a $28 billion total addressable market, the way it's been defined historically. Eight of that is beginning to open up to us now with the feed products that we're creating. And then to build on what Helen just said, I think is firms look to outsource more from a technology and even managed services standpoint, I think that addressable market grows. So there's no shortage, honestly, of addressable market. And I think the companies that are positioned well moving into this can create some of their own tailwinds despite what the market is giving us. Heather Balsky : Great. Thank you. Philip Snow : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of [Guru Siddarth] (ph) of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : This is Guru on for Owen and thank you so much for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about the deep sector offering. I think the last major update was back in Q1 when it helped displace a competitor in banking. So any updates here? Because this really seems like it could be a solid driver give behind AI. So any updates or insights over here? Philip Snow : A little bit, Guru. Thanks for the question. So yes, we're certainly shipping away here. I believe we now have eight sectors with some good coverage and over 80 reports within the workstation. And I believe we're also building out some feed deals. So there's an active pipeline, and it is an important aspect of what most banks want to see now when things come up for renewal. So I think there's just 1 or 2 of us in the market, honestly, that have this in banking. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thanks a lot. Philip Snow : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Wurtzel of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Scott Wurtzel : Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for squeezing me in here. Just wanted to go back to the wealth segment. I'm wondering if you can maybe sort of characterize the overall demand on the wealth side relative to what you're seeing on institutional buy side and sell side. I know you talked about modest growth this quarter, but I would love to just kind of hear characterization of the overall demand and compared to some of the other end markets you operate in. Philip Snow : I think it's the healthiest one for us, honestly, Scott, thanks for the question. So we have a very active pipeline there of deals of various sizes. And we're beginning to build out some interesting workflows beyond sort of what we've been providing over the last few years. And with the introduction of some of these AI tools, I think we're in very good shape. So I'm very optimistic about wealth and our ability to accelerate from here. Scott Wurtzel : Great, thank you. Philip Snow : Summary, we believe we are well positioned in terms of both our strategy and product portfolio to capitalize on the ongoing megatrends in our industry and for when the end markets become more constructive. Thank you all for your great questions today. We'll see you all in September. Operator, this ends today's call. Operator : Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

Unidentified Company Representative : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FactSet's fourth fiscal quarter 2024 earnings call. Before we begin, the slides we reference during this presentation can be found through the webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at factset.com. A replay of today's call will be available on our website. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions from investors. The call is scheduled to last for one hour. To be fair to everyone, please limit yourself to one question. You may re-enter the queue for additional follow-up questions, which we will take if time permits. Before we discuss our results, I encourage all listeners to review the legal notice on slide 2, which explains the risks of forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the appendix to the presentation and in our earnings release issued earlier today. During this call, unless otherwise noted, relative performance matrix, reflect changes as compared to respective 2023 period. Joining me today on the call are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer; Helen Shan, Chief Financial Officer; and Goran Skoko, Chief Revenue Officer. I will now turn the discussion over to Phil. Philip Snow : Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to share our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2024 results. We ended fiscal 2024 with organic ASV plus Professional Services growth of $104 million or 4.8%, which is just above the midpoint of our guidance range provided in June. Annual revenue increased to $2.2 billion, adjusted operating margin to 37.8% and adjusted EPS to $16.45 or 12.3% growth, all above the high end of our most recent guidance. Amidst the ongoing backdrop of macro uncertainty, we continue to see evidence of the green shoots we observed last quarter. These positive trends paired with our solid execution resulted in sales momentum on large deals as we closed out the year. While we remain cautious, I'm encouraged by the reacceleration of our new business and growth to end the fiscal year. Turning now to our financial results. In the fourth quarter, we added $54 million of ASV, which was in line with what we delivered in Q4 last year. This was driven by several large multiyear renewals and seven-figure competitive displacements across multiple firm types. For our organic ASV performance by region, in the Americas, we had 6% growth strength from strategic wins in wealth and momentum from long-term renewals on the sell-side were offset by softness on the buy-side. In the EMEA region, growth decelerated to 2%. Gains from wealth were offset by headwinds to retention on the buy-side across the region, as market conditions continue to constrain the budgets of our mid to large-sized asset manager clients. In particular, one-third of the deceleration in the quarter was the result of a cancellation by one large buy-side client. In the Asia Pacific region, we delivered growth of 7%. Wins across wealth with our analytics product suite and data solutions were offset by higher erosion from banking and asset management clients. Now looking at trends by firm types. Wealth management was the largest contributor to our ASV growth in fiscal 2024. Even with one-time loss earlier in the year of a client in-sourcing one of our services. In the fourth quarter, we experienced strong demand, and organic ASV growth accelerated to 12% for the year led by multiple large enterprise deals in the long-term renewal. These large wins in the fourth quarter build on our competitive displacement of an incumbent at a marquee wirehouse client in the first quarter. In the fourth quarter, we secured a win against the same competitor in the Canadian market, where we now hold significant share with three of the region's top five wealth managers. Another notable advisor desktop win in Q4 was a significant displacement of a competitor where we are replacing a high number of high-end terminals at a leading private bank. In total, we added over 23,000 advisor desktops in fiscal 2024, representing over 30% growth in seat count to bring our total wealth users to north of 100,000. Our wealth workstation has proven to be a differentiator with clients seeking firm-wide enterprise deployments that improve productivity of their advisors. And we believe that FactSet is well positioned to continue our momentum in competitive displacements. As we broaden our offering for wealth managers, we are seeing early success in adjacent workflows. In the fourth quarter, we captured our first enterprise deal in the wealth middle office for performance and managed services. We also achieved a significant milestone in the first sale of our conversational API. This large deal powers a leading private wealth client through programmatic access to FactSet Mercury, our GenAI-powered knowledge agent. In dealmakers, organic ASV growth was 4%. While headwinds impacted this segment earlier in the year, we observed a reacceleration in Q4. This growth was driven by gains from a seven-figure competitive win in banking to displace our main competitor in this space and several multi-year contract renewals and a modest uptick in seasonal hiring. Conversations with our clients indicate a cautious optimism for more normalized hiring in banking in the months to come. On the institutional buy-side, we faced a backdrop of tighter budgets and vendor consolidation that led to an organic ASV growth rate of 3%. These headwinds persisted throughout the year and were most pronounced for asset managers where higher erosion and the large asset manager cancellation put pressure on retention. While ongoing fee compression continues to be a challenge for the industry, FactSet is among the few players that clients can choose to partner with to help consolidate spend and lower total cost of operations. For partnerships and CGS, organic ASV growth was 6%. Softness from partnerships was offset by continued strong performance from CGS. In the fourth quarter, new business and renewal expansions added to growth while a lack of large deals and a significant cancellation were headwinds. As we transition to fiscal 2025, we continue to execute against the strategic multiyear investment plan we outlined last quarter. There are three main pillars driving our focus. First, the continued data expansion to finish what we started. Over the past several years, we have executed the largest content expansion in FactSet's history, including deep sector, private markets and real-time. These initiatives have added to the growing universe of proprietary connected data on our platform, which increasingly differentiates FactSet from our competition. Additionally, these data investments are not only helping us win on renewals, but also driving our success in many of our competitive displacements. The focus of our targeted investments in the upcoming year will be on bringing these offerings to maturity. Secondly, embed FactSet deeper into client workflows. Across each of the firm types we serve, there is continued runway for us to streamline and simplify our clients' workflows. For the institutional buy side, we are prioritizing investment in the front office where there is substantial opportunity to leverage our strongholds in portfolio performance, analytics and risk to deliver differentiated value. With over 5.5 million institutional portfolios representing nearly $30 trillion of AUM flowing through our middle-office systems each night, FactSet is in a privileged position to connect this holdings data with the portfolio workflows of front-office users. In wealth management, we aim to capture further market share by building on FactSet's growing presence on adviser desktops to expand into adjacent workflows such as prospecting and digital reporting. And finally, for dealmakers, we continue to accelerate engagement with our banking clients to bring next-generation automation their research, financial modeling and pitch creation workflows. In addition to optimizing workflows boost productivity for junior bankers among whom FactSet has a strong and loyal following, we are also investing to expand on our technology-driven differentiation for senior professionals. The third pillar is accelerating innovation through generative AI. A fundamental element of our strategy is executing on our AI road map. Since announcing FactSet Mercury and our AI Blueprint late last year, we have focused on integrating generative AI directly into our clients' workflows and enhancing their overall FactSet experience. There are early signs that FactSet's differentiated open ecosystem approach to GenAI is resonating, and our investments in this area are already paying off. Earlier this year, we launched multiple new GenAI-powered solutions, including portfolio commentary, transcript assistance and conversational API powered by Mercury. And we are seeing meaningful usage of each by clients, which is starting to drive incremental ASV and improve retention. I look forward to sharing more on our GenAI progress at our recently announced Investor Day on November 14, including a number of exciting new AI products available in beta release through FactSet Explorer, our product preview program, which has now expanded to over 50 clients across banking, buy side and wealth. In addition to our own efforts, we are enabling third-party developers and technologists to build their own proprietary workflows on top of FactSet's data and technology. Through our AI partner program and GenAI data packages, we are providing programmatic access to our curated content and incubating an ecosystem of fintech firms who need data to fuel their solutions. In summary, I'm pleased with how our team closed out the year in a challenging market environment. In the face of industry headwinds, FactSet continues to be a trusted partner that clients can depend on to reduce their total cost of ownership. With our open platform, flexible approach and history of innovation, we see tremendous opportunity in helping clients modernize away from incumbent processes to get out of legacy technology and data debt. We are well placed to meet this demand with our broad enterprise offering across data, workflow solutions and services. We are guiding to organic ASV growth of 5% at the midpoint for the upcoming fiscal year, balancing a more muted outlook in the first half of the year with improvement in the second half. We're encouraged by the nascent market recovery and our solid execution this past quarter. This is positive momentum to build on, and I'm excited about our opportunity ahead. Over our 40-plus year history, FactSet has delivered a consistent track record of sustainable long-term growth. We remain committed to expense discipline and deploying capital responsibly to balance the trade-off between reinvesting to accelerate growth and expanding margins. I will now turn it over to Helen to discuss our fourth quarter and full year performance in more detail and take you through our fiscal 2025 guidance. Helen Shan : Thank you, Phil and hello to everyone. As highlighted in this morning's press release, the fourth quarter proved to be our highest in terms of ASV growth. In the fourth quarter, we added $53.5 million of organic ASV, in line with last year's results, bringing our annual total to $104.4 million, slightly above our June guidance midpoint. This result is a 4.8% year-over-year increase in organic ASV plus professional services. In fiscal 2024, we grew revenue 5.7% on an organic basis, extending our record to 44 consecutive years of top line growth and showcasing our resilience during periods of market volatility. We improved adjusted margins and EPS, exceeding the top end of our most recent guidance, though GAAP margins and EPS was affected by a one-time item, which I will address later. First, our quarterly results. As we noted at the beginning of the call, reconciliation of our of our adjusted metrics to comparable GAAP figures is at the end of our press release. GAAP revenues increased 5% to $562 million, driven by sales in wealth, banking, asset managers, and asset owners. Organic revenues, excluding foreign exchange movements and any acquisitions and dispositions over the past 12 months, increased 5% to $563 million. For our geographic segments, organic revenues grew by 6% in the Americas, 3% in EMEA and 6% in Asia-Pacific. For the fourth quarter, GAAP operating expenses increased 3% year-over-year to $434 million with lower compensation expenses primarily offset by a one-time $54 million charge related to a Massachusetts sales tax dispute, which we have disclosed in previous filings. We do not anticipate taking additional material charges with respect to this matter. On an adjusted basis, operating expenses grew 1%. Looking at each of our four major cost categories in turn, technology costs, our main expense driver, increased 20% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, mainly due to higher amortization of internal use software and increased investment in generative AI. For the year, technology cost was about 9% of revenue. Conversely, employee expense decreased by 7% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, driven by lower compensation expenses due to earlier cost reduction efforts and a lower bonus accrual. For the year, our people expense was 39% of revenue, down 300 basis points from the prior year. We ended the year with a bonus pool of $86 million, 13% lower than last year. And as a reminder, 69% of our employees are located in our centers of excellence. Third-party content costs rose by 15% year-over-year in the quarter due to changes in the timing of variable fees and remained at 5% of revenues. Real estate and related expenses decreased 9% year-over-year in the quarter due to office space optimization. For the year, these expenses declined to 3% of revenues, 50 basis points lower than the prior year. Our deliberate expense management is positioning FactSet for future growth by allowing us to self-fund additional investments in technology and strategic initiatives in fiscal year 2025. As compared to the previous year, Q4 GAAP operating margin increased by approximately 110 basis points to 22.7% from reduced employee compensation costs and revenue growth, offset partly by a Massachusetts sales tax charge. Adjusted operating margin improved by 240 basis points to 35.8% from lower bonus accrual and salaries, partially offset by higher technology costs. A detailed expense walk from revenue to adjusted operating income is in the appendix of today's earnings presentation. Cost of services, as a percentage of revenue, declined 330 basis points year-over-year on a GAAP basis, primarily due to lower compensation expense, partially offset by increased intangible amortization. Adjusted cost of services was lower by approximately 40 basis points. And in the fourth quarter, SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 620 basis points higher year-over-year on a GAAP basis, primarily due to a $54 million Massachusetts sales tax charge. Adjusted SG&A was approximately 200 basis points lower, primarily due to lower compensation expense. Turning to taxes. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 23.6%, down from approximately 39% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. This decrease was primarily due to the inclusion of a prior year tax adjustment. Our GAAP EPS increased 38.1% to $2.32 this quarter versus $1.68 in the prior year period. This was due to a decrease in employee compensation costs and an increase in revenues, partially offset by charges related to a Massachusetts sales tax dispute. Adjusted EPS rose by 23.8% to $3.74 from revenue growth, margin expansion and a lower tax rate. Free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending, was $137 million for the quarter, a decrease of 12% over the same period last year. The drivers are lower net cash from operating activities and increased capital expenditures. Fiscal 2024 free cash flow was $615 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year. Demand for our solutions remained steady with a fourth quarter ASV retention rate of over 95% and a client retention at 90%. Through the fiscal year, we expanded our client base to over 8,200, adding 296 new logos. Concurrently, our user count increased 14%, adding over 26,000 to our total, driven primarily by wealth and dealmakers. On capital return for the quarter, we repurchased 153,650 shares for approximately $63 million at an average share price of $412.09. For fiscal 2024, we bought back a total of 537,800 shares for approximately $235 million at an average price of $437.40. On September 17, 2024, the Board of Directors of FactSet approved a new share repurchase authorization for up to $300 million. We paid a quarterly dividend of $1.04 per share today, to holders of record as of August 30, 2024. As a reminder, we increased our dividend by 6% in the third quarter, marking the 25th consecutive year of dividend increases. We remain committed to returning long-term value to our shareholders. Over the last 12 months, we have returned $386 million to our shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we paid down $62.5 million of our term loan, reducing our gross leverage to 1.6 times. This is consistent with our plan to repay the term loan in full by the second quarter of fiscal 2025. And finally, turning to our guidance for fiscal 2025. As Phil mentioned earlier, we anticipate growth accelerating as the year progresses, the next six months aligning with current conditions and the balance of the fiscal year improving from more favorable financial markets, execution on several long-standing large opportunities and new demand for our GenAI products and enterprise solutions. Our views are supported by a first half sales pipeline that is comparable to last year. We foresee sustained momentum in wealth, subdued activity in banking and modest improvement on the buy side. While we anticipate continued pressure on client budgets, we believe the overall pace of erosion will begin to moderate. Given these expectations, we are guiding incremental organic ASV growth of $90 million to $140 million, reflecting a 5% growth rate at the midpoint of our range. We expect adjusted operating margin of 36% to 37%. This range includes higher technology and content costs, the reset of the bonus pool and targeted investments in banking and buy-side workflows, offset by lower controllable costs such as professional services. We are committed to maintaining expense discipline while also investing strategically to increase revenue and ensure earnings growth. Finally, adjusted EPS is expected be in the range of $16.80 to $17.40. With respect to additional modeling assumptions for fiscal 2025, we expect interest expense to be between $44 million to $48 million. And we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $95 million to $105 million. We remain positive about growth opportunities, particularly in wealth and buy-side solutions. By executing our generative AI road map, expanding connected content and integrating FactSet further into our clients' workflows, we aim to increase market share and enhance client retention. We are committed to supporting our teams with the tools and knowledge they need to ensure we remain the partner of choice. We are now ready for your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open. Look like Alex's line disconnected. We'll move on to the next question. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Toni Kaplan : Thank you so much. I think this question is for both maybe Phil and Helen. You've had a very significant period of margin expansion since 2021 when we look forward, just given the balancing act that you mentioned of investment versus margin, should we view 2025 as representative of a normal year or how should we be thinking about margins over the long term? Thank you so much. Philip Snow : Toni, I'll start and I think well Helen will have quite a bit to unpack there. I say this is probably a bit of a reset year. We've obviously expanded margins significantly. As you mentioned, I think the CUSIP acquisition obviously was a tailwind for us there. But we have ended up I believe beyond we've set out at the previous Investor Day, which was a little over two years ago. So we do believe we're investing well. We've had some long-standing programs that are fully funded and through our own efforts of sort of being more efficient and self-funding, we feel we're in a great position to continue to invest. But Helen, why don't you provide a little bit more detail. Please. Helen Shan : Yes. No, happy to do that. Thanks, Toni. So we took expense actions in 2024 to really help expand margin in what was a challenging top-line environment. And quite frankly as Phil said, we are higher than what we had originally aimed for in a medium term outlook, which is 35% to 36%. We've also worked to reduce spend in absolute terms in targeted areas like real estate, and we've managed down variable expenses when needed, like our incentive compensation. So I think when you think about the difference of margin between the midpoint of 25% and where we ended 2024, about half of that is attributable to resetting the bonus level because it's meant to be reset for our new -- for the New Year. And the balance is really to help cover technology costs. And so I would look at this as a more normalized level. Now we are doing a fair amount of investing as well. And all of that as I mentioned in the script is very much self-funded. So that's already in the rate that we're giving in our guidance. Toni Kaplan : Thanks so much. Helen Shan : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC. Your line is open. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on the prepared remarks about improvement in the second half or the growth accelerating as the year progresses. Despite that second half 2025 progress, the 2025 ASV guide implies no improvement compared to like 2024, despite potentially better macro with Fed cutting rates. So I just wanted to understand what's your macro and pricing assumptions baked into the guidance? Thanks. Philip Snow : Well, I'll start. Thanks. Ashish. Appreciate the question. We do see out for the next few months, the continuation of some of the headwinds we've experienced frankly for the last two years. But we are beginning to see some green shoots. So I think we saw a modest uptick in banking hiring in Q4. And obviously, we had a lot of really great significant wins in Q4 which the team did a great job of closing. And it was very encouraging that our largest clients were really working very quickly through -- with us through that period, which I think is a great indicator of how much they want to work with us moving forward. And as you know FactSet traditionally has been a tale of two halves, we typically have a much larger second half than first half. So I think we're -- we think that's sort of the best balance. We do think that once we get through the end of the calendar year, clients will have had a chance to reset their budgets. And I would think most of the uncertainty that's been out there in the market will be behind us. So that's quite a bit of our thinking and I don't know, Goran or Helen, if you wanted to add on to that. Goran Skoko : The only thing I would add to what Phil said is that I think we have a good product pipeline. And I think we had recent product launches that will contribute to our acceleration in the second half. We had some sales of those products in the fourth quarter, which further proved that point. But really are hoping to build the pipeline in the first half and realize sales in the second half. So we do expect by the second half in 2025 as we usually have. Operator : Thank you. Please stand-by for our next question. Next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open. Alex Kramm : All right. It seems like I pressed the right button this time. Hello. I guess just very quickly on the buy side, maybe you can flush out your comments a little bit more. One, you mentioned a large asset management cancel this quarter. Can you maybe give a little bit more background? It seems like in asset management, you usually have a very sticky offering and not a lot of competitive threats. So just wondering what's going on there. And then overall, the asset management environment looks like headcount reductions or hiring is stabilizing. So are you seeing some of that already? Or is it still too early to kind of get more positive on that end market? Thank you. Philip Snow : Thanks, Alex. So yes, let me address the first part, which was that cancel. Yes, every now and then, obviously, we're going to face a large cancel. And I think this one was probably just due to a firm needing to consolidate and being under cost pressure. But maybe what I'll do is just give you a little bit more data than we have in the past on our top 10 versus bottom 10 wins for the year. So if I look at our top 10 largest ASV wins for the entire fiscal year, nine of those were against competitors. And seven of them were against our top 4 competitors, which I think are well understood. And four of those displacements had over 700 seats added for FactSet. In the bottom 10 deals, six were lost to competitors, but only three of them were to our major competitors. And four of the bottom 10 deals were the result of M&A or firm closure. So I think there is a consolidation and cost pressure in the industries. On the buy side, in particular, when they look to really stitch together the front, middle and back office, we're going to win some, lose some on that. And this was a case where we lost. But in our top 10 deals, there was one which was the opposite, where we won against the same competitor. The second part of your question, anecdotally, I would say it is becoming more constructive on the buy side. When meet with the C-suite on the buy side, it feels like there's an appetite to continue to do the transformation. But the cost pressures are there, honestly, and it's really up to us to execute against that. Helen Shan : Yes. And I might add a little bit to that. As we think about the buy side, one of the areas that we're seeing continued demand is on the managed services, which is really not -- it's more of an enterprise, not a seat-based type of solution we provide. So, it had some strength in '23, and we continue to see that grow again in '24. So, we would probably look to that as one of the drivers of buy side going forward. Alex Kramm : Excellent. Thanks, guys. Philip Snow : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on the strong performance in CGS that you called out in your prepared remarks, Phil, I guess how fast has CUSIP been growing? I imagine with all the headlines in CDs, it's a pretty big number. So, just curious if you could give us the update on how fast it grew this year, I guess, what percentage of the business it is and what you've assumed for 2025? Philip Snow : Yes. Thanks, Manav. So yes, we don't break that out, but it is a significant portion of the partners business line, which we broke out, I think, earlier in the slide. So that compared with FactSet's traditional partners business grew in aggregate at 6%. CUSIP really drove the growth. We did have a couple of partnerships that have been significant in the past, where we lost some ASV there. So I think you can probably triangulate what happened there. The CUSIP team did a great job this year executing. And I'm really encouraged by the pace of new development there in terms of their thinking. So, I guess, maybe we can talk a bit more about that later, but that's about all we can talk about right now. Operator : Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Faiza Alwy : Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thank you. So I wanted to ask about the ASV guide for 2025. You're not baking in sort of any type of acceleration, which seems prudent. But I'm curious how you would characterize that? Is it more conservatism on your end? Are you seeing sort of anything in the marketplace that's leading you to believe that things won't change? And then I know you have your Investor Day coming up. So maybe give us a preview of how we should think about a more normalized ASV growth for the company. Philip Snow : Yes. Thanks, Faiza. So yes, so as I already mentioned, we're seeing a bit of a headwind here as we sort of finish out the year, but we're much more optimistic about the second half. So we provided a range. I do think there's an opportunity to do better for sure. I'm really encouraged by what we're seeing on the generative AI front. So that's a bit of a wildcard that we're beginning to monetize that, and we have a great pipeline. So if that begins to come in or accumulate at a faster rate, I do think that, that would be encouraging. Someone mentioned hiring. Historically, we have been very highly correlated to hiring on the buy-side and the sell-side. I think if sell-side hiring goes up faster than we have anticipated, and we have been pretty conservative there on the sell-side, I think that could certainly be a tailwind for us in this year. But do remember that particularly for some of these larger deals, it's a pretty long sales cycle as we go at the enterprise level now. And I think at Investor Day, we'll be sharing more. We can't say too much now. But what I do want to stress is the team is most focused on the top line, right? So that's what we want to do. We're not happy growing at 5%. We want to grow faster, and that's going to be our main focus and what we'll talk more about at Investor Day. Faiza Alwy : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Kelsey Zhu with Autonomous. Your line is open. Kelsey Zhu : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So you've previously talked about GenAI kind of expected to start delivering incremental ASV in FY 2025. I'm assuming that's already included in the 4% to 6% ASV growth guidance. But just curious, have you sized the impact of GenAI investments for both ASV and expense outlook for the next few years? Helen Shan : Sure. Why don't I take a shot at that one? Thanks, Kelsey. So when we think about the impact that GenAI I may have, that's why as Phil mentioned, we're looking more at the back half of the year. So that's when a lot of our new solutions that are powered by GenAI will come out in the first half. So that we'll be able to have a better perspective of that. It is baked in our guidance range, and that's why we're talking about it being the first half more in current conditions and the second half boosted by what we hope will be stronger capital markets activity and demand for the new products as well as enterprise. And ideally, as we talked about some of the green shoots of reduced erosion. So, when I think about how much that's baked in there, we'll see somewhere between maybe 30 to 50 basis points is where we might see that come through. As it relates to the expense side, I think right now, when I look at the total amount of investments that we're making, I would call it about 50-plus basis points also attributed to GenAI, both what we've been investing in, what we're going to continue invest into the 2025. Kelsey Zhu : Thanks a lot. Helen Shan : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Your line is open. Surinder Thind : Thank you. With respect to the ASV guide, how should we think about the current pricing environment and what's built into the guide? And then related to pricing, how does something like FactSet Mercury or your AI offering, how do you price that? Helen Shan : Sure. I'm sorry, what was the second part of your question? Philip Snow : I'll take the second part, it's a pricing for AI. Helen Shan : Okay. I'm sorry. Sure. I can do that -- you can do that. So our standard pricing, what's baked in here, as you know, in our contracts, we have either the higher of CPI or RPI or 3%. So we do see some headwind going into 2025 as it relates to our annual price increase. But I want to make a separation between the annual price increase and then what we are able to do as we sell throughout the year. Our rate cards have been adjusted depending on the experience and activity. And so we've been raising the prices on our packages. And the price realization against that on average has been above 80%. So we feel good on what we're able to capture as we sell into this market. I would expect the same for this year as last year, meaning we have a larger book, and we have net new clients. So we will capture incremental dollars and the price realization, as I mentioned, against our rate cards. So in total, we do expect the total contribution from pricing year-over-year to be down modestly, but overall, still a good contributor to our overall growth rate. Philip Snow : And in terms of pricing for AI, we're arriving at a model for this. Of course, we'll iterate on it. Some stuff will just get baked into FactSet out of the box. And we've already got some great product in there called Transcript Intelligence and Search Intelligence. You can go and look across a lot of different documents to get an idea of a trend of what's happening, get questions answered. Secondly, we're going to release deep workflow solutions. So we've released Portfolio Commentary. And we'll be charging for that on a usage basis. So it really will be driven by how many portfolios and how many commentaries you want to create. We did get a lot of demand for customization there after we announced this at Focus back in May. But we've done a lot of that work now. So we're a great position to go out to the market. We've literally got hundreds of clients interested, and we'll be able to essentially customize this to some extent for them out of the box. So that's an approach we'll take with many of these things. We'll take a bundled approach in some cases where you can get a bundle of capabilities and get price for that. But most of this is going to be usage or consumption-based, I would imagine, and it might depend on the product. So a lot of it will be incremental ASV. We did have a great sale in Q4, which was our conversational API. So really, the search experience that you would have on a FactSet, a client wanted to use that within their own ecosystem. And a lot of the larger firms are going to want to do this. So we've taken a federated approach, which I think is a real winning approach. I'm going to pass the baton here to Goran because he had a lot to do with that sale. And do you want to add on to that and sort of your level of enthusiasm for this fiscal year? Goran Skoko : Yes. So it's certainly a sale, we believe, is repeatable. We are already building a pipeline and interest across multiple clients. And as mentioned in terms of new product launches, expect the results to show up in the second half of the year. But I think what is really significant is that this approach -- a federated approach to our conversational API really helps clients to accelerate their internal development and is really -- it's really a huge benefit to their overall cost structure when it comes to GenAI development that they do in-house. So quite excited about it, equally excited about Portfolio Commentary and some upcoming releases that we'll be talking about at the Investor Day. Surinder Thind : Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. Operator : Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. George Tong : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Your fiscal 2025 revenue growth guide of just over 4% is a deceleration from about 5.5% growth in fiscal 2024, even though ASV growth in fiscal 4Q benefited from several large wins that should ramp into next year. Can you help bridge the gap and discuss what may be dampening revenue performance next year compared to fiscal 2024? Helen Shan : Hi, George, I'll take that one. So as you know, the nature of our business, it is a recurring revenue business. So when the ASV goes in is how you get to recognize it. So a stronger Q4 is certainly helpful, but then you are carrying the last three quarters, which were as know lower. So revenue is a lag to ASV growth. And you'll see that over the period of time, if you look back at the last, whatever, 10 years. That's the way that it works. So that's the delta between the two. It also matters how the ASV gets converted in year. So as we mentioned already that the first half will be likely more where we are today and the second half being stronger. And so then that, again, will reflect more of the first half in revenue and then hopefully help us more into 2026. George Tong : Got it. Thank you. Helen Shan : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is open. Andrew Nicholas : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask maybe a bigger picture one on the investment dollars. It sounds like the year-over-year decline in operating margin is at least in part or it sounds like half is tied to the reset of the bonus pool, but there's obviously incremental dollars here tied to investment. And I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the thought process, how you think about kind of balancing that investment spend with kind of your priorities of driving top line growth? And then kind of relatedly, if embedded in your guidance is some flexibility to potentially ramp up investment spend as we move through the year, if you're hitting higher ends of your revenue guidance because it does look like a little bit of an inverse relationship between revenue growth and operating income guidance based on the table on the release. Thank you. Helen Shan : Sure. I'll take that. It's a very good question. So, as we mentioned before, we were able to take some expense actions in 2024 and reduce spend, which gives us some room for investment. So, overall, what I would think about the additional investment that we're putting into 2025, that is included in our margin and I'll call it self-funded, is roughly around 150 basis points, of which half is investments in GenAI, which we'll see that come through as Phil was speaking to likely on the front office as well as in banking and wealth. We're also investing in content, which comes through the form of real-time and fixed income and then also in our buy-side workflows. I mentioned earlier the increase in demand on managed services as well as investments we're going to be making in trading. And then lastly, a bit into infrastructure because to do some of the consumption tracking and billing to support the GenAI and other types of solutions that we have that are based more on usage, that's a bit built into our total of 150 basis points of spend. So, it's being funded in two ways; the productivity gains that we've taken as well as selected reduction in discretionary spend such as in professional services. So, we believe this is the right way to balance the need to invest for top line growth, which, as we said, is our primary focus, but also with the aim of maintaining the strong margins that we've already achieved. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Owen Lau : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I do have a follow-up with the investment, Helen, you just mentioned. So, as you start to monetize GenAI, do you need to continue to invest to maintain the growth rate or you can scale back some of your maybe early investments or current investments at some point? Thanks. Helen Shan : Sure. And I realized I didn't answer the second half of the other question, so I'll try to combine those two. So, first, I think we're early -- in the early stages of this. So, I won't make a view of whether or not we can pull back. I do think that if we're able to realize some of the ASV earlier and if that's stronger that we'd be able to invest more as needed. So, right now, I think what we're looking really is to continue as long as we can get the returns higher than our cost, we will look to continue to invest, Owen. And as I said, it won't just be in GenAI. They'll continue to also be in content as well as into the workflows themselves. Owen Lau : All right. Thanks a lot. Helen Shan : Thank you. Operator : Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeff Silber : Thanks so much. Earlier, you referred to some of the wins you had in your top 10 customers. I think you said there were nine that you took share from your competitors. I know this may be a generalized question, but was there anything specific that drove that share change? I know each contract might be different, but I'm wondering if there are any commonalities in those deals. Thanks. Philip Snow : Yes. Thank you for the question. So I mean, one trend that I would like to highlight is, we're just doing a lot more at the enterprise level with our clients now. And I think Goran has led a lot of these key wins by selling into the C-suite and driving home some new solutions that are repeatable. So, we had that amazing win in Q4 at a client where we're doing sort of middle-office performance for wealth. Goran's driven a lot of our success himself and with a great team for wealth over the previous years. And you can see how well we did in that space this year. And a lot of these key wins were in the wealth space. So, I would say wealth is a common theme. Enterprise level is a common theme. The fact that I think our clients are sort of excited about consuming value in lots of different ways from us is a theme. And then we've just got an amazing desktop product. I mean we continue to grow that. We had a great win in banking, and we just go from strength to strength in banking. And a lot of that's been driven by the investment in deep sector and private markets, but just the work the team continues to do around the efficiency for bankers and that's -- I think we're going to see a step change in that once we release some of these GenAI products. Goran Skoko : And just to add to what Phil said, in addition to in that top down selling, I think our ability to compete for that higher-end terminal, especially in the wealth management has really improved this year as we have added fixed income content and other capabilities. So, we're encouraged that that will drive future growth. One of the most encouraging signs about the wins that we have had is that we're expanding into additional workflows and diversifying our sources of ASV. Phil already mentioned, expansion into performance reporting at a large client, but we have also seen a very significant win, again, in wealth management on -- in terms of expanding into portfolio-related workflows. So that is something we will be building on in 2025 and going forward. So these wins Phil's highlighting are really important to us. Operator : Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Haas with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Jason Haas : Hi, good morning and thank you for taking my question. I'm curious if you could comment a little bit more on what you're seeing in regards to the competitive environment. It sounds like you're winning your fair share out there. But I'm curious if -- given it's still a tough backdrop if you're seeing any level of aggressive pricing from some your competitors? Thanks. Goran Skoko : Hi Jason, thanks for the question. I wouldn't say any different than what we have experienced in the past. I think we always face competition and different level of aggressiveness when it comes to pricing. So we are always keeping an eye out on the competition and exactly how we perform in terms of wins and losses. I do not think that much has changed competitively. There is certainly increased focus by some of the competitors on some of the segments that we do really well in, but we do not see that anything has significantly changed. Helen Shan : I'll add a little bit to that. It is a, as Goran said, a competitive environment. So we're being smart about this. So for example, in new business, we will, at times, given that they're switching costs, but to get the competitive displacement, we'll go in and be as competitive as possible. Now that being said, we've selectively used that pricing to also lock into longer term contracts as well. And Goran said, we've seen some good success there in wealth and banking and incorporates. So I think we're just being smart how we're using price to be able win market share. Operator : Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Your line is open. Craig Huber : Yes, hi. Thank you. Question here. Over the year, how are your hedge fund clients doing in that market and also, when you sell into corporates? How is that going for you right now? Is it getting better or worse or about the same? Helen Shan : So I'll take a shot at that that one. I would say it is about the same. It depends. We see a fair amount of churn on the hedge fund side, Craig. So we'll see ones that go down, and then they'll come pick back up. So our goal there is if they reconstitute themselves and come back as a new hedge fund that we catch them on the new business front, which we've seen a fair amount of. Interestingly, we've had good activity from the hedge fund community in Asia, in particular in the Singapore arena. So we're seeing what is relatively new growth out there, but hedge funds have done well. Corporates, we have a great partnership with a company called Irwin that we also do a lot of business with, and we've seen that uptick this year as well. There's a lot of churn. And our new logos, which we talked about in our call does come a lot from corporates. Craig Huber : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Russell Quelch with Redburn Atlantic. Your line is open. Russell Quelch : Yes. When you think about your strategy to stimulate top line growth back above 5%, I wonder do you feel you may need to be more aggressive in exploring inorganic actions? Or perhaps alternatively, would you consider partnership opportunities to accelerate growth in areas such as wealth, where you think there's a big TAM opportunity? Just curious as what you're thinking there is ahead of the Investor Day. Thanks. Philip Snow : Yes. Thanks, Russell. Yes, maybe we can talk more about that then. But yes, we're -- do think it's a good time to be exploring partnerships more aggressively. I think certainly with the work we've done to open the platform and be more interoperable, there's an opportunity there to team up with certain firms for different sort of market segments. And on the M&A front, we're in a much better position than we have been for the last couple of years to do some targeted M&A just because we were -- obviously, we did a large acquisition with CUSIP, and had to get to this place. So we're seeing the M&A markets become more constructive. There's more things coming up that are of interest to us. And we're going to maintain our discipline, but we do see that, that's a lever that we can certainly use to drive top line growth. Russell Quelch : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is open. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. Phil, I want to ask you a little bit just holistically, over the last few years, we've seen the company expand the margins. Growth hasn't been as much as what we've historically seen. And FactSet has usually been more of a growth company. It seems like now, the guidance right now is for margins to be down a little bit sequentially, but a lot more talk about the new products or anything. Is there any change philosophically that is going on recently within the company where you have pivoted a little more to margin and now are pivoting more to growth? And I just wanted ask you to talk about that. And then just a little bit about the 2H improvement this year versus what you were talking about last year because the outlook at this time year was almost exactly the same way in terms of a muted first half and then expectations in the second half. If you could point out the differences internally where you have line of sight to things, I would say, beyond just kind of the Fed rate cut, but things that you're actually seeing in front of you that give you more confidence this year versus last year, that would be helpful. Philip Snow : Yes, sure. Thanks, Shlomo. Yes. So philosophically, there's really been -- I don't -- there hasn't been a big change. We have always focused on growth, and we've also focused on delivering cash flow and out to the market. You've been covering us for a long time. So we take a lot of pride in that balance. It's been a while since we consistently grew in double digits, I mean at least a decade, but we do aspire to get back to high single-digits. I think that's something we would like to do. And this is -- like in my tenure at the company, this is sort of the third sort of two- or three-year period where it's been a really tough market. And I think -- so a lot of what we've experienced in the last two years has just been market pressure on us, I think, executing against that. So I think part of what you saw there in terms of our focus on margin was just really to continue to deliver good earnings growth to the market. So no huge change there. I think we were a bit more optimistic last year that the headwinds would dissipate more quickly. They didn't. But I do think now that I think we feel more confident that the market is going to be more constructive. And we've done such a lot to evolve the platform. I think we're very well positioned to help clients at a much larger level than we did historically. So the name of game now for us has got to be seven and eight figure deals. That's what's going to move the margin -- move the top line, sorry. I think we're in a great position to do that. On the flip side, we're very focused on efficiency as well. I do think there's a good opportunity for FactSet to be more efficient and whether or not we choose to invest that in more product and other's the question. And generative AI certainly is going to play a part for us as it does when we think about building products for our clients. Goran Skoko : Shlomo, just maybe to follow up on the second part of your question. I think what gives us increased confidence, I already mentioned it, but I think the level of innovation and new products that we have delivered this year. And we really believe that, that's going to contribute to the second half projections that are more optimistic than the first half. So we are not counting on the market necessarily turning. But I think just that product pipeline and what we think we can deliver based on that. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Scott Wurtzel : Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just wanted to go back to some of the commentary on the data expansion side of your sort of strategic investment plan with deep sector, private markets and real time. Just wanted to maybe get a little bit more color on sort of how that's coming up and maybe impacting your conversations with clients, specifically on the renewal side. And then I know we'll probably hear more about this at Investor Day, but if you can kind of give us a sense of maybe sort of the road map on the product side with those three initiatives would be great. Thank you. Philip Snow : Yes, sure, Scott. Why don't we start with real time? I'm going to ask Goran here because he has a lot of experience with this, and I think we're at a good inflection point. Goran Skoko : Yes. So I think we continue to make excellent products in that area. We had a very large win on the real time a couple of years ago. I think the client has gone live with all of their deliverables, and we're quite proud of the progress there, all of the -- in terms of the content coverage and adding all the over-the-counter type content all over this flowing through the product. We're excited in terms of the opportunity there. I'll add on the deep sector a little bit as well. So we continue to make excellent product progress there. We have multiple clients engaged with us in terms of delivering really desk by desk in terms of the sector coverage and are really encouraged by the level of client engagement and product progress in that area. Philip Snow : In private markets, we continue to invest there. Obviously, that's -- a lot of different firms are interested in that for different reasons. We've really -- I think the biggest highlight for us is we've doubled our coverage to, I believe, around 9 million companies or securities and just increasingly better data. So that's a great underpinning for our efforts in banking, in private equity, venture capital. Asset owners are looking at that. There's just a lot of ways that we're able to monetize that investment. Scott Wurtzel : Great. Thanks, guys. Philip Snow : Welcome. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm showing no further questions in queue. I would now like to turn the call back to Phil for closing remarks. Philip Snow : Thank you. So I just first want to really thank Helen and the entire sales team for really closing out the year in such a great way. I think that's encouraging for the upcoming year. And I want to thank all of you on the call and all FactSeters for the hard work they did this year. And we look forward to seeing you all at Investor Day on November 14. I think it's going to be well worth your time. We're going to show some really innovative products and talk about the future and what you can expect from FactSet. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. To ask a question during the session, you will need to press star one on your telephone. You will then hear an automated message advising your hand is raised. To withdraw your question, please press star one one again. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Yed He, interim head of investor relations. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Yed He : Welcome to FactSet's first fiscal quarter 2025 earnings call. Before we begin, the slides we referenced during this presentation can be found through the webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at factset.com. A replay of today's call will be available on our website. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions from investors. The call is scheduled to last for one hour. To be fair to everyone, please limit yourself to one question. You may reenter the queue for additional follow-up questions we will take if time permits. Before we discuss our results, I encourage all listeners to review the legal slip notice on slide two, which explains the risk of forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, please refer to our forms 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the appendix to the presentation and in our earnings release issued earlier today. During this call, unless otherwise noted, relative performance metrics reflect changes as compared to the respective fiscal 2024 period. Also, please note that beginning in this first quarter of fiscal 2025, FactSet will be reporting organic ASV, rather than organic ASV plus professional services, and focus on the recurring nature of our revenues. Joining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer, Helen Shan, Chief Financial Officer, and Goran Skoko, Chief Revenue Officer. I will now turn the discussion over to Phil. Phil Snow : Thank you, Yed, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to share our first quarter results. We are off to a good start in fiscal 2025 with solid operating performance, growing organic ASV 4.5% year over year, delivering an adjusted operating margin of 37.6%, and achieving adjusted diluted EPS of $4.37. While a backdrop of macro uncertainty and cost pressure faced by clients continues to persist, we saw momentum building during the first quarter. We remain cautious, but I'm encouraged by the trends we are seeing in the pipeline. As a reminder, the ASV we add in the first quarter is seasonally the lowest of the year. Given the timing of large deals, it is also important to look at half and full-year performance as more holistic measures of our progress. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect ASV growth in fiscal 2025 will be second-half weighted. Before turning to our financial results, I want to thank those of you that joined our investor day last month and for the positive feedback we received. For those that missed it, we discussed FactSet's strategy to supercharge financial intelligence and help clients as their trusted data and technology partner by delivering efficiency and innovation to their end-to-end workflows. This strategic direction builds on our market-leading franchises across the firm types we serve and is underpinned by our technology evolution, investment priorities, and product roadmap. There's still much to do, but we are confident in our ability to execute and achieve the medium-term targets we shared with you at Investor Day. Demand for our solutions remains steady with ASV retention over 95% and client retention at 91%. During the first quarter, we grew our client base to almost 8,250, and our continued expansion within wealth drove our user count over 218,000. Turning now to our organic ASV performance by region. In the Americas, we grew 5% as we lapped a significant wealth win in Q1 last year. New business accelerated in the quarter across wealth, hedge funds, and asset owners. Improved retention across asset managers was overshadowed by softness in areas where clients are reprioritizing budgets. In EMEA, we experienced 4% growth driven by wins in partnerships and asset owners with additional contribution from PEVC, hedge funds, and overall improved retention in the region. And in Asia Pacific, we maintained 7% growth. Improved seasonal hiring and banking relative to last year was a driver, particularly data solution wins with partners were offset by lower retention with asset manager clients. From a firm type perspective, our results were mixed. After a very strong Q4 to close the year, wealth organic ASV growth was more subdued in the first quarter. Seat count continues to increase at a strong clip, sequentially adding over 2,000 users driven by marquee accounts. We also continue to add smaller wealth management clients this quarter. It's difficult to control the timing of when large deals close, but we remain confident the deceleration this quarter is temporary. And within wealth, we continue to see a healthy pipeline of seven-figure opportunities with potential to upsell existing clients and expand the solution set, giving us conviction that growth will reaccelerate over the next several quarters. In dealmakers, growth was in line with last quarter. Banking, seasonal hiring continues to normalize but remains a drag to growth. As discussed at Investor Day, we expect several new products will add to the acceleration of our banking business in the second half of the year. Most notably, our Gen AI-powered pitch creator offering is already seeing traction in our client conversations with two wins in Q1, ahead of our formal launch in early calendar 2025. Outside of banking, we saw continued acceleration in PEVC to double-digit growth, led by several competitor displacements and strength in Cobalt, our modern portfolio monitoring tool. Adding to corporates, we closed the acquisition of ON in early November to expand FactSet's ability to address the integrated workflow needs of IR professionals with an integrated modern solution. We have a strong pipeline and have already seen increased inbound interest from investor relations users since the acquisition was announced. For the institutional buy side, we maintained growth consistent with last quarter. The highlight for the quarter is a landmark seven-figure performance solutions win, where we beat a competitor and displaced key incumbents at a global outsourced CIO provider, seeking to overhaul their technology stack and solutions across the portfolio lifecycle. This wide-ranging enterprise deal includes our portfolio analytics, multi-asset class capabilities, and performance reporting solutions. This win also underscores FactSet's ability to effectively partner with clients using our managed services offering to deliver workflow efficiencies and an improved operating model. Within asset management, we continue to see erosion pressure as clients scrutinize their budgets and pursue vendor consolidation, particularly with small and midsize firms, where it is more difficult to reach scaled efficiencies. Our recently announced partnership with JPMorgan Security Services seeks to address this total cost of ownership challenge by coupling FactSet's performance reporting and portfolio analytics solutions with accounting and investment book of records through JPMorgan's fusion data management platform. For partnerships in CGS, growth was solid. Improved retention and an increase in larger wins with partners contributed to accelerating growth. CGS continues to perform well, buoyed by the strong issuance market and content expansion. As we execute against the strategy we outlined at Investor Day, clients are increasingly viewing FactSet as an innovation partner that can help them gain greater insights, drive lower cost of operations, and elevate productivity so they can focus on high-value work. We are leveraging our industry-leading data and technology to responsibly harness the power of Gen AI to bring more speed, accuracy, and efficiency to our clients. Building on the AI blueprint we announced last year, we recently unveiled our intelligent initiative, which integrates conversational AI at the platform level to enable next-generation search intelligence. This latest innovation in our series of new product developments leverages FactSet Mercury, our conversational knowledge engine, to provide actionable and auditable insights across our extensive content refinery of structured and unstructured data assets. We hear loud and clear from our clients that they are not interested in marketing hype and promises of the future. They are demanding practical workhorse solutions to boost productivity, unlock efficiencies, and optimize daily workflows. We will be launching new workflow solutions throughout the year that will add to our rapidly evolving Gen AI capabilities and product set. In summary, I'm pleased with the start to this year. It's worth reiterating that similar to last year, we expect growth to be weighted towards the back half of the year. As we head into the start of calendar 2025, I'm encouraged by early signs of momentum picking up as clients reset budgets in what many are anticipating as an improved macro backdrop. There's budding confidence that the operating environment may improve as we progress through the year. A few examples of green shoots this quarter include greater client engagement in banking, strengthened data solution sales to hedge funds, and a greater pace of competitive displacements in PEVC, to name a few. We have a robust pipeline, greater visibility on some larger opportunities, and many new innovative products that resonate with clients. I'm confident in our path forward. As such, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2025 guidance. I will now turn it over to Helen to discuss our first quarter performance in more detail. Helen Shan : Thank you, Phil, and hello to everyone on the call. It is great to be back with you all again. As you've seen from our press release this morning, we began our fiscal 2025 with solid operating performance and an uncertain but constructive market environment. Q1 organic ASV increased $3.4 million or 4.5% growth in a quarter that is seasonally our lowest. Also, a reminder that starting this quarter, we are no longer reporting professional services in our ASV in order to better reflect the recurring nature of our revenues. On this new basis of reporting, the comparable ASV for the prior year is provided in this morning's release. For the quarter, GAAP revenue increased 4.9% to $569 million. Organic revenue, which excludes any impact from both acquisitions or dispositions over the past twelve months and foreign exchange movements, increased 4.7% to $568 million, driven by sales to wealth firms, asset owners, and institutional asset managers. For our geographic segments, organic revenue grew by 5% in the Americas, 3% in EMEA, and 6% in Asia Pacific. Turning now to expense. GAAP operating expenses increased 6.8% year over year to $377 million, driven by the amortization of intangible assets, compensation-related expenses, and professional fees. This captures certain one-time nonrecurring items, including acquisition-related costs. On an adjusted basis, operating expense grew 4.9% at the same rate as revenue. Technology spend was the primary expense driver, which increased 18% year over year, largely due to higher amortization of internal-use software and our continued investment in generative AI. As outlined at Investor Day, we are committed to investing in products and technology to maintain the market leadership needed to drive sustained and future growth. For the quarter, technology costs were just under 10% of revenue compared to 9% last year. Employee expenses increased approximately 2% versus the prior year, as we held our headcount largely flat. People-related costs remain our largest expense category at 39% of revenue, down 130 basis points year over year. We continue to exercise operational discipline to self-fund investments in our strategic priorities through more efficient operations and increased productivity. Third-party content costs increased 4% year over year and remained less than 5% of revenue. Real estate and related facilities expense decreased 4% year over year. These expenses are now less than 3% of revenue, approximately 30 basis points lower compared to the prior year. For a more detailed walk from revenue to adjusted operating income, please refer to the appendix in today's earnings presentation. Compared to the previous Q1, GAAP operating margin decreased by approximately 120 basis points to 33.6%, largely due to one-time items. On an adjusted basis, operating margin was flat year over year at 37.6%. In the quarter, our cost of services as a percentage of revenue was lower year over year by approximately 90 basis points on a GAAP basis and just under 70 basis points on an adjusted basis, primarily due to lower compensation expense, partially offset by increased intangible asset amortization. SG&A as a percentage of revenue was approximately 210 basis points higher year over year on a GAAP basis, primarily due to people expense and an increase in professional fees. On an adjusted basis, SG&A was 70 basis points higher than the prior year. Turning now to taxes. Our effective tax rate in Q1 was 16.5%. This was an increase compared to the 15.2% tax rate in the first quarter of last year, primarily due to the revaluation of a foreign deferred tax asset associated with a tax rate change. Our GAAP diluted EPS increased 1.3% to $3.89 this quarter versus $3.84 in the prior year period, driven by higher revenue, offset by margin compression and a higher tax rate. Given these same factors, adjusted EPS increased by $0.25 or 6.1% to $4.37. EBITDA increased 5% to $230 million compared to the same period last year, driven by higher net income and higher add-back items. And finally, free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending, decreased 56% year over year to $60 million in Q1. This was largely due to the resolution of a sales tax dispute, timing of vendor payments, and higher capital expenditures during the quarter. As we discussed at our Investor Day, we remain disciplined in our approach to capital allocation and are committed to returning capital to shareholders through a combination of stock buybacks and dividends. In the quarter, we repurchased more than 104,000 shares for approximately $49 million at an average share price of $467. At the end of the quarter, we had $251 million of capacity remaining under the $300 million share repurchase authorization approved by our board of directors back in September. Today, we paid a quarterly dividend of $1.04 per share to holders of record as of November 29, 2024. Also, in the first quarter, we reduced our term loan principal by another $62.5 million, lowering our gross leverage ratio to 1.5 times. We expect the term loan to be repaid in full by the end of Q2. Our capital allocation remains consistent with our commitment to maintain investment-grade metrics. And finally, as you heard from Phil, we are reaffirming our previously issued guidance. While there's still some variability around client budgets, we've observed encouraging signs with increased engagement and a growing willingness to make purchasing decisions. In the final weeks of Q1, we've experienced positive momentum, which we are determined to maintain in order to achieve our full-year objectives. We are actively taking steps in pricing and packaging to enhance our competitiveness against incumbent providers, such as with hedge funds and PEVC firms. These actions have resulted in higher new business, and with multiple pilots currently being tested, we are looking to replicate the success across various firm types in different markets globally. Our sales pipeline is healthy, and we continue to witness promising demand for our new Gen AI products and enterprise solutions, setting the stage for this year to be another story of two distinct halves. In conclusion, we remain confident in FactSet's ability to deliver sustainable long-term shareholder value. By harnessing the power of our data and technology investments, we are poised to enhance our clients' financial insight and workflows significantly. And with that, we are now ready for your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is now open. Alex Kramm : Yes. Hey. Good morning, everyone. Sorry to be so short-term focused here, but obviously, you're talking about the two halves, but I feel like both Phil and Helen, both of you, talked about green shoots and optimism for the second quarter. So if I look at the Q1, probably a little bit softer than what you saw last year, maybe some things slipped a little bit. I also think there's a chunkier deal coming into the second quarter. So shouldn't we be positioned for acceleration in ASV growth already in the second quarter, or how should we be thinking about the cadence from here? Thanks. Phil Snow : Thanks, Alex. Appreciate the question. So let me talk a bit more about the momentum that we just talked about in the script. And it's not all just Q2, but let me talk about the rest of the year. So we are very encouraged by the momentum we're seeing. You know, in any given year, we're going to have a number of big rocks that are out there that could be new RFPs or renewals, and I would say in the balance, I'm very happy with how that's landed so far. In terms of Q1, the big deal we did, and some of the visibility we see moving out. More, you know, and across fund types, wealth just continuing to look very strong. Out of our top ten deals for the year, wealth makes up about half of those, and I talked about the seven-figure deals. So that is a very well-performing part of our business with a lot of opportunities. I would say that we're also seeing, as Helen mentioned, increased momentum in private equity venture capital. We're seeing really good momentum in the hedge funds. Some of that's driven just by data that they're consuming. And then within corporates, you know, we did the acquisition of Owen. That's always been a good part of our business. But all of those end markets look poised to grow potentially at 10% this year. So we're very excited about those. Thinking about banking, it's still a bit more uncertain sort of going into the year what the hiring's going to be like, but we're having really good renewal conversations in the middle markets. And the feedback that we're getting from our clients around the pitch creator product, which is the productivity tool on top of our current suite, but using AI, is getting really exceptional feedback relative to what people are seeing from our competitors. And that's playing a big part, honestly, in some of the renewals that we're doing. So, you know, that's sort of one angle. Maybe what I'll do is I'll ask Goran now to talk a little bit more about some of the sales activity and how that compares to last year. Goran Skoko : So I think we have certainly seen improvement in the pipeline and activity as we have gone through the quarter. Phil alluded to the last six weeks particularly being very productive for us. You know, to illustrate the increase in activity, I think our trials have gone up 23% in the Americas and 13% in Europe. And RFPs, we see a 30% increase year over year in Q1 of this year versus last year. So I think that's where the optimism for the remainder of the year comes in for us, and, you know, we are quite optimistic about the activity and the client interaction that we've had today. Phil Snow : Yeah. I'll just end with this one, Alex, which is, you know, I think we've already talked about this, but the CPI increase that we'll be able to capture this year is lower than last year. And, you know, as inflation has come down, but I've seen really good work from Goran and the sales team on closing that difference in terms of, you know, what we would get. And on the buy side, even though that's outside of hedge funds, even though that's the piece of our business that's under the most cost pressure, that team has done an amazing job of beginning to build up a stronger pipeline as we enter the second half. So, you know, we're optimistic and all signs so far are, you know, pointing green compared to, you know, how we were feeling maybe three or six months ago. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is now open. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi. I hate to use my one question on it. The kind of housekeeping thing, Helen, but I'm going to do it anyway. Can you explain the total company ASV growth of 4.5% but the components were each lower than that, like buy side of 4.3 and sell side 3.5? Is there some kind of calculation adjustment that's being made to those items that would get you there 4.5? Helen Shan : Yeah. No. And thank you for that. I do understand why that might be a little bit confusing. So in the past, we've always included all of CGS in the ASV calculations of both licensing and issuance, but we did not include in the buy side and sell side calculations the CGS issuance growth because it doesn't quite fit into that. But this quarter, as you, I'm sure, have noticed that there's been quite a lot of issuance. And as a result, CGS issuance really helped drive some of the organic ASV growth rate this quarter. It contributed about 25 basis points to get us to the 4.5%. So that's why you're seeing that disconnect where buy side is at 4.3, sell side at 3.5, but CGS added another 25 basis points. That's how strong it was. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kelsey Xu with Autonomous. Your line is now open. Kelsey Xu : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. It sounds like managed services could be a key growth driver for buy side ASV going forward. I was just wondering if we have any updated thoughts on total addressable market, who the key competitors are in this space, and just generally your strategy to expand in that market. Thanks. Phil Snow : Thanks, Kelsey. I'll start, and then I'll ask Goran to weigh in as well. So, yeah, we've seen some great momentum and work there from the team. You know, we closed a good deal in Q1 for an outsourced CIO provider that will include quite a bit of managed services here. And there are some deals that we announced last year that did as well. And I think you probably saw the press release where we have entered into sort of a partnership with JPMorgan to do some work for them. So that's that there were managed services associated with as well, even though that deal was, you know, it's been going on for a little while now. We do see a good opportunity here, and it is, you know, really linked to our product suite. So in many cases, these services are being applied to our technology and the fact that we've opened up the platform, particularly for the analytics suite, that's traditionally served the buy side. And that's, you know, the performance solution that we have is, you know, I think best in class. And that's now being leveraged pretty heavily by some of these firms. So I'll stop there, and maybe, Goran, you could add a little bit more color as to what else you see in terms of opportunity. Goran Skoko : Yeah. So, you know, I think a couple of things in terms of competition. I still have, as Phil said, I think demand of services for us are a little bit different than, you know, you would expect from managed services type providers, and it's really that highly skilled talent that we have that can help clients with their performance reporting or, you know, risk reporting type activities that is what we are providing to the clients and augmenting their internal capabilities in the process. It's particularly effective in the environment where the clients are cost-sensitive, and we can help them in their total cost of ownership by providing managed services and allowing them to focus on the high-value activities. So, you know, we're excited about the progress over the last, you know, five, six quarters since we launched services, and we think that there is considerable upside there. You know, I don't have the market size because, quite frankly, there is no direct competition. Helen Shan : Comment on that since this is a relatively newer service that we're offering, but it was performance and now risk and reporting. And what we're tracking are the attach rates, and they're quite good. So back to Phil's comment, and we've already been with clients in the middle office, and what we're seeing is that they're turning to us to help them especially to gain more scale. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Faiza Alwy : Yes. Hi. Thank you. So I wanted to ask about, you know, you mentioned that you're getting exceptional feedback on sort of some of the Gen AI products and, you know, what folks are seeing from your competitors. So curious if you could give us a bit more color around that. Is that, you know, across the board? You know, are there any specific products where you're maybe getting more traction? And maybe if you can dimensionalize that for us, like, is there a way to think about, you know, potential contribution from ASV this year? Is it incremental to the guide? Just a bit more color there would be helpful. Phil Snow : Yeah. Sure. I'd be happy to, Faiza. Thanks. So on our last call, I think Helen stated that we continue to expect or we're expecting 30 to 50 bps of growth in FY 2025 from, you know, from the monetization of Gen AI. So that is included to some degree in the guidance that we gave you. But, you know, it's obviously a wildcard, and we could potentially do better than that. We certainly, you know, we didn't have a huge number as a goal for Q1. So some more of it is sort of weighted to Q2, Q3, and Q4. But what we have seen are very encouraging signs. So we've monetized, you know, six or seven things already. One was the conversational API that we spoke about last year, which is the, you know, client's ability to essentially take that FactSet Mercury experience that you could have if you had a FactSet workstation and plug it into your own environment. So that was a wealth use case that we monetized last year. The banking products are getting great feedback. So we have something called Pitch Creator, which further automates the pitch creation process, and there's all kinds of news out there right now about, you know, how really tough it is for junior bankers, the number of hours they're putting in, and the strain that they're under, and this will, you know, things like our tombstone creator will really help them, you know, with productivity. So that will be officially released in the coming months, but it's already played a key part in a few renewals. So great feedback there. We also have, you know, I think, shown some ability to monetize AI, you know, from our data. So in two ways. So we now had, you know, we had a close where we sold data specifically for somebody that was building a Gen AI product. And then, as we've spoken about previously, we have our AI partner program where we'll work with small technology providers to empower them for their workflows, portfolio commentary, you know, which we've had out there for a while now. We, you know, we got our first commitment to that, which will show up after Q1. So the good news is, you know, we're proving that we've got products that can be monetized, and the question now is sort of building up. We have a very solid pipeline, by the way. So now it's as we get into January first, it's monetizing these at scale, which is the exciting part of it. So overall, it's still, you know, a very exciting thing for us as a company. It's the type of stuff we love to build. We certainly see great potential. Of course, there's lots of news out in the market about, you know, firms maybe not monetizing this as quickly as they thought, or is it real? We believe vehemently that it is real. You know, it may take some firm types longer than others to get comfortable bringing these solutions on board, but we're ready, and we're already seeing the demand. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC. Your line is now open. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks for taking my question. In the prepared remarks, there was a reference to softness in areas where clients are departing budget. I was just wondering if you could provide some color on that front, but also as we get into calendar year 2025, any early commentary on how those budgets are shaping up for your customers? Thanks. Phil Snow : Ashish, I didn't that came across a little muted for me. So you asking about the just overall across all firm types? Or how the budget discussions are going? Ashish Sabadra : Yes. Yes. That's right. Thank you. Phil Snow : Okay. Goran, do you want to address that, please? Goran Skoko : Sure. You know, I think we do not see a big change in terms of the budgets. Early signs are that, you know, the client budgets will remain flat, and the clients will continue to focus on, you know, on cost for the foreseeable future. We are encouraged in terms of clients' continued engagement in terms of their, you know, transformation of technology and in terms of implementation of new tools and new content that can be to help them across their investment process. So we're quite encouraged by all of the activity and, like I said, you know, the number of trials and RFPs has increased significantly, which I think, you know, gives us reason for optimism and more productive client conversations for the rest of the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Scott Wurtzel : Just a quick housekeeping one. Just on the Irwin acquisition and, you know, how we should think about the contribution from that to total revenue for this year would be helpful. Thank you. Helen Shan : Thanks for your question. I'll take that one, Scott. So it's not going to have a material impact in terms of the acquired revenues themselves. So broadly speaking, if it's small, we don't call it out. So it's not going to have a material impact on the top line. But it will help our corporate's business overall. Phil Snow : And just to add to that, you know, it's early days, but the acquisition case we had and what we expected to deliver between now and the end of August, our fiscal year is either on or above, you know, what we thought it was going to be. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Silver with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Silver : Thank you so much. I wanted to shift gears to talk about margins a bit. If I remember correctly, you're guiding to margins for 2025 to be somewhat slightly down. They were flattish in the first quarter. Is that something that, you know, we should expect to continue? Should we expect to continue or expect to see, you know, margin compression in the back half of the year? And if so, what are the reasons for that? Thanks. Helen Shan : Yeah. Thanks for that question. So this quarter, we saw some good favorability compared to year over year with lower people costs. If you recall, we did take some actions through the year, so in comparison, that came through. There's some timing of some third-party credits that also came in that was favorable. And then, of course, we've had productivity overall. But as we reaffirmed our guidance, we do like the ramp-up on expenses starting in the second quarter. We had a little bit of a slow start in investments that we've talked about in our last call. So it takes some time to hire. So the people cost, we think, will be higher in Q2. And then keep in mind, last year, we also had a comparison with our adjustment to a bonus accrual. So there's going to be some of that comparison. We do expect tech costs to go up as well as we're really ramping up on infrastructure spend and cloud-related expenses. So I would look at the H1 margin to be closer to the midpoint of our guidance range. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Toni Kaplan : Thanks so much. I wanted to look at the wealth part again because I think you mentioned that you were lapping a big wealth win in the quarter, but specifically called out maybe a deceleration because of timing around large deals. But a good pipeline. So I was hoping to talk about, like, are you seeing even more elongated decision-making in wealth? Are you seeing any changes in the competitive environment? Are people being particularly aggressive? I know it's always been sort of a competitive market, but just wanted to get more color there. Thanks. Phil Snow : Great. Thanks. I'll start, and then I'm sure Goran has a lot to say about this. So, I mean, it was we had a very large deal in last Q1. So I wouldn't read anything more into my comments other than we didn't have, you know, something of that size in Q1 or enough singles and doubles to sort of match that, but, you know, as I spoke about already, Toni, I think we do see that snapping back here pretty quickly. And we see continued momentum in the space, you know, at different levels of wealth shops. At the very largest shops, it takes, you know, a long time for these decisions to be made, and then you go through the implementation. But I would not see that we're seeing a massive change there, honestly, in terms of timing or so on. Goran Skoko : You know, I think Phil covered it well. You know, I think, you know, it's really just we didn't have a win of similar size this quarter. We are very confident that wealth will reaccelerate for the rest of the year. We mentioned that we saw an uptick in new business in wealth management. We saw seat growth. But we are, I think, continuing to successfully displace competitors. We see geographic expansion this year. We're particularly focused on Switzerland and the UK as, you know, growth markets. And, you know, we continue to penetrate additional workflows. So we're very confident about the wealth, you know, continuing to do, you know, very well for us. And I think Phil already mentioned that, you know, we're expecting double-digit growth this year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Owen Lau : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I think I heard that you had the seven-figure landmark win away from a key incumbent. What were the key reasons for the win? Do you have a more competitive pricing strategy or products? And do you expect more wins like that in the coming quarters? Thanks. Phil Snow : Well, I'll chat about this one a little bit, and then as usual, let's Goran weigh in. So this was an outsourced CIO, and, of course, there's a limited number of those globally. But, you know, it was a complicated deal. There were many aspects to what we were doing for them. And, you know, I think it really just comes down to the quality of our technology, our analytics solutions, and our approach to partnership. In fact, Helen, you spent a lot of time, I think, nurturing this deal and getting it over the line. So what would you add for that? Helen Shan : Yeah. No. I think that's right. And our ability to partner was a big piece of this. As Phil mentioned, there's also the managed services aspect, which they wanted. I think there were a number of things that we really brought to the table here, the connectivity and the flexibility of our open platform, so they were able to bring partners to bear. So those would be the ones that helped us and have continued to help us, I think, as we go forward. Phil Snow : I think our multi-asset class capabilities also played significantly into that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is now open. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. Helen, I think you made some remarks around, you know, just the pricing, packaging versus competition. I was hoping you could just elaborate on that just in the context of it sounds like your growth pipelines are obviously really strong, but what exactly are you, you know, tweaking, I suppose, to make the conversions better? Helen Shan : Yeah. Sure. Thanks for that question. So clearly, it's a competitive environment. And all along, we've been investing to improve our products. So a point of, for example, our new business, where that's where you typically see the most price pressure. And it's usually driven in part because to move someone off of a displacement, there are switching costs. And so what we've done is had a very proactive approach where we've targeted specific types of firms, where we've changed our pricing structure. And the result of that, because of the strength of our product, which has improved in certain cases, like in the private markets, the result is having higher volume. We have seen lower price realization, so we are being a bit more aggressive there. But overall, that's resulted in increased ASV. And in particular, we're seeing this in the Americas and in EMEA. So that's where our packaging and pricing is being used as a competitive tool. And along with enterprise as well, we've been able to leverage some of our enterprise solutions, especially during renewals, and that has been very, very effective also. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is now open. Andrew Nicholas : Hi. Good morning. Appreciate you taking the question. I wanted to ask about your appetite for M&A. The latest and greatest there. And, relatedly, is your conviction in the monetization of your AI investments changing that appetite at all, or does it inform the types of assets that are most attractive to you in terms of, you know, inorganic action? Thank you. Phil Snow : Yeah. That's an interesting question. So, yeah, we have a high appetite for M&A. You know, I think we're in a better position to do more now, and there's a couple of gaps in our product suite across firm sites that if we can find the right assets, we'd be excited to execute on. Most of the things we've been looking at, though, Andrew, are not AI-related. Although, we always look for somebody that has a good technology stack, modern, like, we don't have to do a ton of repair work, so that always plays into it. And very often, folks will have already done some work in that area. I believe we've invested enough so far in our AI suite to make a real impact. And by empowering, like, so many of our employees, I think that was the trick to how we've gotten to where we are so far, but I don't know any other thoughts? Helen Shan : No. I think that's exactly right. That, as we mentioned, we've got a strong balance sheet. We've got the ability for increased leverage, and we've also been very deliberate in how we've been allocating our capital. We will spend more on capex this year, for example, to help do the internal builds, but that gives us still ample room to be able to use inorganic as part of our growth strategy. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies LLC. Your line is now open. Surinder Thind : Thank you. I guess I'd like to touch base on the monetization of some of your AI products over the past year. Can you maybe talk about the value proposition from the perspective of the client and what you're seeing in terms of maybe the uplift to your revenues and where the offset is from the perspective of the client in terms of the savings or the efficiencies that they're seeing? Because one of the things that we found is that a lot of Gen AI solutions tend to be quite expensive. And it's quite easy to use a lot of your, what I would call, your credits, tokens, or your AI budget. Especially given that the earlier commentary around, you know, clients not really seeing a material improvement in their overall budgets. Phil Snow : Yep. Well, let me kick it off here. I think there's a lot to talk about. So we're definitely looking to get adoption right and just proof that we're adding value to clients. And then think of, like, I like what you said about tokens. Just think about how do you best monetize this and, you know, how do clients feel like they're getting value and not exposing themselves to big spikes in expense. So, you know, we're hitting a lot of singles and doubles here. There's some deals that are, you know, in the tens of thousands, some that are in the hundreds of thousands. But we're not going out there right now and selling, you know, multimillion-dollar AI solutions. So, you know, the value proposition really is saving clients' time. So the portfolio commentary solution, you know, gets you an excellent, auditable commentary on how you did versus the benchmark in, you know, a minute or less versus how, like, however long it would take somebody to write that. The pitch creator product, we've already talked about it. It's just saving tens of hours of a junior analyst's time in terms of arranging, you know, logos on spreadsheets or running their models or building their templates or their charts. So that's how we're approaching it is really just brute force efficiency and this, you know, there's an idea generation aspect to this, which is important, but we think that low-hanging fruit of the efficiency gains. So Goran or Helen, I don't know if you want to add on. Goran Skoko : I think, Phil, you've covered it well. You know, I think it is really gains in efficiency. You can just imagine, you know, the month-end process on the asset management side and portfolio managers having to deliver their commentary in time, that's certainly where we help them and clients find value. In terms of the cost itself, I think we have done a lot to optimize on our side to make sure that the costs do not run away. And then we spoke about, you know, our pricing model here, which is basically subscription plus consumption-based, you know, that, you know, clients will have lots of visibility into. But, you know, improved productivity on the client side is really the value that we are offering. And then for those that build their own solutions, we are really enhancing their time to market the capabilities. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners LLC. Your line is now open. Craig Huber : Great. Thank you. Can you talk about pricing if you would for this fiscal year? You talked about that it won't be probably as strong as last year. What are you expecting for realized pricing this fiscal year versus last year? And it's just interesting you're talking about expecting overall revenues to accelerate in the second half of the year. It's obviously against a backdrop that sounds like it'll not be quite as beneficial on the pricing side, but if you could quantify as best you could this year versus last? Thank you. Helen Shan : Hey, Craig. Thanks for that question. So, yes, as Phil noted, our pricing is based off the higher of CPI with 3%. So CPI being where it's at, it does put a bit of a lower or a headwind on that front. But, yes, the stronger pipeline helps. Right now, we're still seeing the price realization essentially overall quite flat to the last year, so we're not necessarily seeing an uplift but we're not seeing a degradation either. Now the only place where I noted earlier where that might be the case is where we're doing a new business and in some renewals. But what we're seeing is while the price realization against our rate card might be a little bit lower, we're actually seeing more in terms of volume, so that's sort of p times q concept. Please note that we've also increased our rate cards, so the price realization percentage gets a little bit harder to completely track, but overall, the value that we've been able to provide, we've been able to capture it pretty firmly again year over year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Motamaiden with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. David Motamaiden : Hey. Good morning. I had a question just on the client retention. It was good to see that it's been, you know, around 90%. For the past year, that ticked up a little bit to 91% this quarter. You know, historically, we've seen that when retention has moved up, you've also seen ASV accelerate. That wasn't the case this quarter. Is that just the pricing dynamic? Or maybe you could unpack what was driving that increase in the retention and why we're not seeing that translate to a reacceleration in ASV this quarter? Goran Skoko : So, you know, just a couple of things. I think we're seeing, obviously, we spoke quite a bit about our focus on improving retention during the day. I think we're putting processes, procedures in place to help our, you know, client-facing organization to focus on retention. You know, we're encouraged by the improvement in client retention. There are certainly fewer, you know, client cancels this quarter than previously, which accelerated our retention rate, and that I think is a good sign of, you know, what's to come. You know, all of the retention efforts we're putting in place are currently reflected, I would say, in specific areas. We saw improvement in retention in investment management in the Americas in particular, both for our workstation and analytics solution. And everything that we are focusing on currently, you know, we expect the number of better results as we move as we go along. But, you know, I think not immediate, but, you know, we do expect retention will continue to improve over the coming quarters. Helen Shan : Yeah. Maybe I can add a little bit to what Goran was just saying. Given the number of clients that we have, we see a fair amount of churn, David, at the bottom. So that 1% change, while we like to obviously see higher client retention, the number that is more impactful will be the ASV retention, which continues to be above 95%. But just to make that part, if there's a lot of churn happening, it might make the numbers move a point, but it's probably more rounding than a strong indicator. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Haas with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Jason Haas : Hey. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. I'm trying to reconcile a couple of comments that you've made. So it's good to hear that you're seeing some more optimism on client engagement and a better pipeline. But I think you also said that you're expecting your customers' budgets to remain flat and still be pretty cost-focused. So I wasn't sure if that implies that you're, you know, seeing potential for more share gains or you're seeing a situation where clients are spending more time shopping. And maybe just following up on the budget point, think given that we've had pretty good equity market performance and there's generally an expectation for M&A activity to pick up, why don't you think clients will increase their budget? What's holding them back at this point from doing so? Thanks. Goran Skoko : A couple of things. You know, maybe my comment was a little bit too pessimistic about, you know, clients not increasing their budgets. I think certainly the improved M&A activity and the improvement in banking fees, you know, is something that we spoke about correlation of our sell-side revenues to, you know, to bank fees. And we do expect that some of the macro conditions will improve as we go through the year and, you know, and then the hiring and banking in the fourth quarter takes place. I also think it's really important that our strategy is to make sure that we can perform well in the cost-constrained or cost-sensitive times as much as we can, you know, rely on markets improving. So if you look at the services that provide, we spoke about, you know, managed services or helping clients with efficiency gains with our Gen AI tooling, I think all of that can help us, you know, weather the, you know, the more difficult, you know, market conditions as well. So, you know, we are focused on performing well regardless of the conditions. And, you know, the early signs of budgets, you know, I do not see significant increase, but on the sell side, certainly improving M&A activity would indicate that, you know, we will see some, you know, upward movement in budgets there. Helen Shan : But I think to add to what Goran just said, even if the budgets are relatively flat, it's still early days here, so we're obviously talking with clients as they end out their calendar year, fiscal years. We are seeing a shift more into tech budgets. That's one. And we are doing more and having discussions with the CTOs. So the Gen AI products, what that helps us do is change whom we're speaking with as well, and the sale changes along with that. The other point around market share gain, I think that's exactly right. Goran already spoke to the point around having higher RFPs and trials. That is, in some cases, clients who are looking now to rethink whom their providers are, and that puts us in a very favorable spot as we try to win new business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. George Tong : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. As you look across your different client segments, on a relative basis, can you talk about which you expect to show the most improvement going into the second half of the year and which may perhaps show lesser improvement in performance? Phil Snow : Hey, George. Maybe I'll just go back to some of my earlier comments. So, you know, I talked about, you know, some of the PEVC and hedge funds. So the smaller parts of FactSet, but I think it's showing very strong signs of growth this year. The wealth space we've spoken about, which is bigger, and we continue to feel that we'll see that do well. You know, the two bigger chunks which have more uncertainty around, honestly, right, the banking business and the rest of the buy side, sorry, beyond hedge funds. So in banking, you know, I think we showed at Investor Day a graph that was very popular with many of you, which showed how FactSet's ASV and revenue kind of have a lag to the revenues that the banks generate. So if that comes through, and, you know, there's more hiring, more banking activity, and greater adoption of our AI products as we move through the year, I'm optimistic about the sell side. Again, the piece about business, which has been under the most pressure for a long time, is the buy side that's leveraged to active management. So that's a little bit more uncertain. As I mentioned earlier, you know, the team's done a great job of building the pipeline and closing the gap we had versus the pipeline last year. So hopefully, that helps you in terms of stack ranking those of your model. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is now open. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi. Thanks for squeezing me back in. I just want to ask you a little bit about the pickup you said in the last six weeks that you're seeing. It seems to be like a noticeable pickup in terms of decision-making with the clients. And do you think that that has something to do specifically with the fact that efforts in the product that is resonating more? Would you think that might have to do with just more optimism after, let's say, the presidential elections? Because the last six weeks seem to be very coincidental, like, right around the presidential elections, things seem to pick up. And just, you know, in general, are you seeing anything in terms of administrative picks that be, you know, positive or negative for the industry or for FactSet on its own? You can just address those items. Thank you. Phil Snow : Stop, Shlomo. I'm going in reverse order. So I just think in terms of the election and having it behind us, obviously, the bankers that we speak to are excited. They think it's, you know, the environment's going to be good for M&A activity. And I think just potentially having less regulatory burden on the different, you know, clients out there. Obviously, frees up time and, you know, to do other stuff, which would help us. So Goran, do you want to maybe address the rest of Shlomo's question? Goran Skoko : Yes. Shlomo, I think, you know, part of it, I would attribute, you know, I think we have also put things in place to increase, you know, client-facing activities. You know, making sure that, you know, we're increasing reach-outs and things of that nature. The optimism in the market, you know, there are certainly, you know, I think we certainly see better optimism in the market. I see a more optimistic, you know, sales force around me every day. So I think that's all part of it. So I think it's a combination of things. We are certainly doing everything that we can to improve the pipeline and do as much as we can to improve our results for the rest of the year. And even the market is feeling a little bit more optimistic than it did three months ago. Phil Snow : Great. Okay. Well, thank you all for such great questions and for joining us today. In closing, I'm pleased with the solid performance we delivered to start off fiscal 2025. While the current market environment remains uncertain, I'm encouraged by the conversations we're having with our largest clients and look forward to executing on the robust pipeline of opportunities in front of us to accelerate growth year over year. I'm proud of the progress we are making on strategic priorities we outlined at Investor Day. These efforts are already taking root and give us confidence that FactSet is well-positioned to deliver on our medium-term outlook. And I want to conclude by thanking all the FactSetters around the world for their continued great work and efforts. Happy holidays to everyone. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Operator, that ends today's call. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
