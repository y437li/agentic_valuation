Mueller - JPMorgan Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. David Harris - Imperial Capital Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Shirley, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Prologis First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions). Thank you. Ms. Tracy Ward, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Tracy A. Ward:  Thanks Shirley, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2014 conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. This morning we'll hear from Hamid Moghadam, our Chairman and CEO, who will comment on the company's strategy and the market environment; and then from Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover results and guidance. Also joining us for today's call are Gary Anderson, Mike Curless, Ed Nekritz, Gene Reilly and Diana Scott. Before we begin our prepared remarks I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and in the industry in which Prologis operates, as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filing.  Additionally our first quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures and in accordance with Reg G we have provided a reconciliation to those measures.  With that I will turn the call over to Hamid and we'll get started. Hamid? Hamid R. Moghadam: Thanks, Tracy and good morning everyone. We had a strong first quarter and 2014 is shaping up to be a good year for us. We see excellent momentum across all our business lines and geographies. Markets continue to improve pretty much everywhere around the world. Rents and occupancies are recovering at a pace ahead of the forecast we gave you at our investor forum last fall. In the U.S. absorption is running more than double the pace of new completions, pushing occupancies above pre-crisis levels. We expect this trend to continue throughout 2014 albeit at a more modest pace. We see no general signs of overbuilding although speculative starts in Dallas are getting ahead of demand. There is also a fair amount of new construction in the Inland Empire and Houston but we are not concerned about those markets as absorption is more than keeping pace with new supply.  Turning to capital flows we see significant investor demand for quality industrial real estate. Appraisals lag real time transactions and our view of the market by 25 to 50 basis points. At the same time the market chatter about portfolio pricing is a further 25 to 50 basis points inside where we think the real market is today.  Moving to Europe the leasing markets are also improving but at an uneven pace. UK and Northern Europe are strong and Southern Europe is slowly getting better. While strengthening Italy and Romania are the two softest markets in Europe. Across the Continent cap rates are compressing rapidly and appraisals are 50 to 100 basis points behind real time transactions.  In Brazil, Mexico and China the markets are much stronger than the economic headlines would suggest, consumer interest -- the customer interest in our product remains solid. In Japan markets continue to tighten and rents are increasing faster than our previous expectations. Japan is a market with the biggest upward pressure on construction cost.  Switching to our three lines of business, ops led the way in the first quarter. Overall occupancies held up better than our expectations and rental growth was above plan. In our development business margins on starts and stabilizations were well above average. Our pipeline for the rest of the year continues to look strong in terms of volume and projected profit margins. We had a good quarter of acquisitions in Europe ahead of compressing cap rates.  As we look forward given the strength of pricing in the U.S. we're putting more of our non-strategic assets on the market for sale in 2014. With respect to acquisitions here in the U.S., we are only spending time on transactions where we can have a competitive advantage in terms of our scale and our expertise or see value at discounts to replacement costs.  In investment management business we experienced another quarter of strong fund raising across all our vehicles. Our ongoing dialogue with perspective investors is as strong as I remember in our entire history. We are turning away more business than we choose to take on. We are now rated BBB Plus by S&P in the top quintile of REITs. This represents the second full upgrade over the last 12 months and is a long way away from where we started at the close of the merger. We still plan to have one of the top balance sheets in the business and to attain an A rating in the near future.  To sum it all up we're feeling pretty good about our business, where it is today and where it's going. We expect strong rental growth through the balance of the year and beyond, development and investment management businesses are two powerful engines for profitable growth going forward. And finally we are at the point in our evolution where we can grow significantly in scale with very little incremental investment in corporate overhead. With that let me turn it over to Tom who will take you through the numbers. Thomas S. Olinger: Thanks, Hamid. I'll start with our results for the first quarter. Core FFO was $0.43 per share, about $0.01 ahead of our expectations. The outperformance was driven by higher NOI. Additionally interest income was higher than expected due to the recovery of a notes receivable that was fully reserved. Leasing volume totaled 32 million square feet consistent with the first quarter of 2013.  Our quarter-end occupancy was 94.5%, down 60 basis points from year-end and in-line with our historical first quarter seasonality. Americas and Asia occupancy outperformed expectations with the drop from year end at 30 and 40 basis points respectively. Europe occupancy was modestly lower than forecast, dropping a 130 basis points. GAAP rent change on rollover was 7% and positive across all geographic divisions led by the Americas at 10.4%. Notably Europe's rent change on rollover was 3%. Cash rent change on rollover was positive 1.1% for the quarter. Same-store NOI for the quarter increased 3% on a GAAP basis and 4.1% on an adjusted cash basis. G&A was $63 million in the first quarter which is typically our highest quarter due to the seasonal nature of incentive compensation.  Turning to capital deployment, in the first quarter development stabilizations were $264 million, with an estimated margin of 22% generating our share of value creation of $51 million or about $0.10 a share. Building acquisitions were $371 million with the weighted average stabilized cap rate of 7% and were primarily in Europe. We also started a $172 million of new development projects at an estimated margin of 22%. For dispositions and contributions in the quarter we completed $1.2 billion generating $568 million, our share at a weighted average stabilized cap rate of 6.2% with most of this activity related to the U.S. logistics venture contributions.  Moving to investment management; operating income was $21 million in the quarter in-line with our expectations. Following a record year in 2013 institutional investor demand remained strong. Year-to-date we've raised $582 million of third-party equity, primarily for our European ventures. Our capital raising and deployment drove investment management AUM higher to more than $27 billion at the end of the quarter.  Switching gears to capital markets, we completed $1.2 billion of financings in the first quarter. We continue to capitalize on low interest rates particularly with euro-denominated debt to extend term, lower interest cost and align the currency of our debt and assets. Our LTV and debt-to-EBITDA credit metrics increased slightly this quarter due to deployment timings. However we expect our credit metrics will continue to improve with NOI growth from high occupancy and rising rents. We repatriated the majority of the $700 million euro bonds proceeds back to U.S. dollars, which increased our U.S dollar held equity to 82% from 77% at year-end. Subsequent to quarter-end we redeemed a $175 million of bonds maturing in 2015 and repaid $239 million of secured debt. Additionally Prologis European Properties Fund 2 issued a $300 million Euro bond.  The recent credit rating upgrade from Standard & Poor's to BBB plus is affirmation of our earnings trajectory, liquidity, access to multiple sources of public and private capital and our commitment to build one of the strongest balance sheets in the REIT sector. For 2014 we continue to expect year-end occupancy to reach between 95% and 96% and GAAP same-store NOI to range between 3% and 4%.  On expenses; net G&A is forecasted to range between $233 million and $243 million. For capital deployment we continue to expect $1.8 billion to $2.2 billion of development starts with 80% our share and building acquisitions between $500 million and $1 billion with our share at 40%. For contributions our forecast is unchanged at $2 billion to $2.25 billion with 50% our share.  For dispositions; given the increase in divestiture demand as Hamid mentioned we're raising our guidance by $250 million to range between $750 million and $1.25 billion with 80% our share. The increased dispositions will be primarily in the U.S. We can self-fund our growth this year as proceeds from contributions and dispositions approximately equal our forecasted deployment. Our investment management guidance remains unchanged with revenue ranging between $200 million and $210 million and expenses between $95 million and $100 million representing an operating margin of about 50%. This guidance includes the promote we expect to recognize in the second quarter net of expenses of approximately $20 million from our open-ended target U.S. Logistic Fund. We have added promote eligibility date disclosure in the supplemental and you should note that we have an opportunity to earn a promote in each year of the foreseeable future. For FX we are continuing to assume the euro with 1.35 and the Yen at 105 for the year and our U.S. dollar net equity to range between 85% and 90% at year-end.  Putting this all together given the strong start to the year we are raising the low end of our prior guidance and now expect full year core FFO to range between a $1.76 and a $1.82 per share. At the midpoint of our guidance range 2014 core FFO is expected to grow more than 8% year-over-year  We expect second quarter core FFO to be higher than the first quarter principally as a result of the USLF promote. As we are moving to the second half of the year we expect rent growth and increased NOI from development stabilizations to steadily increase core FFO. To sum it up we had a good quarter and we are excited about our prospects for the remainder of the year.  With that I\u2019ll turn it to the operator to open it up for questions. Tracy A. Ward: Shirley? Operator : I apologize ma\u2019am I was on mute. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Brendan Maiorana from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Thanks, good morning. Tom I wanted to ask about guidance and you went through the details. It seemed like the main change from the parameters that you give us was the increased dispositions to take advantage of strong pricing that was out there. But you did raise the low end by a couple of pennies. So I am just wondering what the offset is given that it seems like the deployment expectations are about the same. Is it better on the operation side, is it better on the financing side or is there something else that\u2019s driving the move up when dispositions would be -- could be a little bit of a headwind? Thomas S. Olinger:  Brendan, this is Tom, thanks for your question. It is driven by better NOI in the first quarter and our confidence with the operating fundamentals going forward. It's also the result of deploying our excess -- significant liquidity we had at the end of the year and in early January, a little faster than we thought. And we also have a little more visibility now on the size of the promote from USLF in the second quarter.  Looking forward we\u2019ll be as efficient as we can on redeploying any excess disposition proceeds and as we mentioned we took our guidance up there. We\u2019ll continue to look on how to do that efficiently on deployment, including redeeming bonds where we think the economics make sense. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Specter from Bank of America. Your line is open. James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch : Thank you. This is Jamie Feldman here. Can you talk a little bit more about the occupancy dip in the first quarter? I think you had said it was pretty sizable in Europe and then taking it forward kind of what gives you conviction that you\u2019ll get to your occupancy guidance by the end of the year? Hamid R. Moghadam : Let me take that second part of that first. Jamie, it\u2019s kind of happened every year in the last, I don\u2019t know 25 years. So it's a good expectation. Our expectation is that it always dips in the first quarter and it always comes back and we have pretty good visibility in the leases we are working on for the second quarter and beyond. So that one is pretty much a given. I will let Gary talk about Europe. Gary E. Anderson:  Yeah so Jamie in Europe we are still bullish there. The macroeconomic recovery is accelerating, it's broadening. The recovery -- actually over the course of the past 90 days GDP forecast has increased by 30 basis points. We are sitting at about 1.5% GDP growth for the entire year. So the recovery as Hamid said is uneven and our operating results are sort of reflective of that. Things played out pretty much as we expected in Northern Europe and the UK, occupancies dropped while we started to push rents, makes perfect sense; we\u2019re right in the sweet spot in those two geographies sitting at 96%, 97% occupancy and the ability to push rents.  We had hoped that we would be able to hold occupancies in Southern Europe and Central and Eastern Europe and we didn\u2019t. There is not a concern there. There is no systemic issue at all and I expect occupancies to increase certainly about the third quarter of this year. So net-net we feel good about the operating results there and again this is the third consecutive quarter that we had positive rental growth in Europe, so 3% so all-in-all a pretty good result I think in Europe. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citi. Your line is open. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc.: Yeah, good morning up there, Kevin Varin's on the phone with me as well. Tom or Hamid I just wanted to talk sort of about free cash flow, equity, sort of dividend raise and when you look at the results in the first quarter, your core AFFO was effectively on top of the dividend which you lifted 18% to $0.33. When you think about the back half of the year if you put aside the $0.04 promote that you in the second quarter your core FFO was about $0.43 to $0.45. Let's assume the $0.10 drop from FFO to AFFO is similar, you got pretty tight coverage and so I guess from your perspective why raise the dividend and give away that free-cash flow ability and then also put an ATM in place of $750 million, potentially putting pressure even though the decisions are good and you can match fund this year, putting pressure on the need to raise equity where you got free cash, if you were to maintain the dividend where it was? Hamid R. Moghadam: Wow, that was a pretty long winded question. I think you are assuming two businesses away which are pretty important as part of our overall lines of business. I mean you just put investment management away by assuming away promotes. That's a pretty important part of our business. And you also put away the development business that makes us $300 million to $400 million a year really, really.  So yes, if you just consider our operating business the dividend and our earnings power from just the rent business, assuming no growth in rents and occupancies which is again a draconian assumption, is right on top of the dividend but of course our view is that there will be growth in our rents and our occupancies and that the development in investment management business will be strong contributors to our overall financial picture. Tom, do you have anything to add? Thomas S. Olinger: I will just add on the development side you have to remember that realized development gains or taxable income and that has to be distributed to shareholders, so you need to look at as Hamid said the totality of that business not just with the operating business. And when you look at on that basis our AFFO payout ratio would be in the mid to low 80% range. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley : Thank you for taking the questions. So you touched on construction cost in Japan and you also discussed where you are seeing some construction activity domestically. Could you update us on the replacement cost in relation to rents in the U.S., the relative growth in both and how your own construction costs are trending domestically? Eugene F. Reilly: Yeah, sure Vance it's Gene, I'll hit that one. So as we look at actual construction cost in the United States we saw sort of a 3% to 4% increase year-over-year. And we expect that to increase not significantly at this point but probably that goes to sort of a four to five range. And that's one component of replacement cost obviously. Land it's moving, I mean that's really all across the board but in a healthy market it is moving really quickly. So you are seeing sort of 10%, 15% increase. When you boil all that together and you are probably looking on a go-forward basis something in the 7% plus range all-in. So we've got a keen eye on replacement cost and as you know we do a lot of development so it is something on one hand we are worried about, but on the other hand it sort of underpins where rent levels are and also underpins the growth in those rents. Hamid R. Moghadam: Our rental forecast on our Investor Day was predicated on a 10% real growth in construction cost above and beyond inflation in the period between 2013 and 2016, that's kind of was the basis for that analysis which we shared with you in September of '13. I would say and that was a global forecast. I would say if you look at where we are and we were going to do that analysis over again I would say construction cost would be higher than those projections primarily because Japan is much, much higher and I would say the U.S. is higher and the growth is coming a little earlier than we thought in that analysis.  So I think there is -- that's why we think that forecast that we put out there is actually looking pretty conservative right now and we're ahead of it both in terms of occupancy, we're ahead of it in terms of rent. The only headwind to that forecast is that I would say cap rates have come in a little bit lower. So development can occur a little sooner with the same level of profitability than before. So compared to September I would say global cap rates are down maybe 25 basis points. Where we really think they are now where the price stock is, the price stock is all kinds of -- if you really believed the price stock cap rates are down 50 maybe even more than that. I don't believe the price stock. But really, really cap rates are down 25 basis points, so that's a bit more of a headwind that will negate the construction cost increase. So roughly I think replacement cost rents are about where they were when we forecasted them in September. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Guinee from Stifel. Your line is open. John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus : Great. Thank you. Hey Tom can you -- I think it was Mr. Bilerman asked about dividend increase et cetera. Can you expand a little bit more for educational purposes on the -- basically in developing, merchant building investment sales business in the U.S. versus Europe. Because in the U.S., for the most part your normal real estate annual corporate taxes are sheltered via the REIT rules and you can usually -- if you want to do a 10-31 exchange and do other assets, how much leakage do you have in Europe because the U.S. REIT don't apply and you may or may not be able to use 10-31 exchanges. And how does that all translate into a percentage of your dividend that is almost guaranteed to go up as your merchant building business expands? Thomas S. Olinger: Thanks for the question, John. So when you look at outside the U.S. the friction you get, well number one is those gains do come back and it is taxable income. You cannot shelter those gains through a 10-31 mechanism like you can in the U.S. So those earnings when they are repatriated come back and that's taxable income. The leakage on that is actually very minimal. We're very efficiently structured, both out of Europe and Asia and that leakage is generally in the low to mid-single digits, from a leakage perspective. Hamid R. Moghadam: But here is the important point, John, they only are taxed when they come back here. So in terms of present value they are very low in terms of their net economic impact because they often times unless you're doing a lot of balance sheet gymnastics in terms of expanding or shrinking your balance sheet in these regions, which by the way we've being doing a lot of, but now we're in the stable mode given that we have all these fund structures in place and all that, we shouldn't be doing a whole bunch of repatriating.  We've moved up the share of our U.S. dollar equity to 82% already. So there isn't that much more of money coming back and forth. So I think you can think of effectively the present value of that leakage overseas if the absolute number is in the low single-digits the present value impact is going to be virtually zero. Thomas S. Olinger: And then from a sizing perspective when you think about the size of our development pipeline and this is on a long-term run-rate basis if you just assume for even that $2 billion of development that stabilizes a year and a long-term margin of 15% that's $300 million. Probably two-thirds of that is happening outside the U.S. and will ultimately affect your taxable income. So a rough way to look at it would be about $200 million of potential taxable income as Hamid mentioned when it's repatriated could come back to your USTIs. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of George Auerbach from ISI Group. Your line is open. George Auerbach \u2013 ISI Group : Great, thanks. Hamid you mentioned the investment opportunity in Europe a few times now. Can you give us a sense for any portfolio sized deals in the market today? And how long of a horizon you see to put capital to work in Europe at above average returns. Hamid R. Moghadam : Well. Cap rates in Europe have compressed a lot faster than I ever thought. You really have this unusual situation where the appraisal community in Europe I would say is 50 to 100 but probably really more like 75 to 100 basis points behind real deals and we were very successful in the middle, actually all in 2013 and early part of this year. But now we are finding that we are actually losing deals, portfolio deals by maybe 25 basis points on the cap rate.  So markets in Europe have adjusted very, very quickly. You still have a good discount to replacement costs because rents are pretty low and you can still buy properties at the replacement cost. But the big surprise for me has been -- well UK really normalized in 2012, 2013 but the continent was right after it.  And if I were going to guess, probably since our Norges transaction there has been, which I think was basically the coasts are clear and the water is safe sign I have mentioned those cap rates were down 75 basis points, may be a 100 basis points and heading lower. So the investment opportunities in Europe are quickly, quickly dissipating. They are still attractive because you still have rent growth but you don\u2019t have the combination of really high cap rate compression or rent growth like you had before. So still good but not great. Gary E. Anderson: George, I would just add that our pipeline is still pretty strong and we were looking at over \u20ac1.8 billion worth of acquisition opportunities. And it\u2019s a mix of one-off deals smaller portfolios call it in a $100 million range and then some larger portfolios. But there is pretty good activity there and better product again then I have seen in the last decade that\u2019s come in to market. So there is still opportunity, I think. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Craig Mailman - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: Thanks, good afternoon guys. Maybe could we just hit on U.S. development a little bit, you mentioned Dallas, looks like it may be getting a little bit ahead of itself but -- and then Inland Empire and Houston they are still on demand there to absorb the supply but on the other side you said cap rates in the U.S. are coming in a little bit more than you thought and may be that makes development easier. I guess as you guys look out on the horizon are there more markets sort of on the bubble of getting to Dallas or even Houston, Inland Empire type developments starts there that get you guys worried, or at this point is the runway still pretty good here in the U.S. for development? Eugene F. Reilly :  Craig, it is Gene I\u2019ll take that one. Generally the answer to your question is yes, it does look pretty good. If you look across U.S. markets three of them stand out in particular, Dallas recently we mentioned, the Inland Empire and Houston. But in all of those cases if you study the metrics you look at where their actual vacancy rates are today, you look at historical absorption and supply as a percentage of stock, it\u2019s kind of in balance but it's ramping up quickly as Hamid mentioned in Dallas it's ramping up really quickly. So those are three markets we have our eyes on. We are very active in development in all three of them. There is no doubt as this recovery takes shape that more markets will fall into that category, but none of them are flashing red lights yet at this point. Hamid R. Moghadam: So the only thing I would add is that keep the overall numbers in mind. The overall numbers are last year 65 million feet of new supply, 225 million feet of absorption. We under-built the market by about a 160 million square feet. That directly translated into vacancy rates dropping by more than any other year ever. And by the way that doesn\u2019t account for obsolescence, putting that aside. This year we think absorption is going to be around 200 million with construction increasing to about a 100 million square feet. So the deficit that we had at the 160 million feet last year is going to be more like a 100 million feet this year which will mean that this will be the second best year for vacancy drop. So now of that 100 million feet of supply my guess is 50% of it is in that three markets we\u2019ve just talked about. And the reason that development is occurring in those markets, guess what rents have recovered, to replacement type rents. It\u2019s not because people had more development talent or less disciplined or any -- or banks are more exuberant there. It\u2019s just that the rents have recovered earliest in those markets and those rents are [through peaks] [ph].  So I think this volume of construction is directly related to rents. If rents pop 20% sooner than we thought you will get more development coming in these markets but until the other markets recover to the same extent I don't think you will see development. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust. Your line is open. Again Ki Bin Kim, your line is open. Hamid R. Moghadam: Ki Bin, there is something wrong with your mike. Why don't we skip over and come back to him. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel from Green Street Advisors. Your line is open. Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Thank you. I was wondering if you could just talk about your development pipeline a little bit. It seems like the number of starts is a little bit lower than I had probably anticipated given the amount of development you're expecting to be this year, may be you can just comment on that? Thank you. Michael S. Curless : Sure, Eric this is Mike Curless. We are not particularly concerned about the first quarter. Historically our first quarter is always by far our lightest quarter. This year we started 13 projects they happen to be some smaller projects just due to mix and certainly weather was an impact on a couple of projects that we moved into the second quarter. But relative to the overall volume for the year we certainly think there is bias to the upside, 80% of all of our activity is already identified. That's a very high number for this time of the year. And 80% was going to take place on land that we already own. The ramp up is already underway in Q2. And we expect that to increase steadily all the way through to the end of Q4 which is pretty typical for our pattern of development for the year.  We continue to have bias to the upside in Europe. And in Asia and don't rule out our [WC] business given our customer reach and our land control. So we feel pretty good about some upside opportunities in those three important categories. If history any indication we expect good margins again for the third year in a row. So I feel real good about not just the quantity of the activity but more importantly the quality of that activity. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. David B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Yeah, maybe for Gene and/or Hamid, I want to talk about capital raising in the U.S. obviously fairly quiet in the first quarter and tying that into your disposition acceleration the election to pursue disposition as opposed to contribution. So I guess one can you tie together the concept of capital raising in the U.S., the appetite here both for you as well as the partners out there.  And then the second is if it's more of a property quality issue that you are trying to clean-up, can you may be give a little color around cap rates and timing? Hamid R. Moghadam: Sure, I think disposition is what we are buying and what we are selling are very different things. We have some residual cleanup of the portfolio left in our non-strategic markets and also the less strategic assets in core markets. And we're just getting along with that quicker than we would have otherwise because we see an opportunity to get good valuation. So but what we are buying on for USLF primarily, which is our active vehicle in the U.S. we're being very selective and we're buying for not just quality core products, that's a mandate of that fund. And we are very mindful of replacement cost and like I said in my prepared comments we're looking at situations that either our scale or expertise can add value. But it's getting tougher and tougher and one of the things that we don't want to do is sign up for a huge pipeline of capital. There is plenty of interest for people who want to give us money. We are being selective in managing our pipeline so that we not only can raise money but can invest that money intelligently without any undue pressure for people who want to get their capital to work. So that's the balance. It's not lack of interest from investors. Quite to the contrary there is a lot of interest on the part of the investors and we're just trying to balance that with the opportunities that we see in the market. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Good morning. Tom just given your comments about the increase in dispositions, can you just give us an update where you expect in the year in terms of U.S. equity exposures also overall leverage? And then also just so we have greater clarity in the promote, I think you had said $0.04 last quarter, is that still a good number to use? Thomas S. Olinger: Sure Michael I'll take those up. First the equity we expect to end the year, our U.S. equity balance between, somewhere 85% and 90%. So right on top of what our long-term goal is there. From a leverage perspective if you look at the mid points of our sources and usage in our deployment and guidance that would put us right around 35% LTV at the end of the year. If you remember when you look out to the first quarter 2015 two things are happening, first we've got the convertible debt that we would expect to convert into equity. That is roughly about 200 basis points of LTV.  And then we also have optionality around the sell down of our interest in the Health venture that would get us to the low, very low near 30% LTV. And your last question was on the promote. Yes, I said we expect that to be around $20 million net of expenses or roughly $0.04 recognized in the second quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum from UBS Securities. Your line is open. Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Securities : Thanks. Tom just on the same-store guidance, how much of a tailwind should we expect on the expense side going forward for the remainder of the year? Thomas S. Olinger: I think what you saw -- I don't think there will be much of a tailwind for the rest of the year. What you saw in the first quarter was really the result of Q1 '13 expenses being higher than normal. So you shouldn't see much of any tailwind at all from expenses. We talked about this last quarter but when you look at same-store increase year-over-year you've got about 1.5% driven by just rent change. So I think about 15% portfolio of your portfolio turning over, 10% rent change, about a 150 basis points of occupancy improvement. So that's another 1.5% and then there is about 50 basis points of indexation that's not reflected in straight line rent.  So it's in this indexation, primarily in Europe where it's not a fixed income but it's based on an index that floats therefore you can't straight line it. So that indexation also comes through and that's about 50 basis points. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan : Hi. I joined a little late, I apologize if I missed this. But I think you talked about longer-term development margins. If you're looking at the next round of developments starts and where do you see the stabilized yields coming in and the margins on this next batch? Hamid R. Moghadam: I think for our starts this year the margins are going to be above 20% and I think, I said this now I think three years in a row and I've been wrong I think they are going to gravitate down to 15 but I may be wrong. I think our land is on the books at a pretty attractive price. So while we're monetizing that land I think our margins will be over stated until we work our way through that land and have to buy new land at market. Thomas S. Olinger: And it's about a 2.5 year to 3 year supply, the land on our books today. Hamid R. Moghadam: I think if we're going to pick a number for our land today on the books of the 1.6 billion I would say that land is easily 20% or 25% undervalued with the big area up. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust. Your line is open. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Just have one follow-up on promote. In 2015 it looks like a larger portion of it does come from some of your newer -- newly established joint -- JVs in Europe and given your commentary about cap rate compression there and if your promotes are structured the way they are historically as such are based on IRR than sort of the laddered promote structures.  I think it will be a pretty sizable promote just even if a 100 basis points of cap rate compression would drive a big part of the IR calculation. As of today could you talk a little bit about what that size of promote would like potentially in 2015? Hamid R. Moghadam: Ki Bin it's dangerous to do that because a million things have to happen before that promote is realized, including appraisers actually closing the gap between reality and what they are appraising. That's been very sticky in Europe and they are really lagging as I've now said three times I think by 75 or 100 basis points. I have no idea when they are going to start recognizing the evidence in the market, very, very sticky. But the best way I think to think about our promotes is that if you think that we're going to outperform our indices by call it 200 basis points of performance and historically that\u2019s been about the order of magnitude or the outperformance that the company's experienced with that big range but kind of averaging around 200 basis points above the indices. The promotes are 15% to 20%.  So that translates into $0.30 to $0.40 of gross promotes, and the net promote is about 60% of the gross promote. So I think of it as a 25%, 25 basis point of AUM, third party AUM of-course we are not charging ourselves promotes, right. So take the third party AUM and if you want to model something that's relatively regular that\u2019s the number I would use, particularly now that we are getting into the period that there is almost a promote coming in every period.  You are going to get some volatility around that but that\u2019s of a kind not a bad bullet point. And I would say they would be biased towards the upside of that in the next three or four years given that we are recovering from a really horrible three or four year period where there were no promotes and most values are reverting to the norm. So I think we are entering a good period of promotes for the company and it\u2019s a real part of our business I wish people would go spread it forth. Operator : Our next question comes from Brendan Maiorana from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Thanks, I had a couple of follow-ups. Just first on the new supply versus the net absorption calculation or projection, I know for 2014 it\u2019s been consisting a 100 million of its new expectations versus 200 million. I wonder, based on where the development starts are shaping up how you think that outlook may trend in 2015? And then second question the improvement in the secondary market location, which is causing you had sell some of your none-core assets. Is that driven by improvement in fundamentals in those markets, is it accelerating more in the secondary markets? Or is it just capital slowing into those markets because cap rates in primary markets are low? Hamid R. Moghadam: I think fundamentals are getting better in all markets, so including the secondary market. So the way the capital means that you can achieve better pricing in those markets in terms of timing then we thought otherwise. So the transactions that were slated for late there is no sense waiting for later because you can achieve the same thing earlier and the decision, the same those have been determined to be non-strategic and so we are going to sell it. And what was the first part of question? Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: The ag -- what happened in 2015? Hamid R. Moghadam: Supply will be up only because rents will be up and it will make more sense to build in more market. So again we shouldn\u2019t think about these issues in compartments. Supply relates to where rents are and where profitable development can take place. And if you buy the thesis of recovery in a broader range of markets you would see development in a broader range of market. But again let me put this in perspective I\u2019ve been in this business since 1983. That\u2019s I hate to say it but that\u2019s 31 years.  There have never been periods where we have under-built the demand in the U.S. anywhere near these levels that we experienced last year and this coming year and next year. It\u2019s just unprecedented so vacancies are compressing rapidly. And I think together with that rents are increasing rapidly and it\u2019s not because this all of a sudden became the best business in the worlds. It\u2019s because we are climbing out of the basement, the basement that we all fell into in '08 and '09. So afterwards -- climbing out of the basement let\u2019s see how disappointed people are just to point that we will have a good long term sustainable period of rent growth once we\u2019ve reached a equilibrium. But between now and equilibrium expect a rapid rent growth. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Specter of Bank of America. You line is open. James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch : Great, thanks it's Jimmy Feldman again. I was hoping you guys could talk a little bit more about the types of tenant demand you are seeing? And may be how it\u2019s changing or how you might expect it to change over the near term given where we are in the economic cycle? In fact in terms of sectors then and what people are doing with this base? Michael S. Curless: Jimmy this is Mike Curless certainly seeing a lot of movement in a variety of sectors and our customer demands e-commerce, packaging, housing related auto related. E-commerce is a real large driver there, probably see them doing about 15% of the activity in our existing portfolio in our new space in the development pipeline those numbers are more like 30% of that activity, the space sizes tend to much larger than traditional brick and mortar uses. So plenty of activity in e-commerce. The customers are gravitating towards large population centers, the Amazon affect is well underway in terms of people wanting to be closer to the customers for the possibility of same day delivery. So we're seeing a lot of activity in our global markets and that plays very well with our platform given our high percentage of land and buildings in those particular markets. Hamid R. Moghadam: The only thing that I would add is that the three PLs are back. There are big customer segment for us. And if you would ask me a year ago how the three PLs were reacting, they were securing a contract, logistics contract before the secured real-estate and today it's exactly the opposite. They realized that because of the dwindling supply they have to secure the real-estate in order secured logistics contract. So I would say that's an interesting trend that's occurred over the course of last 12 months. James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch : Globally? Hamid R. Moghadam: Globally, yeah. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citi. Your line is open. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc.: Yes, I had a few follow ups almost rattle them off just things to NOI you present the gross basis, I am just curious what that would be on a pro-largest share effectively your consolidated plus your share of joint ventures, number one. Number two, the Japan land sale 21 acres for $55 million, $107 per billable foot seems high. I know land prices are high in Japan, just curious what's going on there.  The third just ATM, I know you had the ATM last June you didn't issue anything you -- how should we think about your intent to use it going forward. And lastly just on the expense recovery rate, it was about 79% this quarter which was higher than last year, higher than the first quarter of last year so it seems like that perhaps had something to do, I am not sure with same-store expenses and revenues, if you can just clarify what's your hope that would be helpful? Thanks. Hamid R. Moghadam: So Michael I would be happy to answer any one of those questions that you select. What would you like me to take, which one would you like to take. We are trying to have the fair process for everybody to get their questions in, so. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc.: All right you can answer equity one first and then I'll re-queue up for the same-store which would be the second one just to understand. Hamid R. Moghadam: So that would be great. We don't foresee any need for equity in our business for all the reasons that Tom talked about. And yes, we do have the ATM program in place and we did renew but we don\u2019t expect to be underneath it unless our investment, opportunities set changes from where it is today and where we see it today. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel from Green Street Advisors. Your line is open. Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Thank you. Can you maybe just discuss what's causing the increase in prices or decrease in cap rates. Our understanding is that a lot of the institutional capital has been partnering with most of those to build those new shiny product. But it appears that it's now kind of gone the other way where B product is getting a little bit of better because rapidly improving better fundamentals.  I am just trying to figure out is a lot of new capital also or the same capital willing to allocate more. Hamid R. Moghadam: Our impression is that there is a lot of private equity that's interested in the sector and it is the weight of capital and it's almost interested in bulking up plays are popular. So I guess that's the incremental capital we see in the marketplace, the institutional stuff. And the non-traded green sector continue to be active. But I would say the incremental capital is really private equity Mike do you have more --? Michael S. Curless: More to add there, Yeah when you see 15 or 20 people trying to buy a product in LA and obviously only one could be successful. You are seeing four or five people on that list moving to B product and or moving to regional markets as well. We continue to see a real lot of capital and quite a few new players in the mix these days. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael J. Salinsky from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: May be just going back to the compression you talked about in cap rates in Europe over the last six months relative to what you are seeing in terms of rent growth are return thresholds coming in or is your expectation in '14, '15, '16 that the growth is going to accelerate to justify that compression at this point? Thomas S. Olinger: I think it's anticipation of rent growth and availability of financing in Europe that are the two things that changed and also I think Financing in Europe that are the two things that are changed. And also I think it is the fact that the ice was broken, I really think our Norges transaction without dwelling on that too much was really a sign that the waters are safe. And almost immediately after that people start piling into Europe in a big way. So I think primarily the cap rents that were high, higher than elsewhere in the globe because the financing markets were more frozen then the rest of the globe, attracted people in.  Now that cap rates have compressed I think people are attracted to Europe not because there is a little bit more cap rates compression that\u2019s going to happen but also rent growth is kicking in and you can still buy product that\u2019s below. So I think that\u2019s the attraction and it can be all finance now which it couldn\u2019t be two years ago so those are the dynamics.  The way I would think about it Michael was that is just like the U.S. may be two and half year lag with may be the UK being only a year and half behind the U.S. and some of the parts of Eastern and Southern Europe been three years behind the U.S. and sort of the average of Europe being two and half years failing the U.S. same pattern. Hamid R. Moghadam: Focus on the core market today in Europe and they will gravitate to the secondary markets over time.  Our next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman. Your line is open. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc. : More questions than -- can you hear me now? Hamid R. Moghadam: Michael, it\u2019s your turn again. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc.: Yeah, I can hear you. Can you hear me? Hamid R. Moghadam: We can hear you fine. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc.: I thought round two we get more questions, I apologize. I didn\u2019t read the rules correctly enough. So just on saying that\u2026 Hamid R. Moghadam: Okay, I may give you two. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc.: Okay. Same-store NOI you presented on the total share what would that be in terms of just Prologis\u2019 share and were there anything funky going on in the consolidated portfolio on expense recovery is that certainly higher year-over-year and I don\u2019t know if it played until the total things stores well? Thomas S. Olinger: So Michael -- so you are right. What we present is that on demand it's across our entire stack at same-store. I don\u2019t have our proportionate share committed to memory, I can certainly follow up on that but it's certainly higher than the owned to manage because of the rails of U.S. waiting. So when you think about our U.S. equity now across 80% that will really drive our underlying earnings. And when you look at how the U.S. is leading the charge on all the operating metrics whether it\u2019s rent change on rolling in the quarter was 10.4%. So our bottom line our look through would be better than owned to manage.  And then on the expense recovery side as I mentioned earlier there is nothing going on unusual other than Q1 of \u201913 expenses were higher than normal and that's the trail off that you see this year and going forward for the rest of this year, we don\u2019t expect any unusual expense changes and that\u2019s going to be the real occupancy and rents driving same store. Hamid R. Moghadam: Hey Michael by the way one thing I would add just to philosophically so you understand why we don\u2019t crack that number separately is that we\u2019ve really always operated under this philosophy of one portfolio policy and there -- our people on the field don\u2019t really differentiate whether we own 20% or something 50% or something or a 100%or something we run it on ownership blind basis. And the stats are reported on an ownership blind basis for that reason. That\u2019s the only way we can do a good job for our institutional investors. So really the only thing that Mike -- that Tom is talking about is the mix. We have more fund mix in our non U.S. business then our U.S. business. So -- and given that the U.S. is early that the mix would drive you to that conclusion. But we actually don\u2019t track those kinds of numbers by ownership type at all. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from the line of David Harris from Imperial Capital. Your line is open. David Harris - Imperial Capital : Yeah hello, thanks for taking my question. I apologies if you covered this, I was a little late on the call but if I look at your development cost capitalization you are running it fairly close to a $150 million on an annualized basis. Is that cost fully reflected in the development margins that you are quoting on page 23 and 24 of the current development program? Thomas S. Olinger: Yes it is David and it\u2019s a good question. I'm actually glad somebody asked it because I get that question at NAREIT all the time. The development margins that we report not only includes capitalized overhead that matches the number that you mention but it also includes a full carry on the entire capital not just on the debt portion that's assigned to that project. So we capitalize carry throughout the development process until it reaches stabilization. So I know some people don't do it quite that way and therefore our margins if they were done in the alternative way would even appear higher than they are today. Hamid R. Moghadam: Okay, last opportunity for Michael to ask a question. The line is clear. Hearing none I want to thank you for your time on this call and look forward to talking to you at NAREIT, bye-bye.

Baird Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors Neil Malkin - RBC Capital Markets Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Operator : Welcome to the Duke Realty's second quarter earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to our host Mr. Ron Hubbard. Please go ahead, sir. Ronald Hubbard : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Denny Oklak, Chairman and CEO; Jim Connor, Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Denien, Chief Financial Officer. Before we make our prepared remarks, let me remind you that statements we make today are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For more information about those risk factors, we would refer you to our December 31, 2013, 10-K that we have on file with the SEC. Now, for our prepared statement, I'll turn it over to Denny Oklak. Dennis Oklak : Thank you, Ron. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I will highlight some of our key accomplishments for the quarter, and then Jim Connor will give you an update on our leasing activity and development activity. I'll review our asset recycling transactions, and Mark will then address our second quarter financial performance and balance sheet. By all account, the second quarter was a great success for Duke Realty, and I am very proud of our team for their accomplishments. We signed 9 million square feet of leases and finished the quarter at 94.5% in-service occupancy rate, our highest level since 1999. Rent on renewal leases for the quarter grew by 7.6%, a level consistent with the first quarter and reflective of strong supply demand fundamentals and solid pricing power. We started a $213 million of new development projects at solid yields, and we made significant progress on the disposition front with nearly $300 million closed in the second quarter, both exceeding our expectations as of mid-year. We also opportunistically issued common stock on our ATM program. We used the disposition and the ATM proceeds to redeem our Series J preferred shares into fund our increased development expectations for the full year. Mark will touch more on this later. Now, I'll turn it over to Jim Connor, to give a little more color on our leasing activity and development pipeline. James Connor : Thanks, Denny, and good afternoon, everyone. From an operational standpoint, we had a very strong quarter with leasing of 9 million square feet, as Denny noted. Our total in-service occupancy ended up at 94.5%, that's up 50 basis points from the previous quarter. Our tenant retention was solid at about 68% and rental rate growth on renewals continues to improve across the portfolio with growth of 7.6%. We continue to be very focused on pushing rents throughout our portfolio and in particular on the industrial side. Now, let me touch on some of the key activity within each of our product types. With respect to our industrial portfolio, we continue to see fundamentals improve with completion of 7.8 million square feet of total leasing, including 1.9 million square feet of build-to-suit development, 680,000 square feet of leasing in our recently completed spec projects. In-service occupancy in the bulk industrial portfolio at the end of the quarter was 95.6%, that's 120 basis points higher than a year ago and a 15-year high for us. Compared to general market vacancy in our 22 markets, our in-service occupancy has outperformed in the competition by almost 250 basis points. As I noted, we signed two deals totaling nearly 680,000 square feet that fill the remaining space in two of our speculative projects. One in Chino, California and one in Indianapolis, Indiana that were both placed in service in 2013. Also contributing to growth in our industrial occupancy was a new 300,000 square foot lease that we signed with Amazon in the Atlanta market. And on the renewals side, we executed three notable industrial leases between 200,000 and 430,000 square feet with Georgia-Pacific, Home Depot and Coca-Cola in our Atlanta, Indianapolis and Dallas markets respectively. With the tightening of conditions across most of our markets and high occupancies in our own portfolio, we've been highly focused on capturing rent growth, as we've been saying now for the last few quarters. I am proud to note that our industrial rent growth accelerated to 9% during the second quarter, bringing our year-to-date average to 8.7%. Now, I'd like to turn to the medical office portfolio. We continue to have positive trajectory with our in-service occupancy increasing to 93.9%. That's a 120 basis points above a year ago and with weighted average remaining lease term of over 10 years. The suburban office market continues to show slight improvement across most of our markets. Rent growth is still relatively flat in most market, but concessions are on a downward trend. Our in-service office portfolio ended the quarter at 87.7% leased, which is down 40 basis points from the first quarter. This decrease is entirely attributable to our second quarter dispositions, which had an average occupancy of 93%. Now, I'll turn to the development side, where we had $213 million of starts across 10 projects in the second quarter that totaled 3.6 million square feet and expect to generate a 7.2% weighted average initial stabilized yield. We commenced three speculative projects this quarter, as we had alluded on previous calls regarding support coming speculative projects in 2014. With our recent signing, our 2.4 million square feet of speculative projects that we've started since 2009 and are now in service are 97% leased. We've done a great job covering all of our spec bets across all of our markets. The projects, in particular, we started a 144,000 square foot speculative project in Northern New Jersey in our Legacy Commerce Center. We started a 324,000 square foot speculative facility in Chicago down in the I-55 Corridor, which was a redevelopment site we acquired in late 2013. You should also note that Chicago industrial market has been 95%-plus leased for close to five years, and we've got a great leasing momentum down in the I-55 Corridor. The third project we started was a 937,000 square foot development within an existing joint venture at our AllPoints Midwest park in the Indianapolis Airport submarket. We are currently 99.3% leased on our entire 19.5 million square foot bulk industrial portfolio in Indianapolis. In addition to these three spec developments, we commenced construction on a 270,000 square foot facility that's 47% pre-leased in Dallas Airport submarket. Our Dallas portfolio is over 97% leased and our team has been generating excellent rent growth in renewals over the last year. We also executed six 100% pre-leased build-to-suit development projects in the second quarter. Four of these were bulk industrial as follows : one is 486,000 square feet on our own land in Minneapolis in the northwest submarket; a 305,000 square foot development in Columbus, Ohio, on our land at the Rickenbacker Global Logistics Park; a 757,000 square foot building in the northwest submarket of Chicago; and lastly a 240,000 square foot development in Houston, down near the Port of Houston. These industrial build-to-suit projects have terms ranging from 10 to 15 years. And lastly, the fifth build-to-suit project was a 54,000 square foot medical office expansion with TriHealth in Cincinnati. This represents the fifth development completed with TriHealth in the last seven years, which is really a reflection of our reputation as a trusted provider and advisor a facility needs in healthcare industry. Lastly, the sixth build-to-suit we started in the second quarter was a 112,000 square foot Class A office project for Interactive Intelligence on our land in the Woodland Corporate Park in Indianapolis. We simultaneously negotiated expansions and extensions of our leases with Interactive on two existing leases that totaled 272,000 square feet within that same park. From an overall development pipeline perspective, at quarter end we have 31 projects under construction, totaling 10.8 million square feet and a projected $722 million of stabilized cost at our share that is 76% pre-leased in aggregate. These projects have an initial cash stabilized yield of 7.4% and GAAP yield of 8.1%, again highlighting the tremendous value creation being executed by our teams and our strategic land holdings. Thank you. And now, I'll turn it back over to Denny to cover our recycling activities. Dennis Oklak : Thanks, Jim. With respect to investment activity, we had $278 million of building dispositions during the quarter, consisting of five transactions. The two largest transactions were the sale of the 3630 Peachtree, our office building in Buckhead and an office portfolio in Cincinnati. We closed on the 3630 Peachtree Tower in Atlanta's Buckhead submarket, a deal that most of you probably saw in the news late last month. The deal sold for a Buckhead record $390 per square foot and our share of the proceeds was about $100 million. The project was 86% leased at closing. While this project went through some rough times during the downturn, including a large impairment charge, it ended up with a great result, as we fully recouped all of our invested capital and made a nice profit. The portfolio in Cincinnati was sold for $150 million or roughly $144 per square foot. The six office buildings making up this portfolio were on average 16 years old. The portfolio was 96% leased, but I will qualify that, saying that nearly 75% of the leases rolled in the next three-and-a-half years. On the land side, we sold $18 million of non-strategic parcels during the quarter. In addition, I'll note that combining land sales with development projects on our land year-to-date remonetized 350 acres or about $69 million of land. On the acquisition side, this quarter we closed on a 980,000 square foot modern bulk facility, located in Lehigh Valley region of Pennsylvania, and which was just completed for a purchase price of $73 million. We actually went under contract on a facility in a full commitment structure in the third quarter of 2013, just after the project commenced construction and after a pre-lease for 100% of this space was signed. Given the cap rate compression in this market, over the last nine months, we believe our acquisition cap rate was approximately 50 basis points below to date levels. As noted on the last few calls the acquisition market continues to be intensely competitive and given our very strong development pipeline and opportunities, we expect the acquisition activity for the remainder of this year to be low. I'll now turn over to Mark, to discuss the financial results and our capital plans. Mark Denien : Thanks, Denny. Good afternoon, everyone. As Denny mentioned, I would like to provide an update on our financial performance as well as an overview of our capital transactions. Core FFO for the second quarter of 2014 was $0.30 per share compared to $0.28 per share in the first quarter of 2014, and $0.27 per share in the second quarter of 2013. Core FFO was up $0.02 per share from the first quarter of 2014, as a result of improved occupancy and the negative impact of the extreme winter weather conditions had on first quarter operating results. Carrying a higher base of operating properties through the second quarter also contributed to the improvement, as our Cincinnati office portfolio disposition did not close until the end of the quarter. Same property NOI growth for the 12 and three months ended June 30 was 3.5% and 4.6%, respectively. The 12 month number is reflective of current annual run rate, driven by increased occupancy and rental rates in all product types. The quarterly number is higher, primarily because of timing of certain items. As Jim noted, our growth in average net effective rental renewals was 7.6% and we are happy to say that this is the third consecutive quarter that we've been able to report increased quarter-over-quarter rental rate growth on renewals across all three product types. We are optimistic about our ability to continue to push rental rates. We generated $0.25 per share in AFFO, which equates to a dividend payout ratio of 68%. Although core FFO increased $0.02 per share from the first quarter, the increased capital expenditures that coincided with the second quarter's increased leasing volume, resulted in AFFO per share being equal to the $0.25 per share reported for the first quarter of 2014. On the balance sheet side. We finished the quarter with $60 million outstanding on our $850 million line of credit as compared to a $180 million outstanding at March 31. Building and land sales generated $297 million of proceeds during the quarter, which allowed us to reduced line of credit borrowings and overall leverage. We anticipate continued strong disposition activity for the last half of the year, which will allow us to fund development and minimize use of our line of credit. We also repaid four secured loans totaling $64 million during the second quarter. In the process, we unencumbered about $155 million of properties to enhance our financial flexibility and credit profile. During the second quarter and in early July, we issued 12.7 million common shares from net proceeds of $222 million. We are using the proceeds from ATM issuances as well as proceeds from property dispositions to fund our increased development pipeline in the recently announced redemption of our $96 million in Series J preferred shares that carry a coupon of 6.625%. The redemption of these preferred shares will result in over $6 million of the annualized reduction in preferred dividends. Our ATM shelf that we filed in the first part of 2013 has now been fully utilized. All of these capital transactions coupled with our operational performance resulted in noteworthy improvements for key financial metrics during the quarter. We reported a fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.3x for the rolling 12 months ended June 30 compared to 2.2x we reported last quarter, and 1.9x that we reported one year ago. For just the second quarter fixed charge coverage is now up to 2.4x. Net debt plus preferred EBITDA for the rolling 12 months ended June 30, 2014, was 7.4x compared to the 7.8x we reported last quarter, and 8.2x we reported for the rolling 12 months ended June 30, 2013. When looking at this metric for just the current quarter, it improved to 7.1x. We expect to see continued improvement in these financial metrics, as development projects continue to come online and as we realize the benefit of the redemption from the Series J preferred shares. We are in an excellent liquidity position and have no significant debt maturities until February of 2015. I will conclude by saying that we're very happy to have reported another strong quarter. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Denny. Dennis Oklak : Thanks Mark. Yesterday, we raised and narrowed our guidance for FFO for 2014 to a range of $1.15 to $1.19 per share. This change is reflective of our overall strong start to the year across all aspects of our operations, and includes increased anticipated development starts, dispositions and overall leasing activity for the year, which are expected to be better than what was originally anticipated. As noted in yesterday's earnings release, additional detail on revisions to certain guidance factors can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. In closing, we're pleased with our teams outstanding operation performance and allocation of capital year-to-date, which should set the stage for solid future growth and benefit our stakeholders. So we'll now open up the lines to the audience, and we ask participants to keep the dialogue to one question or perhaps two very short questions. You are of course welcome to get back into the queue. Thank you. With that, we'll open it up. Operator : (Operator Instructions) And we'll go to the line of Jamie Feldman. Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I just want to get your latest thoughts on just supply in the warehouse market. How are you guys feeling this quarter? What are your thoughts on the markets that are the greatest risk and concern? And looks like you are ramping up your development pipeline even more. So how should we be thinking about that? James Connor : I would tell you, much like last quarter, when we talked about some of the specific markets, there are really only a couple around the country that look a little uncertain at this point in time. Dallas has unfortunately got a lot of questions. Dallas had a huge year last year of net absorption between 16 million and 17 million square feet. They're off to a great first quarter, north of 6 million square feet of absorption. That slowed down a little bit in the second quarter. So I think there is a little bit of uncertainty there in the Dallas market. All of the other major industrial markets, Chicago, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Atlanta, even the Inland Empire has largest development pipeline areas. There is just a great deal of leasing and a great deal of positive absorption. So I wouldn't tell you outside of Dallas, we've got our eyes on any particular market right now. Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And then I guess as a follow-up to that on the demand side. What did you guys see in the quarter? Did you see continuation at the same level of demand? Is it picking up? I mean we certainly saw better GDP announced yesterday. What are you seeing recently? James Connor : I would tell you that across the board, demand is up. We're just compiling our own internal study of all of the spec products in all of the different markets. But the spec that's out there in the second quarter, we're tracking about 18 million square feet of that absorbed. That's not true net absorption of the market. That's just of the spec base that was complete or under construction. Leading that would be the Inland Empire, north of 9 million square feet of absorption, so a big quarter. But a lot of good numbers across the board, so we still think the vast majority of the markets are in very good health and very much in balance. Dennis Oklak : Well, Jamie, our 9 million square feet of leases that we saw in the second quarter was really our second highest quarter for the last two years. So momentum is certainly still out there, with wind at our back right now. Operator : Next we'll go to the line of Michael Bilerman. Kevin Varin - Citigroup: This is Kevin Varin with Michael. How should we think about development spreads going forward, just based on the new starts and guidance? You mentioned in your opening remarks that yields on the new projects were 7.1% which is down from the overall pipeline. So are the spreads starting to tighten to acquisition cap rates, given either increased development competition or maybe higher construction costs? James Connor : I would tell you that it is a competitive market out there. And there is a lot of local developers that are in the markets. There is no shortage of capital. So that's one piece of it. We've seen construction price still up. I think we covered this on the last call. We have not seen significant increases that some of our peers had pointed out, which we think is probably because we have our own construction company, so we have a little bit better handle on managing the cost there. So while we've seen a little bit of compression on the yields. As long as we're doing stabilized yields north of 7 with overall yields north of 8, given where cap rates are, there is just huge value creation. Mark Denien : I would add to that too. The product mix has a little bit to do with the decrease in our yields this quarter, because a higher percentage of our development starts this quarter was on the industrial side, whereas in the prior couple of quarters we had a little bit more office and medical office in that number. So I agree with what Jim said. The overall quality of the yields is still really there holding up. James Connor : Yes. I think if you were to look at where yields have come down slightly, I have seen substantially more cap rate compression in last two quarters. So I can make a compelling case in spreads that that probably increased slightly as opposed to going down. Kevin Varin - Citigroup: And then just one follow-up question is, I just wanted to see if you had more clarity on what the new incremental sales are in terms of what asset types you're looking in the market out there? And then also how we should think about timing as well? James Connor : Well, Kevin, it really hasn't changed much for us. We're still focused on selling, primarily again the Midwest suburban office assets with a couple of selective suburban office assets in the Southeast, like we did with 3630, we think there is just some very opportunistic sales we can do right now. And then in the second half of the year, I mean you'll also see us selling couple of, I mean, just a little bit of remaining retail that we have left, which is something we've been planning on teeing up here for a while. The only other thing I would add is, you might see a bit of selective pruning of the industrial portfolio also in the second half of the year. And this will mainly be, I would say, the older, smaller, lower, clear height type product that we have in a few of our markets. The pricing on that out there seems very good right now. So I think we'll selectively prune some of that. As far as timing goes, we closed quite a bit right near the end of June, things that we've been working on for a while, including those two office dispositions. So the pipeline, I will tell you, is sort of getting geared back up right now. So I would tell you likely the dispositions will be later in the third quarter and then throughout the fourth quarter. Operator : Next we'll go to the line of Vance Edelson. Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley : On the industrial side, the development projects range in size from under 100,000 to more than 1 million square feet and just about every size in between. So presumably you get a good feel for where the build-to-suit and other demand is coming from. So can you share with us your thoughts on which size category you're seeing the most active demand? And how that shapes your speculative build plans going forward or is it pretty much across the board regardless of size? James Connor : Well, I would tell you that build-to-suit activity as leasing activity is pretty strong across all segments. The one probable clarification I would make, there are fewer large buildings available in the inventory, either spec, second generation, out there today. So the tenants that need 500,000 square foot or greater, more of those have to consider build-to-suit and perhaps say a 100,000 foot prospect that was in the market. But as you stated in the question, we're seeing activity all over the board. Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley : And then, as my quick follow-up. On the industrial leases expiring say over the next 12 to 18 months, could you give us an updated feel for the portion that were signed during the recession and what the potential price roles might look like on those? Dennis Oklak : Vance, it's quite similar to what's been rolling in the last couple of quarters. We look out about 18 months. And of all of our industrial leases expiring over the next 18 months, right out about 50% of those were signed between 2009 and 2011, and then the other 50% split fairly even between deals signed before '09 and after '11. So the way we look at it, the deals before '09 and after '11, probably fairly modest rent growth on those deals, the deals signed in that '09 to '11 timeframe. We're getting deals up into the high teens on some of those. So we think when you average it out, it's pretty close to the run rate we've been at for the last couple of quarters, which is close to high-single digits, I would call lit. Operator : Next we'll go to the line of Brendan Maiorana. Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo : Mark, if I look at sources and uses as it relates to the guidance for the back half of the year, it seems like you've gotten -- as I think maybe you or Denny mentioned in the script, you've gotten more aggressive in terms of where the dispositions are coming out, more conservative in terms of acquisitions. Seems like a portion of that is related to the Series J redemption. But is there a portion of it that you're using opportunistically to delever a little bit more? It seems like maybe, relative to what you have coming in the door, there's a little bit less in terms of what you need to spend it on. Dennis Oklak : Brandon, I would say that if you just kind of look at the midpoint of our guidance from acquisitions and development dispositions, where we have to go. When your factor in the two large office dispositions that we had that closed late in the second quarter, we probably have about a net, I would call, a $100 million of excess capital coming in the door. So you're probably right. I mean absent an even further increase in the development pipeline, the way we've seen it, we've really pre-funded a little bit of that the development pipeline, as we look forward over the next six to nine months. So that's really kind of what we've got it earmarked for right now is development. And as that fix up or decreases that will drive how much additional capital we need. But as we sit here today, we don't really see any needs for capital for the next six months to speak of, with any significance. Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo : And just as a follow-up. So the guidance, there were a couple of sort of changes all around and you guys moved the range up a little bit. I saw the same-store range didn't change and you're kind of tracking ahead. You've got nice rent spreads and it seems like you feel pretty good about occupancy. If you're 3.5% in year-to-date and you add a little bit of a tough Q1 with some weather issues, is it fair to think that you're likely to be towards the upper-end of the 2% to 4% same-store range this year? Dennis Oklak : Yes, I think we can get to the upper end. I think the first quarter was a little deceivingly low like you said for to weather reasons, and then the second quarter is a little bit higher than our run rate for some other small reasons. So you average it out that 3.5% on the 12 month is pretty close to what we believe our current run rate can be for the foreseeable future. Now, I'll caveat that a little bit with saying that we have had significant occupancy increases over this period of time. And we're getting closer and closer to full occupancy. Although, we do still think we have some room to go on the occupancy, we just don't know that it will be at pace that we've been increasing the occupancy by. So we'll have to come down to the rental rate growth side. James Connor : And Brendan, the other reason we didn't really change it is, because that number can fluctuate so much based on our dispositions. And we've got pretty good plan in place for dispositions, but you never know the timing of closings in those type things. So as we look at that, we just select not to change it. Operator : Next, we go to the line of Dave Rodgers. Dave Rodgers - Robert W. Baird: Jim, maybe a question for you on the spec developments that you're doing and the spec developments you're tracking in the market. It might be easier, I guess, if you address your own. But I guess, I'm wondering how much market rents are being pushed at the high-end by these spec developments. I guess another way of asking that is when you're going to an area, putting in a new spec building, what's your premium rent that you're seeking or are you really targeting markets that maybe have already gotten replacement cost rents back from the recovery? Just a little more color on that would be helpful James Connor : I would tell you without any specifics, probably half of the markets across the U.S. are there. Deals are being done in existing space, first and second generation to support the rents and the yields we need on spec development. The remaining half is probably within $0.05 to $0.10. And for the right users, for the right timing, for the right location, that's not too big a premium. That's why you're seeing as much build-to-suit activities you're seeing around the country. Dave Rodgers - Robert W. Baird: And I think that's consistent with your portfolio as well? And you've been a little late to the spec game, but I think that's probably been why there's a little bit more conservatism? James Connor : We have try to exercise a little conservatism. We can still remember 2007, 2008. But we had so many really good build-to-suit opportunities across the spectrum that it just hasn't really paid for us to take on much spec risk. Now, that so many of our portfolio, industrial portfolios, in particular, are north of 95%. There is some opportunities there that we need to take advantage of just to handle the growth of our existing clients in some of these markets. So that's why you'll continue to see us selectively pick some markets that we feel comfortable, where our portfolio is, where rents are, where absorptions are. And we'll continue do a modest number going forward. Dave Rodgers - Robert W. Baird: Mark, maybe one for you. I think we've talked about this before, but I'll ask it again. Given your comfort just more recently, issuing equity on the ATM and given, maybe some comfort going a little bit lower into your preferreds, breaking that 6%, 7% barrier in terms of the yield and buying back that Series J. As you look at the rest of the preferreds, I don't know if you commented on this already, but if you would, what stops you at this point, given where the equity is, given where some of these 15-year bonds are pricing out in terms of getting rid of the rest of those preferreds? Mark Denien : Dave, the biggest thing is development pipeline and the deposition. We want to make sure like we'd said before that we've got all of our bets covered on the development side first. And if we've got some excess capital and our stock's trading at a nice price, then we'll look to opportunistically take some more preferreds down over time, but with the disposition pipeline that we have in front of us, we may have the opportunity to do some of that through dispositions. We just need to see how that plays out first. Operator : Next, we'll go to line of Eric Frankel. Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors : I'm curious, if your development pipeline increases further for whatever reason, how would you likely fund it? Dennis Oklak : It would be through some combination of disputation proceeds or the ATM. Like we said at the beginning of the year, Eric, our plan all along was to fund our net growth 60-40, 60% equity/disposition proceeds, 40% debt. We've been able to fund everything thus far for the most part through the disposition program, but to the extent, that we still have attracted development out there and we don't have the dispositions to pay for it, we will look to fund it through the ATM. Mark Denien : And I would also say, Eric, I don't think you're going to see that pipeline get much bigger than it is right now. We kind of keep our eye on that under regular basis and know about where we want to keep it. It's been running more in the $600 million to $700 million. We're a bit over $700 million this quarter. But I don't see or think you'll ever see it ramp up significant above that? Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors : It's just interesting that this quarter, obviously, as you've stated yourself, you essentially pre-funded your increased development with almost all equity, I thought that was an interesting move. I think the only other question I have is regarding the leasing of some of the spec developments that came online in the last year or two. Did those leases come in at or above pro forma in terms of rental rates? Mark Denien : No, they came in above pro forma. The only differential is some times you underwrite five year leases and you end up doing 10 year leases. But if you look at the net res across the term of the yields, we're above the across the board. Operator : Next we'll go to the line of Neil Malkin. Neil Malkin - RBC Capital Markets : I just had a question. The Cincinnati portfolio you sold, can you give us a cap rate on that, from I guess, GAAP or EBITDA perspective? And then what it would be from an AFFO or economic standpoint, like what's the spread there? And then also, can you at all quantify how much, around how much TIs per total CapEx you could probably take out of your portfolio once the majority of the suburban office dispositions are completed? Dennis Oklak : Well, I guess, the answer of the first question is we really don't disclose GAAP rates on specific transactions, obviously, for competitive reasons. That that is blended in with our overall cap rate or in-place yield as we call it, that we disclosed. But on the second question, the difference between sort of the in-place with NOI cap rate and what we would believe is kind of a normal after CapEx. Really as we look at our net portfolio, it's about 150 basis points lower on a cash basis than on an NOI basis, on a pretty consistent basis. And that's probably about average or maybe even a bit low on the low side for some of office, probably goes between a 150 basis points to 200 basis points from cash to NOI. And I'm sorry the last question was? Neil Malkin - RBC Capital Markets : Well, I mean, I'm not exactly sure. I guess maybe if you can quantify the amount that you could possibly sell and you have left to sell of the suburban office assets and then, I guess we could actually figure out how much spend you could possibly be saving, right? Because those are obviously CapEx-intensive assets you're selling? Mark Denien : That's right. And I think we, if you look back probably over the last couple of years, I think we disclosed every quarter, pretty much how much CapEx we're spending by product types. So you can see that. And clearly the suburban office is where the higher number is as well as drop to the higher percentage. And so that's coming down. Again, if you look at our remaining dispositions for the rest of year in our guidance, which is probably $300 million, $400 million, at least 50% of that I would say is going to be in the suburban office, probably a little bit more than 50% of it. Operator : And we'll have a follow-up question from the line of Jamie Feldman. Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I was hoping you guys could spend a little bit more time on your comments on the office business. It sounds like rents aren't necessarily moving, concessions are coming in. Can you give a little bit more color in terms of what you're seeing on both the demand side and rent growth and maybe a little more granularity on the different markets? James Connor : Sure, Jamie. I think as we outlined in the script, there's not a great deal of rent growth in the suburban market yet, but where we are making you some ground is concessions are trending down, less free rent, less TIs in particular going into the deals. Better term is probably a big factor that doesn't get talked about a lot. Office tenants in the last years have been a little nervous to make commitments beyond that three to five year period. Now we're starting to see tenants making longer-term commitments, which improves the economics of a lot of our deals. Dennis Oklak : Just adding to what Jim said, I would say, the Midwest rents are still pretty flat, but I think we've actually seen some decent rent growth in a couple of the Southeast markets and we're not in all of that many office markets anymore, but Raleigh's held up extremely well in both from a volume and a very stable and growing rental rate stream. South Florida, the activity has been pretty good across the board and rents continue to creep up down there. So the suburban office market is coming back slowly, slowly and even in the Midwest, I think I would say, I think our activity is probably up a little bit but rental rates probably are not. Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Do you get the sense that maybe three quarters or a year from now we'll be talking about a much more robust office market or it just feels like we're stuck in neutral here in your markets, outside the Southeast, I guess? James Connor : Well, we love to be talking about that Jamie. But realistically, I don't think so. I don't think -- we're not seeing the trends where you're going to see a real significant turnaround, where you've got some substantial rent growth in the next 12 months. I don't think we're that bullish on the suburban office market. I think we'll continue to make modest increases in occupancy like we have over the last 18 months. In some of the better markets, as Denny alluded, Raleigh, South Florida, even Texas, those markets rents have gotten back to where they're supporting new construction. I think the Midwest still lags behind and is a little bit softer. Operator : And we do have a follow-up from Michael Bilerman. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup: Denny, just on the Lehigh Valley industrial asset, that was a build-to-suit that you had committed to take out from the tenant or from another developer? Dennis Oklak : That was from another developer. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup: And what was the, I guess, this is just you were attracted by the asset or what was it? What drove you to. Dennis Oklak : Michael, the Pennsylvania area and New Jersey are the geographic area we're trying to grow in. And this was good opportunity for us from a group that we have our relationships with and like the price propound and it's an excellent building in excellent location. So it's always good for certain private developers to be able to have it take out and they get that upfront. A lot of times you get a bit better deal on it when if it's fully complete. So we believe we did on that one. Dennis Oklak : Michael, the only thing I would add is we have a long-standing relationship with the tenant. We have that tenant in four or five other buildings around the country. So we have a very high-level of comfort with them, strong relationship. So we think there is actually an opportunity to grow. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup: And what's that lease length like? Mark Denien : 10 years I think. Yes. Annual rent growth. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup: So what is that? And what was your sort of going in versus the GAAP rate, cap rate on it? Mark Denien : Well, I don't remember exactly, but the going in is 6. And then I think its 1.5% to 2% bumps for sure. But I think closer to 2% on that deal. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup: On the medical office, do you have any desire as you think about the acquisition market being pricey and you're continuing to sell assets and raising that guidance? Are you thinking about capping the medical office assets at all for proceeds? Mark Denien : No. As you recall, we did about -- we sold and improved net portfolio at the end of last year about $250 million, couple of those closed, I think early this year. And we've said at the time that that really -- we took advantage of the market, what we thought was good pricing, sold some assets that weren't as strategic to us as the ones we retained for hospital relationships or geographical purposes. So we're very comfortable with where that portfolio is now and quite honestly there is really none of that in our disposition guidance. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup: And then as you think about just, Mark, on the balance sheet, sort of the target ratios in terms of funding from here and definitely raising the equity, certainly was a big positive in terms of funding and making sure you have the capacity. I am just curious, and obviously buying back the preferreds is going to help fixed charge as well. How should we think about where you want your ratios to be going forward? From a debt-to-EBITDA, debt-to-gross assets and the fixed charge perspective? Dennis Oklak : Michael, we haven't really set any targets in the sand like we did back in '09, but what I would tell you is this, a couple of things. As we look out towards the end of the year, we fully expect our debt-to-EBITDA to be under 6.5% by the end of the year. Our debt plus preferred to EBITDA to be well under 7% by the end of the year, and our fixed charge closer up to 2.5%. And then from that point on, what I would say, our plan is to grow the company, to grow mainly through development and to fund that growth at a better leverage profile that we set here today. More in that 60%, 40% range. And if we do that all those ratios naturally will just continue to improve. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup: And how much do you have left on the ATM right now? Mark Denien : We are out of our ATM. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup: That actually you're going to reload then? Mark Denien : I'm sorry. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup: Are you going to reload it? Mark Denien : Yes, I think it's prudent to always have it out there, just if we need it to have it. So you'll probably see us reload that some time in the not too distant future. Operator : Let's go to the line of Ki Bin Kim. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Sorry, if someone has already asked this question or not. But you have had been a pretty much a net disposer, shorter developments, just on buying and selling for a couple years now. How should we think about that next year? How does that dynamic change a little bit next year? Mark Denien : Well, I think, Ki Bin, we're now at the point, I guess I'd say couple of things here. When you look from here on out for the next six months, to say, 12 months, we're still targeting some of the Midwest suburban office assets, which are just not long-term holds for us. And we obviously did some of that in the first half of this year, and we've got some more, that you'll see us do in the second half of the year. And then, we also are targeting just these couple of retail assets that we still own or own a partial interest in, because those are pretty much stabilize now. And I think the pricing will be pretty good on those. So we're going to be get rid of those. I think looking forward, when you look around the rest of our portfolio, including industrial, suburban office, medical office, it's going to be properties that we really like. And so I think you'll see as the more opportunistic and strategic on the dispositions, once we get through a little bit of those targeted assets again. And the dispositions will really depend on a lot of different things. First of all, what the cap rates are? If we think it's a really good time to sell, we'll look at selling. What our development pipeline might be, if we've got a development pipeline and we can sell some older assets and redeploy the proceeds back into great new development assets, we'll do that. So I think sitting here today we don't really have any specific targets for a dollar volume of what it might be after this year. I think it will be more strategic, it's really based on market conditions. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust: I guess are you ruling out any kind of sizable dispositions or is that still kind of possible? Dennis Oklak : Well, I don't think it's very likely, because our office portfolio is getting down to the point now where it isn't that sizeable. So I don't think you're going to see any particularly sizeable transactions, but I suppose something should come along, but I don't think it's likely. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust: And just one last one. Your service operations income, I know we've talked about it in the past, and there is other reasons why it's there and not just to make the $18 million a year. Any change in terms of the right staff level, especially as it relates to that part of the business? Mark Denien : Well, the staffing in that piece of the business is just part of our -- there is no separate staffing for that piece of the business. We get that business really primarily, I would say, through our land positions. And as you know, since we've been around for a long, long time, and definitely since we've been a public company, if we can make some money by selling some land and doing a third-party construction project for a customer who wants to own their building, we're happy to do that. And those are the same people that would develop a build-to-suit that we owned on that land or developed a spec building on that land. So it's all part of the same group. And I would say the earnings are probably up a bit this year, because we had a couple larger projects that were exactly like that, where we sold the land and entered to a third-party construction contract that have proved pretty profitable for us. But again, we've had this discussion over the years. Our service operations are all there, been very consistent, higher obviously in the years, we were working on the BRAC project in D.C., because that was such a large project, and has consistently stayed above 5% of our overall FFO, and that's it. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions in queue at this time, please continue. Ronald Hubbard : I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today. And we look forward to reconvening during our third quarter call, tentatively scheduled for October 30. Thank you again. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thanks again for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference services. You may now disconnect.",

Before we make our prepared remarks, let me remind you that statements we make today are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For more information about those risk factors, we would refer you to our December 31, 2013 10-K that we have on file with the SEC. Now for prepared statement, I\u2019ll turn it over to Denny Oklak. Denny Oklak : Thank you Ron, good afternoon everyone. Today I will highlight some of our key accomplishments for the quarter and then Jim Connor will give you an update on our leasing and development activity. I\u2019ll review our asset recycling transactions and Mark will then address our third quarter financial performance and balance sheet. I have to say that the third quarter of 2014 was one of Duke Realty\u2019s best quarters ever. Our operating fundamentals were at near record levels. We placed in service over 3.6 million square feet of new developments which were 98% leased and have an 8.6% GAAP yield. We continued our asset recycling by selling a $175 million of mostly suburban office assets at a 6.2% in place cap rate creating significant value for the company. I\u2019m very proud of the teams we have in place throughout organization and their ability to execute the real estate transactions and operations as well as or better than anyone in the business. Specifically, we signed 5.9 million square feet of leases and finished the quarter at 95.4% in service occupancy rate, our highest level since 1995. Rent on renewal leases for the quarter accelerated to 9%, up from the 7.5% to 8% level of the first two quarters. This performance reflects tightening fundamentals and the quality of our modern bulk industrial portfolio. We also started $100 million of new development projects at solid yields, bringing our total starts year-to-date to $419 million. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim Connor to give a little more color on our operations. Jim Connor : Thanks, Denny. Good afternoon, everybody. From an operational standpoint, we had a strong quarter of leasing at 5.9 million square feet, as Denny noted. Our tenant retention was a little over 58% because in this tight industrial market we\u2019re able to opportunistically upgrade the quality of our tenants and the economic terms of the leases in place by bringing some new tenants that\u2019s indicated in the overall improvement in our occupancy during the quarter. Now, let me touch on some of the key activity within each of our product types. With respect to our industrial portfolio, we continue to see fundamentals improve with completion of 5.1 million square feet of total leasing. In-service occupancy in the bulk industrial portfolio was 96.6%, 200 basis points higher than a year ago and an all time high for us. In addition to the exceptional leasing execution by our team, we continue to capture rental rate growth, which is a key focus of company right now. With growth on industrial lease renewals of 9.2% for the quarter, the highest growth rate in 12 years. We are seeing broad strake in industrial leasing across all our markets. As an example, our Indianapolis portfolio best in class modern bulk industrial product continues to benefit from strong demand from regional and national companies that are modernizing supply chains, as well as the e-commerce players choosing Indi as a primary distribution location. Our 19.4 million square foot Indianapolis portfolio is 99.7% occupied with only 60,000 square feet of available space in service buildings. The Indianapolis market wide industrial vacancy is just over 5%. Our Indianapolis portfolio has realized average net effective rent growth of 12% year-to-date, up from the mid single-digit level last year. Some other notable new leases signed during the quarter that drove occupancy higher were in Savannah where we signed two new leases totaling 1.2 million square feet with Home Depot national distribution centers. We also executed a new lease for 446,000 square feet at Nashville with B&G Foods North America and a new lease for 216,000 square feet with UPS Supply Chain Logistics in central New Jersey. On the lease renewal side, we also executed a 414,000 square foot lease with General Motors in Cincinnati. We are 95.5% leased or better in 18 of our primary 22 markets with six of our markets at 100% occupancy, which positions our portfolio in the sweet spot to continue to push rents and reduce concessions. Now turning to the medical office, the portfolio continues to perform well with an in-service occupancy level of 93.9% and the same property NOI up nearly 6% on the trailing 12 month basis driven by a combination of occupancy increases, rent growth and operating efficiencies. The suburban office market continues to improve with our in-service occupancy up 30 basis points over the prior quarter after excluding the effect of dispositions and a partially leased development project that was placed in service. Our team had an exceptional quarter leasing with nearly 700,000 square feet of leases with notable activity in St. Louis market where we signed 12 leases totaling 244,000 square feet which improved occupancy 80 basis points in that market. We have also signed an additional 60,000 square foot new lease in the St. Louis market in early October. Turning to development, we had a $100 million of development starts in three projects in the third quarter, totaling 1.1 million square feet expected to generate a 6.8% weighted average initial stabilized yield. Two industrial developments commenced, the first was a 150,000 square foot build to suit industrial project on our land in the Gateway North Center in Minneapolis with Blue Dart Corporation. This is our third build to suit in the Gateway North Business Park in the last 10 months which is another testament to our development expertise and our strategic land holdings. I would also point out that as of today we\u2019re now 100% leased in Minneapolis. The second industrial development is a 783,000 square feet speculative project we started in Southern California. The project is located in the Inland Empire, a market has absorbed over 25 million square feet of space year-to-date according CBRE, a pace that is slightly ahead of last year, while vacancy has dropped to mid 4% range down from the low 5% from the area a year ago. Finally, I\u2019ll note that our 5 million square foot industrial portfolio in California, we\u2019re currently 97% leased and believe it is the opportunity time to start speculative development in that market. On the suburban office side, we started another project in Raleigh in our Perimeter Park development. Perimeter 4 is a six storey 192,000 square foot Class A office building. As many of you know, we owned prime land at in Raleigh adjacent to the Research Triangle Park and the Raleigh International Airport and are benefiting from an economic boom in the region with single-digit office vacancy rates and markets rents up 3% year-over-year. The current project is 71% pre-leased to ChannelAdvisor Corporation, with a promising list of prospects to fill the remaining space. Many of you will remember that in 2013, we started two similar projects in the same park in Raleigh. I\u2019m pleased to note that both those project were delivered on time and have been leasing ahead of budget currently at a combined 85% level. The two delivered projects are on target to achieve projected stabilized yields in the mid 9% range. From an overall development pipeline perspective, at quarter end we have 24% projects under construction totaling 8.3 million square feet and a projected a 627 million in stabilized cost at our share, that are 59% preleased in the aggregate. This pre-leased percentage is down a bit from previous quarters due in fact as Denny said, this quarter we placed 3.6 million square feet of developments in service that were 98% leased in aggregate. Our current pipeline has an initial cash stabilized yield of 7.1% and a GAAP yield of 7.7%, once again highlighting the tremendous value creation being executed by our team and the value of our strategic land holdings. Now I\u2019ll turn it back over to Denny to cover some of our asset recycling activities. Denny Oklak : Thanks Jim. With respect to investment activity, we had a $175 million of primarily suburban office dispositions during the quarter across three transactions. As we alluded to in the last call, we\u2019ve been focused on selling suburban in the Midwest as well as taking advantage of good market pricing to sell a few select assets in the Southeast. As many of may have seen in the news, we closed on the sale of the Royal Palm buildings in Broward County, Florida. These two buildings encompassed 466,000 square feet and were sold for $275 per square foot. We acquired this complex in 2010 and had a gross investment basis of about $245 per square foot, which represents excellent value creation for shareholders. The second disposition transaction we closed in the Southeast was Millenia Lakes in Orlando. This was a three building complex held in joint venture and included a 12 acre parcel of land as well. The office complex was sold for about a $193 per square foot with total net proceeds to us of $40 million, which represented nearly 25% gain over the gross basis. Finally, we sold an 11-building 2.1 million square foot non-strategic industrial portfolio in Indianapolis, also held in joint venture where we had a 10% ownership interest. Our share of the sale proceeds for this disposition was $7.4 million. On the land side, we sold 9 million of non-strategic parcels during the quarter. In addition, I\u2019ll note that combining land sales with development projects and in land year-to-date we\u2019ve monetized 470 acres or about $84 million of land. Now let me share and update about additional dispositions. We\u2019ve alluded to on previous calls and some that are in the news. First, we have about 10 other transactions, mainly suburban office properties and our two remaining retail centers that are in the market or under contract. We expect to close these in the fourth quarter. So a few may spillover into the first quarter. All of these transactions are part of our 2014 disposition guidance. There are two other larger deals recently offered to the market that have been in the real estate news. The first is an industrial portfolio comprised of 56 non-strategic building, 5.9 million square feet for an average of about 100,000 square feet per building. The portfolio is currently 91.7% occupied and the buildings are on average 23 years old. This industrial portfolio is located in primarily Midwest cities. With the recent compression in cap rates we\u2019ve seen for this type of industrial assets, we believe this is another great value creation opportunity. Timing wise, we expect bids on the portfolio in about a month and would expect to close early next year. This package is not part of our 2014 guidance. The second large package recently put out on the market and in the news is a nine building 1 million square foot 90% occupied suburban office portfolio located in Saint Louise and two office parks known as [Medical] Center and Woods Mill. We expect the timing of this sale to be in late first quarter of next year and also these are not part of our 2014 disposition guidance. To summarize our asset transactions, we continue to take advantage of a favorable window in the real estate and capital market cycles to maximize proceeds in suburban office and other non-strategic assets and allocate capital primarily into value creating development activities or further deleveraging actions. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mark to discuss our financial results and capital plans. Mark Denien :  Thanks, Denny. Good afternoon, everyone. As Denny mentioned, I would like to provide an update on our financial performance, as well as an overview of our capital transactions. Core FFO was $0.30 per share for the third quarter represented by strong operational performance, delivery of developments and offset a bit from dispositions. Same property NOI growth for the 12 and 3 months ended September 30th was 3.8% and 6.0% respectively. The quarterly number is higher than expected due to exceptionally strong leasing activity, rental rate growth across all product types and extremely low bad debt expense for the quarter. As Denny noted, our growth in average net effective rental renewals was 9.0% for the third quarter and is 8.0% year-to-date. This growth in net effective rent was driven primarily by rent growth in our industrial portfolio where we\u2019re optimistic about our ability to continue to push rental rates. We generated $0.26 per share in AFFO, which equates to a dividend payout ratio of 65% compared to $0.25 per share in the second quarter. We expect there will be an uptick in second generation CapEx during the fourth quarter related to our recent leasing activity, which is reflected our revised annual AFFO guidance of $0.95 to $0.97 per share. As we continue to improve our overall operations and have a higher percentage of our income come from high quality lower CapEx old properties, we\u2019re producing a consistent growth in AFFO and driving down our already conservative AFFO payout ratio. As we previously mentioned on last quarter\u2019s call, we issued 3.1 million common shares through our ATM program in July raising total proceeds of $55 million. These were issued at an average price of $18.09 per share. Later in the third quarter we raised an additional $10 million of proceeds through the ATM program at an average price of $18.58 per share. Building and land sales generated a $185 million of proceeds during the quarter, a portion of these proceeds were used to redeem our $96 million and 6.625% Series J preferred shares, which will resulted in over a $6 million annualized reduction in preferred dividends. All of these capital transactions coupled with our operational performance resulted in a continued trend of improvement in our key financial metrics. We reported a fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.4 times for the rolling 12 months ended September 30th compared to 2.0 times we reported for the year prior. For just the third quarter, fixed charge coverage is now up to 2.5 times. Net debt plus preferred to EBITDA for the rolling 12 months ended September30, 2014 was 7.2 times compared to the 7.4 times we reported last quarter and 8.3 times we reported for the rolling 12 months ended September 30, 2013. When looking at this metric for just the current quarter, it improved to 7.1 times. Also during the quarter, we closed on a renewal of our unsecured revolving credit facility increasing the potential maximum facility size from $850 million to $1.2 billion at a 20 basis point reduction in rate and extended the term to January of 2019. We are in an excellent liquidity position and our leverage metrics continue to improve. We are very well-positioned to continue bolstering the balance sheet, fund our development pipeline and address our next significant debt maturity in February 2015. I will conclude by saying that I\u2019m very happy to report an another strong quarter. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Denny. Denny Oklak : Thanks Mark. As a result of this outstanding performance, we are pleased that yesterday we were able to raise the low-end of our guidance for FFO per share by $0.02 narrowing our 2014 range to $1.17 to $1.19 per share and raising the midpoint by $0.01. Similarly, as Mark said, we raised our guidance for AFFO per share by $0.01, narrowing our 2014 range to $0.95 to $0.97 per share. We also range same-property guidance from a range of 2% to 4% up to a range of 3.75% to 4.5%. In closing, we are pleased with our team\u2019s outstanding operational performance and allocation of capital year-to-date and expect the solid finish to the year. We believe dispositions currently in the market will continue our asset recycling into primarily high quality development projects, continue to increase overall quality and stability of year-over-year growth of cash flow per share. With that, we\u2019ll now open it up for questions. And we ask to participants to keep the dialog to one question or perhaps two very short questions. You are of course welcome to get back in the queue. Thanks. Go ahead. Operator : (Operator Instructions). And our first question we\u2019ll go to the line of Jaime Feldman. Please go ahead. Jamie Feldman - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch : Hey, thank you and good afternoon. Just I guess it\u2019s a quarter later, can you guys just give a sense of which markets this quarter you sense are still taking up that maybe weren\u2019t quite as strong last quarter? And then which you think you are starting to get more concerned about supply or maybe just slowing down on the demand side? Denny Oklak : Sure Jamie. I think no matter who\u2019s numbers you use, across the country you\u2019re seeing great activity, great net absorption. I think, you started to see some numbers in -- I\u2019ll just kind of work my way around the country. Atlanta and Chicago and Pennsylvania all had good quarters of net absorption. Those markets are all in very good balance. Going down south, Houston had another good quarter. Their pipeline of spec development continues to be well leased. Dallas as we have talked about, increased the amount of spec space a little bit. So I think that\u2019s we\u2019ve got our eye on that market. Southern California just continues to perform at a huge level as I reiterated earlier. They had another I think approaching 6 million square feet of net absorption in the third quarter. I don\u2019t t think if missed any. It\u2019s some of the secondary markets. Cincinnati had a great quarter, some of the Florida market, South Florida had another great quarter of leasing there. So those are kind of really the highlights going around the system. Dallas is probably the only one that we\u2019re watching a little bit. Some people have referred to Indianapolis but as I alluded to in the call, our Indianapolis portfolio is performing so well. We chose to build some additional product down there just to have some expansions base for our existing tenant base. So we feel pretty good about that market. And I think that\u2019s really the highlight. Jamie Feldman - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch : And just a follow-up. As you think about some of these secondary markets that are starting to pick up, is it the same types of demand, is it ecommerce, is it supply chain or is there something different happening in those markets? Denny Oklak : Well, I think the big ecommerce is primarily the Tier 1 markets. You are seeing some of the infill leasing for some of the e-commerce guys and some of the secondary, tertiary markets, but the big notable million square feet deals that our favorite retail and ecommerce companies are primarily in the Tier 1 markets. You just, you\u2019re seeing good activity across all sectors in the industrial pipeline. So, I think e-commerce continues to be a big part of the performance but you cannot credit it solely to e-commerce like you probably would have maybe two or three years ago. I think you\u2019ve got just the macro economy that\u2019s pretty much hitting on all cylinders from the industrial perspective. Operator : Thank you. Next, we\u2019ll go to line of Vance Edelson. Please go ahead. Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley : Terrific, thanks. So, just on selling the 11 industrial buildings in Minneapolis, it\u2019s a market you described as very robust and it\u2019s benefiting from the e-commerce. Could you share a little more on what the JV\u2019s rational was for pulling out of those assets? Denny Oklak : Sure Vance. That is the JV that we formed back before we went public back in 1992. So, as we said in prepared remarks, we only owned 10% of that and the rest of it is owned by institutional investor. And obviously a 22 year run which is tremendous run for them on those assets and they just decided to -- that they were ready to sell and move onto something else. So as since the [vector] was in place for 22 years, those assets were getting older in nature and so they wanted to sell. And again I think the results from that disposition were extremely favorable and we\u2019re seeing that in the markets really I would say across the board today. Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley : Did you have an opportunity to buy them but they\u2019re older assets, so you didn\u2019t want them? Denny Oklak : Yes, we could have bought them, but yes that\u2019s right. You know that our philosophy is that with the new larger modern bulk product and that\u2019s what we\u2019re really focused on, on the development and has been on the acquisition side. Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley : Okay. And then\u2026 Mark Denien : You\u2019re less than 200,000 for the building and your average age is well over 25 years. Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley : Okay. That make sense. And then with valuations on the office side continuing to move up, would you consider more non-core dispositions than you would have earlier in the year or perhaps even placing on the market what you want to consider to be more core if the price looks good? Denny Oklak : Well, I think we have sold some core what we would call core office product in the Southeast. Earlier this year we had the joint venture with 3630 in Atlanta then selling the Royal Palm buildings and Millenia buildings, those were all excellent core assets in I would call it core office market. So, yes, we were happy to do that when we think the timing is right. And then as we said, we\u2019ve got a big portfolio of suburban office assets in St. Louis that\u2019s now in the market plus some other miscellaneous office product in various markets. So, we think the pricing is good right now and that\u2019s what we\u2019re experiencing. So we\u2019ll continue to prune that portfolio. Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to Kevin Baron. Your line is open. Kevin Baron - Citi: Hi. Good afternoon. Denny, you kind of talked about already to mark that portfolio that\u2019s available in St. Louis I guess for marketing. Could you just talk a little bit more about the strategy with the Midwest suburban office and the marketplace Cincinnati and St. Louis those assets are running in the low 80s for occupancy. And the sales that you\u2019ve completed in the past quarters have been more stabilized assets. So maybe just speak about how much lease up is needed just to generate that investor interest. And then maybe just talk about the pricing trends that you\u2019re kind of seeing within those particular markets? Denny Oklak : Well, let me start with the St. Louis. As we\u2019ve said on the call, as Jim said that market is I would call it on fire for suburban office when you compare to what we\u2019ve seen for a long, long time. And so, one of the projects that I mentioned on the call was around in the script was Woods Mill. Woods Mill is a two office building portfolio we\u2019ve owned for probably 10 years and it\u2019s now 100% leased. And so there is some other product there that is also moving up and at a very high occupancy. So, we are looking at marketing those as we get those leased up. And that again somewhat why our remaining occupancy always looks a little bit low because we continue to have good leasing success and then we mark those assets for sale. The similar story I would say over in Cincinnati, but probably not the level of leasing activity that we\u2019ve seen in St. Louis at this point in time. So, we continue again earlier this year, we sold about $150 million package in Cincinnati and we continue to look at other opportunities to sell some of those assets also. Kevin Baron - Citi: Okay. And then just one follow-up. If you look at the development page in the supplemental, the developed margins declined from 21% last quarter to 18% if you kind of look at the midpoint of the projected value creation. So, another deliveries starts in the quarter impact your numbers. But can you just walk us through what is pressuring those margins; is it new land costs or construction costs and then maybe how we should think about that over the next 12 months or so? Mark Denien : Kevin, this is Mark. I\u2019ll start with that and I\u2019ll let Denny or Jim chime in on what\u2019s left in that portfolio. But part of what\u2019s driving the decrease in the margin is the product mix. We\u2019ve placed in service this quarter a couple of our office projects down in [Riley] that Denny or Jim mentioned. We\u2019re in the mid 9.5% yield range with still obviously the margin on those projects on office site. We were getting better margins in the industrial that we\u2019re left with. So, the development pipeline that sits here today is much more heavily weighted towards the industrial product than it was the office a quarter ago. And then as it comes specifically to the margin on the industrial, Jim, I don\u2019t know if you had anything. Jim Connor : Yes. And the only other comment, I think you\u2019ll continue to see that number fluctuate a little bit depending on how much of the volume is in our newer markets. So for example, the Southern California is a market we\u2019ve really just geared up to start the development in. We acquired that piece of property last quarter to be able to put it in service. So, the yields there are not going to be as good as our mature markets where we\u2019ve owned strategic land for a number of years on a really good basis. And I think 18% is still pretty good. Kevin Baron - Citi: All right. Okay, thanks guys. Operator :  And next we\u2019ll go to line of Brendan Maiorana. Please go ahead. Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities : Thanks. Good afternoon. Looking at your leased rate, it\u2019s very high. I think it\u2019s about as high as it\u2019s been. But if I look at the occupancy rate as you disclosed it on page 16, there is a pretty healthy spread between leased and average commenced occupancy. And that\u2019s a stat that you guys have only offered more recently, but it\u2019s 350 basis points wide across the overall portfolio, it\u2019s 370 basis points just in the bulk side. How should we think about what a normalized spread leased versus occupied should be and what does that mean for occupancy trends as we think about it over the next few quarters? Mark Denien : Yes, Brendan, I\u2019ll see if I can try to answer part of that. That 350 basis-point spread was certainly wider than we have historically run out. We\u2019ve been more in the 150 to 225 basis-point spread I would say, so the 350 is definitely wider. A couple of things I would point out. If that spread is not that wide in our same property pool, if you look at the same property page in the supplemental, it\u2019s the commencement occupancy is closer to the 95% range. So the spread on that pool is more like a 150 to 175 basis-point which is what we\u2019ve been traditionally running at. What we\u2019re dealing with is only about 75% of our NOI right now is in our same property pool, because as we\u2019re going through this dispositioning phase, we\u2019re selling older assets and we\u2019re replacing it with a new development pipeline that takes 24 months before it makes its way in same store. So about 25% of our total NOI is not in the same property pool yet and that\u2019s where we\u2019re really seeing significant NOI growth. And I think that that 350 basis-point spread will translate into additional NOI increases as we get through the next several quarters; it just may not all show up in the same property pool. Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities : Okay. And Mark just related to that, your occupancy guidance I think suggests that a modest dip in the fourth quarter; is there anything specific or just that\u2019s just kind of natural expirations? Mark Denien : Yes, Brandon our occupancy guidance is an average, not an endpoint. And if you look at it on average, what it really would suggest it will be right around a very top in the guidance. And because we were within that range, we just decided not to update the guidance. Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities : Okay. Mark Denien : So, if there was any dip at all I would say it would be very, very modest. Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities : Okay. And just real quick one, you have $250 million of debt with February maturity and high rates, 738. So, I think can you pay that off three months early and if so, what would be likely rate if you were to go to the market today? Mark Denien : Yes, we\u2019re probably looking at 4%, maybe just under 4% for 10 year money give or take right now. We could not pay it off early without a fairly substantial make whole premium. And we\u2019re looking -- as Denny mentioned, we have a lot of dispositions in the pipeline, we do like the debt rates we have right now, but we\u2019re just trying to right now Brendan balance out the disposition proceed with the maturities we have coming at us. There is a lot of different ways we can take care of that February maturity, but needless to say that all pretty attractive relative to the rate we have on that debt. Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities : Great. Thanks. Operator : And next, we\u2019ll go to line of Eric Frankel. Please go ahead. Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors : Thank you very much. Just hoping you can maybe just explain operating expenses; they seem to be at a pretty low rate this quarter, especially about that some of your peers have reported some higher operating expenses just I was, I want to get an explanation whether it\u2019s a one-time thing or you expect operating expenses to ramp up over the next year or so? Denny Oklak : Yes Eric, I guess to be honest with you, it didn\u2019t really pop out to me or us that they were that extremely low. Operation, we have pretty good quarter overall, but just trying to think here, not been stuck. We obviously had very high operating expenses in the first quarter with weather related issues. I guess in a lot of our cities, the first quarter and the third quarter is really the highest quarter of operating expenses we have because of weather conditions either cold or hot. And we have a pretty mild summer, so that maybe a part of the driver. So I\u2019ll have to look into that and get back to you again. Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors : Okay. Just my follow-up question regarding the leasing spread. So, Jim you commented you\u2019re able to -- a little bit higher quality rental. Could you comment on leasing spreads for those new tenants are in place? Jim Connor : Well, we\u2019ve certainly -- that\u2019s been a lot of time talking about this in the last few quarters. We continue to monitor very closely the number and percentage of leases in the portfolio that we\u2019re done in the trough period that 2009 to 2011 period. And we\u2019re generally working out on the renewal side, the next two to three quarters. So, the next 18 months we still got about 50% of the portfolio rolling, 50% of the square footage that is rolling in the next 18 months is from that trough period. So, we were seeing very good opportunity to push rents there. The other place we\u2019re pushing back is concessions are down and lease terms are up. Because our occupancies are so high, we\u2019ve got certain tenants that we want to renew for shorter periods of time that we\u2019ve got limited opportunity to push the rents and extend the terms out. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to take advantage of that. So that\u2019s the first piece of its is, the trough rents. And the other piece of it is just a result of the high occupancy. When most of our operating units are above 95.5%, they can dictate some pretty good terms. So we\u2019ve been pushing a lot on not only the rental rates, but also the annual increases. And we\u2019re pretty consistently getting 2.5% increases now on our industrial annual escalations, which has been a pretty healthy improvement over the years gone by. Denny Oklak : And Eric, as you know we\u2019ve not historically tracked new leasing spreads and a lot of that we\u2019ve talked about has been because as we were more predominantly office, it was really hard to measure one lease to the other because the type of build out and space was actually different since lot heard on the office side than the industrial. But we\u2019re trying to track that data now on the industrial side. And I would tell you that the spread on our new leases on the industrial is maybe 100 basis points lower than the renewal spread, but they\u2019re very much in some ballpark on the industrial side. Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors : Okay. Thanks for the color. Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to line of Dave Rodgers. Please go ahead. Dave Rodgers - Robert W. Baird: Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Maybe Jim to start with you. On the development side, I think you need $80 million to $180 million of development starts in the fourth quarter to hit your guidance. I assume you have good visibility on that. And that\u2019s not going to be an issue. But I guess I\u2019d love to know what you\u2019re thinking in terms of kind of the runway for development kind of the total pipeline as you think without giving guidance for 2015. But how does that build the two pipeline look and any kind of timing issues where we\u2019d see a slowdown or could see a pick-up in the development activity overall? Jim Connor : Well Dave, I\u2019m going to have to choose my words very carefully because I\u2019ve got three guys in the room looking at me now. I would tell you and I think everybody would have the same sense as you look at where we are in 2014 and what we need to achieve to hit hard, the midpoint of our guidance, I would tell you I think we all feel very good about that. As you look at the U.S. industrial market, you\u2019ll look at the improving office market; you\u2019ll look at the healthcare business all of which contribute to our new development pipeline. I would tell you we have the same sense of confidence for 2015 that we\u2019re currently enjoying. So, I think we\u2019re reasonably optimistic. Dave Rodgers - Robert W. Baird: Okay. And then maybe on the medical office side, are you still seeing opportunities to do development in medical? And on the flip side, given the strength in cap rates and valuations of assets I mean is it maybe to think about maybe putting more of those out to market as well as you move into 2015? Jim Connor : Well, to answer the first question, yes, we\u2019re seeing a lot of additional opportunities. As the healthcare industry as a whole continues to go through an ambulation, we\u2019re seeing a lot of off campus opportunities. We\u2019re picking and choosing those on a very limited basis. We like those that are in line with major systems and long-term lease components. We like those that tie into our existing core markets. So, we\u2019re continuing to see those. On-campus opportunities probably not as strong as the off-campus opportunities in terms of just of the pure numbers. But I will tell you there are a lot of very big projects out there in the marketplace. So, we think the pipeline for the medical business is very strong for the fourth quarter and for going into 2015. In terms of spreads, the medical business is enjoying great cap rate compression just like the industrial business is. And we could monetize large pieces of that at anytime if we so chose. I think as we\u2019ve demonstrated and consistently told you guys in the last quarter, we\u2019d much rather take advantage of the opportunity to reposition the portfolio through the sales of the suburban office properties because we\u2019re getting real good cap rates there that historically we haven\u2019t seen. The only thing you see ourselves would be pruning the portfolio, we prune the MLV portfolio late in 2013 with a few assets trickling in it early 2014. We really don\u2019t anticipate we need to do that. You will see that portfolio that Denny talked about earlier on the industrial side, again that\u2019s just kind of pruning the portfolio some older and some non-strategic assets for us. So, I think that will be the extent of it in those two product types. Dave Rodgers - Robert W. Baird: Okay. Thank you. Operator : And next we\u2019ll go to line of Ki Bin Kim. Please go ahead. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Thanks. I\u2019m not sure, if I missed this, but the two other larger deals that you said are out for sale and I realize you have closed yet. But did you talk about a dollar range for those assets on a cap rate range? Denny Oklak : We didn\u2019t really talk about that. I guess I would -- and especially since we\u2019re in the market right now, I\u2019d rather not talk about that. So, what I can say Ki Bin is that those are included in the guidance as we said in the call that there -- actually two big ones are not included in our guidance. I mean there we don\u2019t anticipate either one of those to close till sometime probably in the first quarter of 2015. So, those would be included in our 2015 guidance when we give that. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Let me ask this in a different way. Are those assets for sale on par with average asset quality in those respective markets? Denny Oklak : Yes, I guess I would say so. I mean once an industrial portfolio of smaller buildings, older buildings, so I\u2019d say as that kind of portfolio goes, this is a pretty good one. And then the suburban office assets are in St. Louis and those would be typical good parts in suburban St. Louis, yes. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Okay. And just the last question from me and someone -- I know you alluded to it little bit Mark on your lease spread about -- regarding new lease spreads that which you historically haven\u2019t going in [your term out]. If I look at the rent, just the average net effective rent for what you find in both industrial and office in 2013 and three quarters in 2014, it seems like in every quarter, the net effective rent just broadly speaking is lower in new leases than they are for the new leases signed -- sorry, for renewal leases. So it just makes me wonder that is it just lower quality type of assets that are under a new lease bucket or what cause net effective of rent to be consistently lower? Mark Denien : That\u2019s just purely a factor of the market Ki Bin. I mean you got our industrial leases range anywhere from call it high $2 to $6.5 a foot, depending on what market you\u2019re in and exactly what type of industrial building it is. So it\u2019s really just product mix even within the industrial portfolio and locations driving that? We look at the overall deal quality of all of our deals which we take the total CapEx and concessions to get a deal done by the total rent we\u2019re going to collect over the life and I would tell you that the overall deal quality on all those deals are better and better every quarter. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Okay. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next we\u2019ll go to Michael Salinsky. Your line is open. Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets : Hi guys. Just given the significant disposition activity you had year-to-date. Any consequences there from a dividend standpoint that would fortunately kind of push some of that into \u201815, it will require special dividend or 1031? Mark Denien : No Mike, we should be good to go there. The acquisitions that we have done this year, we pretty much did all 1031 deals with that already. So that mitigated whatever exposure we may have had. So we should have a bit of room before we bump up against any kind of special dividend issues. Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And just as my follow-up. As you think about the leverage for the company, I mean when you were walking to the plan and deleveraging over last few years, you had a very stated target. Can you give us a sense kind of what target leverage for Duke we should expect going forward with kind of the range now as you made significant progress year-to-date you seem to be on a course for next year? Denny Oklak : Yes. Always really kind of laid out here right now, Mike is to get that fixed charge up about 2.5% to get that plus preferred to EBITDA down below 7.0% and keep that debt plus preferred to gross asset number in that 48% range through the year-end \u201814. And now what\u2019s really going to drive that are the dispositions that we\u2019ve talked about. And how quickly they come in and how we utilize the proceeds from that I guess is what I would say. So, as we give 2015 guidance at January, I think we\u2019ll have a better view on what our net disposition level will be and uses of those proceeds and at that time I think we\u2019ll be in a better position to get some more concrete guidance on where we\u2019re headed towards the leverage. But needless to say, it will be an improvement of where we are today. Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets :  Thank you very much. Operator : (Operator Instructions). We do have a follow-up from Kevin Baron. Please go ahead. Kevin Baron - Citi: Yes. Mark and Denny I appreciate you don\u2019t want to negotiate against yourself I mean back to sales, but maybe you can just share with us just the annualized NOI of each portfolios and then we can apply whatever cap rate we want in terms of determining value? Denny Oklak : Well, I certainly would if I had any idea what they were sitting here today. So, on the industrial portfolio, Mark you said it\u2019s about 21 million? Mark Denien : Yes, it\u2019s in the low 20. Denny Oklak : And again I don\u2019t really know what the office side is. But let me I guess I mean I think basically if you put these two together, we\u2019re targeting let\u2019s say $425 million to $450 million range between those two portfolios something like that. Kevin Baron - Citi: Okay. And then as we think about the same-store growth in the quarter, up 6, rents up 5, expenses up 3.3. Was there anything either in this quarter or in 3Q of \u201813 that would have changed that number relative to what you\u2019ve been doing year-to-date closer to 4? Denny Oklak : Yes Michael, I would say that I think I commented briefly on bad debt expense that was probably about 1% of the 6% right there. Not to say that the prior year\u2019s quarter had high bad debt expense, but this quarter was virtually non-existed. So that change right there was probably about 1% of the 6%. The rest of it was the combination of occupancy and rental rate growth. I would tell you that as you look forward and I forget if there was Kevin or Brandon or who has brought up the spread between our leasing rate and our occupied rate, but most of that spread is not in a our same property portfolio. Our same property portfolio is now got a pretty high commencement level. So, as you look forward, it\u2019s probably not going to have quite the same occupancy growth going forward, but we did have very good occupancy growth this quarter over last year. So, some 1% of that was kind of bad debt anomaly. Kevin Baron - Citi: Okay. And then just going back to the value creation in the development pipeline and I know 18% margins at all, which is still high. But as you think about the spread to what you\u2019re developing to and what you\u2019re evaluating the math. If you look at this quarter, you\u2019re about a 110 basis points spread, last quarter you were a 130. In this quarter you dropped your applied cap rate now. I think I heard Mark talk about mixed shift in terms of the stuff at KML, which would have dropped the pipeline expected deal from 7.4 and 7.1. How much of it was reevaluation on the value of those assets that you have in there to drop the applied cap rate for value creation from 6.1% down to 6%. Denny Oklak : None of it Michael. The way we do that calculation we lock in our estimated cap rate the day we start the building. So, the way we look at it right, wrong aren\u2019t different is once you go forward than that from that point on it\u2019s a passage of time or it\u2019s leasing activity. So the day we believe we create the value, the day we start the building. So we lock in the estimated market cap rate on that day that we will adjust our yields as we lease up faster or slower than what we had, but the cap rates locked in. So, none of that was due to your question, it was due to like you haven\u2019t confirmed that. Kevin Baron - Citi: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Denny Oklak : And again Mike, I would say it\u2019s really, it is product mix generally and that can vary on the industrial side, for example market to market though. You kind of spread; you are going to get maybe more in one market versus another. So, it\u2019s just what\u2019s in that pipeline, it\u2019s a way that around. Kevin Baron - Citi: Okay. And just last one I just want to ask one more just on the medical office and I know we\u2019ve had this discussion overtime just in terms of that piece and I know you provided a lot of good opportunities for development and you have a pretty good franchise that what you have been able to build up going back when you number of years ago. As I think about how you have transformed the portfolio, you think about these other portfolios you\u2019re putting on the market going deeper into the company and pulling out some industrial office, pulling out more suburban office. I guess, do you step back strategically and sort of say hey, in a couple of years the first line of this press release not read Duke Realty Corporation a leading industrial suburban office and medical office property REIT, it will just be Duke Realty a leading industrially REIT. And do you think about a more strategic larger scale exit to get value for the platform you\u2019ve created in the medical office and you get paid for the value creation in future projects or you just become a more pure play industrial company? Denny Oklak : Well Michael, I think, if you look back historically over the last four, five years, we\u2019ve certainly gone that direction. I mean we were 35% industrial five years ago, we\u2019re now pushing 65%. But I think what the way we look at it is, we\u2019re now in a position that we really like the overall portfolio, we know we still have some assets and again as we\u2019ve been saying primarily older Midwest suburban assets that we just don\u2019t really want own long-term. So we\u2019re looking at more what don\u2019t, we want to own long-term right now. And the good news is we can take those proceeds from this dispositions and as we said we can put those into our development pipeline and really self fund our development and overall increasing the quality and the kind of assets that we own. And so we like doing that today, both with the bulk industrial and the medical office because we know we\u2019re creating a lot of value there. And then just as far as -- and again if you look at the timing, I don\u2019t think there is, we haven\u2019t seen a better time in quite a long time to sell these suburban office assets. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. And then as far as pruning the portfolio as Jim mentioned, we did prune that MOB portfolio to the tune of about $0.25 billion about a year ago. And we\u2019re doing the same thing now with this industrial package. So we\u2019re just really trying to take advantage of things going on in the market to continue overall improved quality of portfolio. Kevin Baron - Citi: Great, thanks for the color Denny. Operator : We do have a follow up from Eric Frankel. Please go ahead. Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors : Thank you. Just to clarify, Mark. I guess I was more specifically wondering about [pass-through] on your operating expense line item. Just maybe you could provide a little bit of color what taxing authorities thinking of various markets in terms of reappraisals and where that can go in the next year or two especially with appreciating property prices everywhere? Mark Denien : Okay, yes. Because I do some math Eric, and I wasn\u2019t noticing an overall big lift in operating expenses overall. So, I still can\u2019t answer your question. So, I\u2019ll have to take a look at that but I will tell you that obviously we\u2019ve got an in-house property tax staff and they\u2019re pretty good at staying on top of what\u2019s going on out there and doing fields where they need to be. So I will follow up on that and get back to you. Denny Oklak :  But also on the industrial side Eric, they\u2019re more like net leases. So those increase especially when you\u2019re at 96% leased on the industrial side, virtually all those increases pass-through. And I would say that\u2019s probably why our expenses are down a little bit because our occupancy is up. And so we\u2019re passing more of that stuff through. Mark, can you explain it, but I\u2019m taking credit for it. How is that? Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors : Fair enough, fair enough. And perhaps Jim, maybe to talk through leasing prospect for your spec developments and obviously that\u2019s been increasing a little bit over the last year, you\u2019ve also been super successful with all the hit, but obviously you take a little bit more risk in the development pipeline, maybe you can touch upon the leasing activity? Jim Connor : Yes Eric, I would tell you that we\u2019re very optimistic that we\u2019ll have the opportunity to announce some new deals in our spec development when we report our fourth quarter numbers in mid January. I think the performance of our local teams is demonstrated. If you go back and just look at our historic track record, we\u2019ve done over the last few years, 15 spec projects with the total value of $285 million. When we started them they were 23% pre-leased and they\u2019re currently 95% pre-released. So, we have not been as aggressive on the spec side as some of our peers as shown in the percentage of our development pipeline that was pre-leased. But we\u2019ve made really \u2013 we\u2019re covering all our debt. So I would tell you that everything we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace today we continue to believe we can execute on all those with the consistent kind of track record that we\u2019ve been able to do in the last few years. Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors : Okay, thanks. Appreciate it. Operator : We do have a follow-up from Jamie Feldman. Your line is open. Jamie Feldman - Bank of America :  Great thanks. Can you guys talk a little bit more about the depth of buyers for the assets you have in the market, leverage and private versus public. Just what are you seeing out there? Denny Oklak : Well, we\u2019ve got I think we\u2019re all extremely pleased with the depth of buyers potentially that are out there. We have a single asset, just I'll give just a couple of examples that I think will give you some color. We have a single asset, office asset in St. Louis that we're finalizing the process on right now I'd say. And we had 12 offers on that building. Again a larger single asset in the [Clayton] sub market. And I would say 6 of the offers were very good and very competitive and very close. On that industrial portfolio, we had 20 CA signed in the first hour that our folks began marketing that one. So, the activity is very good and very strong. It's kind of a wide range of buyers, but I would say most of these are more of the private equity kind of buyers, some little bit more on the institutional side. Not I would say generally speaking, what we're selling it isn't public REITs that are looking at this product. So, seems to be deep pool of buyers. And quite honestly all these are being conducted without planning contingencies right now. But there is plenty of secured debt available for that even when number of buyers have unsecured lines that they can use for acquisitions today. So, the financing really isn\u2019t an issue right now. Jamie Feldman - Bank of America : Do you share some kind of leverage, would you? Denny Oklak : I don't know for sure and I think it quite varies from transaction to transaction, Jamie. But I think probably in the 60% give or take leverage range on most of these transactions today. And they are all pretty clear, Jamie, there is no doubt on any of these. Jamie Feldman - Bank of America : All right, great. Thank you. Operator : And at this time, there are no further questions. Please continue. Denny Oklak : I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining the call today. I will look forward to see many of you at upcoming NAREIT meetings or at our Atlanta Property Tour on the late afternoon at NAREIT on November 6th. Also note that our fourth quarter and year-end call is tentatively scheduled on January 29th. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference service. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Prologis Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Tracy Ward, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Tracy Ward : Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2014 conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. This morning, we will hear from Hamid Moghadam, our Chairman and CEO, who will comment on the company\u2019s strategy and the market environment; and then from Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover results and guidance. Also joining us for today\u2019s call are Gary Anderson; Mike Curless; Ed Nekritz; Gene Reilly; and Diana Scott. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I\u2019d like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates as well as management\u2019s beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filing. Additionally, our fourth quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures, and in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Hamid and we\u2019ll get started. Hamid Moghadam : Thanks, Tracy, good morning, everyone. We had a terrific quarter to finish off an excellent year. A year into our three year strategic plan, which we presented to you back in September 2013, we are ahead on both earnings and deployment targets. Our outperformance reflects the strength of our reposition portfolio, which today is focused on the highest quality assets and the best markets around the globe. Our earnings in 2014 exceeded the top end of our guidance driven by operations and capital deployment. Let me take a few minutes to discuss the three key elements of our strategic plan. Our first priority has been capitalized on the rental recovery. The improvement in market fundamentals has been strong, but somewhat uneven across regions. It is well underway in the Americas, Asia and certain parts of Europe at a pace ahead of our initial projections, while Southern, Central and Eastern Europe lag behind. In the U.S., net absorption in 2014 was right on our forecast, double the rate of deliveries. Our U.S. occupancy outperformed the market by 320 basis points, demand was broad based. At year-end, we were more than 98% occupied in many of our markets. This occupancy combined with double-digit rent change on roll over resulted in same store NOI growth of more than 5% in the U.S. and 3.7% of overall. For 2015, we forecast deliveries of 165 million square feet against absorption of 225 million square feet leading to further increases in occupancies. Moving to Europe, despite the bifurcated recovery at 95%, our occupancy in the region outperformed the market by 210 basis points. As we forecasted, cap rate compression has been a headwind on rent the growth in Europe. What\u2019s surprising is how far and how fast cap rates have dropped on the continent? While absorption and delivery information is hard to come by in Europe, we estimate Class A absorption of 66 million square feet compared to new deliveries of 45 million square feet in 2014. This drove market occupancy up by 150 basis points. Looking forward, market occupancies in Europe will continue to rise as the supplier remains constrained. We see space utilization running at a high level forcing customers to leave more space to support their incremental growth just as they did in the U.S. two years ago. In Asia, market conditions continue to be strong and pretty much on plan. Our second priority has been to realize value from our land bank through development. Last year, we put $430 million of land to work in developments with an estimated overall profit margin of 20%. These outside margins are driven by the low book value of our land which has a build out potential of about $11 billion of properties overtime. Our third priority has been to leverage our scale to grow earnings. Our global reach allows us to deploy capital where we see the highest risk-adjusted returns often ahead of the pack. In the U.S., where market conditions are strong and values are high, we have been a net seller of non-strategic holdings. Conversely in Europe, our focus was on development where we acquired quality assets at significant discounts to replacement cost. Timing here was critical as cap rates compressed throughout the year. For perspective, we took the proceeds from our dispositions and contributions at a weighted average cap rate of 6.2% and redeployed those proceeds into higher yielding assets at a weighted average cap rate of 6.8%. The net result was a favorable spread of 60 basis points on investments. As a result, we are able to grow earnings and at the same time, improve the quality of the portfolio. Moving to strategic capital, we continue to have a significant investor queue with steady interest across all our funds. In 2014, we raised about $2.5 billion of third-party strategic capital. What\u2019s remarkable is that each of our funds has outperformed its respective benchmark for all time segments in the past five years. To sum it all up, we expect market conditions globally to improve from these healthy levels. Our market leading position in Q series around the world gives us the ability to deploy capital profitably and we have the financial capacity to carry out our plan. And as we\u2019ve explained before, we are well insulated from movements in foreign currency. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom. Thomas Olinger : Thanks, Hamid. We had great results for the fourth quarter and full year. Core FFO was $0.48 per share on the quarter and $1.88 in 2014, representing an increase of 14% year-over-year. Leasing volume for the operating portfolio in the quarter was 33 million square feet. Development leasing totaled 9 million square feet, our highest level in seven years as we continue to see strong demand for new space. Average term for leases signed in the quarter increased sequentially from 45 months to 60 months. Quarter-end occupancy was 96.1%, up 110 basis points from the third quarter. The sequential increase was driven by Europe, the Americas and spaces under 100,000 square feet. GAAP rent change on rollover was 6.2% led by the U.S. at 11.4%. This metric may sling quarter-to-quarter based on the composition of rolling leases. In 2015, we expect rent spreads to continue to increase and exceed 2014 levels. Cash rent change on rollover was flat for the quarter. GAAP same-store NOI on an owned and managed basis increased 4.1% in the quarter and 3.7% for the full year at the high-end of our prior 2014 guidance range. GAAP same-store NOI on a share basis in the fourth quarter was 4.9% driven by the outperformance in the Americas, which represents about 75% of our share of NOI. Moving to capital deployment, development stabilizations totaled $1.1 billion with $236 million our share value creation or $0.46 per share. Development starts in 2014 totals $2 billion with an estimated margin of 20% indicating the book value of our land bank continues to be significantly undervalued. We acquired $1.5 billion of buildings during the year was $659 million our share at a weighted average stabilized cap rate of 6.4%. The majority of the acquisitions were through our co-investment ventures in Europe. We invested $679 million in North American industrial fund at a 6.1% weighted average stabilized cap rate increasing our ownership to 66%; we begin consolidating this venture in our financial results this quarter. Contributions and dispositions totaled $3.2 billion driven by non-strategic asset sales in the U.S. and the formation of our U.S. logistic venture. Our share was $2.2 billion and was at a weighted average stabilized cap rate of 6.2%. Looking at realized gains in 2014, we generated a $172 from development and $37 million VAC\u2019s. We measured the realized gains on VAC\u2019s has the difference between the sales price and the value of the building based at on an industrial use. Turing to capital markets, we continue to exploit the low interest rate environment, while maintaining significant liquidity. In the fourth quarter, we issued a \u20ac600 million euro bond and raised a total of $356 million in equity with $214 million through the exercise of warrants related to the formation of our ELP venture back in 2012, and an [indiscernible] issued through our ATM program. Our debt metrics and liquidity strengthen this quarter as leverage declined to 36.5%, debt to adjusted EBITDA fell to 6.8 times and liquidity increased to $3.4. Another indication of the strengthening of our balance sheet is the significant amount of nominal fixed charge coverage. On a run-rate basis, we\u2019re generating over $1 billion of excess EBITDA over fixed charges annually, our excess coverage is continue to grow in 2015, given expected leverage levels and pace of EBITDA growth. So we\u2019ve discussed before we\u2019ve taken significant steps to minimize our foreign currency exposure on both NAV and earnings. With our U.S. dollar net equity at 89%, we\u2019ve effectively insulated our balance sheet in operations from movements in foreign currency. Europe comprises about 7% of our non-U.S. dollar net equity with sterling representing the majority of this exposure. We\u2019ve minimized our Euro net equity exposure by naturally hedging with Euro denominated debt, which has the added benefit of very low borrowing costs. We currently have $3.8 billion Euro debt with an average interest rate of 2.6% and a term of over seven-years. While we have continued to see the U.S. dollar strengthen over the past quarter, the impact on Core FFO from the decline in the Euro and the Yen in the quarter was less than $0.01. The bottom line is we virtually eliminated the risk of FX movements significantly impacting our NAV and earnings. Let\u2019s turn to 2015 guidance. For operations, we expect our year-end occupancy to range between 95.5% and 96.5%. We expect to stabilize $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion of developments, an increase of $700 million at the mid-point over 2014. We are forecasting that the increase in NOI from development stabilizations will be the largest driver of our 2015 Core FFO growth. The higher volume and stabilizations will contribute about $0.14 a share to 2015 Core FFO. Looking forward, stabilizations will continue to be a significant driver of NOI growth, given projected starts of approximately $2.5 billion in 2015. GAAP same store NOI on an owned and managed basis is expected to grow between 3.5% and 4.5%. As you know, it is our share of same store NOI that impacts earnings, we expect our share for same store growth in 2015 to be 5,200 basis points higher than owned and managed. As I mentioned earlier, this is driven by the higher performance and our higher ownership of the Americas relative to Europe and Asia. Our share same store NOI growth will contribute about $0.13 a share to 2015 Core FFO. Our net G&A, we expect the full year to range between $238 million and $248 million. We forecast the whole G&A flat despite a planned increase in AUM. On the capital deployment front, we are seeking an increase - we are seeing an increasing volume of profitable development opportunities in 2015 and expect starts to range between $2.3 billion and $2.6 billion. Our well located land bank and global customer relationships are driving increase build issues activity, which we expect to account for about one-third of our starts in 2015. On the specular [ph] development front, we are largely building in our existing [indiscernible] master parks. The average occupancy in the markets where we expect to start and stabilize back this year is about 97%. While acquisitions are always hard to forecast, we are estimating building acquisitions to range between $1 billion and $1.5 billion. We expect dispositions to increase from 2014 and range between $1.5 billion and $2 billion with activity coming from the Americas, Europe and value-add conversions in the U.S. Contributions to our co-investment ventures will be driven by development stabilizations, and are expected to range between $1.3 billion and $1.8 billion. We expect to realize development gains of between $200 million and $250 million in 2015. Putting this all together, our share of net deployment is about $600 million. For strategic capital, we expect revenue to range between $210 million and $220 million, which includes an expected net promote from our PELP venture in the fourth quarter of 2015 of between $0.03 and $0.04, which is in line with the net promotes we\u2019ve earned in 2014. Now putting all of our guidance together, we expect 2015 Core FFO to range between $2.04 and $2.12 per share. This represents year-over-year growth of 11% or an increase of $0.20 at the midpoint of our guidance. The year-over-year growth is primarily driven by development stabilizations in our share of same-store NOI and reflects dilution of about $0.08 a share driven by the timing of dispositions and increased level of deployment during the year. From an FX perspective, we\u2019ve hedged the majority of our affiliated 2015 Euro and Yen net earnings effectively insulating 2015 results from any FX movements. In closing, we are very pleased with our results for the quarter and the year. We delivered ahead of our 2014 plan and have strong momentum heading into 2015. With that, we will open up for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brad Burke from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Brad Burke : Hey, good morning guys. I wanted to ask about the sources of capital over the course of 2015. It looks like you\u2019re planning on deploying around $600 million into development and acquisitions over the course of the year, that\u2019s net of your contribution and dispositions. You raised equity during the quarter. So I was wondering whether or not we should expect you\u2019d be raising additional equity in 2015? Thomas Olinger : Thanks, Brad, its Tom. Brad Burke : Okay. Thomas Olinger : When you look at our net deployment in 2015, it\u2019s about $600 million all together. If you exclude our share of acquisitions, we are actually generating about $200 million of net proceeds in 2015. So decision about how we\u2019ll fund any growth really gets down to acquisitions. And it will be a function of the opportunities that we see in the markets and the volume of activity we see and the relative returns, and that\u2019s going to drive our decision on how we capitalize and what equity we raise. We clearly have the ATM program it\u2019s a highly efficient way to issue equity. We also have $3.4 billion of liquidity that we plan on maintaining that level. Our plan assumes that level of liquidity throughout the year, our lines under on and sitting on some cash. So we feel very good about our ability to fund any growth and it\u2019s going to be a function of opportunities we see returns we can earn, and where our share price is trading. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Jamie Feldman : Great, thank you. I was hoping you could focus a little bit on fundamental demand. Just give us some color on what weakness or any weakness you\u2019re seeing from changes in oil prices and we\u2019ve seen a pull back in some of the durable goods numbers I think that earnings were relatively weak today. So just kind of any big picture thoughts on what\u2019s happening in the broader economy and the impact on demand as we roll into 2015? Eugene Reilly : Sure, Jamie, it\u2019s Eugene. I\u2019ll take that one. So so-far we\u2019ve really haven\u2019t seen an impact and of course impact from oil prices are going to take some time to apply itself out. So at the moment if you actually look at the markets that would be affected by that particular statistic, Houston and Dallas, they are looking pretty good right now. Now having said that, there isn\u2019t any question that a long-term $4 to $5 price of oil is going to have negative impacts on Houston, and it\u2019s probably going to have negative impacts on the state of taxes generally but we have not seen that. In fact, in Houston, fundamentals are robust. Our portfolio there is about almost 9% leased and about 10% of our customers have any exposure to - which roll in directly. So I\u2019m not particularly concerned, but having said that, when we look at future capital deployment and development thoughts in the state of Texas, we will be very selective on the sub-markets where we\u2019re active in and of course a very delicate one. Thomas Olinger : Yes, the only thing Jamie, I would add to that is that remember we have, we\u2019re also pretty active in Europe and Japan and those are two net importers. And a drop in the price of oil actually helps those economies. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Toti from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. David Toti : Thank you, good morning guys. Tom or may be can you just comment on the rent spreads in the quarter $6.2 versus $9.7 in the third quarter. How much was that was a function of market mix or your weakness or spending specifics you\u2019ll be great. Thomas Olinger : Yes, this is Tom and I\u2019ll let Gary or Eugene add-on. It really was a function of mix this quarter. And particularly in Europe and the amount of role we saw in Central and Eastern Europe. Hamid Moghadam : Yes, I think that\u2019s it, that\u2019s the big story. So Europe counted for about 33% of our leasing this quarter, typically, you see it about 25% and 26%. And in disproportion amount of leasing was done in Central and Eastern Europe, which were markets that were lagging. I mean that\u2019s not a good thing we\u2019re leasing space in those tougher markets. So it\u2019s driving occupancy and NOI. And as we\u2019ve said, this number is going to be volatile quarter-to-quarter, but we feel very good about going into 2015 when you look at our annual rent change number. So we think it\u2019s going to be up over 2014 and as Tom said in his opening remarks driving same store NOI about 3.5% to 4.5% range on an owned and managed basis and higher than that on a Prologic\u2019s share basis given our disproportionate waiting to U.S, so a net-net we feel good about it. Thomas Olinger : Yes, the only thing I would add to this is that we are going to be positive and strong throughout the year. The first quarter will be the weakest quarter, which is because of demographics of the leases and our rent change will accelerate throughout the year. So just be prepared on that because you are going to have the same question three months from there. David Toti : Yes, same as [ph] expectation actually with respect to Europe, Southern and Central Europe. Thomas Olinger : Yes, for Q1, so good point, I\u2019ll leave it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust. Your line is open. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. If I heard you correct on because you provide guidance on what you expect on realized development profit in 2015. And just a couple of questions around that, which I think is a important metric that I think we haven\u2019t [Indiscernible] that for a very long time. What was on 2014 versus 2015 and if I just do some simple math, I mean it seems like the margin is closer to 15%, if I compared to your contribution guidance in 2015. So I guess with more disclosure. I have questions around that, but maybe if you could provide some more color? Thomas Olinger : Okay. We did discuss what our expectations are for realized development gains. So just to be clear, we talk about when we stabilize assets, we will talk about what our margins are at that time or margins are above 20% and what we are stabilizing, which is similarly high levels on starts. On for realized gains, those are gains as a function of ours contributing those developments overseas into our ventures are also third party sales. So those are realized, they go through the P&L. The most important thing about those realized gains are that\u2019s taxable income and it drives AFFO growth as well as dividends. And we had a $172 million of realized development gains in 2014. We are forecasting realized development gains between $200 million and $250 million in 2015. That\u2019s a function of higher stabilization that are coming off the development pipeline next year or in 2015, and those getting contributed into ventures as well. Hamid Moghadam : Yes, and then of course there is the unrealized gains that are the other half that don\u2019t even hit the P&L, which is pretty interesting you know, you are in a business that generates couple hundred million dollars of value creation and basically doesn\u2019t show up anywhere in the P&L. Until couple of years later as in effect to getting free $200 million of real estate every year of that will produce a return. So over time you get the return, but you\u2019re not getting it in anyway upfront. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Vance Edelson : Great thanks. Could you provide some color on U.S. rental rates and the continued strength there, specifically the relative rent change between larger and smaller warehouses and then what are some of the driving forces are for the demand in big-box versus small? Eugene Reilly : Yes, sure it\u2019s Gene, I\u2019ll take that. Our - we\u2019re getting to occupancy levels that are historic, yet we haven\u2019t seen before. And what we\u2019re finding is that small customers that segment of the portfolio, I think had about a 180 basis point increase quarter-over-quarter. So that\u2019s really the portion of the portfolio that we have left to lease. And frankly that\u2019s where we have more pricing powers. So you have more rent growth with the smaller customers. And as I said on previous calls, that product has much higher replacement costs and we have ways to go before we reach that, so that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to see a continuation of that. In terms of big box and then Michael made some commentary on this, but we see sort of two types of demand going on in the United States. Big-box demand which is heavily oriented to e-commerce, we don\u2019t see that slowing down. That\u2019s going to be episodic quarter-to-quarter because they are very big transactions, so we think that will continue. And then on the small side of the spaces, you just have an awful lot of pent-up demand in that category and very little, it\u2019s in construction and most of the markets. Hamid Moghadam : Yes, but in terms if big-box demand, particularly in the build-to-suit segment, we\u2019re seeing a definite increase on size requirements, which are reflective, I think of more confidence that the customers have in their futures space needs. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Vincent Chao : Yes, good morning everyone. I\u2019m just curious in Europe, and the comment sounded very similar to what we have been hearing over the last couple of quarters, in terms of rents being capped by lowering cap rates, but obviously doing very well in the occupancy front. I was just curious given the economic conditions there and some of the key measures that are going on, if there\u2019s been any particular markets where you\u2019re seeing maybe an increased opportunity to deploy capital or invest that maybe a little bit different than what you have seen over the past few quarters. Just give an competitive level or your outlook for those markets. Gary Anderson : Vincent, our thesis in Europe is to be simple. Our forecast when we prepared to 2015 plan, in no way anticipated obviously QE. So on the margin, QE in Europe, is a positive. So and that\u2019s now reflected in our guidance or anything. So if anything on the margins, there is upside in our numbers going forward. Now is to how important that will be et cetera, I can\u2019t really tell you but I tell you that cap rates in Europe have probably compressed 75 basis points anyway and maybe more in some places not UK. UK compressed couple of years ago, and it\u2019s one of the most cap rate markets in the world. But the rest of Europe, I think has compressed 75 basis points to 100 basis points maybe depending on the market and that is definitely a headwind on rental growth. I think it will be a more emmenic [ph] rental growth as a result of that. But we\u2019ll take it in terms of increased value its okay. Thomas Olinger : But Vincent, I guess one thing to add, in terms of the weight of capital and ECB is driving cap rates down. We\u2019ve been in front of this, if you think about it. Look back to 2013, we deployed about $600 million in third party acquisitions; this year or last year rather 2014, about $1.2 billion; and prior to that, we\u2019re investing in our funds. So I think we\u2019ve been in front of it, certainly the tougher environment on a go forward basis to acquire I would say large portfolios and [indiscernible] but we\u2019ll be selective. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Good morning. Hamid, I can appreciate the fact that the business is performing well. And then you guys are in a position to increase development starts. I\u2019m just wondering given some of the comments Jamie made about some of the consumer demand in drop some companies like CAT, how you guys think about manage the development risk and potentially what are the warning sign that would get you guys to potentially pull back on the development stats. Hamid Moghadam : Steve, that\u2019s a really good question and something that we think about all the time. Our business has a lag with what\u2019s going on in the real economy. Remember when the business turned around sort of in 2011, we\u2019re all sitting around wondering when, why people we\u2019re not taking space and what the redoing was the utilization rate was going up, and utilization rate was absorbing all the net new demand. But not transplanting into more space being leased. And then finally people could no longer the utilization rate and they have to new space. Nobody wants to lease industrial space because they liked it they only do it because they have to. So finally, U.S. absorption picked up and that ended up being a big driver of demand. So as the economy has sputters and these - the data sets that are coming out are really erratic. I mean some data is really good and surprises people and some data like the cats of surprises the negative. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see the impact of that until couple of years down the road, and unless it\u2019s a steady trend up one quarter, down one quarter, that won\u2019t affect anything, but if it\u2019s a steady decline obviously we\u2019ll show up in our numbers and demand for our product down the road. But I don\u2019t really think that that\u2019s an overall, we are going to be experiencing that anytime soon. Now, how we manage this is pretty simple, we are buy and large most of our developments. Well, and third of them our businesses, so those are leased and we know actually 35% of them and we know kind of where that stands. And of the balance of 65% I would say the vast majority are in parts where we already have in a couple of buildings or many buildings and we are building the next incremental building. And those parks that has usually lead to the next building been built are 97% occupied today. So on the margin, we may guess wrong on one building in one park, but it\u2019s not like the office business where you drop a million square foot building and three years later maybe you\u2019re wrong about the market. It\u2019s a very incremental kind of growth. So that\u2019s what we do. We look at how space is leasing every day, every minute by talking to our people. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citi. Your line is open. Michael Bilerman : Yes, good morning out there. Tom, I was wondering if you can just provide a little bit more granularity in terms of the FFO increase is coming from development, I think you in your opening comments talked about $0.14 incremental in 2016 gross about $70 million of FFO. And I guess when I look at the development pieces that we have it\u2019s about $700 billion give or take of pre-stabilized developments that are obviously rolling into 2015. And then overall $700 million increase in the amount [ph] of development stabilizations in 2015 out just to 2014. And I assume the pre-state wide developments are earlier and $1 billion out of the $2 billion of developing ending in 2015 or probably later. You are going to get this continual FFO growth. And so maybe just provide us a little bit more details of the up and down, exactly how much NOI was recognized in 2014 off of what base, how much of that is still over from last year and how much was coming at 2015 so I assume it\u2019s probably helping 2016 as well? Thomas Olinger : Yes, Michael. Simple math would be we stabilized $1.5 billion in 2014, we\u2019ll stabilize $1.8 billion if the midpoint in 2015, just take a simple half year convention. So we\u2019re going to get a half a year pop from 2014, take the yield to 7.5%, we\u2019re going to get half a year pop from 2015 stabilizations, so half of the $1.8 million take that at 7.5% yield. That gets you roughly $70 million, that\u2019s your $0.14 a share. The important thing like you said is, what this means going forward. The pop we got in 2015 until our stabilizations of reach are steady state of development, you\u2019re going to continue to see this incremental pop from stabilizations every year, because in 2016 we\u2019re going to be stabilizing the other half, you\u2019re going to get a full year run rate on that $1.8 billion. We\u2019re starting about $2.5 billion at the midpoint in 2014, so that ought to be stabilizing in 2016. So I would see, I think we\u2019re going to continue to see this pop until we reached the point that our stabilizations and our run rate at a steady state converge. Hamid Moghadam : And the only other thing, Michael, I would add to that is that if you train a normalize kind of our earnings for the development ramp and all that, there is one other thing you normalize for and that is dispositions over acquisitions. Our dispositions tend to be more front-end loaded. Our acquisitions, and development completions and stabilizations tend to be back end completion. And that training mismatch erodes or dilutes us by about $0.08. So the $0.14 delivered will be offset by $0.08 of the bad in a steady state kind of environment. So net, net, net it\u2019s not as big as you would think. And in a normalized year, obviously acquisitions and dispositions would be equal and would be roughly the same timing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum from UBS. Your line is open. Ross Nussbaum : Hi good morning guys. I wanted to follow-up a little on Steve\u2019s question, if market trends in the U.S. continue in the manner that they\u2019ve been going which is that absorption has been outpacing construction so our industry occupancy rates are moving higher, it would lead me to believe that one of two things are about to have an either, you\u2019re going to see accelerate market rank growth, or you\u2019re going to have to see more supply coming. So I guess the question is which one is it MBD [ph] and why? Gene Reilly : Ross, its Gene. I think both are going to happen, as you\u2019re going to have one in certain markets, and the other in markets where you can have more supply. But overall at these levels we have nine markets above 98% of occupancy and 19 markets above 96%, that\u2019s in our portfolio. And the underlying markets that we\u2019re doing business in there are getting to occupancy levels they haven\u2019t seen before. So my guess, and by the way at the same time the constraints on supplying new space, continue to get more difficult. So the entitlement process isn\u2019t easier building our kind of product, building industrial product is particularly challenging. So I think you\u2019re going to see more rent growth than immediate reaction in terms of new supply. As we\u2019ve forecasted we think supply will pick up in the U.S. next year. And we\u2019re going to get closer to equilibrium, but the other thing I\u2019d point out is that as a percentage of stock, these new completions are still very, very low. And frankly as a percentage of stock, the net absorption is also low by historical standards. So there is probably some upside there as well. Gary Anderson : But let me tie this just something that we talked about in I think our Analyst Day may be two to three years ago, when we laid out the thesis for very substantial rental growth, which in those days was actually quite a position to take and it actually has played out pretty much that way, may be a little bit better than the U.S. and a little less in Europe, but fundamentally the same way. We laid out three steps in this rental increase scenario. Step one, is just a simple rollover of lease time at the trough to market rents. Just spread to market of the existing leases. Number two, the catch up of market rents are that point in time to replacement cost rents, which is kind of the phase we\u2019re in now. The third step is that as construction volumes increase, price of construction is going to go up and we\u2019re seeing this in many markets at substantially higher than inflation, because margin will come back into the subs and into the general contractors, and construction costs were going up. And also land costs are going to be new cycle land cost with new entitlements, bursement [ph] and all of that. All of that stuff is coming in at significantly higher than inflation. So replacement cost is not a static number, it\u2019s a number that is going up pretty fast right now. Now at some point it will normalize, but I think that we are in the middle to late stages of Phase II, but Phase III hasn\u2019t even started. And there are some markets that are further behind, some markets that are more closer in. Inland Empire, I would say your rents are right about the place where you can develop profitably and interestingly, because of rent, it\u2019s because cap rates, but same difference. So replacement cost as a moving target and expected to move a lot in the next couple of years. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee from Stifel. Your line is open. John Guinee : We\u2019re ready. Well, okay. Couple of one long question. Tom looks to us like your weighted average cost of interest went down from 4.2 to 3.6 as a result of all the tenders you did. What\u2019s to us the back of the envelope is that\u2019s worth about $0.10 a share in FFO growth for 2015 over 2014, is that the right math. And then second is what you are thinking about your dividend policy. And then for Hamid, PLD stock in oil is about 47 bucks a share will be higher in two years. Thomas Olinger : By the way, John, before we answer any of those questions, I just wanted to give credit to keys for doing the best pronunciation of your name ever. So let\u2019s start with that. John Guinee : Yeah. Hamid Moghadam : So on the impact of the various debt tenders that we\u2019ve done, I\u2019d say over the last two years. The impact over on all of that has been about concerns like you said, however, we saw about $0.03 of that come through in our 2013 earnings or another $0.03 in 2014 and it will get about $0.03 to $0.04 to that in 2015. So the 2015 impact is really $0.03 to $0.04. Now, if you isolate only the impact of the tenders and your analysis you\u2019ll get a higher number, but you can\u2019t do that because you need to look at what we did to our overall capital stock. We used to run our lines at over $1 billion drawn at a very low interest rate. We are carrying zero outstanding balance at our line. So it is $0.10 is not the right number, it\u2019s really $0.03 to $0.04 for next year. Gary Anderson : And actually we\u2019ve cashed on the balance sheet which fund the other way in terms of what it contributes. In terms of the - our stock price versus oil, I have no idea other than the fact that in the very long-term both of them are going to be up a lot. And with respect to dividends, which was the other part of your question, by the way pretty good job of asking three questions. But on the dividends, basically our AFFO is growing pretty rapidly and though our dividends is going to grow somewhere in line or lower than AFFO and higher than inflation it\u2019s going to be in that range. So Tom, you wanted to add. Thomas Olinger : Yes, I will just add. Our AFFO growth in 2014 was about 22%. And looking at 2015, we see AFFO growth in line with Core FFO growth surround 11%. And we look at and we have to look at our AFFO with realized gains because that impacts our TI. And when we look at payout ratios, this year our AFFO payout would be about 74% and in 2015, I think, it\u2019s going be probably even a little less than that payout ratio. So we\u2019ll be in the low, somewhere in the low 70s, payout ratio in 2015. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Craig Mailman : Hi, just curious, the average maturity overall lease in this quarter, hope the 15 months relative to previous, I mean, even this comment was it something in particular this quarter, or are you seeing tenants trying to take a longer-term perspective on their space needs? And be aggressiveof the fact one for eachchannel that you guys have a pretty good queue of private capital, wanted to be deployed. May be just comment on what geographies that capital is looking for or may be any changes there, and that\u2019s the hurdles. Where there return hurdles? Gary you have something. Hamid Moghadam : Craig, I\u2019ll take your first question. It\u2019s Eugene. We have now for the last few quarter, we have been aggressively pushing term, with this part of cycle, we are pushing rents and looking for longer-term. Most of you will recall during the downturn we scaled back dramatically and do not want to lock in low rents, so that strategy has been shifting. We have a very, very large sort of quarter-to-quarter change 15 months don\u2019t think of that as a trend. So there is a little that aberration there, but looking at say the trailing four quarters, we\u2019re up about 10% for five months and you\u2019re going to see that continue. So we\u2019re going to continue putting term at least in the U.S. and in Europe it\u2019s probably a different story. Garry has something. Gary Anderson : Craig, I\u2019ll just say that what\u2019s driving it up, obviously the Americas in the U.K we\u2019re about 75 months, that\u2019s typically a longer-term lease market and you\u2019ve got the market that\u2019s in our favor. Obviously this particular quarter we had development leasing at $9 million square feet, which is driving in the quarter-to-quarter up, because the development leasing with high percentage of builder suites are generally longer-term. But that\u2019s offset by what we\u2019re doing in Continental Europe, we\u2019re trying to stay short in Continental Europe, so our average lease term is about 36 months there, plus or minus, because we want to take advantage of the rental growth when it does come through. Hamid Moghadam : In terms of interest and private capital I would say, it\u2019s across the board. And at pretty high levels, I would say comparable to the mid-2000s, because there\u2019s a lot of pent-up demand, these peoples set the market out for long time and not that there\u2019s more liquidity in the markets there investors are back in. If I were going to pick one region, I would say Europe is getting the most interest on the margin. As people view Europe as a place that has some cap rate compression still left. And you know in Europe the appraisals are way behind reality. And most people understand that. So they\u2019re trying to get their money invested based on old price as opposed to new prices that are being paid on the margin. But people really do believe this cap rate compression story and the value being less in the European markets. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Maiorana from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Brendan Maiorana : Thanks, good morning. Tom heard your response to my [indiscernible] question about the development. Stabilization - has an impact in terms of FFO for 2015. If I look at 2014 stabilization, it was only $1.1 billion, which was down from 2013 even though starts, increased, have increased each year from 2011. What cost the stabilizations to be low in 2014 relative to kind of where it starts been in the past couple of years and do you see that risk or swing factor in FFO numbers could be as we look at 2015? Thomas Olinger : Yes, 2013 versus 2014 was a mix issue because a fair bit of the starts that we had in 2013 where in Japan. And the Japan construction cycle is probably more like 18 months to construct and that leads up. So that was the way that kind of over 2013 and the 2014. But going forward, Japan has been - we\u2019ve had a very steady level of development starts 2013, 2014, 2015 in Japan. So I don\u2019t see that swinging at all, and I\u2019d see stabilizations should get closer and closer to our - forgetting average out like we said long-terms start somewhere in the $2.5 billion range. It\u2019s probably going to take us in 2017 until we get that an equal run rate. But for simple map, I would use sort of a two year lag between starts and stabilizations, that\u2019s a good real fund. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tom Catherwood from Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Tom Catherwood : Just thinking about foreign currency here a bit, was wondering what the same store NOI would have been in the fourth quarter and for 2014, inclusive of the negative currency movement and when we think about that [ph] being 89% U.S. dollar net equity. What kind of exposure FFO was you think you have in 2015 as far as base swings in the year or at the end? Thomas Olinger : Yes, I\u2019ll answer your second question first. As far as from a P&L perspective we have virtually zero impacts from any FX movements. We have hedged our estimated euro and yen net earnings for 2015 we hedged the euro at about a 1.20, 1.2 and the Yen at 1.20. So we are really locked in for earnings for 2015. So we\u2019re fully insulated. On an NAV perspective, at 5% move of all of our foreign currencies against us is about $0.25 a share impact on NAV. The other item, yes well the other question was on same-store, we do report same-store on a constant currency basis, so you can see the real impact of what\u2019s happening on the operation side. However, if we look at our same-store impacted by FX, our share would really go up, because we are disproportionably owned in the U.S., so about 75% of our NOI is in dollars. And that relative percentage the U.S. actually becomes a higher percentage, if you FX adjusted because the dollar has strengthened against other currency. So dollar goes up in that scenario, Euro and Yen impact goes down. So when you look at our share, it would actually be more positive on an FX adjusted basis. The other thing since you brought up FX I do want to touch on as we\u2019ve got the question or two around, in our reconciliation of FFO to our net income down to our Core FFO about whether we are backing out the impact of unrealized FX losses. When you look at our operations virtually all of our FX activity around the world goes through our P&L is realized and goes through our FFO. The only thing that would go through unrealized FFO from a - I\u2019m sorry, go through unrealized FX or anything around the derivative. We take those when they are realized. When you look at our P&L that line that says derivative losses in FX adjustments, there\u2019s two things going on to that line, it\u2019s a negative $20 million number that\u2019s getting added back, so a positive $20 million number. That\u2019s made up of a $36 million loss related to the mark-to-market on derivative, our derivative convertible debt security. So that convertible debt matures here in March, we think it\u2019s going to convert into equity is the strike price is $38.72. From a GAAP perspective, we have to mark to fair value of that derivative debt against our share price. So our share price went up in the quarter, we had to recognize a loss related though. That we add back that was $36 million. We actually had about $20 million of FX unrealized gains in the quarter and that all related to our hedges that we have about in place, we have about $1 billion of hedges and those hedges, they are worth about $160 million, none of that $160 million have gains that we\u2019ve realized over the last year since we have those hedges in place went through our P&L, zero. So that should go through our NAV but none of that\u2019s going through our P&L. So everything, the vast majority of all the FX that happens around the world hits our P&L, hits our Core FFO. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Michael Salinsky : Good afternoon guys. You talked about your share of the same-store NOI, can you talk a little bit, may be on your renewal basis kind of what your expectations may be the U.S. and Europe specifically. And then as you look forward to 2015, just given the compression we\u2019ve seen in cap rate, as well as the growth that you realized around the primary markets, domestically in the U.S., where do you see the best growth opportunities domestically? Hamid Moghadam : Okay, I\u2019ll take the first question, just some color on where we would see same-store growth. I\u2019ll talk about it on an owned and managed basis. We would see the U.S. in the mid-five, somewhere next year. Europe and Asia, in the call 1% to 2% range. Now blending that all together when you look at our proportion and ownership that\u2019s how you get something in the mid to high fours for our share of same-store growth next year. Eugene Reilly : And the growth opportunities, if the question is related to where can we sort of push rents, more aggressively I draw your attention to the desktop manual look away with very, very high occupancies. But I want to call two markets that have really been laggards one is Chicago and the other Atlanta. Both of those markets sort of began to turn the corner in 2014. Huge amounts of absorption, and we\u2019re actually seeing very, very strong rent growths in those markets. And for us that\u2019s $50 million square feet of product and in terms of incremental growth in income, I would probably point to those two markets in terms of potential for the future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel from Green Street Advisors. Your line is open. Eric Frankel : Thank you. Hamid or Tom, who has the lower cost of capital. You or the investor in your strategic capital queue. Thomas Olinger : I think our investors in our strategic capital queue have the lower cost of capital for core product. I think we have a lower cost of capital for development activity. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick from Capital One Securities. Your line is open. Tom Lesnick : Thanks, I\u2019ve got a clarification question on the North American Industrial Fund consolidation this quarter. Ownership obviously increased from 42% in 2Q to 63% of 3Q, but it didn\u2019t consolidate, what was the controlled threshold or test a qualified for a consolidation of 4Q that now that ownership is 66%? Thomas Olinger : This is Tom. It relates to the rights that the limited partners had in that fund and in Q4 we got down to just one remaining investor, so it\u2019s ourselves and one investor, and as a result of that the limited partners rights control right went away. That was a triggering event getting down to one investor. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers from Baird. Your line is open. Dave Rodgers : Yes, thanks. Either for Tom or for Mike, you talked lot about development in terms of the third of the starts being build-to-suit. Could you talk geographically where you expect those starts to be? That earlier I missed it. And now along those same lines, can you talk about whether you\u2019re seeing any differential in margin or development yield that would be different, obviously geographically it varies? But any difference that you\u2019re seeing start to emerge given kind of the economic environment out there? And then the second question just to Tom, on the promotes I think you did expect some promotes whether there is some potential this year, but I assume aren\u2019t in guidance can you confirm that? Tom Olinger : Yes, I\u2019ll take the promote question first. In my prepared remarks, I did talk about our guidance does include $0.03 to $0.04 of net promote in 2015, in the fourth quarter of 2015 we have a promote opportunity with our PELP venture or Norges venture in Europe. And again that\u2019s $0.03 to $0.04 that\u2019s in our guidance in Q4 of 2015 and it\u2019s consistent with the level of promote we\u2019ve recognized up in 2013 and 2014 earnings. Michael Curless : And in terms of, this is Mike, in terms of the complex the makeup of the development volume, I think geographically, as Tom mentioned in his remarks, over 95% of the activity is going to take place in our global market where the fundamentals there are really strong call it 97% occupancy in those markets. From a margin perspective, we take the over in terms of our average relative to global markets relative to some of the regional markets we\u2019re doing business in, but it\u2019s not a big appreciable difference and we still think regional markets are very meaningful part of our business. And at the end of the day, build-to-suits ought to about 35% of the total volume and I would point out that 35% of the larger amount of volume this year would be about 25% increase in the build-to-suit volume from last year. We\u2019re very bullish about how that pipeline looks given the amount of LOI\u2019s and signed leases we have in terms of carry over volume already this year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Mike Mueller : Hi, I just wondering Norges, the assets on balance sheet that you can contribute here in Norges JV this year, what are you thinking about that growth 2015? Thomas Olinger : We don\u2019t have a contribution arrangement with Norges on any under assets, with the JV on the series of assets. Actually it\u2019s two JVs, one in the U.S., one in Europe. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citi. Your line is open. Michael Bilerman : Yes, just for follow-ups, just in terms of the equity rates in the quarter, when, just in terms of timing, when were you sort of notified that Norges is going to exercise the warrants? And then also when did you make the decision to tap the ATM and at what price, did you do that? And I get the fact that the convert, this coming will give you more equity in March, but I guess where it starting today relative to your NAV, do you have a desire to tap the ATM further, given where it may have occurred in the fourth quarter? Eugene Reilly : So from a timing perspective, the Norges warrant was exercised in December. And we tapped the ATM program in December. Going back to our plans for 2015, again, it really gets back to acquisition opportunity. So if you strip out acquisitions, our share out of 2015 guidance net, net our deployment generates cash of I think roughly $200 million. So our decision to raise equity will line up with the opportunities we see in the returns that we see with those acquisitions. So that\u2019s how we are looking at it. If we see great opportunities to acquire portfolios, we\u2019ll think about the smartest way to capitalize that. And I think we\u2019ve got a lot of different way to do that, when you think about our liquidity, our ability to tap the equity markets and the substantial equity queue that\u2019s built up in all of our private capital, our strategic capital vehicles. So we got lots of different ways we can fund deployment in acquisition to particular, if we\u2019d like the economics out there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee from Stifel. Your line is open. John Guinee : Just Scott I\u2019m sorry. One of a question is that to imply Tom that you\u2019re help promote this 4Q 2015 that also imply that Norges those from 50% to 80% in that same quarter or those apples and oranges? Thomas Olinger : Yes, those are apples and oranges. We have the ability and this is true and, I think, almost all of our funds where we can earn, we have the opportunity to promote every three years. Fourth quarter of 2015 is the third anniversary of the formation of the PELP venture. Therefore that is the first time, first quarter in which we can earn a promote. Likewise, if you look to 2016 and you can see this in our disclosure or supplemental as we\u2019ve got two other funds, I think, it\u2019s our PELP II fund and [indiscernible] Europe, both are up for promote opportunities in 2016. So we\u2019re going to see a steady stream of promote opportunities over the next several years given as Hamid mentioned our funds are performing about their bench marks. So I would expect if that holds we\u2019re going to see promotes not just in 2015, but continue one. Now the other thing you\u2019re referencing is that the PELP sell down right that we have, but we can sell down our ownership interest down to a 20% interest. That is totally independent of any promote of that\u2019s a separate decision and that\u2019s going to be a function of how we want to deploy our capital globally, that\u2019s going to trigger and what opportunities we have, if and when we trigger that sell down right. Eugene Reilly : It\u2019s also a as long as we think that decision in 10 point increments, it\u2019s not like all or none it\u2019s an 10 point increment and it doesn\u2019t all have to be - that decision doesn\u2019t have to be made in 2015. We have that window coming up every year, so we can sell as much or as little as we want whenever we want pretty much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel from Green Street Advisors. Your line is open. Eric Frankel : Thank you. I want to talk about U.S. property values a little bit. Could you talk about the composition of the property sold during the quarter, I think, the weighted average stabilized cap rate at the lowest I\u2019ve seen in awhile. I know that you guys have some unique properties you sold the south part of the Bay Area that where probably is going to be likely converted a couple of years. So I\u2019d like to understand as to where property value thinks our cap rate might have moved? Eugene Reilly : I would say this we have a one property that would fall under the description of unusual in terms of unusual good, in terms of Bay Area with an upside potential. But the vast majority of our sales actually in the last couple of years have been non-strategic properties in smaller markets from the bottom of our portfolio. So with the exception of that one deal in Silicon Valley, the rest of it would be non-strategic sales. So on average it would be lower than median of our properties, probably a lot lower than the median of our properties. Eric, bottom line is the price stock on industrial cap rates in the U.S. are in the low fours on the very best markets. And in the low fives for most markets, I\u2019m talking about brand new great product in the markets everybody wants to be in with a good credit tenant. And I would say low fives in most markets and sixes, six pluses and six, six and halves in some of the less strategic markets. I\u2019m not sure, we deploy capital at those kinds of numbers in fact we won\u2019t, but that\u2019s where the market is. Operator : Your last question comes from that line of Jamie Feldman from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Jamie Feldman : Thanks, Hamid. I guess can you walk through where you think cap rates are for Europe along the same lines what you just did for the U.S.? Hamid Moghadam : Sure. London and the Southeast would be four, Midland\u2019s would be low fives, Southern Europe would be six and half to seven, with an aero down by the way on that one, Germany would be in the low fives, same with the rest of Northern Europe. What am I leaving out? Gary Anderson : Eastern Europe. Hamid Moghadam : Definitely in Eastern Europe would be six and half. Operator : There are no further\u2026 Hamid Moghadam : And I\u2019m sorry, just a complete the global, since we talked about everywhere else. I think Japan is low fives hitting high fours and within the J-REIT structure it\u2019s actually trading in high threes. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the presenters. Hamid Moghadam : Right, thank you everyone for being here, I know how you are battling to storm back ease all the best to you in dealing with that. I look forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Kim and I\u2019ll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Prologis First Quarter Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Tracy Ward, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Tracy Ward : Thank you, Kim. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Prologis conference call. If you have not yet downloaded the press releases or acquisition presentation related to this call, they are available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. This morning, you will hear from Hamid Moghadam, our Chairman and CEO; Gene Reilly, our CEO of the Americas; Tom Olinger, our CFO; and also joining us for the call today are Gary Anderson, Mike Curless, Ed Nekritz, and Diana Scott. After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll host a question-and-answer session. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I\u2019d like to state that this call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, and projection about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates, as well as management\u2019s beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance, and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings. Additionally, our first quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures, such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures and in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. As is our custom, after our prepared remarks, we will please ask you to limit your question to one. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom, who will begin with the highlights from our earnings from the first quarter. Tom Olinger : Thanks, Tracy. Good morning. As you\u2019ve seen from our earnings press release, we had a very strong start to the year. Core FFO was $0.49 per share, an increase of 14% over the same period last year. Occupancy at quarter end was 95.9%. Leasing volume was very good, and as a result, we saw a lower than normal seasonal dip in first quarter occupancy. GAAP rent change on rollover was 9.7%, positive across all regions, and led by the U.S. at 15.1%. Cash rent change on rollover for the quarter was 3.3%. GAAP same store NOI increased 3.5% on an owned-and-managed basis, and 3.7% on an our-share basis. CAM true-ups negatively impacted same store NOI by about 50 basis points in the quarter; however, this is isolated to Q1 and will not impact our same store NOI run rate for the remainder of the year. Given the momentum and occupancy in rent change, we feel confident about same store NOI and are increasing the midpoint and narrowing the range on a GAAP owned-and-managed basis to 3.75% to 4.5%, with our share expected to be 50 basis points to 100 basis points higher. On the capital deployment front, starts and acquisitions totaled $421 million, while dispositions and contributions were $494 million. The weighted average stabilized cap rate on dispositions and contributions was 3.6%, which includes the previously announced value-added conversion sale on a 56-acre industrial park to Facebook. Turning to capital markets, we converted $460 million of convertible debt to equity during the quarter, helping drive down leverage, which was 34.4% at quarter end. Debt to adjusted EBITDA, including realized gains, improved to 5.8 times and to 6.4 times without gains. We also continue to have significant liquidity with $2.8 billion at quarter end. Our USD net equity increased to 91% from 89% last quarter. Looking further at foreign currency, we continued our efforts to mitigate the impact on both NAV and earnings. Notably, we\u2019ve now fully hedged our estimated sterling, euro, and yen earnings for both 2015 and 2016. As a result, movements in these currencies will have no impact on our estimated Core FFO throughout next year. Let\u2019s turn to 2015 guidance, which does not reflect any impact of the KTR transaction, as we\u2019ll discuss this separately in a moment. We have included guidance in our press release and supplemental, so I\u2019ll focus only on significant changes from last quarter. Starting with deployment, we\u2019re increasing our disposition range to between $2.1 billion and $2.5 billion with activity coming from non-strategic asset sales in Europe and the U.S., and we\u2019re increasing our share of contributions to co-investment ventures to 65%. As a result, we now expect to fully fund our 2015 deployment activity through capital recycling. In addition, we\u2019re increasing the range of realized development gains to between $250 million and $300 million for the year. Putting this all together, we are increasing the midpoint and narrowing our 2015 core FFO to a range between $2.07 and $2.13 per share. This represents year-over-year growth to 12% or an increase of $0.22 at the midpoint. This is on top of the 14% growth we had in 2014. Again, our 2015 guidance here does not reflect any impact from the KTR transaction. Our existing portfolio continues to benefit from strong operating fundamentals and we\u2019re well positioned to deploy capital at favorable returns. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Hamid to discuss the KTR transaction. Hamid Moghadam : Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your joining us today to discuss this exciting transaction. Yesterday, we announced the signing of definitive agreements to acquire KTR\u2019s $5.9 billion business at a stabilized cap rate of 5.5% and in line with replacement costs. The transaction is summarized on page three of the presentation. The portfolio comprises of all of KTR\u2019s funds and will be acquired by our consolidated joint venture with Norges Bank. As we\u2019ve discussed on previous occasions, we\u2019re interested in acquiring stabilized assets in the U.S. only when we see a strong alignment in quality and location with our own holdings and when we bring significant competitive advantage to the table. This transaction is an excellent example of these principles in action. First, it\u2019s rare to find a portfolio that aligns so perfectly in terms of asset quality, customer profile, and market composition with our own. We believe this synergy enables us to add immediate value through leasing and portfolio operations. Second, we worked hard to position our balance sheet and our institutional capital relationships to pursue significant investment opportunities such as this as they arise. And third, our OP unit structure, the attractiveness of our currency, and our ability to execute reliably and expeditiously give us an important edge on large, complex portfolios, as evidenced in both the KTR and Morris transactions. Let me add that I\u2019ve known the KTR leadership team for 15 years and have always considered them to be knowledgeable investors and among the most astute competitors in the U.S. industrial market. I would now like to walk you through the strategic rationale for the transaction, which is summarized on page four of the presentation. First, the portfolio strengthens our U.S. presence with highly complementary assets, representing a 95% overlap with our existing U.S. operating portfolio. Second, the acquisition presents a rare opportunity to deliver immediate accretion to our shareholders as we build an even stronger platform for sustainable growth. Third, this transaction advances our important partnership with Norges. Specifically, it will expand the assets under management of the USLV venture by 6x to $7 billion and grows our partnership with this leading investor to more than $11 billion of assets on two continents. And fourth, this acquisition expands relationships with our current customers and establishes some important new ones. It also adds to our development pipeline, driving incremental NOI growth as we lease up these properties. With that, let me turn it over to Gene to walk you through the details of the portfolio. Gene Reilly : Thanks, Hamid. Please turn to page five of the presentation deck and I\u2019ll start with some background on KTR for those of you who are not as familiar with them. KTR Capital Partners is an investment development and operating company focused exclusively on U.S. industrial real estate since its founding in 2004. The company is a significant player in the sector and would actually rank second among public companies here excluding Prologis. KTR\u2019s investment strategy has been very similar to ours throughout its history. They've been our toughest U.S. competitor over the years and have consequently constructed a portfolio that is an extremely good fit for Prologis. The real estate assets include three categories. First, a 60-million square foot operating portfolio of very high quality assets located throughout the U.S., with over 70% focused in LA, New Jersey, Chicago, South Florida, Seattle, and Dallas. 87% of the assets are located in global markets, and as Hamid noted 95% are located where we currently operate real estate leading to the terrific operating synergies we\u2019ll have here going forward. Second, there are eight well conceived development projects totaling 3.6 million square feet, two-thirds of which are located in California. 50% of the development will be delivered at or near shale completion at closing and the remainder will be shale complete before year-end. And finally 438 acres of land capable of supporting 6.8 million square feet in nine markets, all of which appeal the targets and places in which our land bank needs to be restocked. While the development portfolio and land complement our strategy and meet current needs combine they represent less than 6% of the transaction and our percentage of non-income producing assets actually declined post closing. Turning to page 6, this really speaks for itself in terms of depicting the common market selection preferences between the two firms and the clear operating synergies of this combined portfolio. Turning to page 7 and 8, we described the effect of the acquisition on the Prologis U.S. and global portfolio metrics. Key takeaways here are as follows, obviously a very well aligned portfolio, as compared to ours. The KTR portfolio is slightly younger with a longer remaining lease terms. The portfolio is also under leased at 89% occupancy currently. We are highly confident in our ability to bring this occupancy in-line with the rest of our U.S. portfolio within 12 months. We are active in these markets, know all of these assets and actually look forward to taking this on in the current operating environment. This gap by the way represents about two or three weeks of normal leasing volume for us in the U.S. Finally, U.S. equity is up significantly on top of a nice quarterly improvement in the metric pre-acquisition and finally turning to page 9 from the customer perspective the addition of this portfolio will expand relationships with over 150 multi-market customers that today lease space from both firms. Like Prologis KTS a sophisticated customer outreach strives to develop strategic, not purely transactional relationships with the customers and their roaster. And with that I am going to turn it over to Tom to discuss capitalizing and transaction. Tom Olinger : Thanks Gene. I will continue on page 10 of the presentation. While this transaction provides immediate accretion to core FFO and to cash flow it also has other significant financial benefits. First the acquisition will increase our share of U.S. dollar investments. Our U.S. dollar net equity post the KTR transaction will increase to 93%. As Dean mentioned, we can efficiently integrate these assets and as a result we expect to lower G&A as a percentage of AUM by about 12%. Let\u2019s move to slide 11 to discuss how we plan to finance the transaction. We are committed to maintaining a very strong balance sheet with significant liquidity. This transaction has proof of why a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity is a strategic advantage. Longer term we will finance the transaction at line with our capital strategy, which includes both debt and equity on a leverage neutral basis. In the interim we have many different options to fund the transaction and it\u2019s important to remember we\u2019ve already financed 45% of the deal through USLV. Let\u2019s look at the book ends of our options. On the asset side, this includes incremental dispositions of non-strategic assets and fund contributions in addition to the potential sell down of our interest in PELP, our European venture with Norges. If we assume funding the transaction using a mix of accelerated dispositions of non-strategic assets contributions and sell down of fund interest, the annual stabilized core FFO accretion would be about 5% or $0.11 per share with year-end leverage of about 35%. On the debt side, we have significant availability on our line and capacity for more unsecured and secured debt. We have also obtained a commitment for a bridge loan from Morgan Stanley for up to $1 billion to ensure we continue maintaining significant liquidity regardless of how we elect to fund this over the near term. If we assume we fund the entire transaction with long term debt, the annual stabilized core FFO accretion would be about 9% or $0.18 a share with year-end leverage of about 38%. We also have a 750 million ATM program in place. Regardless of the various combination of capital in the interim over the long term, we will fund this on a leverage neutral basis. We will provide more information on financing plans at the appropriate time.  Turning to accretion on slide 12, on a leverage neutral basis we expect the transaction to deliver accretion of $0.14 on an annual stabilized basis. We expect to hit this annual stabilized run rate in mid-2016. This represents about 7% growth over the mid-point of a revised 2015 guidance. When you consider our net deployment for the rest of the year, including funding this transaction on a leverage neutral basis, our leverage at year-end would decline to approximately 33%. From a cash flow or AFFO perspective we expect growth in-line with core FFO. The impact of this transaction on 2015 core FFO will vary based on the closing date of the deal and how we finance this in the short term. However, assuming we close in June and fund initially on our leverage neutral basis 2015 core FFO accretion would be approximately $0.05 a share. To wrap-up on page 13, we are very excited about this transaction as it meets all of our strategic objectives. It is very high quality and consistent with our long-term investment strategy, provides significant accretion to core FFO and cash flows on a leverage neutral basis, increases our U.S. dollar net equity, lowers G&A as a percentage of AUM, and expands our relationship with Norges Bank. With that I will turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instruction] And your first question comes from the line of George Auerbach from Credit Suisse, your line is open. George Auerbach : Thanks. Good morning. Tom, just a few questions to help us in the street models. First, the deck noted it's a 5.5% stabilized cap rate. Can you comment on the cash yield today? Second, maybe for Gene, the 89% occupancy, where is the vacancy in the portfolio, just to help us think through just how fast you\u2019ll lease that up? And three, Tom, the $0.14 of accretion to core FFO, is that a GAAP number or a cash number? Gene Reilly : I\u2019ll start \u2013 go ahead. Tom Olinger : Gene will start and I will answer the last question. Gene Reilly : Yes, George I\u2019m going to start with the leasing. So, one of the things, first of all the vacancy is actually distributed pretty much throughout the portfolio, so we don\u2019t have pockets of vacancy. We have a couple of large buildings but nothing worth pointing out. One thing I didn\u2019t mention in the prepared remarks, we have leases signed that haven\u2019t yet commenced or leases out for about 240 basis points of occupancy right now. So, we hit - the timing just happens that it\u2019s 89%, but actually we are going to start quite a bit higher than that and as I said we are not concerned about getting this amount. So, your first question was related to cash yields and I don\u2019t know Tom you probably want to talk that one. Tom Olinger : Well George I\u2019ll answer your question on $0.14 a share that is a GAAP measure and that includes about $0.02 to $0.03 of non-cash items, which would include any impact on resetting straight line rent, any impact on resetting lease mark-to-market, as well as debt mark-to-market. So, again the $0.14 is on a GAAP basis includes $0.02 to $0.03 of non-cash items and when you think about what the impact on AFFO is, we think the AFFO growth from this transaction will be right in line with our core FFO growth. So, any of the scenarios I talked about you should consider AFFO growing in line with that \u2013 those growth rates. Hamid Moghadam : Yes, let me answer George\u2019s first question. George, if you stabilize the portfolio to 95%, which is in line, actually a little bit lower than our existing portfolio that\u2019s when you get to your 5.5%, at the current 89%, you are at 5.2%. So, I think that\u2019s the number you were looking for. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citigroup, your line is open. Manny Korchman : Hey, guys. Manny Korchman here with Michael. If we just think about the value that you ascribe to the operating platform and Jeff and his Team, is there a non-compete there? Can you help us think about those two topics when you approach this transaction? Hamid Moghadam : Sure, I mean the operating platform, you can approach its value from two places. One is, how would the market value this and there are fair number of comps for investment management organizations. Their EBITDA round numbers was in the mid-to-high $20 million range and at 2.30 that works out to a little under a nine multiple on EBITDA. On our side, from our point of view, given the synergies that we have on the overhead side and the arrangements we have on the investment management side, our EBITDA is actually \u2013 going to be a little bit higher than that in terms of synergies. So the multiple to us would be a little bit lower than it would be to the upside market. So, depending on which of those two measures you want to look at, somewhere between a seven and a nine multiple on EBITDA. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Specter from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Jamie Feldman : Good morning. This is Jamie Feldman here with Jeff. If I could just ask a follow-up to the prior question and then I'll ask my question. The follow-up being, what are the synergies? And do you expect to maintain a lot of the KTR staff and platform? And then my actual question is just following up with Tom on slide 11, can you talk us through the magnitude of some of these financing options? Getting a lot of questions about how much equity you'd actually need. And then also thinking about maybe the PELP ownership or some of the other things you could have prefunded, what was the thought on not having all the financing in place at this point? Gene Reilly : So Jamie, it\u2019s Gene. I will answer your first question. So, we have the opportunity to recruit talent from this team and we certainly hope to hire a number of people. We are taking on 60 million square feet here. As you know, we manage our real estate in-house with an in-house property management team. KTR, also ran their business in an integrated model.  And you know, frankly, besides sharing an investment strategy that was pretty much in common with Prologis, their approach of running the business was also very similar. I think they have some of the best people in the business. And they work within a platform that treats customers the same way and approaches the brokerage community and the broader real estate community in the same way. So that is very attractive for us. So we certainly will be taking on a number of their people, primarily in property management roles in terms of numbers, but also some of their investment folks as well. Hamid Moghadam : Yeah. Just to be clear, I think in the past you have heard us say that we can take between $10 billion to $20 billion of incremental assets in our markets without any increase in G&A. This transaction is totally consistent with that, notwithstanding what Gene said, which are those additions are on the property management leasing side which are attributable at the property level and are already factored into the cap rate and all the things we just talked about. In terms of the bottom line G&A of the company, we anticipate no change. And in fact, having gone through this exercise now, we are even more convinced that we can take on maybe $10 billion or $15 billion more of assets, again without a commensurate or without any increase in the below the line G&A. Tom Olinger : And Jamie, this is Tom. I'll answer your question. First on being prepared, we have been getting prepared for a transaction like this for the last four years and getting our balance sheet to where it is with high liquidity, low leverage, strong cash flows. I'll walk you through some of the assumptions on the different scenarios.  So first on the leverage neutral scenario, where earnings were $0.14 on a leverage neutral basis, so what we are assuming there is equity of approximately $1.7 billion, so that would include the units of $230 million and the balance of common equity. So call it $1.5 billion. About $1 billion dollars of debt. About $400 million which is assumed, so incremental new debt of about $600 million. And then we've got a combination of other assets, which is cash, and some other liquid assets plus some additional asset sales of about $500 million. So those are the three components that get you to our share of the funding of $3.2 billion.  Again 1.7 of equity, $1.5 billion which is common, a $1 billion of debt and about $500 million of other assets. That takes our leverage in combination with our deployment guidance for the full year, without KTR, all of that in combination gets us to LTV of about 33% at year end. The asset sales scenario we talked about simply replaces that $1.5 billion of common equity, with a combination of asset sales and fund contributions and sell downs of interests. So the debt component's exactly the same. That results in earnings accretion of about $0.11 a share and we end up with leverage at the end of the year of about 35%. The last scenario is if we fund this transaction all with debt and that scenario is $0.18 of accretion, and we would end up the year at leverage around 38%. So we feel really good about our ability to fund this in a variety of different ways. And our leverage in all of these scenarios continues to be very good even in the fully debt scenario. So we feel good about where our balance sheet is, we feel really good about our liquidity through any of these various iterations, and we feel good about our rating as a very solid BBB+ BAA1 company. Hamid Moghadam : I would like to add one more thing. A couple of years ago, we did our first joint venture with Norges in Europe, basically recapitalizing pepper and some other assets in Europe. And at that time, you may recall that we did it on a break-even cost basis about an 8 cap. And the reason we retained a 50% interest is that we were confident that there would be some value appreciation in that portfolio and we negotiated the right to sell up to 30% of that venture down to 20%. Well in the interim two years, cap rates have in that portfolio, compressed from 8 to about 6.4 as of the end of the year. We believe that those cap rates will continue to compress just based on real-time transactions in Europe to probably 6 or a little bit under. And that is a negotiated right that at any time we can basically pull that lever, and generate a $1.1 billion of capital to fund this or any other activities we might have. So to think of it as a built-in equity issuance out there that we can always use, we have great optionality there to fund our business. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Gabriel Hilmoe from Evercore. Your line is open. Gabriel Hilmoe : On the 5.5 stabilized cap rate, does that include all the current developments in process as well as the land being built out? If not where does the yield move to assuming those are built out and stabilize? And then just one for Gene, as far as market rents, where is the KTR portfolio relative to market today? Gene Reilly : So let me take your last one first. We think that their portfolio is under rented pretty much in the same neighborhood as our U.S., so call it 10% under rented. Relative to the yields, the numbers we gave you were for the operating portfolio. If you add the development portfolio, those yields go up a little bit, as you can imagine, because we have a margin in there. But it is such a small component, you are talking about basis points. And the land is priced as we would buy land okay? So when that is put into production, again that is going to push the yield. But it is $90 million of land and that, again, is basis points. Tom Olinger : Yeah, the projected value add on the development portfolio is about 7%. Now, remember the development portfolio is almost all under construction and in various stages of being completed, so a lot of the risk has been taken out of it. And but there is still a pretty good spread of 7%, between it and its retail value. Operator : And your next question comes from Ross Nussbaum from UBS. Your line is open. Ross Nussbaum : Hey guys, a couple of part question on the fee side. Tom, first, of the $0.35 to $0.37 of accretion that that you talked about that was NOI plus fees, how much of that was fee income? And then the second question I have was, you are buying I guess the KTR platform here. What's just simply buying the assets and not paying the $230 million for the platform just simply not an option in this deal structure? Tom Olinger : I\u2019ll take the first question. On the incremental fees, it\u2019s about - it\u2019s between $0.02 and $0.03 is the incremental fees in that caption on page 12. Gene Reilly : And it\u2019s Gene, I\u2019ll take the second one. First of all, no, that was not an option. And second of all, we wanted it. We are getting benefits out of this we\u2019ve already described and there is a lot of intangible benefits as well that come along with this, mostly in their people, reputation, brand in the industry. As we said, this is a tough competitor who we think is really, really good. Operator : And your next question comes from Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is open. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. Just a couple of quick questions. I'm not sure if I missed it, but what is the total value of the plus CIp? And second question going to the equity portion for funding for this deal, I mean, about a $1 billion to do right? Your stock, I have a trading around 10% discount to NAV. Just curious to know what is your thinking process in terms of timing? Like you know, is it within a couple of years? Maybe slightly I don't want to say agnostic to the pricing but is $42, $43 a share is that in the range where you would commit to that equity neutral statement? Or is it longer term where you want your stock price to be closer to NAV before you actually pursue a equity or leverage neutral transaction like this? And maybe tied to that you know I thought the whole point of having a low levered balance sheet was not to maintain that low leverage but was actually to use it and maybe take leverage up for a deal like this. So curious why you even have to keep it leverage neutral. Thanks. Hamid Moghadam : Okay, those are all good questions. So let me take them one at a time. The land bank is $90 million of the total deal and the construction in progress is $260 million of the whole deal. Secondly, in terms of how we think about equity, first of all, it would be really unfair and, and misleading if we reported the accretion of this deal on a levered up to 38% basis using debt which is something we can do, but some of that benefit $0.04 of that benefit would come from levering up and we can lever up anything and generate that. So really we chose to describe the transaction on a leverage neutral basis and that leverage neutral level is pretty consistent with our goals, because remember this company is still driving towards a single A rating and we are committed to that. In terms of the level of equity that we need to generate, actually to do it perfectly on a leverage neutral basis if we were doing nothing else the number is about $1.5 billion and we are issuing about a little over $200 million of OP units to the seller. So the number is $1.5 billion. When we would do that totally depends. We are going to be opportunistic. We know what the value of our properties are and we are in no rush. As you heard from Tom, we have multiple ways and multiple levers to pull in terms of financing this transaction. And hopefully we'll be thoughtful about when we take advantage of the equity markets. But we don't need to do it today, tomorrow or even six months from now. We have plenty of runway to do that but we will equitize this transaction. Operator : Your next question comes from Blaine Heck from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Blaine Heck : Follow up on that last one. Can you tell us where the $44.91 share price for the OP units issued to KTR came from? And then maybe can you comment on the timing of the deal at this point in the cycle versus maybe investing more in Europe where you guys have said that value seemed to be accelerating a little bit more? Hamid Moghadam : So in terms of $44.81, our deal was the stock price for the 20 trailing days of trading with a floor of consensus NAV which on the day that we shook hands was $44.81. So that\u2019s where that came from. So actually consensus NAV is higher than that now, but it happened to be that on that date. In terms of, what was the other question? Blaine Heck : Timing of the deal, why this is opposed to Europe? Hamid Moghadam : Well, we are doing both. I mean this is, we can't exactly time strategic transactions like this and we can't plan for them. So, and as you know, we are not in the business of buying a lot of companies. Because frankly, every time we look at a portfolio, we realize that there is no fit between it and our business. And if we want to buy something we usually have to go through I don't know selling half of it, so it is pretty complicated. This is the one portfolio that has almost a perfect match with our own holdings, so we have been very excited about it because of these synergies.  And that doesn't mean that we are not active in Europe, we continue to be pretty active in Europe and we have a good capital recycling model with our funds that adequately capitalizes our development business in Europe. And we did a lot of acquisitions in Europe in the last 24 months before the pricing really started tightening up. Pricing is tightening up. We think there is more room on the cap rates, but there has been 100 basis points to 150 basis points of cap rate compression in Europe since we started investing there in this cycle. There is probably another 50 basis points to 75 basis points left and we'll be opportunistic to take advantage of those deals as well. So it is not an either or. We just can't plan on transactions like this. Operator : Your next question comes from Craig Mailman from KeyBanc. Your line is open. Jordan Sadler : Good morning. It\u2019s Jordan Sadler with Craig. My question is something a follow-up on that last question. I guess based on the commentary we've heard from you most recently, I think we would have felt that you have thought that the U.S. was longer in the tooth as it relates to the stage of the rental rate growth cycle, and as it relates to where cap rates are, evaluations are, whereas there seem to be more room or upside in Europe. And so I guess this transaction comes as a little bit of a surprise in that you seem to be buying the U.S. here. So is there anything that's changed relative to maybe the comments in February and March? Hamid Moghadam : So I think at one of the conferences, somebody asked me where we are in the cycle of what inning we are in. And I think specifically about the U.S., I answered the question that we are in the eighth or ninth inning on the cap rates. And by the way, I have been wrong about that for the last two to three years. Cap rates have continued to compress. But we think cap rates are pretty much there. We said that we are in about the fifth or sixth inning of market rents recovering. And as you know, for the last three years, we have been talking about the market rent recovery and actually had some pretty specific projections that we shared with you which, to be honest with you, were controversial at the time but turned out to be really correct and in fact, a little understating the rental recovery. And most importantly, in terms of rents in the portfolio, we are in the second maybe third inning. Because these market rents have only started escalating in the last two to three years and it takes awhile before all these things are all through the portfolio. So really, the attractiveness of this portfolio, in addition to its fit, is the opportunity to capture some of those rents as we work our way through the portfolio. Europe, just to be clear, has had cap rate compression, significant cap rate compression, very consistent with the way we call it. The rental upside in Europe will be less, because the rental declines in Europe were less during the downturn, so we think we are in the early stages of rental recovery in Europe, probably in the first or second inning of the rental recovery, other than the UK. The UK is very use-like. But most of Europe is in the early stages of rental recovery and the real story in the short term in Europe is cap rate compression. So they are flipped, Europe is cap rate compression, modest rent recovery. U.S. probably not a lot more cap rate compression but pretty robust rental growth. There is also one other thing I would like to say, because it's really important. We all sit around and throw around cap rates, because they are just really easy things for people to discuss. But there is an underlying quality and the ability of the portfolio to generate same store growth over time. You are seeing that in the Prologis portfolio today. We have worked hard to prune our portfolio down to the key global market and you are seeing that our U.S. rent change this quarter was 15%, up with that up against anybody else\u2019s numbers, and the KTR strategy is very consistent with the Prologis strategy. So, we think these high quality portfolios will outperform in terms of same store NOI growth over time and frankly to buy another portfolio and there have been portfolios for sale for another 40 basis points on the cap rate and giving up just upside we don\u2019t think it\u2019s too wise even though it sounds like a better cap rate. That\u2019s how we think about it. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel from Green Street Advisors. Your line is open. Eric Frankel : I was hoping you'd comment on these types of deals and how you view your development platform franchise? I see, you guys, you talked about in the past, you guys have ascribe a lot of value to it, so I just wonder, if you think about dilution, when you think about these larger types of deals, especially relative to your cost of capital now, which we will argue is not particularly strong. Thank you. Tom Olinger : Well it\u2019s all a big circle isn\u2019t it. I mean, yeah we do think our development business has value. We have done everything we can, you know last two to three years to show its ability to generate profits and that continues and we\u2019ve talked about maybe getting your 5% or 6% multiple, 5 times or 6 times multiple on those sustainable development gains, but we are not getting it and all the NAVs that people throw around are exclusive of that development platform. Some people are beginning to give us a little bit of credit for that, maybe on the order of $0.50 or $1 a share, but certainly not on the order of $3 to $4 a share, which has six multiple on those earnings would imply. So, and the reason our cost to capital is in your view not very attractive is because we are not getting full credit for that development business. Now with this transaction, we really are reducing the percentage of the company always that has non-income producing asset because this is a large portfolio operating asset and actually the other thing we are doing is actually cranking up their percentage of assets in the U.S. and those two things over time should make this debate about the development, the value of the development business less important as the value of the operating \u2013 as the size of the operating portfolio gets bigger and bigger because our development business is not going to get proportionally bigger, but the underlying operating portfolio will continue to grow. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Vincent Chao : Hi, everyone. Just wanted to see if we could get some more color on just the background of this deal, obviously, you've been working with these guys, or aware of them, dealing with them for a long time. But just curious about the timing, and maybe coincides with the cycle question, but why now? And maybe the decision to bring Norges in, were they the driver behind this? Or did you consider this for the wholly-owned portfolio at all? Tom Olinger : Yes, Gene. Gene Reilly : Yes, I think - first of all Norges wasn\u2019t the driver of this. I think it was pretty well known that KTR was exploring opportunities for its first two funds kind of throughout last year and we are aware that engage in dialogue and took into a bit of different direction, but as you said we\u2019ve known these guys for a long time, and we\u2019ve competed against this business for a long time. We always have respected how they do things, and we like to real estate. So this naturally went in the direction of basically buying the entire business. Once that was solidified, then Norges came into the transaction, but they didn't drive the deal. Tom Olinger : Yes, our understanding was that the alternatives they we\u2019re looking at and you would have to ask them about it, but primarily was focused on recapping the first two funds and continuing the investment of fund three, as we understand it. Also, the other alternatives probably did not include attractive currency like we have, that would be desirable to certain of the investors. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of John Guinee from Stifel. Your line is open. John Guinee : Hi Tom, and I guess your team there, I\u2019m sure you have done a lot of forward NAV numbers and if you hold your cap rates fixed is this going to end up being a value creative or value destructive two or three years down the road. Tom Olinger : This deal as Hamid talked about will be value creative for sure. When you look at the growth potential of this portfolio, and its fit, the efficiencies in which we can integrate this portfolio, I think those two things alone will create a lot of value over the next several years. And notwithstanding the immediate accretion of this deal, most importantly on a cash flow basis. We talked about the $0.14 of earnings and there is about $0.02 to $0.3 estimate in there of noncash items, but our AFFO should grow toe-to-toe with core FFO. So, I think there is value creation all around this thing whether you want to take an earnings cut, or a quality slice, a growth cut, we are very excited about the upside here. Gene Reilly : John, let me give you a couple of numbers so you get a sense for this. This portfolio, once you look at the operating assets, is about $92.50 a foot. And if you look at the U.S. portfolio that Prologis has, it's a little over $82 a square foot. So there is about a 12% difference in terms of price per foot between these two portfolios. But there is a 15% rent difference between the portfolios. In other words, this transaction, average rent market rent is $547 and the Prologis portfolio prior to this deal is $4.73. So 12% more price per foot, 15% more in rent. So, in terms of metrics, it's very comparable and actually attractive, compared to our portfolio. Now, why is it a little more expensive and higher rent? Well, because it has, the Prologis portfolio is about 50% focused on the top five markets, and this portfolio is about 56% focused in those markets. So slightly higher concentration in the bigger markets, and longer average lease terms. The average lease term in this portfolio is about six and change, and our portfolio, before this deal is about four. And finally, in terms of age, the Prologis portfolio is about 20 years, 21 years, this is about 17 years. So on a couple of parameters, mix of market, age, and duration of leases, if you adjust for it, you can very quickly get to the same evaluation and the rents lineup exactly with that. Now, why did I take you through all this? Because we are a big believer on rental growth in the Prologis portfolio absent this. Remember, last year we grew our earnings and the leverage by 14%, our FFO per share. This year at the mid-point we are growing our earnings even before this deal at 12% per share, again with neutral or slightly declining leverage. And this transaction adds another 7% on top of that, when fully equitized. So obviously those are pretty good numbers. And to have more of the kind of the real estate aligned with ours that can produce those kinds of growth numbers we think is a pretty attractive proposition. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sumit Sharma : Sumit Sharma for Vance Edelson. Most of our questions have been asked. But I guess what I'm wondering is, is there any part of the portfolio that you would consider noncore or something that you would sell immediately? And also, going back to your question on pricing, I guess this particular deal changes the competitive landscape of \u2013 at least from an e-commerce fulfillment category because I see that one of the most telling charts is slide 9, which has Amazon shooting up like crazy. The question really is, having picked up one of the top three e-commerce fulfillment center developers, are you seeing higher pricing power as part of the revenue synergy eventually? Or if not, what else is there driving up the revenues? Tom Olinger : Yes, let me just address the question about Amazon, and Gene can talk about the other part of your question. I wouldn't exactly use the words shooting up. Amazon when it is fully shot up is 2.4% of our global rent roll. So it\u2019s an important customer, but our rent rolls are very, very diversified across different players. Gene, do you want --? Gene Reilly : Yes, so your last question, which is a good one is did we factor in any sort of competitive advantage in pricing power with Amazon or other ecommerce? No, we did not do that. Having said that, that\u2019s kind of part of the platform. KTR has probably the best relationship with that particular company on the build-to-suit than anybody and we\u2019ve done a lot of business with Amazon ourselves, by the way. So, what was the first question? Yes, sales, sales. So there is a, an immediate sale portfolio and immediate probably means the next couple of years, 4% to 5%. It is small, and basically, it\u2019s kind of flex the assets in south Florida, some in California. But it\u2019s very, very, very small. Operator : And you next question comes from the line of Mike Salinsky from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Neil Malkin : Hi, this is Neil Malkin, I\u2019m with Mike. A couple of questions. On the KTR, portfolio you guys cited a good amount of vacancy that you can lease up. Just wondering how you factored in the fact that you can get to 600 basis points, 700 basis points of occupancy increase within a year, KTR was an astute operator? And then also are the prop 13 resets and the occupancy growth, are all those things factored into that 5-5 stabilized yield? Gene Reilly : Yes. Let me take the first one. So KTR is a very astute operator. But they are also a private equity investor with finite live funds and I can tell you they don\u2019t manage the occupancy, they manage the value. And you should call them up and ask them, what they focus on. Our approach is more balanced. But frankly, to move this, we have 250 basis points pretty much in the bank. This is like a couple of weeks of leasing. I\u2019m really not that concerned with it. So we can maybe go into that in more detail. But our teams are the best leasing teams in the country, and I think that our stats speak for themselves. As to your other question, do we have everything baked into the stabilized returns? Yes. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citigroup. Your line is open. Michael Bilerman : Yes, I just had two questions. One was, Tom, I think you mentioned $1.7 billion of equity and I\u2019m just curious, if you think about 85% leverage, call it, 6.5 times debt to EBITDA that is an equity commitment closer to $2 billion to $2.1 billion, so I wasn\u2019t sure if I heard the $1.7 billion wrong. And the second question was just related to earnings. You took up your current 2015 guidance $0.2 at the midpoint, and I was wondering if you can walk through the drivers of that increase, because anything you start thinking about the changes it would seem more that it\u2019s tilted down because you are selling a lot more assets, contributing more, you have lower strategic capital revenue, you have slightly higher acquisitions and slightly higher same store, but I would argue the dispositions and the lower strategic capital revenue would have offset both of those. Tom Olinger : Okay, Michael, I\u2019ll take both of those. On your first question the stock, when we talk about the $0.14 of earnings and leverage neutral, that assumes 1.5 billion of common stock and 230 million of units, so $1.7 billion in total. And that relationship, when you also consider the debt we are issuing and the $500 million of other assets, so there is cash in that number of other assets. There are some other assets that we are utilizing. So that is a perfect 65%-35% equity debt split, which is debt in line with where our leverage was at the end of the quarter. We ended leverage at the end of the quarter at 34.4%. So that is the equity number that is needed $1.7 billion all in with the units that keep us in our quarter relationship. Your other question about Q1 earnings, and thank you for asking a question about Q1 earnings. We got them out early. Yes, we are up $0.2 at the midpoint and that is really driven by operations. Yes, we did have some deployment move around, we increased our dispositions, but that was a fairly wide range that we gave you initially and we tightened that up. But when you look at the year the increase, the midpoint of $0.2, it\u2019s really operations driven and it\u2019s the fundamentals that you hear us talking about that we have confidence in and we are seeing come through our numbers. Hamid Moghadam : Hey, Michael, there is one other really important transaction too that helps with this equity math that you were trying to do. Remember, we sold something that was in our NAV probably for low $100 million range for about $400 million and that was the Facebook campus. So that obviously generates a lot of capital. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel from Green Street Advisors. Your line is open. Eric Frankel : Thank you. Just speaking of earnings, Tom, can you go through the expense true up process and just talk about how expenses can ramp up like that? And second, just in terms of dispositions now a factor for the year is this at all related to the KTR deal? And third, it looks like Amazon\u2019s roughly 10% of the KTR, portfolio. You know from what I understand there is a lot of highly amortized improvements that go into those developments; I know KTR has done a lot of that. Can you talk about the economics of those deals and what do you think the long-term rent for those facilities matches up to typical brand new generic asset? Thank you. Gene Reilly : Questionnaire Eric, it\u2019s Gene. I'll take the last question first, relative to Amazon. So, you are correct. I mean what really drives the longer lease terms in this portfolio would, the Amazon leases represent a lot of that and that \u2013 those will have slower growth over time. And if you look at this portfolio, probably the trade-off is longer lease terms, slightly slower growth because you are not capturing what we believe market rent growth to be. But in terms of above standard tenant improvements, I mean we strip those out in terms of how we analyze any acquisition, including this one. Hamid Moghadam : Yeah, those are not in the numbers that are reflected in the cap rate analysis. Tom Olinger : Eric, I\u2019ll take your other two questions. First in the CAM true up, we go through CAM analysis every quarter. And we do a true up to billings for the prior year in every Q1. When you look specifically at Q1, what happened this time, it\u2019s not a relatively large, big expense number. It is about $3 million. But what you have is, we had a slight positive true up in the Q1 of 2014, a slight negative true up in 2015, and the delta between those two was about $3 million. But that\u2019s far less than 1% of total operating real estate costs for the whole year, which is really what this is driving to. So it has a really surprisingly disproportionate move in your same store. Your second question about deployment changes, the deployment changes that we made absent KTR were made independent of the transaction. We\u2019ve talked about accelerating sales of non-strategic assets, particularly in the U.S. We are also looking at the sale of non-strategic assets now in Europe. And we just tightened up the range, and tightened up our approach with that to sell into this market right now. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of John Guinee from Stifel. Your line is open. John Guinee : First, Hamid, great insight and value add on the per pound and rents versus the two portfolios. Second, you may have said this and I just didn\u2019t catch it, but is Norges also buying a 45% interest in the platform, the land and the underdevelopment? Or are they only a 45% interest in the 60 million square feet? Hamid Moghadam : We are 45-55 across the board. John Guinee : Okay, everything? Hamid Moghadam : Yeah. John Guinee : Got you. Thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Brad Burke from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Hamid Moghadam : Let\u2019s move on. Brad Burke : Sorry about that guys. Good morning. I had you on mute. Just a quick one from me. Can you comment on the $5.9 billion paid? How that will compare potentially to the estimates that you have for total replacement costs for the entire portfolio? Gene Reilly : Yeah, sure. Brad, its Gene. We think we are buying this right at replacement costs. And by the way, in terms of kind of timing and the cycle and so forth, remember we think replacement costs are going to move up pretty dramatically. They certainly have in the last year or two and we think that's going to continue. So we like this entry point. But it's right at it. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citigroup. Your line is open. Michael Bilerman : Yes, one last one. Yes. One last one. Just in terms of that 5.5% yield I think you talked about being stabilized with the increase in occupancy by next summer. And I think Tom, you said there is $0.02 to $0.03 of non-cash. I don't know how much of that is actually in the 5.5% quoted yield, it is all in about 40 basis points. So maybe you can just help us. What is the going in current cash yield, day one, at 89% occupancy with the current rents? And then what is that next summer what are you assuming that occupancy goes to? I assume it's 95% if you are taking it to stabilize, how much market rent growth are you assuming? And what is your, I think the \u2013 you said the rents were similar below market to your, so I assume seems there is some pickup also from whatever their role is next year. Maybe just help us current to next summer. Hamid Moghadam : Okay. All the numbers that I'm going to mention to you are this instant's numbers. No rental growth projection from this point forward okay? At 89% occupancy, which is what the portfolio is, by the way, for another nanosecond, because we think there is another 2.5% of leasing coming through immediately. But at 89%, if you took a picture of that, it's 5.2% yield, if you lease it at today's rent, no inflation in rent. At today's rents, up to 95% leasing, that number goes up to 5.5% yield. And that, neither one of those two numbers includes land and CIP, which are currently non-income producing. If you throw those in the denominator and say we are not getting any return for $260 million of CIP, and $90 million of land the yield goes down to 4.85% yield, but that would be kind of a misleading number. If you then say what happens when you lease up the development that is underway, that 5.5% goes up to like a 5.6%, because those developments are coming in at a slightly higher yield. And none of this assumes any rental growth because it is a cap rate. It is a static measure. For the more dynamic things we look at IRRs and things like that. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman from KeyBanc. Your line is open. Craig Mailman : Just two follow-ups here. Tom, I was hoping maybe you could give us the number on a cash basis for the U.S. that kind of equates to the 15.1%. Then just secondly, as we look out maybe five years, just curious to the earlier question you guys had talked about the amazon leases. But just curious if you were to compare PLD\u2019s legacy, same store NOI outlook that you guys kind of talk about versus what the KTV would be, are the same store kind of outlook similar? Or is this one slightly below where the legacy portfolio would be? Hamid Moghadam : I would say this one is slightly above where the legacy portfolio would be because the concentrations of this as I mentioned is about 5 points more in the what we consider the very best markets, good demand and supply constraints. As to when you\u2019re going to get to those rental changes, it would be slightly delayed in this portfolio because the weighted average lease term is longer. So the potential is more here. You are just going to get to it a little bit later. But if you took a seven year view, it would be higher. Tom Olinger : On your second question, I don\u2019t have that exact number in front of me, but I think it\u2019s going to be something in the 6% to 7% range. Because we\u2019ve always talked about our GAAP rent spreads in the U.S. were about 15.1%. We would see the spread between GAAP and cash at any one point in time average between 600 basis points and 800 basis points. So I think it will put you in that range. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Jeff Specter from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Jamie Feldman : Hey, thanks. It\u2019s Jamie again. Just a couple of quick follow ups. One, the yield you\u2019ve just quoted, I mean, does that include your fee stream from Norges? Tom Olinger : No. Jamie Feldman : So that\u2019s before fees? Tom Olinger : Yes. Jamie Feldman : What\u2019s the incremental yield on fees? Hamid Moghadam : It is a cap rate, so it doesn\u2019t have fees in it. You can assume that our investment management teams are around 50 basis points of assets under management. Jamie Feldman : Okay. Hamid Moghadam : Round numbers. Jamie Feldman : All right, great. And then, Tom, I guess for the guidance, I think you guys took down your strategic capital income. Can you talk us through that? Tom Olinger : Yes. That is all related to FX movements. About two-thirds of our strategic capital revenues are outside the U.S., so euro and yen denominated. So that reflects marking down the revenues to those spot rates today. Now, however, but remember, we are, hedging our net earnings in both euro and yen, as well as Sterling. So, even though you are seeing revenues go down, you are going to see the offset of that sitting in our income statement in our FX and derivatives line. That\u2019s where the hedges that are in place sit. So that\u2019s the benefit. Likewise, we would see some small benefits in G&A for example going the other way because of FX movement. So bottom line is, it\u2019s all FX movements, but the offset is all sitting down in the net hedge FX line that you\u2019ll see over the rest of the year. So no impact on earnings. Hamid Moghadam : Okay, great. I think that was the last question. So let me summarize the key takeaways from this call. First and foremost, even though we didn\u2019t really talk about it that much, we had pretty good earnings in the first quarter, we are pleased with it and we think it\u2019s going to continue to get better throughout the year. But let me just go back to the merger, which is now almost four years ago. We worked very hard to realign our portfolio with our investment strategy, to strengthen our balance sheet, to create a very attractive currency, through our OP unit structure and to form really strong relationships with strategic sources of capital. That was a lot of hard work, but I think that hard work has now positioned us to be a very efficient and effective acquirer of assets. And the platform is scaled to a level that we can do that with no or minimal incremental additions to our overhead. So we are very excited about that. Thank you for participating in our call, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I'll turn the call over to Hamid, and we'll get started. Hamid? Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Tracy, and good morning, everyone. We just finished the great quarter and our financial results reflect very favorable market conditions and solid execution by the Prologis team. In fact, this year is shaping up to be one of the strongest in my 35 years in the business. We're halfway through the three-year plan we outlined for you at our Analyst Day in September of 2013. Let me take a few moments to highlight our key accomplishments since that date. Capitalizing on the imminent rental recovery was the most important objective among our three key priorities as outlined in the plan. Our market rent growth forecast of 20% to 25% between 2013 and 2017 was viewed as quite bold at that time. Yet with the Americas and Asia slightly ahead of forecast and Europe slightly behind, the rent recovery cycle is unfolding pretty much as we expected leading to substantial growth in our earnings. The strong rental recovery has been particularly pronounced in the U.S. where the increases are becoming evident in our rent growth and financial results. Our investment strategy with this focus on global market has enabled us to achieve rent increases of 22% with our share of same-store NOI exceeding 7% in the second quarter. New supply in the U.S. continues to be absorbed at a rapid pace, driving vacancy down to 15-year lows. Our forecast calls for declining vacancy rates in the U.S. through the end of 2016 with supply and demand reaching equilibrium in 2017. As the largest owner in the sector, we're constantly on the lookout for signs of overbuilding, as we have a vested interest in preventing oversupply in our markets. We'll not be shy about sounding the alarm bell at the first sign of undisciplined development. Don't be surprised if our future spec starts remain flat or even moderate compared to starts this year. In Europe, improved customer sentiment is leading to growth in occupancies and rents, especially in the UK and Northern Europe. Markets in Central and Eastern Europe are also on demand, albeit at a slower rate. Even Southern Europe, which has lagged the other regions, is showing modest improvement. The big story in Europe, however, is continued cap rate compression, which began about two years ago. The rates on the continent have tightened by about 150 basis points since 2013 and we expect them to drop another 50 basis points to 75 basis points over the next 12 months. In addition, appraisals in Europe continue to lag real-time transactions by about 50 basis points. Turning to Asia, rents in Japan are growing at a healthy pace and vacancies are low. Competition, however, is seeding up, putting pressure on land prices and development margins. In China, procuring land in the top-tier markets remains a challenge, but high-quality product continues to lease in line with pro forma. Our second key priority was to put our land bank to work to realize its embedded value, while meeting the needs of our customers. Midway through our three-year plan, we've generated $540 million in value creation or about a $1 per share in NAV on $1.9 billion of stabilizations. At full build out, our land bank can support more than $10 billion of additional development or about four years of activity at our current pace. Our development margins will remain elevated and our closure rate on built-to-suit is running very high. We'll remain disciplined with our development starts and expect to create about $400 million or $0.75 a share of incremental NAV annually through our development activity. Our third priority was to use our scale to grow earnings with minimal incremental overhead. At this point in the cycle, asset growth is likely to come through development and less from pure acquisitions, unless of course we're able to capitalize on a competitive advantage in a given situation; for example, through the use of appropriately priced OP units. The KTR transaction is an excellent example of these principles and action. It's rare to have the opportunity to deliver significant immediate accretion to shareholders by finding a portfolio of such quality, which is so consistent with our own. The KTR transaction reduced our G&A to AUM ratio by more than 15% to 54 basis points. The continued build-out of our land banks will make us even more efficient as we scale our portfolio organically. Turning to capital flows, globally we see considerable investor demand for high-quality industrial real estate. In the U.S., we announced these stabilized cap rates in the mid-to-high 4% range in our best global market. And as I've mentioned before, in Europe cap rates continue to fall as demonstrated by our fund valuations, where cap rates compressed by another 30 basis points in the quarter. Before handling the call over to Tom I'd like to leave you with a couple of thoughts. The benefits of scale are clear and manifest themselves in important ways such as lower G&A costs, lower financing rates, and wider array of financing options and a higher share of wallet from key customers. However, size alone does not make us better. We are better only when we deliver profitably on our objectives. Over the past several years, we've taken great care to position our portfolio to where it is today and we're confident that our efforts will pay off in terms of superior same store NOI growth in the coming years. Factoring in core FFO growth in 2014 and the midpoint of our 2015 guidance, we'll have averaged 15.5% annual FFO growth over this two-year period. AFFO is growing even at faster rate, requiring us to increase our dividends three times over the past 18 months for a cumulative increase of 43%. With two years of results in, we've already surpassed what was considered to be an ambitious three-year plan as presented on that Analyst Day. With that, I'll turn it over to Tom, who'll take you through the numbers and guidance. Thomas S. Olinger - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Hamid. We had an outstanding second quarter and strong first half of 2015. Before I begin with our results, I want to remind you that we completed the acquisition of KTR on May 29. The properties were acquired by USLV, our joint venture with Norges. You'll see the impact run throughout our financial statements since we consolidate this venture. The portfolio is fully integrated. The assets have been successfully on-boarded in the day-to-day management of the properties has been transitioned to our regional teams, a terrific example of our ability to scale efficiently. Now let's start with results for the quarter. Core FFO was $0.52 a share, up 8% over Q2 of 2014. For the first half of the year, core FFO was $1.01 per share, up 11% over the first half of last year. Based on feedback we've received from investors and analysts as well as that our share of operations and deployment drives our earnings, this will be the focus of our disclosures going forward. We will, however, continue to provide owned and managed information in our quarterly supplemental. Quarter-end occupancy excluding the KTR assets was 95.6%, up 100% basis points over the second quarter last year. The KTR portfolio was 89% occupied at the time we announced the acquisition. The operations team is making great progress placing this portfolio, which was 92% leased at the end of the quarter. GAAP rent change on rollover was 16.6% and the highest quarterly level we recorded to-date. Rent change was positive across all regions and led by the U.S. at 22.2%. GAAP same-store NOI increased 5.9% in the quarter and was led by the U.S. at 7.1%. Now moving to capital deployment for the quarter, which again is on an our share basis. We continue to deliver very profitable developments. Development stabilizations were $578 million, with an estimated margin of over 31% and value creation of $179 million or $0.34 a share. Development starts totaled $799 million with an estimated margin of 19.6%. Acquisitions were driven by KTR in total $3.2 billion at a stabilized cap rate of 5.5%. And contributions and building dispositions totaled $415 million with a stabilized cap rate of 5.9%. Turning to capital markets, we continue to tap the foreign debt markets at very attractive terms. We completed $3.1 billion of financing activity in the quarter at a weighted average interest rate of 1.6% and term of almost five years. This included $1.6 billion, which was denominated in euro and yen. Leverage at quarter end was 40.2% on a gross book value basis and $39.2% on total market capitalization basis, which is how most REIT's disclose leverage. Debt-to-adjusted EBITDA and fixed charge coverage excluding realized gains was 7.6 times and 3.7 times for the quarter respectively. We have approximately $1.3 billion of short-term financing related to KTR, consisting of the $1 billion term loans due in 2017 and the remainder on our line. Our plan is to repay this balance through asset sales, and I'll get into the specifics of that in a moment. We continue to maintain significant liquidity subsequent to the closing of the KTR acquisition, with over $2.4 billion at quarter end, plus we have no unsecured debt maturities until 2017. Now let's turn to our outlook and guidance for the year. For operations, we're maintaining our year-end occupancy range of between 95.5% and 96.5%, and continue to expect development stabilizations for 2015 of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. We're establishing guidance for our share of GAAP same-store NOI to range between 5% and 5.5%. Looking forward, the majority of our same-store NOI growth will be driven by capturing the current spread between in place and market rents as leases roll. To put this into perspective, even with no further market rent growth, our share of same-store NOI in 2016 should grow at about 4% from just capturing today's rent spread. Our assumption, however, is that market rents will continue to grow. We continue to expect net G&A for 2015 to range between $235 million and $245 million. On the strategic capital front, we've increased our expected revenue range to between $200 million and $210 million. Also included in our guidance is an expected net promote from our PELP venture in the fourth quarter of 2015 of about $0.04. In terms of capital deployment, I'll refer you to our supplemental, page eight, for detail on our updated guidance ranges and our share of each activity. You'll note the most significant change is the increase in disposition guidance, as well as we believe this is a great time to sell non-strategic assets that we have value maximized. At the midpoint, our share of the expected net deployment for the second half of 2015 is about $350 million proceeds. But I need to point out that the Morris industrial transaction is included in our acquisition guidance, which we will fund with approximately $400 million OP units. Therefore, the total cash net deployment proceeds for the second half will be approximately $750 million. Now let me spend a minute discussing the plan to permanently capitalize KTR and focus on three aspects. First, we will retire the short-term KTR borrowings of $1.3 billion through a combination of dispositions and contributions, primarily in the U.S. and Europe. With the proceeds generated in the back half of this year, we will repay approximately 60% of this balance and take our leverage to roughly 37%. We'll complete the remainder of the plan in the first half of next year to fully retire the KTR borrowings and fund our development needs. At that point, our leverage would be in the mid 30%s, in line with our target credit metrics and on a path to an A rating. Second, this plan does not assume any sell down of our fund interest. The reason we've prioritized dispositions in this plan is because we expect substantial increases in European valuations over the next year. Since the downturn, we have opportunistically acquired additional interest in many of our ventures, particularly in Europe. As a result, we are well above our long-term ownership target of 20%, and giving us significant financial capacity. For example, reducing our interest to this level in our ventures would generate upwards of $3 billion of capital at today's values, providing substantial embedded liquidity, optionality, and capacity to fund our capital needs beyond the conclusion of this plan. Third, given our confidence in this plan and the embedded capacity within these ventures, we have no need to issue equity, as it'd generate excess liquidity based on our current deployment outlook, and is also consistent with our view of attaining an A rating. Putting our guidance all together, we're increasing the midpoint of our 2015 core FFO, which we now expect to range between $2.18 and $2.22 per share. This represents 17% year-over-year growth, or an increase of $0.32 at the midpoint of our guidance, which follows 14% growth last year. As Hamid mentioned, our AFFO is growing faster than our core FFO in 2015, and as a result, we announced an increase in our third quarter dividend to $0.40 a share. In closing, we had a great quarter and our outlook for our business is equally as strong. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI : Thanks, good morning. Tom, I was just wondering if you could provide a little more clarity on I guess the cap rates that you might expect, a range of cap rates from the asset sales to fund the KTR deal? I'm just trying to think about maybe what the negative arbitrage would be between what you bought KTR for and the cap rates on dispositions? Thomas S. Olinger - Chief Financial Officer : The cap rates are going to be on average; again, you need to think about this as just being not only dispositions but contributions. I think overall, you're going to see those be in the mid-to-high \u2013 the low 5%s on contributions, all the way up to the \u2013 maybe the mid-to-high 6% on some dispositions. When you blend that all together, one thing you need to take into consideration, though, is, when we contribute assets for funds, we also get incremental fees, which certainly offsets the dilution. Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : The other thing is, Steve, there's some land sales as well in that, and of course, the cap rate on land sales is zero. So, I think it will end up being in the mid-to-high 5%s, when you blend it all together. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Auerbach from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. George Auerbach - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks, good morning. Tom, with KTR closed, can you now talk more specifically about which portfolios, or the overall size of the assets that you have in the market for sale in the U.S. and Europe to fund KTR? And in addition, can you just clarify your comment on PELP, the sell-down? It sounded to me like, from your comments, that we should no longer expect a sell-down of PELP this year. Thomas S. Olinger - Chief Financial Officer : That's correct. So, to be clear, our plans is not \u2013 our plan to permanently finance the KTR outstanding balance of $1.3 billion assumes no sell-down in our European ventures. And again, as I mentioned, the reason we're focusing on dispositions and contributions for this plan is because we expect substantial cap rate compression in Europe over the next year, and as we look at how we're value maximizing assets on sale, we're prioritizing dispositions and contributions. Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : The other thing I would add to that is actually selling in our funds would be the easiest execution that we have out there, because really all we got to do is look at the NAV at the end of the quarter based on appraisals and make a phone call to actually to get that done. So, there is very little execution risk on that. It's just that as I mentioned to you, there is a lag in cap rates from reality. There's about 50 basis points of lag between appraised cap rates and reality in the marketplace, and we think the reality of the marketplace is poised for further compression. So, yes, we could go do the easy thing and put this thing to bed tomorrow, but we'd be leaving about 100 basis points of value on the table and we have lots of other ways of getting to the same place. But we have this as a plan B with $3 billion of cushion. So, we're not losing a lot of sleep over this. Michael S. Curless - Chief Investment Officer : This is Mike. In terms of the geographic distribution of the portfolios that we currently have in the marketplace or will have very shortly out there, it's a good spread of about a dozen markets, some global markets as well as some regional markets. I think it's a good mix of product that'd be attractive to what we're seeing as a very large buyer pool out there. And in terms of pricing, we have high expectations given the outstanding cap rates we're seeing now in the U.S. It's a really good time to put incremental portfolios out in the market and we're bullish on our ability to get that done by year end. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman from KeyBanc. Your line is open. Craig Mailman - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Just want to follow-up on the disposition theme here. Looking at where you guys are trading relative to private market cap rates, just thoughts on ramping the disposition program even further to potentially buy back stock. Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, one thing at a time. I mean, first, our dispositions I want to emphasize the plan \u2013 the disposition plan actually has nothing to do with KTR. We would have sold these very same properties as the final step in the clean-up of our portfolio to align it with our strategy, just like the properties we sold in 2011, 2012, and 2013 and 2014. So, it's just basically the last phase of that. So, KTR, other than a few properties out of KTR itself, does not really impact our disposition plan. It's business as usual. It happens to coincide with paying off the financing that we took on in connection with KTR. But that's just coincidental. So, that's the way we're looking at financing our business and any of you guys have anything else to add to that? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. You mentioned that the development margin should remain elevated. Could you comment on development yields by market first across the U.S.? We've heard there are some cities where it could be as low as 4%, others more like 6% or higher. And then if you could also provide the international color on the build yields as well. Thanks. Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Gene, will address that question. I did not address one part of Craig's question, which is on stock buyback. Look, we're going to continue to execute on our disposition plan and also the fund sell-down to align with what our long-term ownership plans are in those funds. Obviously, we'll be in a substantially liquid position. We'll be a lot more liquid than what we need to achieve our A rating. And that capital is available for all kinds of purposes, including potentially stock buyback, but we are nine months to a year away from that because that would be the last thing we would execute on. So, depends on where the stock sits at that point in time, and right now we think our priority should be selling our non-strategic assets and paying off the financing associated with KTR and the stock buybacks are something that will come later, and we'll have the capacity to do a lot of that obviously. So this whole issue of equity issuance, which is \u2013 everybody keeps worrying and talking about, honestly we don't get it, because the problem we're trying to solve is excess liquidity not a lack of liquidity. Gene, you want to start? Eugene F. Reilly - Chief Executive Officer- Americas Region : Yeah, yeah with respect to the development margin, so the U.S. will be sort of high teens and as we've said that we're going to remain elevated in margins, I would say at least over the next 12 months, that I could see. In terms of where that actual returns on cost are, I mean it really range from the mid to high 5%s, in LA for example, if you were to do a build to suit in a 4.5% cap rate environment, it could be that low and they range into the mid 7% depending on U.S. market. So if you look at Mexico, you're going to be in low to mid 8%s, and then of course in Brazil you're going to be in the 10% to 13% in terms of return on cost. Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Our development yields in Europe, Continental Europe I'd say 7%, 7.5% something like that, in the UK probably in the 5% to 6% range depending on the market. Obviously, if you're in the London market, it's going to be lower than if you're up in the Midlands. In China, I'd say they're close to the same as Continental Europe probably in that 7%, 7.5% range and then Japan, obviously lower than that 5.5% to 6%. But again, we expect yields to be pretty healthy for the foreseeable future, cap rates are compressing in Europe and values are strong in Asia. Thomas S. Olinger - Chief Financial Officer : And our land bank is still \u2013 books substantially less than fair value. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Maiorana from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks, good morning. I wanted to ask about the dividend raise. Your AFFO, Hamid, I think you mentioned has grown pretty nicely, grown faster than FFO and probably somewhere around $1.80 or $1.85 share annually. So you've got nice coverage relative to the dividend but you guys do capitalize G&A into development, so that doesn't hit the P&L and then you capitalize some interest expense as well. And we're at a good point in the business cycle. But if development slows down and you start to expense some of those costs that are capitalized, do you still feel like you'd have solid coverage of the dividend at $1.60 relative to an AFFO number if you had to expense a few more of those items? Thomas S. Olinger - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Hey, Brendan. Brendan, this is Tom. So, absolutely we have very strong coverage when you look at where our payout ratios are, we look at this with realized gains because that's TI and that's got to go out the door or a proportion of it does. So we're in a low 60% payout ratio. If you want to exclude realized gains, which we don't look at, but we would be in the mid to high 80%s exactly where we've been long-term after this divined raise. So we feel good about our coverage. We actually need to raise our dividend, not only \u2013 we're not trying to just meet our payout ratios or our target, we're really trying to make sure we're paying out the statutory minimum. So we've got TI pressure that we need to increase \u2013 continue to increase the dividend to make sure we're getting the right amount of TI dividends out the door. Now on your question about capitalized cost, to put in perspective, we'll capitalize about $70 million of development overhead this year and maybe $65 million of capped interest. So when you look at that $70 million against midpoint of starts for $2.6 billion, that's about 2.6% or 2.7%. So it's a fairly conservative cap \u2013 fairly conservative capitalization ratio when you think about what is actually out in the marketplace. So, even if you would cut those capitalized costs by $10 million or $20 million, which is I think would be a pretty substantial cut that would have a very minimal impact on our AFFO given the nominal amount of AFFO that we have out there. So bottom-line, we feel really good about our coverage and in that scenario, I don't think it would materially cover \u2013 materially impact our dividend payout ratio, particularly as we look at our growth prospects going forward from rents rolling to market. Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Brendan, can I give you one little other piece of color. I mean, we've got a big advantage in that we're a global developer, and we've talked about this in the past. Look at the spread of our development activity, it is very broad and there's one building per market, we've got \u2013 we're building in each one of the geographies, $2.5 billion of development spend is not a big deal for us, we can certainly do more, but we have the advantage of literally picking the markets that we want to develop in. So I think $2.5 billion run rate is a pretty safe rate. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel from Green Street Advisors. Your line is open. Eric J. Frankel - Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Thank you. I wanted to touch upon the operating portfolio a little bit. First, I'm not sure, do you ever mention what your cash releasing spreads were by market? And second, regarding releasing spreads, which markets benefited the most? Were there global markets, were there more of the regional markets or just like to get a little bit of more color on that. Thank you. Thomas S. Olinger - Chief Financial Officer : Eric, I'll take the cash rent change on rollover question. So, I did not mention it, but the cash rent change on rollover was about 4.5% for the quarter as compared to the GAAP rent change. Now that's spread a little wider than what we've had in the past, but what's happening is given the significant spread between market and rolling rents, our customers are asking for help to mitigate really the sticker shock that's happening with the significant rise in market rates, just look at this quarter alone. In the U.S., we saw 23% increase in spot rates to rolling rates and as a result, we're trying to help customers ease into these higher rents with escalations, and really just in the initial part of the lease. So that's why it's really important to look at the net effect of rents calculation, because that captures the economics of the overall lease. Looking at the cash rent change, you pick up just that spot change from the last lease to the initial lease, which clearly doesn't represent the economics of what you're signing up for. So we focus on the GAAP net effective. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee from Stifel. Your line is open. John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great, thank you. Here's my question, I'm trying to get to the bottom of it, is you've got great same-store NOI growth. You've got excellent mark-to-market. You have a good value creation and development pipeline. But if I look at PLD at a 5% fixed cap rate, your per share in 2013 was $46.80 and your per share (31:07) for 2015 is $47.70, which is less than a dollar of value creation from 2013 to 2015. So I can't quite see where the leakage is and do you guys have any explanation for that? Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I'm not sure how that math works, John. I mean the NOI number is growing. If you're taking the same cap rate and applying it, actually interest rates are increasing, so the mark-to-market on the debt should be getting smaller and we're creating $400 million of NAV though the development process every year. So I got to look at the detailed math of what you're talking about, but I'm not sure I totally understand it. There is some degree of FX factored into that, but again, most of that is mitigated because of the fact that we have matched liabilities with our assets overseas. So, I mean I can't do that math for you right now but would be happy to take you through that analysis. By our estimation, our NAV should grow by about a $1 a share, a little less than a $1 a share though the development activity and in the foreseeable future, we see earnings growth in the low-double digit range and probably even 10% just to pick an easy number. So that'd be $3 to $4 of NAV growth. So I don't know what you're doing with your math, but happy to take a look at it. John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Am I still on the line? Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : You are. John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Oh, this math just comes from page 34 to 36 from your NAV. This is not anything I'm doing creatively or uniquely. I'm just tracking your NAV as presented in your supplemental every quarter for the last three or four years. Thomas S. Olinger - Chief Financial Officer : Well, the other piece of it, John, would be the cap rate that you're assuming as well, on that NOI. Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : There's definitely been cap rate compression over the last 12 months, for sure. And I don't know if you're using a constant cap rate or what you're doing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brad Burke from Goldman Sachs. Brad K. Burke - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning guys. I wanted to ask about your leverage mix. Obviously, you're able to issue a lot of debt this quarter at a very low rate. Just want to get an update on how you're thinking about the mix of floating rate in non-U.S. dollar denominated debt versus where you're at today? Thomas S. Olinger - Chief Financial Officer : Brad, this is Tom. So, today, we're at about \u2013 in the high teens on variable rate debt. Prior to the KTR funding, we were in the high-single digits. We're going to get back to that high-single digit range once we complete the permanent funding plan, and with selling dispositions and contributions that will fund this. So we'll get back down to that range. Our bias is to go long and to fix as much interest as we can at this point, just given where rates are. Regarding the mix of foreign currency debt versus U.S. dollar debt, based on where our U.S. dollar net equity is, we're at about at 90.6% at the end of this quarter, once we complete the KTR plan, we're going to be pushing more of the middle, middle 90%s, of U.S. dollar net equity. So, we don't have really any room today to move up our proportionate of foreign dollar debt. Going forward, we will do our best to match fund our foreign-denominated asset growth with foreign-denominated debt. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Dave Rodgers from Baird. Your line is open. Dave B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yes, good morning, guys. Maybe for Mike, a question on construction cost. Can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of the construction cost components increasing? And maybe a second part to that is, how do you see construction cost keeping pace with rent growth here, particularly in the U.S., in the near-term? Michael S. Curless - Chief Investment Officer : Dave, in terms of construction costs, we're seeing there has been increases in the U.S. over the last couple of years, in the 3% to 4% range, perhaps as high as 5% in select markets where competition is more intense. For the most part in the global markets, we're seeing rents outpace that, that's why you're seeing some construction, that you are from a supply standpoint. Going forward, we anticipate that moderating a bit, maybe into the 2% or 3% range, but I think there is still some pretty significant competition for construction services, given the heavy load of development activity that's out there. Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And in Europe, I'd just say, we haven't really seen significant construction cost increases, because there isn't a lot of development going on today, maybe just a bit. China, we're seeing some small increases as supply continues to move forward, and Japan is the interesting one. Japan, we had a spike right when the 2020 Olympics were announced, and then it peaked and it basically stopped. And we think that, as you get closer to the 2020 Olympics, you're going to see construction cost increases in Japan. At the same time today, we're seeing land increases, very significant land increases, in Japan. So, I think that underpins a pretty healthy story for rent growth in Japan over the next several years. Michael S. Curless - Chief Investment Officer : And land is increasing pretty much across the board in the U.S., along with entitlement cost. So, while construction increases have been moderate, we think they're going to outpace inflation. Overall replacement costs are going up pretty rapidly. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vin Chao from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, good morning, everyone. I just want to go back to the rent spreads here, which were quite strong in the quarter, accelerated from the first quarter. But I think, when they were talked about originally, there was some negative mix in the first half, more European leasing than in the second half. Just curious if that maybe didn't play out the way you thought, and that was part of the reason why we saw such strength in the first half spreads, or if that's still going to be a positive tailwind to you in the back half, and if you could maybe quantify that, how that mix is changing? Thomas S. Olinger - Chief Financial Officer : Vince, this is Tom. We've really normalized the mix, starting in Q2. Q1, we were \u2013 and part of last year, as you point out, we were more heavily weighted towards Europe, and particularly Southern Europe and Central and Eastern Europe, so it's moderated. So that would be one thing. And then second would just be the strength of the U.S. markets and the proportion of leasing with the U.S. markets driving these returns. So going forward, I think we'll expect \u2013 I don't foresee any real mix issues like we had in the past with Europe, with U.S. being disproportionally different. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman from Citi. Your line is open. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey guys, good morning. If we could just go back to your earlier comment on cap rates compressing in Europe and your hesitation to sell there at the moment, can you balance that against, A, your acquisition plans for the rest of the year, maybe into next year, and how much of that will be in Europe? And B, how you get comfort (38:47) buying in the U.S. and selling in the U.S. at the same time? Thomas S. Olinger - Chief Financial Officer : Well, from a mix standpoint, if you look at our acquisitions this year, it's very much \u2013 you really need to look at the remainder of the year. It is weighted towards the U.S. and the Morris industrial transaction, which we agreed upon pricing there probably six to nine months ago. So, from that standpoint, we are focusing on \u2013 that's a big driver of the U.S., as well as, we do have some U.S. 1031 activity going forward. When it looks about balancing, buying in the U.S. versus Europe, we're always looking at the relative returns, and the overall growth profile of what we're buying and what we're selling. And as \u2013 looking at the KTR portfolio, in particular, very high quality portfolio that we expect to perform right in line with the rest of our U.S. portfolio. Look at how our U.S. portfolio is performing right now. We expect the KTR portfolio, similar quality, to perform equally as well. I think that is a big testament to why we wanted to buy that portfolio. Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : The only comment I'd make with respect to Europe is as Tom said in his prepared remarks, we've obviously increased our ownership position in our funds, that's the best acquisition that can make. Over the last several years, we've been buying portfolios and as we've told you there, well, we'd like to buy more in Europe, there aren't a lot of portfolios to buy, so we're focusing our time on those one-off acquisitions, and those value-add deals, and you can see it coming through in our numbers. We did two building acquisitions, one in Prague and one in Netherlands in the second quarter, and a total of $144 million year-to-date. If we could get more in Europe and it was good quality stuff, we would do that. At the same time, we will be selling non-strategic assets in Europe, when we feel like they're value maximized. So we are going to be both buyer and seller in a market like this. Thomas S. Olinger - Chief Financial Officer : And rounding out the activity in the U.S. the majority of it outside of the large portfolios of Morris and KTR are the value-add acquisitions in U.S. as well, where our local teams identify those, those aren't subject to the same pricing pressures in general that we see on the larger portfolios and it's a way we keep our acquisition activity strong in U.S. more on a case-by-case, project-by-project basis. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust Robinson. Your line is open. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. So Hamid, maybe we can go back to the earlier conversation regarding capital deployment and KTR. And I think I heard you correctly when you said that you didn't fully understand the market's reaction to equity overhang risk, some of the things that you've heard from the buy side. If you could reflect on just what has happened in the past four months or so with the KTR deal, what are some of the things that you possibly learned or maybe you could have done differently maybe a forward equity issuance or maybe just a whole host of things that you could have done differently or not. I was just curious what your reflections are regarding that and how your stock price reacted post the deal and what feedback you received from investors? Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. That's a really good question. The thing that I learned is that you can be totally honest with people in the way you present something. And in the interest of being super honest and straightforward with people, you could convey an impression that could be really inaccurate. So let me elaborate. Every M&A deal that a company does, they talk about its accretion using the capital structure that will be deployed immediately to fund that acquisition, which in our case is 1.5% debt. And we should have come out maybe and said this deal is not only NAV neutral because we're buying in the (42:51) market, but it is accretive to the tune of 15% or some crazy number like that because we're financing it on the margin with 1.5% debt. And that would have been the least if you will honest thing \u2013 honest way we could have portrayed it. So we elected not to do that. We used the word, this is how accretive it is on a leverage neutral basis. And I think the market read that as, we are immediately going to finance this on a leverage neutral basis, and I think it created an overhang. I mean, remember, we own a lot of the stock. We're not selling our stock at a 10% discount or now 20% discount to real estate value just to buy fully-priced real estate. We get that math. I mean come on guys, we've been doing this for a while, okay. So, clearly, that is not what we intended to do. We know all the sources that we have. We know how much non-strategic assets we have that we're going to have to sell, anyway whether we do KTR or not. Sure we have to sell a few more with KTR because as we've mentioned to you, about 5% of KTR is long-term non-strategic. So, yeah, we're going to sell our non-strategic assets and that happens to fully fund this transaction over a 12-month period, and to us that's very comfortable. We are committed to our single A rating, but that doesn't mean we need to achieve it tomorrow. We're heading in that direction. We are not telling you different story to the rating agencies that we're telling to the equity holders, all of what we've told you has been consistent and in my belief presented in the most responsible way possible. But I think the issue about the leverage neutral language and the talking about the timing that was assumed that we're going to get this in balance right this second half after it closes. I think we're actually misinterpreted by the market and we'll take the responsibility for that miscommunication. But the reality is, we'll clearly fund this transaction within a year. Our leverage ratios will be back in line consistent with that single A rating and above and beyond this, we've got about $3 billion in effect equity firepower sitting in our funds that once those funds and ventures are valued properly, particularly in Europe because of continued cap rate compression and closure of that appraisal lag. We'll take advantage of those in a way that it matches with our needs \u2013 with our capital needs. So we don't have a big capital drag on our income statement. I hope that clarifies. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum from UBS. Your line is up. Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Securities LLC : Hi, thanks. Hamid, you had commented that we shouldn't be surprised if the development pipeline stabilizes or goes down as we look out over the next few years. I'm going to assume that we should also expect the same from the land bank but perhaps you could comment a little more, is there any expectation the market should have that the land bank could really move down beyond what happens to the development pipeline just so that you get more of these non-income producing assets off your book so that your earnings multiple isn't negatively impacted by that? Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure, that's a really good question. To be perfectly candid with you, not all of our land is strategic. In fact, we've quantified, classified about $400 million of our land as non-strategic, meaning that we don't intend to develop it, either somebody else is going to develop it or we'll sell it to user or something like that. So of our book value of land bank that you see today, $400 million of it should not be there, and we're going to sell that no matter what and not replace it with anything else. So the land bank for sure would come down. Then in a normal market, we will be acquiring land at the same rate as we'll be putting land into production. We'll reach some level of equilibrium at some point. Our best guess is that in that situation, we would have a $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion of land, which is about two years of development at the run rate of $2.5 billion and the math on that is pretty simple. Two years of $2.5 billion development is $5 billion and land is about 25% of the total. So that gets you to about $1.250 billion of land that we need to carry around here. And so if you want to be in the development business and generate whatever we generated, I think it was 17 unleveraged by IRRs over a period of 15 years, you've got to have land. The unfortunate thing as you all know in our business, we don't get to cap that as earnings, and that's fine, because I think when industry counted that as earnings bad things happened. So we're good, but it's real money. It's real cash that comes in the bank in the company and it's real NAV that's created and we can patient to realize that value. So the bottom line is, we like the development business. You have to have some land to account for it to be able to play in that business. It's the highest rate of return business we have, but we have too much land in relation to our development volume going forward. As to my comment that we're going to moderate it is that look four years ago, five years ago, before there was a development business in the depth of the crisis, we told all of you that our annual development volume is going to normalize from $2 billion to $3 billion a year globally and in some markets and in sometimes, it's going to get closer to $3 billion and in sometimes, it's going to get closer to $2 billion. And I guess what I'm saying is that it's been going steadily up in the last three or four years and now it's about $2.6 billion, $2.7 billion. Don't be surprised if that comes down to $2.4 billion, $2.5 billion or something like. I mean that's very normal, and we're going to bounce around numbers like that going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman from Bank of America. Your line is open. Jamie C. Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, thank you. I'm here with Jeff Spector as well. Can you just talk a little bit about the KTR yields and how they came in or how they are coming in versus your original expectations? I think on the first quarter call you guys had said the in place was a 5.2% cash, this stabilized was a 5.5% and if you backed out the CIP in land it's a 4.85%. And along the same lines if you look at there was an occupancy dip across the portfolio in the second quarter, can you talk about how much of that was KTR versus the rest of your portfolio and what gives you comfort on getting to the guidance you've laid out which is at least a 10 basis point growth if not more? Eugene F. Reilly - Chief Executive Officer- Americas Region : Yeah. So, Jamie. It's Gene. I think KTR had a 20 basis point effect globally. But let me get to your yield. So things are playing out as expected, if anything the rents we're getting on new leases. And by the way we've signed about 40 leases since we've announced this transaction about 2.5 million square feet in that portfolio, but we're right out of 5.5% yield on a stabilized basis. So this is the same way we describe any acquisition. So that's 95% occupancy. At 89%, you're correct, it was around a 5.2%, but we're already at 92% leased in this portfolio. And our plan is to be just under 95% by the end of the year. So we're a little ahead of schedule relative to the 12-months timeframe that we outlined to get KTR in line with the rest of the U.S. portfolio, or said another way, around 96%. So, hopefully that clears up the yield. I mean I see upsides in the yields because the rents coming in a little better than we expected. Thomas S. Olinger - Chief Financial Officer : Jamie, on your point about the 4.9% cap rate. I think you meant to say that if you include the land in the CIP, in addition to the operating assets, the yield would be 4.9%. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman from KeyBanc. Your line is open. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hello. Can you hear me? Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Go ahead, Craig. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, it's Jordan Sadler here with Craig. Just a clarification. Can you \u2013 are you saying that and I think I understand the sentiment, but there's no equity in the plan any longer. I think last call and where some of the confusion came in was, Tom, you gave the example on a leverage neutral basis talking about the issuance of potentially $1.5 billion of equity. So obviously there's some communication about that ultimate financing, which I know I now understand was not imminent necessarily in terms of how you were trying to communicate it. But now you're saying the plan just does not assume equity, this is going to be done through asset sales. Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : If I may take that question because it's my bad more than company's or Tom. I think we laid out alternative financing plans for you. I think we laid out three financing plans and one of them included equity, and two of them did not include equity. And we wanted to be \u2013 we wanted to give you the bookends of what could happen in terms of financing this deal. Our current plan and the one that we're executing right now assumes no equity, the only equity that exists is in effect the OP units that are part of the Morris transaction that go with the Morris acquisition. I mean if you want to really define equity in a broad way and just by way of reminder the valuation of that equity is fixed at where our NAV was on whatever we negotiated that deal about a year ago. It's $43.11, which by the way after discount, issuance discounts and all that is equivalent of $45 a share. So that's the only equity that's ever been in the plan before or after KTR and there is none contemplated in the current plan. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee from Stifel. You line is open. John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes, on a lighter note, going back to Europe, I've been watching the Tour de France almost every night, and I have yet to see a PLD roof or a PLD sponsor on any of the teams. Are you guys doing that this year over there? Unknown Speaker : (54:25) Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : It's too expensive, John. It's too expensive to get your name on that \u2013 on those jerseys, as you know, so we're going to keep our money for dividend growth, but... Timothy D. Arndt - Senior Vice President, Strategic Planning and Analysis, Prologis, Inc.: You may see something on the roofs, though. Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, so John, you asked a good question, and Tim Arndt, our Treasurer, has been actually trying to reconcile the numbers for you, so instead of waiting, I think he is prepared to talk about it right now. So let's answer your last question now. Timothy D. Arndt - Senior Vice President, Strategic Planning and Analysis, Prologis, Inc.: Yeah. Hey, John. I'm guessing, I think, between the two periods you described, you're seeing, if we look at, (55:02) I believe you're holding cap rates constant, understand that; the NOI growth is flowing through; you're probably seeing an addition of something like $3 to $4 a share on that basis, and I'm guessing you're also seeing something on the order of $1.50 a share in terms of development value creation added over that period. I think the components you're missing are, we had about a $1 come through, the way we present our NAV in the supplemental, what would appear to be loss from debt extinguishment, which is a temporary phenomena, we bear those debt premiums initially and we earn them back in a period of about two to three years through lower interest expense subsequently. So that'll be coming back through the NAV statements through about 2018, 2019. The other component that would deserve acknowledgment is, it's really 2013 when we got ahead of all of our hedging and debt placements, and until that got up and running, it's a fact that we probably saw about $1 to $1.50 of NAV loss before that program got completed. If you looked at what we did in terms of bond financing in the euro market, as that market opened up, that principally got done in 2014. So, you know we're fully hedged now, we won't see any further loss from FX in NAV today, and we'll earn the debt extinguishment back in about two to three years. Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And John, so that you understand the strategy behind the timing of that euro match funding. The time we did the merger, 40% of Prologis' equity was in foreign currencies \u2013 I mean, I'm sorry, in U.S. dollar. 60% of Prologis' equity was in foreign dollars and to that date we had \u2013 certainly I had not ever heard a single call about currency exposure in this company. One of our first objectives, the day the transaction closed, that we said we're going to neutralize and insulate this company against currency movement. But we couldn't do it immediately because remember, the PEPR was a big component. We had to bring PEPR in and then recapitalize it with PELP, all that stuff, until we could get all the puppies in the right pond, we couldn't really refinance the transaction. So, as soon as we got these pieces in the right buckets, we basically executed on our immunization strategy on FX, which is \u2013 it's really like debt extinguishment. Basically, you had an FX hit upfront, and you're going to earn it back over time in terms of earnings and matching on the debt side. So, if we hadn't done that, at that time, the launch that Tim just qualified for you for $1.50 would have been in excess of $5 a share. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel from Green Street Advisors. Your line is open. Eric J. Frankel - Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Thanks for all the questions. Tom, not to beat a dead horse, but regarding the releasing spreads, could you clarify what the average rent bumps you're getting on new leases? Second, regarding disposition plans, how many market exits do you guys plan over the next year or so? And then third, related to the KTR deal, it looks like New Jersey had the biggest dip in occupancy, so just want to understand if there's any particular buildings that need to get leased up? Thank you. Thomas S. Olinger - Chief Financial Officer : Eric, I'll take the first part of that. So our bumps over the life of the lease really aren't changing on a long-term basis. What's really happening is, the initial rent in this, call it the first maybe six months of leases that are getting stepped up. So instead of walking somebody to market day one, the sticker shock that is happening, tenants would like to walk into that say, over three months or six months. So that initial rent, you're not seeing the full mark-to-market day one, but you are going to see it over the next quarter or two. Eugene F. Reilly - Chief Executive Officer- Americas Region : Eric, let me give you an example. And this is real life and, during this past quarter, we had like a dozen examples like this. So put yourself in a tenant's position, you're paying $3 a foot in rent and the market rent today is $5. That exists all over the United States, okay? That's real sticker shock, and we may cut a deal at $5 flat, okay, in which case you'd have a 66% cash rent change, or you may say, all right, we're going to give you $3 for the first year, then it's $5, then it's $6.25 for the next two years. That's a 0% cash rent change. And that second deal has a higher net present value to us. So, it's \u2013 the problem with this statistic is that, in volatile periods on the upward cycle and the downward cycle, it doesn't really tell the whole story. Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, with all due respect, and we should stick to real estate, which is our business, and leave analytics to you guys. But in any asset class where the duration of the leases is longer than one year, the concept of cash to cash comparison becomes a little problematic. In apartments and hotels that \u2013 or whatever \u2013 that concept works just fine, because there is no profile through the term of the lease. But the minute you get into four or five year leases, you can do all kinds of shapes of leasing with different present value implications that will affect that number, but really doesn't affect the effective rent. But we'll continue to report it and I'm sure you'll continue to look at it, but honestly in the way we run our business, we're not that focused on that number. Eugene F. Reilly - Chief Executive Officer- Americas Region : Yes, we could also make our teams confirmed to a policy that would make us look better, but I want to do that. I want these guys to do smart deals based on what the market gives them. So your other question was on New Jersey. So we have 750,000 square foot development go into the operating pool this quarter and that really is the driver of the occupancy. With respect to that building, we've good activity one it. We're not really worried about it and New Jersey overall has frankly had quite a bit of construction over the last year, but that's very much moderated, not much in the pipeline. So, we feel good about that market long-term, but it's that development that was pulled into the pool that caused that. Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And it was a Prologis development, not a KTR development. Eugene F. Reilly - Chief Executive Officer- Americas Region : Correct. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Maiorana from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. A follow-up for Tom. So the property operating margin in the quarter was pretty high. It was close to 73%, which I think is one of the highest that you guys have had in Q2 for the past several years and was up sequentially from Q1 pretty materially even though occupancy levels were down. Just wondering if there was anything unusual that hit this quarter such that the operating margin might be impacted from the run rate \u2013 from the Q2 level for the back half of the year or as we think about it for 2016? Thomas S. Olinger - Chief Financial Officer : Nothing unusual that would move that materially. We're \u2013 just given where occupancies are trending, right, very high and where we're seeing \u2013 revenues are certainly growing a heck of a lot faster than expenses and occupancy is going up, so our operating leverage is increasing meaningfully and that is what's going to drive that margin. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sumit Sharma from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sumit Sharma - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Sorry, no questions. They've all been asked. Thanks Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Great. I think that was the last question. Again, I want to thank you for participating. We're really feeling good about our business and we are not taking our eye off the risks that are entailed in our business. So \u2013 and rest assured we are vigilant but excited about finally having our day in the sun. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a quarter-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Ron Hubbard, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead, sir. Ron Hubbard : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Denny Oklak, Chairman and CEO; Jim Connor, Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Denien, Chief Financial Officer. Before we make our prepared remarks, let me remind you that statements we make today are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For more information about those risk factors, we would refer you to our December 31, 2014, 10-K that we have on file with the SEC. Now for our prepared statement, I\u2019ll turn it over to Denny Oklak. Denny Oklak : Thank you, Ron. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will highlight some of our key accomplishments for the quarter and then Jim Connor will give you an update on our leasing activity and development pipeline, and then Mark, will address our third quarter financial performance. We closed $250 million of property dispositions during the quarter at an overall average in place cap rate of 7.1%. These proceeds were primarily the result of two major transactions. In a continuation of our strategy to reduce our remaining suburban office investment, we sold a six building portfolio comprising 1 million square feet in Cincinnati. We were very pleased with the execution on this transaction, given the property\u2019s age, occupancy and rollover schedule. At quarter end, this leaves about 900,000 square feet of suburban office properties in Cincinnati that are all being marketed now and much of which is expected to close around year end. We believe we timed the investment sales market well on the divestiture from this market. After this sale, substantially all of our remaining wholly owned suburban office product will be located in Indianapolis, our home town. The second large disposition was a 1 million square feet modern vault ecommerce industrial facility located in Delaware that we developed as a built to suit a few years ago. While the facility fits our portfolio quality profile, the location is a bit tertiary and we believe it\u2019s prudent to take advantage of the exceptionally strong market for modern class A industrial product and strategically harvest some value for our shareholders. We\u2019re also pleased with the execution on this opportunistic sale at a nice margin on a recently completed development. We also closed on the sale of a couple smaller projects during the quarter and looking into the fourth quarter, we believe we\u2019ll be near the high end of 2015 guidance on dispositions. We\u2019ve also mentioned on the last few calls our expectations to continue to sell our remaining suburban office assets as a continuation of our strategy to focus on industrial investment in top tier markets in select medical office developments. In addition, we\u2019ve also been consistent, communicated our intentions to self-fund our development pipeline, with dispositions of suburban office properties, as well as select industrial asset sales much like we executed in the third quarter. We believe our ability to execute this strategy to self-fund development during times like now when there\u2019s a bit of capital market volatility and a public to private equity discount is a great advantage for us. In fact we believe as the current market conditions process from a robust private market investment sales standpoint, we should be able to dispose of another $500 million to $800 million of assets next year in 2016. Let me state that this is not our official 2016 guidance that we will deliver to you in late January, yet this range is in our very early thoughts for next year. I would point out that dispositions at this level would not only likely kind of our development pipeline for 2016, but would also cover most if not all of the $368 million of debt that we had maturing next year. This would greatly reduce if not entirely eliminate any capital needs in 2016, further improve our already strong leverage profile and continue to raise the overall quality of our operating portfolio. Even with these dispositions, we are confident in our ability to grow our AFFO per share in 2016. In light of that, as noted in yesterday\u2019s press release, we are pleased to announce a 5.9% increase to our regular quarterly dividend. This increase is driven by our repositioned portfolio, which we believe will perform extremely well in good times and bad. Also with respect to dividends we announced yesterday, a special dividend in the amount of $0.20 per share or about $69 million. This dividend is driven by taxable gains on $1.7 million of dispositions year-to-date, along with additional dispositions we expect to close by year end. As we mentioned from the time we announced other Starwood sale, we wouldn\u2019t know how much if any special dividend would be necessary until later in the year. We implemented various tax paying strategies such as seller financing to reduce the special dividends to a relatively small amount. Nonetheless we\u2019re happy to provide this return to our shareholders. Later, in the call Mark will discuss our near-term capital plan outlook, which takes into account these distribution changes. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim Connor to give a little more color on our leasing activity and development pipeline. Jim Connor : Thanks, Denny. From an operational standpoint we had another solid quarter of leasing totaling nearly 4.5 million square feet. While this is down from our historic levels, it\u2019s a reflection of our continued record high occupancies in the portfolio with little space left to lease. Rent growth on renewal leases was strong at 13%, representing continued landlord pricing power. Total in-service occupancy ended at 95.8%, flat compared to the previous quarter as lease expirations were essentially offset by solid leasing. Now let me summarize a few key market fundamentals and then I\u2019ll close with our development activities. Nationally, the industrial market momentum continues to be very strong. Demand outpaced supply for the 22nd straight quarter. In the third quarter, the U.S. industrial market has 58 million square feet of positive net absorption, bringing year-to-date totals to 175 million square feet. Supply remained in check at 38 million square feet delivered during the quarter, consequently vacancy rates fell by 20 basis points to 9.6% overall. Most of our markets are having record years including the Inland Empire, which had 6.2 million square feet of leasing in the third quarter, bringing their year-to-date total to almost 35 million square feet or 4.5 million square feet more than all of 2014. Turning to development, we generated $110 million of starts during the quarter across five industrial projects and one medical office project. These new developments span markets such as South Florida, Baltimore, Pennsylvania and Minneapolis, and we\u2019re 60% preleased in the aggregate. Our overall development pipeline at the quarter end has 31 projects under construction, totally 7.2 million square feet and a projected $639 million in stabilized costs at our share, they\u2019re 47% preleased in the aggregate. The activity on the vacant portion of this pipeline is very strong across the system as our pipeline for build to suit prospects that should improve the occupancy in our development pipeline in future quarters. We also continue to make significant process -- progress in selling non-strategic land during the quarter. We\u2019ve sold another $23 million, bringing total land sales year-to-date to $94 million, prompting the increase to our land sales guidance for the year. And now let me turn it over to Mark to discuss our financial results and the capital plan. Mark Denien : Thanks, Jim. Core FFO was $0.29 per share for the third quarter 2015, compared to $0.28 per share for the second quarter. The increase in core FFO was primarily due to continued improvement in operating results and the impact of developments being placed in-service, which were partially offset by the dilution from continued dispositions. We generated $0.23 per share in AFFO for the third quarter, compared to $0.25 per share in the second quarter, which is in line with our annual AFFO per share expectations. The decrease in AFFO per share from the second quarter was due to increased capital expenditures during the quarter as a result of the timing of lease commencements. Looking out to the fourth quarter, we expect our CapEx to be lower than it was in the third quarter. Same-property NOI growth for the 12 and three months ended September 30, 2015, was 5.4% and 3.0%, respectively. These same-property results were driven by the increased commencement occupancy and growth in rental rates. Current quarter NOI growth was negatively impacted by about 40 basis points due to some bad debt recoveries in the 2014 period. As noted on the prior call, occupancy growth has slowed a bit in the latter half of the year. We still expect strong rent growth and we\u2019re still comfortable to meet our full year expectations. I will point out that today our non-same property NOI represents roughly 18% of our total NOI and we have significant NOI upside from occupancy growth in those properties. So there\u2019s solid overall NOI upside as we look forward. We ended the third quarter with over $217 million in cash, because of this cash position and expected fourth quarter disposition proceeds, we gave notice of our intent to payoff the $150 million, 5.5% unsecured notes that were due March 1, 2016. This redemption is expected to settle tomorrow. We will also use a portion of this cash to fund the repayment, in order to fund the payment of the special dividend that Denny mentioned. Our credit profile at the end of the third quarter continued to improve as well, using the proceeds from disposition activity to reduce leverage along with improved rental income from operations resulted in fixed charge coverage for the third quarter, improving to 3.0 times and net debt-to-EBITDA from the three months ended September 30th improved to 5.9 times. We expect to see further improvement in these metrics during the fourth quarter with the bond payoff and as new developments are placed in-service and speculative developments are leased up. I would like to take just a moment to address our loan related issue in one of our unconsolidated joint ventures that owns a portfolio of office properties in the Washington DC area where we are the 30% minority partner. This joint venture has a $203 million interest-only non-recourse CMBS loan of which our share is approximately $60 million. Due to recent lease expiration in one of the properties secured by this loan, the joint venture did not make a scheduled principle payment during the quarter and the loan was placed in default, because the value of the properties is below the outstanding loan amount, the joint venture elected not to continue to fund that service. The joint venture and the lender have been working together to effectuate a smooth transfer of ownership of the underlying properties to the loan servicer. This transaction has little to no impact to operating results and will actually improve our leverage ratios due to the high loan to value nature of these properties, also there is no impact to any of our other debt facilities due to the non-recourse nature of this joint venture loan. Now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Denny. Denny Oklak : Thanks, Mark. In review of the year-to-date results and outlook for the remainder of the year, yesterday we raised the low end of guidance for FFO per share by $0.02 per share, narrowing the 2015 range to a $1.15 to a $1.19 per share, effectively raising the midpoint by $0.01. We also narrowed the AFFO per share to a range of a $1.00 to a $1.02 per share. In addition earnings -- into the earnings guidance changes, we raised the narrow land sales guidance from a range of $80 million to $120 million to a range of $100 million to $130 million, up $15 million from the previous midpoint. Also as a result of the highly competitive acquisition market, we reduced our acquisition guidance to $25 million to $50 million, a $75 million reduction again at the midpoint. As noted in yesterday\u2019s earnings release, additional detail on revisions to certain guidance factors can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, including the back page of our quarterly supplemental package, which is a new disclosure this quarter. Let me reemphasize, we once again are proud to have a company with a rock solid balance sheet and a low AFFO pay out ratio position to support raising the regular quarterly common dividend 5.9%. Looking forward, we\u2019re optimistic that the entire Duke Realty team and investment in best-in-class assets can generate steady AFFO growth per share through the economic cycles. We\u2019ll now open the lines up to the audience and we ask participants to keep the dialogue to one question or perhaps two very short questions and you are, of course, welcome to get back into the queue. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And first we will go to the line of Manny Korchman. Manny Korchman : Hi. Just think about MLBs for a second, given all the changes sort of in the healthcare landscape and what\u2019s been happening with hospitals, just wondering if you see any changes on the MLB side of the business? Jim Connor : Hi, Manny. It\u2019s Jim Connor. I\u2019ll take that. I would tell you that the outlook for the entire healthcare industry from our perspective is very, very positive and healthcare systems and hospitals continue to make capital investments. MLBs and ambulatory care facilities lead most investment categories for hospital systems around the country. So I would tell you it has a very bright outlook and we think we\u2019re very well-positioned to continue to grow that portfolio. Manny Korchman : And my other question is on, you mentioned the dispositions for next year, you also mentioned it\u2019s not guidance? But what would be the composition of that, if you could give us sort of first glance? Jim Connor : Well, I think, you can assume that a significant portion that will be some of the remaining office assets there. Again, I think, opportunistically selling some industrial assets or cleaning up a little bit of the industrial portfolio will be a relatively minor piece of that, but there could be some, so mostly office. Manny Korchman : That\u2019s it for me. Thank you. Operator : Next we will go to the line of Brendan Maiorana. Brendan Maiorana : Thanks. Good afternoon. So, Jim or Denny, $550 million to $700 million of development starts this year. It sounds like you guys feel pretty good about the demand outlook that exists out there in your portfolio? As you\u2019re thinking about the next year or so, is that a pretty good annual run rate or do you think you sort of step off the gas a little bit and if you think things are a little bit riskier out there? Jim Connor : Hi, Brendan. This is Jim again. I would tell you late in the year looking out into next year we\u2019re reasonably optimistic that the landscape is going to stay the same. I would tell you that if we take our foot off the gas it will be on the speculative side. As I referenced earlier in my comments, we have a very strong built to suit pipeline and that\u2019s both in the industry and the medical business, because as you all know the medical business really looks and acts pretty much like build to suits. So, if we see a slowing or we get concerned about our in-service occupancies, we\u2019ll let up on the spec development, that will be first and foremost. Manny Korchman : Okay. So and then just related to that for, Mark, so it sounds like you guys expect to be towards the high end of the disposition guidance for this year, so maybe that\u2019s another $250 million of proceeds on dispositions this year? And then if I just take sort of the midpoint of that $500 to $800 of possibility for next year, that\u2019s about $900 million by the end of next year, so that\u2019s probably a little more than your spend on the development pipeline? Is it -- is that a fair way to characterize it and do you think as we sit here a year from now or the end of next year, your leverage is going to be lower than where it is today? Mark Denien : I think that\u2019s a very fair way to look at it, Brendan. After we called the March 16 notes that we\u2019ll payoff tomorrow and we\u2019re using cash already have on hand for that, we\u2019re left with about $360 million of debt next year. So you take $360 million of debt and the midpoint of that kind of development of $500 million, $700 million, something like that, that gets closer to the $900 million you just talked about. So we really believe that through the disposition process we can fund the development and maybe not all, but most if not all of the debt that\u2019s coming through next year, which would then leave us with a better balance sheet than we have today even. Manny Korchman : Great. Thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll go to the line of Juan Sanabria. Juan Sanabria : Hi. Good afternoon. I was just hoping you could speak to maybe the occupancy expectations as we end the year and if that\u2019s the biggest variable in your same-store NOI range for the balance of this year given what you\u2019ve achieved year-to-date? Denny Oklak : I\u2019ll start with it, Juan and then Jim, can chime in. But we do have quite a bit of new development coming online in the fourth quarter. So I am not really talking about same-property occupancy, I am talking about overall in-service occupancy, if you look at the page in our supplemental that list when our developments are coming in line. In the fourth quarter we have about 1.7 million square feet coming online, it\u2019s only 16% occupied. So that pipeline right there is what\u2019s going to drive our occupancy most likely down a little bit at year end from where we stand today and that will drive our average occupancy for the year down just a little bit, but you know we\u2019re still very comfortable, probably midpoint to upper half of our occupancy range for the year. And then from a same-property perspective, that population just talked about, obviously, won\u2019t impact same-property, because it\u2019s new property. I think you could see the occupancy in the same-property to be relatively flat from where we are right now. So we continue to measure ourselves against the higher base from the previous year because of all the occupancy lease up that we\u2019ve done. So that\u2019s what putting a little bit of pressure on that same-property NOI growth and maybe, Jim, can speak more generally on overall leasing prospects? Jim Connor : Yeah. I would -- only other comment that I would make is, we have just a couple of leases rolling at the end of the year that we know we\u2019re not going to renew. So really we control our own destiny in terms of, as Mark said, leasing up the develop that\u2019s coming in service and we have a lot of activity and as I alluded to earlier, a lot of strong demand in the marketplace. So, I think, we\u2019re confident that we are continue to lease that spec space up that\u2019s coming in service and continue to hold those high occupancies that you\u2019re seeing. Juan Sanabria : Great. And just a quick follow up, with regards to the expirees next year, how do you see those placed relative to market as we think maybe about same-store NOI growth and then sort of flat occupancy type world? Denny Oklak : Well, as we talked at NAREIT and many of the other conferences, we kind of break all the lease roll-up into three different tranches. Looking out the next 18 months and that\u2019s a time period that we\u2019ve referenced a number of times before in different conversations, 25% of the leases that are rolling in the next 18 months were leases that were signed in the trough period. Mark Denien : 35%. Denny Oklak : 35%. Mark Denien : 35%. Denny Oklak : Mark just corrected me, 35%. So there we think we have significant upside and as we\u2019ve discussed before 20%, 25% is not uncommon for those trough leases. And then about the third of the leases, we have moderate upside. We typically look to 5% to 10% there. And then the rest third we think they\u2019re flat, there might even be some that that effectively have to get rolled down, because they were made at the peak in 2007 or maybe 2008. But, overall, we still think -- we\u2019ve still got some runway in the existing portfolio with the leases that are coming due. Juan Sanabria : Thank you. Operator : Next we will go to the line of Ki Bin Kim. Ki Bin Kim : Thank you and good afternoon. Could you comment about the changing strategies from ecommerce companies like Amazon, I think a few years ago it was to be in more of the non-intercity MSAs where they had some favorable tax treatment and things like that? And maybe now with their desire to be more same day delivery, are you seeing any kind of incremental shift from ecommerce-based companies that are moving away from like Arizona and more into population centers at all? Denny Oklak : Sure. Ki Bin, I can give you a little bit of color there. I would say, first and foremost, we are not seeing any slowdown by any of our major ecommerce clients in the large fulfillment centers. Those are still the backbone of their logistics and supply chain models. What you are seeing and the trend has really picked up some momentum this year is the smaller infill facilities. These are typically 50,000 to 75,000 feet and much closer into the major population areas. And this is really what everybody in the industry is referring to the last mile. So you can all remember in the not too distant past when the buzz word was two-day delivery and two day went to next day and next day went to same day and now a number of the ecommerce leaders are going to delivery models where for a small premium they can get you your box inside of two hours. And that\u2019s really what this last mile was all about. It\u2019s having limited inventory of high volume products close in to major metropolitan areas where they can affect delivery inside of a 90 to 120 minute window. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. And could you comment on the type of buyers that are out there for your suburban office sales that you\u2019ve had in the past couple of quarters and maybe a similar question for, I mean, the higher quality industrial? Denny Oklak : Well, I think even the big -- the obviously the big transaction we did this year was with Starwood so far, so a private equity-type buyer. I think a lot of the transactions we\u2019ve done are with those same type of buyers in the suburban office. So generally speaking, a little more leveraged kind of buyers again taking advantage of today\u2019s low interest rates makes the risk of owning suburban office a little bit elastic, low interest rates. And some of them are national. I would say national buyers. Some of them are smaller private buyers. That more depends on the size of the transaction, so that\u2019s typical on the suburban office. On the warehouse product that we sold this year including the one larger project we saw in the third quarter, I would say a little bit more institutional type buyers. Some private equity folks in there too for smaller product but more institutional. Ki Bin Kim : Are there any other big portfolios out there that are being marketed for sale? Denny Oklak : For us, you mean? Ki Bin Kim : Yeah. Denny Oklak : No. As we\u2019ve said, I think we\u2019ve still got some suburban office assets mainly in Cincinnati where our wholly-owned stuff is now and just a couple here in Indianapolis right now that are all on the market. But there\u2019s nothing I guess that I would say is big and so in the remaining guidance we have for dispositions anyway. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Next we\u2019ll go the line of Eric Frankel. Eric Frankel : Thank you. I guess my questions are more related to land. So one could you describe some of the land transactions you\u2019ve completed this quarter and you expect to next quarter? And second perhaps you can touch upon future development starts? How much of it\u2019s going to consist of land monetization? How much of it\u2019s probably going to consist of new land purchases and either new markets or just new locations? Thank you. Jim Connor : Sure, Eric. It\u2019s Jim and I\u2019ll address that. From a land perspective, most of the land buyers we have today are combination of either generally private parties that are in the office business, private developers are buying the office land. We have converted a fair bit of our office land to alternative uses primarily apartment and multi-family. So they should be the kind of the two biggest buyer groups. And as we know the strength of the retail market and the multi-family market, we\u2019re getting very good pricing on those dispositions, specifically down in Florida where we sold some of the suburban office land. So from the buyer perspective that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. In terms of our development, we have a goal of continuing to monetize all that non-strategic land that we\u2019ve identified. So we think we can prune another probably upwards of $100 million of non-strategic land. And that\u2019s comprised of some of the residual office land that we have in some of our portfolios and some industrial land where we think we may have too much and be over invested in certain submarkets. But most of the land that we\u2019ll monetize will come from development as we put buildings into production on the existing land base. So overall it\u2019s a combination of the two. But I would say the majority of it\u2019s going to come from development and then some from additional land sales. Eric Frankel : Okay. I guess, I can just go back into the queue but just a housekeeping question. Mark, on the conveyance of the properties in suburban DC, is that going to marked as a disposition or no? Mark Denien : I am not sure to be honest with you, Eric. We\u2019ll obviously make sure the disclosure is very clear. We did in the supplemental right now. We\u2019ve taken all the properties, all the operations and all the debt off the books just like it was any other property we would\u2019ve sold. I can tell you it\u2019s really not part of our disposition guidance if that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting at. And I would just remind you that our share of the debt is $60 million. So the way we look at it, we\u2019re taking $60 million worth of properties off, $60 million of debt off and they kind of wash out. But when they are actually finally turned over to the lender, we\u2019ll make sure the disclosure is very clear on that. Eric Frankel : Yes. Okay. Thank you. I\u2019ll jump back in the queue. Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Michael Carroll. Michael Carroll : Thanks. Given the strong capital position that you guys have, is the company interested in completing any acquisitions and if not, what\u2019s holding you back? Is pricing just too frothy right now? Denny Oklak : Yeah. I guess. Mike, I would say we would be interested in doing some acquisitions but really just what you said. I mean, generally speaking the pricing is holding us back. It\u2019s still pretty expensive out there. And that\u2019s why we continue to really focus on the disposition side right now. And we\u2019re again as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we\u2019re very pleased with pricing we\u2019re getting. Mark Denien : And I guess the only -- I am sorry -- Mark, the only thing I would add to that is we\u2019ve got a very strong development pipeline. We\u2019re really able to use the proceeds and the balance sheet that we have today to take advantage of those development opportunities. Michael Carroll : Thank you. Operator : Next we\u2019ll go the line of Vance Edelson. Vance Edelson : Great. Thanks. So given the strengths and demand, could you differentiate between class A, B, and C industrial space from what you\u2019re seeing? Are all the asset classes performing well now because occupancy is high and there\u2019s no place to really go for the tenants or are there still some important differences in performance and the ability to raise rents at this stage in the cycle? Denny Oklak : Vance, I would tell you and as I touched on with the macro numbers, it\u2019s pretty good across all markets and submarkets. I can speak to A and B. Clearly A and that\u2019s what all the new product that\u2019s being developed. We\u2019re at the absolute top of the price point with those products. I think for the class B and we do still own a little bit of class B in some of the smaller assets. As we\u2019ve seen, for instance, the housing industry continue to come back probably not as strong as it did in the last cycle but they\u2019ve made comebacks. That small to mid-sized space is continuing to lease. So we\u2019re starting to see some good rent growth opportunities there. And I happy to say I don\u2019t think we own any class C properties. You\u2019ll have to ask one of my peers. Vance Edelson : Yeah. I was asking more about market wide because if the class C is filled up and that\u2019s doing well then tenants can\u2019t trade down. And they\u2019re really forced to go to class A or class B which actually increases demand for you somewhat market wide? Denny Oklak : I think that\u2019s reasonable conclusion. I think it\u2019s pretty much hitting on all cylinders out there. And that\u2019s a very favorable environment for us and that\u2019s why we\u2019re continuing to be out there pushing rents. Vance Edelson : Okay. And then just a quick follow up on what you said about land. As you keep an eye out for parcels to acquire, are the higher and better uses such as multi-family or even data centers presenting competition so to speak. And is that perhaps a factor that\u2019s helping keep industrial supply off the market? Denny Oklak : Well we don\u2019t -- when we\u2019re buying land for industrial -- and our company has really changed its culture in terms of how we buy land for our industrial portfolio. But we\u2019re not competing for residential use as much as we were probably in the last cycle. So we\u2019re not seeing that much competition. Thankfully we\u2019re not really in the office development business anymore and we\u2019re not out buying land. That\u2019s where I think you\u2019re seeing more of the competition would be the multi-family guys competing for suburban office land and bidding the price up. So it\u2019s not much of an impact for us. The greater challenge for us is really more on the entitlement process for industrial. It\u2019s not competing with residential or multi-family development. Vance Edelson : Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : And next we\u2019ll go to the line of Dave Rodgers. Dave Rodgers : Good afternoon, guys. Jim, a question for you I guess on industrial. You talked about a pretty good build-to-suit pipeline, sounds like maybe spec comes down as a percentage of the total. But I guess I just wanted to push a little bit on that in terms of are you seeing anything and kind of the lease-up assets that you\u2019re working with that give you pause, doing more spec development on the industrial side? And I guess the flip side of that is do you have enough demand for build-to-suits that the pipeline can get meaningfully larger in terms of what you\u2019re building as you move into 2016? Jim Connor : Let me take those in kind of reverse order. Yes on the build-to-suits. The development pipeline is still very strong on the build-to-suit side both again industrial and in healthcare. So as we begin to formulate our thoughts about guidance for next year which of course we\u2019re not giving yet, we look at how we think the build-to-suit pipeline is going to hold up for next year. And then we look at how the leasing progress is going on our spec development that\u2019s already underway and how much spec risk we think we can take on and still maintain the performance of the portfolio. If you look at where we are year-to-date and where we would expect to finish the year, spec is only about 35% of our total portfolio which is significantly less than most of our peers. And as we\u2019ve said, with a strong build-to-suit pipeline and we can all remember not too long ago what the effect of all that spec space was when the market starts to turn. We\u2019ve taken a little bit more conservative approach and we\u2019re still comfortable with that. Dave Rodgers : Okay. And maybe just one follow-up on the office side. I don\u2019t know if this is Mark or Jim, but as you look at your occupancy in suburban office, I think it\u2019s about 89%. Do you feel comfortable transacting at that level or will you drive occupancy higher before any sales? And I guess the bigger question there is should we expect any impact on AFFO next year in terms of what you would guide to as you come out later or early next year in terms of what AFFO could look like if you\u2019re really leasing up office aggressively to sell it? Mark Denien : Dave, I\u2019ll take that one. I would say the occupancy at 89% is really not having any effect in our dispositions. We\u2019re selling actively out of that pipeline. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see a lot of movement in that occupancy. Again it just depends on the mix of dispositions. Same thing I would say the occupancy probably would start picking up a little bit based on what we\u2019ve got in the pipeline to sell now. You know, as we keep saying the sale of those suburban office assets really is just accretive to our AFFO going forward and we anticipate that same thing to occur on the office dispositions that will happen in 2016 also. Jim Connor : Dave, I would just add from an AFFO perspective. Looking at what we already have on the market right now, you\u2019d just continue to see the capital expenditures related to office go down as we continue to sell it. So there may be some incremental leasing done but on a net-net basis that will continue to head south. Dave Rodgers : Great. Thanks. Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to the line of John Guinee. John Guinee : Great. Thank you. A couple quick ones. I guess, Jim, all of your vacancy is really and your big vacancy is in Perris Logistics Center in Southern California, something in Pennsylvania and Camp Creek in Atlanta. I know where Camp Creek is in Atlanta. But I have no idea where the other two assets are. Where is Perris Logistics Center and where is 33 Logistics Park? Mark Denien : John, you\u2019ve got to get out more. John Guinee : I know, I know. Denny Oklak : You didn\u2019t know we were international, John? John Guinee : No. Denny Oklak : The Perris Logistics Center is in the Inland Empire East, John. We bought a site there last year and immediately put about half of it into production with the 780,000 foot building that we have and that will be completed and come into service later this quarter. And then the Pennsylvania building you were talking about is at the Eastern end of the Lehigh Valley. John Guinee : Got you. Okay. And then Mark, I guess, the self-funding concept is a wonderful, wonderful concept music to my ears. But it\u2019s a lot easier said than done to sell stabilized assets and 1031 exchange them into development sites. Have you guys figured out a way to do that or do you have enough room in your taxable income to cover any gains out of the asset sales within the current dividend structure? Mark Denien : Well, as we weren\u2019t able to give, John, guidance earlier this year on what our special dividend would be for this year, it\u2019s really difficult to give it for next year at this point in time. But for some perspective, even if you just say we\u2019re at the top end of that number Denny threw out of $800 million of dispositions next year. If you compare that to the $2 billion we did this year and we\u2019re only paying a $0.20 special dividend this year. I think that would give you some indication that we do have some maneuvering and some room that we should be able to work through that with what I would call a fairly immaterial issue to deal with. John Guinee : Got you guys. Okay. Thanks a lot. Have a good Halloween. Operator : And we do have a couple in queue with follow-ups. We\u2019ll go to the line of Brendan Maiorana. Brendan Maiorana : Thanks. So you guys sold the Delaware Amazon building. They\u2019re still your second biggest tenant. Do you foresee additional sales of the Amazon facilities throughout the remainder of the country or was it just you didn\u2019t like the Delaware location as much as the others and that\u2019s why you decided to market it? Denny Oklak : Well, I guess what I\u2019d say, Brendan -- Amazon is our largest tenant or our second largest now I think after the sale but -- and we\u2019ve done a lot of development for them. But we\u2019ve been pretty particular about where we develop. They\u2019ve done a lot of projects in I\u2019d call sort of second, third tier distribution markets, great for them but not so great for us. So we\u2019ve pretty much shied away from those markets and the Amazon development that we have done we\u2019ve been -- we like it because we know that even if at some point in time they leave, those assets are in a great distribution markets and we can release those. So the Delaware site with Amazon was also a very -- we got very comfortable with that site but again with exposure to Amazon as well as a little bit out of the way location compared to any other Amazon building that we own, we thought we\u2019d take advantage of the market. Brendan Maiorana : Okay. All right. So, it sounds like a little more one-off there. And then just last one I had, more of a housekeeping question for Mark, the $368 million of mortgages, looks like a pretty high interest rate on those. Timing of when those mature during \u201816? Is that more early part of the year, middle? Mark Denien : Yeah. Brendan, there\u2019s probably eight or nine different loans there but the biggest is about 300 -- close to a $350 million CMBS loan that we have. It actually matures in December but it\u2019s prepayable with no penalty in May. So I think it\u2019s pretty safe to assume that May would be a good take out date. Brendan Maiorana : Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : And next we\u2019ll go to the line of Eric Frankel. Eric Frankel : Thank you. Just a couple quick follow-up questions. One, could you touch on the MD office market a little bit? It looks like occupancy has picked up there pretty meaningfully? Jim Connor : Sure, Eric. I mean, our Indianapolis office portfolio has always performed pretty well and even during the height of the recession, the Indianapolis office, our Indianapolis office portfolio never dipped below 90%. So it\u2019s been a strong performer for us. And as Denny alluded to earlier with us about finished in Cincinnati, you\u2019ll start to see us selectively prune the Indianapolis office portfolio. Eric Frankel : Okay. Denny Oklak : I think one other thing there, Eric. Eric Frankel : Sure. Denny Oklak : We put -- built 100% lease built-to-suit I think in the third quarter. So I think that ticked up the occupancy a little bit. Eric Frankel : Right. Understood. Okay. Actually I have two more questions. Second question is related to the Panama Canal. That is now expected to open next year? Just want to get your thoughts on potential changes in trade flow, East Coast ports? Can they actually accommodate these ships in your view? Is it going to affect demands in any way? Any color would be appreciated? Obviously your Savannah market seems to be holding up much better. Denny Oklak : Sure Eric. I can give you a couple of the general comments. Clearly we think it\u2019s going to beneficial for the Eastern Seaboard markets. And I would also include the Gulf markets like Houston. But we think the impact is going to be very slow to take place. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see really meaningful movement across the Eastern Seaboard for potentially upwards of 10 years. And while that sounds surprising, if you just think about the whole logistic supply chain network, companies do not make changes in that overnight. And you\u2019re talking about changes in rail lines, trains and changing in trucking and distribution, new facilities being built. So I think you\u2019ll continue to see it evolve over the next 10 years but it\u2019s going to be a very positive thing for the Gulf and East Coast markets. Eric Frankel : Great. Okay. Thank you. The final question is related to the dispositions you didn\u2019t necessarily highlight, maybe some additional color on that would be great. Denny Oklak : I am not sure what color are you looking for there? Eric Frankel : Just pricing, how much you actually sold and where the assets are just that type of detail. Denny Oklak : For the third quarter? Eric Frankel : Yes. For the third quarter. There\u2019s a Cincinnati office portfolio, the Amazon building in Delaware and then there\u2019s a remainder which we don\u2019t really know where it is. Denny Oklak : I am sorry. I didn\u2019t understand the question. Yeah it\u2019s just miscellaneous things. There was another office asset in Cincinnati that was outside that portfolio. There was a small. It was basically an industrial asset down in South Florida that was originally part of that Premier acquisition we did but wasn\u2019t exactly an industrial asset and we sold it. It was more of a flex retail kind of product. We sold a couple things here at south here in Indianapolis. Some miscellaneous small industrial, single story office kind of products. So it was just a bunch of different little things that we keep cleaning up the portfolio. Eric Frankel : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And no one else is in queue with a question. Denny Oklak : I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining the call today. We look forward to reconvening here in our fourth quarter call, tentatively scheduled for January 28, 2016 and hope to see many of you at the Fall NAREIT Conference in about two and a half weeks as well. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

And later there will be an opportunity for questions and answers with instructions given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, your conference call is being recorded. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference call over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Ron Hubbard. Please go ahead. Ronald Hubbard : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter and year end 2015 earnings call. Joining me today are Jim Connor, President and CEO and Mark Denien, Chief Financial Officer. Before we make our prepared remarks, let me remind you that statements we make today are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For more information about those risk factors, we would refer you to our December 31, 2014, 10-K that we have on file with the SEC. Now for our prepared statement, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim Connor. James Connor : Thank you, Ron and good afternoon everybody. Let me start off by saying that\u2019s why we are not in the telecommunications business and we are in the real estate business. But now we will get started. Let me start off by saying that 2015 was another excellent year for Duke Realty. We exceeded all of our beginning of the year goal and capped the year off with an excellent fourth quarter. Let me recap our outstanding year. We signed nearly 22 million square foot of leases, which we believe is especially impressive given our all time high occupancy levels. We improved in-service occupancy to an all time record high of 96.1%, which is up from 95.4% at prior year end. And we grew same property NOI at 4.7% and grew rents on renewal leases by 12%. We commenced $684 million in new development starts and completed $1.8 billion in property dispositions, substantially reducing our office exposure to 8% of our NOI. We sold $132 million of non-strategic land and monetized another $93 million through our development activities. In total, we recycled the almost $1 billion of proceeds to fund our development needs for the year and payoff over $1 billion of debt to significantly delever the balance sheet. All are growing AFFO per share about 5.2%. Finally, we raised our regular quarterly common dividend by 5.9% in light of the stronger balance sheet and low payout ratio. We also paid a $0.20 per share special dividend in December. I\u2019ll now touch a bit on our leasing development activity from the fourth quarter. We had a very good quarter in leasing with over 6.7 million square feet executed and also commenced $238 million of new development starts. One of our notable leases includes the 783,000 square foot lease executed on our speculative development in the Inland Empire that is just completed in the fourth quarter. This leads with the new customer which happens to be one of the world\u2019s largest online only home furnishings retailers. This is another example of our expertise and commitment to be in the nations leading e-commerce real estate solutions provider. I would like note that in year-end all but four of our 22 industrial markets were 95% lease or higher on an in-service basis, with an overall in-service occupancy level for our industrial portfolio of 96.5%. Our medical office portfolio continues to produce strong results ending the year with in-service occupancy at 95.5%, that\u2019s 120 basis point improvement over year-end 2014 and tenant retention rate for the full-year is 86%. As we stated before the low volatility and growing NOI nature of this portfolio should contribute to a better risk adjusted earning stream for the overall company. Turning to development for the fourth quarter, we started $238 million of development projects across seven deals. We signed three 100% pre-leased industrial developments, totaling 1.4 million square feet with the largest being a 1 million square foot facility for Amazon in Columbus, Ohio. The Amazon deals for term of 15 years and is a joint venture in our Rickenbacker Intermodal Park. We also begin two speculative industrial developments during the quarter, one for 403,000 square feet in Chicago and the other for 490,000 square feet in our Northern New Jersey. Both of these submarkets have vacancy rates in the 5% to 6% range with a strong demand outlook for the year and we already have the solid list of prospects. On the medical side, we started two on-campus facilities, totaling 158,000 square feet in aggregate which were combined to 75% pre-leased. Including the solid fourth quarter activity, our development pipeline at year-end is over $665 million with a weighted average stabilized initial cash yield of 6.9% and it\u2019s expected to generate a GAAP yields of 7.5%. This will produce margins consistent with our historical 18% to 20% range. The aggregate pre-leasing level is 58% which is up a bit from previous quarters as expected. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Mark to discuss our financial results and our capital plans. Mark Denien : Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon everyone. I am pleased to report the core FFO for the quarter was $0.29 per share compared to $0.30 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014. Core FFO for the quarter when compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 was impacted by 2015 disposition activity. Improved operational performance partially offset the impact of these dispositions. We reported core FFO of $1.17 per share for the full-year 2015, compared to $1.18 per share for 2014. Core FFO was impacted by lower income from service operations in 2015 as a result of a decrease focus on third-party construction projects and lower income from joint venture management. The lost FFO from 2015 dispositions was substantially offset by the impact of deleveraging, improved operational performance, and incremental NOI from new development project deliveries. I am very pleased to report AFFO of $1.01 per share for the full-year 2015 and $0.24 per share for the fourth quarter. 2015 AFFO represents a 5.2% growth rate over 2014, which is impressive given the level of dispositions and deleveraging for the year. AFFO for the full-year 2015 translates into a payout ratio of 68%. Looking forward we expect to be able to continue to grow AFFO per share and we\u2019ll evaluate our dividend to maintain a conservative AFFO payout ratio in the 65% to 75% range. I would like to take a moment to address a joint venture related land impairment charge that is not included in our core FFO. During the fourth quarter we made a decision that we would actively seek to exit our retail joint venture in Linden, New Jersey. We have previously bought 57 acres of industrial land from this joint venture on which we have developed over 1.1 million square feet of modern bulk industrial product. Retail development on remaining land in this joint venture has been held up for several years due to ongoing zoning and land used litigation. The decision to exit this joint venture triggered a $19.5 million impairment charge this is included in our GAAP losses from joint ventures and also in our core FFO adjustment of $35 million of land impairment charges recognized during the quarter. The remaining land impairment charges relate to some office parcels, both on balance sheet and in joint ventures that were either sold in the fourth quarter or expected to be sold in early 2016. Overall, we had another solid quarter from an operational standpoint and now I will quickly recap capital activities for the quarter. We utilize the disposition proceeds generated during 2015 to fund our development pipeline as well as to reduce leverage. As discussed last quarter we also used a portion of 2015 disposition proceeds to pay a special dividend of $0.20 per share in December. As previously announced in October we repaid a $150 million of 5.5% unsecured notes that had an original maturity date of March 2016. We believe that this transaction was an excellent use of available cash and help to further improve our key leverage metrics. For the full-year 2015 we repaid $831 million of unsecured notes and $231 million of secured debt. Our expectation is for another strong year of net dispositions in 2016. The proceeds of which will be used to fund our development pipeline and for 2016 debt maturities, which will help us to deleverage further. The level of plan dispositions in 2016 may result in another relatively minor special dividend for 2016. Combining the additional capital we anticipate generating in 2016 and with the significant improvements we\u2019ve already made to the balance sheet in 2015. We are well-positioned to continue to improve our leverage metrics this year. I am very pleased to announce some very good external news regarding this balance sheet progress. Just last week both Moody\u2019s and Standard & Poor's raised our credit outlook to positive from stable and maintained our credit ratings at Baa2 and BBB respectively. We are optimistic that further improvement in operations and deleveraging will propel us to a high BBB credit rating in the not-too-distant future. Now I will turn the call back over to Jim. James Connor : Thanks, Mark. Yesterday, we announced a range for 2016 core FFO per share of a $1.15 to $1.21 with a midpoint of a $1.18 and AFFO per share of $1.02 to $1.08 a share with a midpoint of $1.05. In addition we are also introducing a range for NAREIT-defined FFO per share of a $1.12 to $1.24 with a midpoint per share of a $1.18. First from a macro outlook perspective we expect the economic environment in 2016 to continue at about its current pace, yet with a bit more volatility and possibly some downside if the recent turmoil continues with uncertainty about China and the impact of oil prices. We are however a bit more optimistic on continued favorable industrial supply demand fundamentals that can support rent growth and new development starts. For 2015, U.S. industrial demand outpaced supply by over 90 million square feet. Nationwide availabilities continue to fall and are at all-time lows for the modern industrial era. Assuming the markets reached supply demand equilibrium in late 2016 or early 2017, we still see opportunity for rent growth, albeit at slower levels than the past few years. This is particularly evident given e-commerce tailwinds, a positive outlook on consumer spending and our strong track record of executing strategic development projects across our nationwide platform. As we anticipate having virtually exited the suburban office business by the end of 2016, we are providing our guidance on operational metrics such as occupancy and same-store property growth on industrial and medical office assets only. We believe this is the best way to think about and model the Company on a go forward basis. And this is how we plan to report actual results beginning in the first quarter. A few specifics on some of the anticipated key performance metrics outlined in the 2016 range of estimates page provided in the back of our supplemental package and on our website are as follows. Our average in-service occupancy range for the industrial and MOB on a combined basis for 2016 is expected to be 95.4% to 96.4%. I would point out that we do expect the in-service occupancy in the first quarter to drop from current levels, due mainly to spec development projects coming online along with the typical first quarter decline due to seasonal industrial expirations and contractions. Same-property NOI for industrial and MOB on a combined basis is projected to grow at a range of 2.75% to 4.25% which is based on steady occupancy and continued rental rate growth and embedded lease escalations. On the capital recycling front, we expect proceeds from building dispositions in the range of $600 million to $900 million and proceeds from land dispositions of another $20 million to $60 million. These dispositions include nearly all of our remaining office portfolio, consistent with an exhibit we published in our November 2015 investor presentation. The results should be that our office exposure will be in the very low single-digit percentage of our NOI by year end. I will also reiterate that while these dispositions will be diluted to FFO, we expect the capital recycling to generate positive AFFO growth. Acquisitions are projected in the range of zero to $50 million. We expect to continue to be very selective given today\u2019s pricing environment. Development starts are projected in the range of $400 million to $600 million and above 50% preleased. We expect to fund our development pipeline with proceeds from our building and land dispositions. Service operations should be in the range of $8 million to $12 million below our 2015 run rate as we continue to emphasize on balance sheet development over third-party work and a continued decline in fees from joint ventures as we continue to reduce our investment in these joint ventures. We would also like to introduce financial credit metric expectations for the first time, all measured on a year-end or fourth quarter run rate basis as follows. Effective leverage, measured on a book basis, is projected to continue to decrease and finish the year in a range of 38% to 42% highlighted by the expected repayment of roughly $330 million of secured debt in the May timeframe, sourced from disposition proceeds as noted above. Fixed charge coverage is projected to increase to 3.3 to 3.6 times on a fourth quarter 2016 run rate basis. And net debt-to-EBITDA is projected to range between 5.6 and 6 times on a fourth quarter 2016 run rate basis. Now, before we open up the line, I would like to acknowledge our entire Duke Realty team for their efforts producing another great year of execution on our real estate operations and capital recycling. Our collective actions are producing reliable steady cash flow growth for our shareholders. I would also like to give special thanks to our outgoing CEO and now Executive Chairman, Denny Oklak for his 29 years of service and 12 years of leadership as the CEO at Duke Realty. Denny has not only left an indelible mark on what is a leading first class corporate culture here, he mentored and personally touched many of us here at Duke Realty in ways that words can\u2019t describe. And what many of you listening in can appreciate, Denny also left his mark as one of the pioneers in industry group leaders since the dawn of the modern REIT industry from the mid-1990s. Going forward, all of us here at Duke Realty look forward to carrying on the culture and strategic direction that the leadership under Denny has practiced, a formula that we firmly believe will continue to drive shareholder outperformance. And now, we will open up the lines for some questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Juan Sanabria. Please go ahead. Juan Sanabria : Hi, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me have some time. For the dispositions, what are you guys thinking in terms of cap rates? If you could give us a little more color on what markets, in the office market in particular, you're looking to exit and any bias you're thinking about in terms of when the sales will actually be executed? James Connor : Well, Juan let me start off and then I\u2019ll let Mark to add a little bit of color. I would tell you as we\u2019ve looked in our projected budget in detail. I think you\u2019ll see the cap rates average in the mid-5s. Those will range from low in the 5s. What I said? Juan Sanabria : You said mid-5 that would be pretty good. James Connor : That would be pretty good, mid-7s, at the low end - sorry about that. On the low end we will have asset, the number of our high-end assets that will be sold in the mid-to-low-5s and some of our lesser quality assets with cap rate as high as in 9% or perhaps 10%. So on average we are looking in the mid-7s. Mark Denien : Yes, as far as timing Juan, I think you will see \u2013 we\u2019ve already closed on some that kind of spilled over from 2015 and 2016, but on balance I think it will happen fairly evenly during the year. So that would suggest our $150 million to $200 million give or take for quarter on average. Juan Sanabria : And just is your bias to be towards the high end of the disposition range? And what markets will be left in the office pool? James Connor : Well, today as we detailed in most of our investor conferences in the fourth quarter, the largest single ownership is in Indianapolis. And we started disposing of Indianapolis office assets in the fourth quarter with a two-building package. And we\u2019re in the process of looking at and evaluating how is the market, the balance of the portfolio throughout the year. So Indianapolis is the largest single concentration and then from there its really selling mostly one-off asset some of which are joint venture assets, some of which are wholly-owned that are around the country, some of which we have been working to stabilize, some of which we\u2019ve been waiting for debt to expire. So it\u2019s a combination of reasons, how they have ended up the bottom of list, that\u2019s kind of the overview. Juan Sanabria : Okay, great. And then on the demand side for bulk, have you guys seen any softening across any of your key industries or tenants or geographies that is either on the developments or just regular course leasing that is an area of concern or something you are watching? Obviously, Mark is a bit skittish on whether we get a recession or not. James Connor : Juan, I don\u2019t think any of our local operating teams have reported that or can point to any weakening sectors, most of our concern I would tell you is geographically based where we are following the supply and demand balance. We\u2019ve reported last quarter that and I think many of us share, a little bit concerned about Houston. We have less of that concern and probably our peers in the office and the apartment side, but yet we are watching that closely. And I think several of us have alluded to the supply side in Dallas. There is a lot of product on the market in Dallas. They had a phenomenal year in terms of absorption and all-time high, but there is a lot of product available down there. Beyond that we see the markets in great balance and really good demand from our customer base. Juan Sanabria : Great and just one last quick one. Have you guys seen any impact to MOB cap rates in the transaction market just given the cost of capital issues with some of the healthcare-focused REITs? James Connor : No, we have not been the sellers of MOB since 2013 and 2014 when we clean up the portfolio. We are still seeing very strong and growing demand by the hospitals and healthcare systems and we\u2019ve seen no impact on yields and projected cap rates from any of the interest effect. Juan Sanabria : Thanks guys. Operator : And we will next go to the line of David Toti. Your line is open. David Toti : Hey good afternoon, guys. Just quickly, a couple of high-level questions. First, with regard to some of the conversations you have had with your MOB tenants, is there any hesitation in front of the election, any expectation for structural change in healthcare that could impact the MOB development, the structural development as we've seen it the last couple of years? Anything from the conversations of note that might be shifting? James Connor : No, David, I would tell you, in fact, it\u2019s exactly the opposite. Most of the major hospitals and healthcare systems particularly those that we do business with who are financially very strong, are continuing their very strong capital investment programs across the system. So our pipeline for MOB has probably never been healthier in terms of projects and opportunities with not only our existing client base, but new client base, and that is affording us opportunities for some geographic expansion, which has always been a goal of ours in the MOB portfolio. David Toti : Okay, that's helpful. Then just one other question. One of your peers mentioned on the call earlier this week that they expected to see some value deterioration in industrial assets, potentially in secondary and tertiary markets, so where the fundamentals weren't as strong as the landscape or as fundamentals in the industrial space plateaued. Do you have the same expectation going into 2016, 2017? It sounds like from your opening remarks that you expect sort of a plateau as well. Would you also expect value shifts in a similar fashion? James Connor : While I anticipate more of a plateau, I don\u2019t anticipate any yield or margin erosion in 2016. I think the earliest that we would be concerned about that might be 2017 when some of the supply and demand side markets reach equilibrium. We are not anticipating cap rates to move north dramatically. The amount of capital that out there, the introduction to foreign capital and sovereign wealth funds making big acquisitions in the industrial side. We think its going to continue to keep cap rate pressure down where it is. So I would tell you, no I don\u2019t see erosion. I think they will stay flat for the year, we will see how 2017 shapes up. Operator : We will next go to the line of Jeremy Metz. Your line is open. Jeremy Metz : Hi, I was just wondering; in terms of the same-store guidance of 2.75% to 4.25%, can you just break that down for us? How it looks between the industrial and then for the MOBs and maybe what's baked into guidance for rent spreads in 2016? Mark Denien : Yes, Jeremy its Mark. I think industrial MOB will be probably pretty close together so I would think each of them will be at the midpoint in close to the mid-3s. As far as rental rate guidance, we are still projecting double-digit rental growth on all of our industrial deals that we\u2019re doing; we\u2019re about 14% in the fourth quarter. We\u2019ve mentioned this before, we track all leases that we have coming at us for the next 12 to 18 months and out of all those leases looking out over those next 18 months about a third of them were still - are still left that were signed in that 2009 to 2011 time period. So we really want to try to puts rents really hard on those up into the maybe the high-teens and then the other on balance, will get us down in the \u2013 still we think the low double digit for rent growth on industrial. Jeremy Metz : Okay, appreciate that. Then a quick one on G&A. You're obviously calling for it to be relatively flat here, so just wondering later in the year, as you finish cycling out of the rest of the suburban office sales, is this something we should see trend lower from here and into 2017? Mark Denien : No, I think you will see our G&A load still fairly flat I mean I think we done a good job of reducing expenses over the years as we moved out of that product type. But I am not sure that we can get anymore efficient than we already are. Obviously there will be overhead changes whether it be additions or deductions, but I think that will be driven all the way down to the property level. So those costs aren\u2019t really residing in G&A anyway. Operator : And we\u2019ll move to the line of Ki Bin Kim. Please go ahead. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. Could you comment on potential buyer mindsets on expectations for industrial real estate? Have they changed at all? James Connor : Ki Bin, I think it depends on the buyer profile and whether we are selling Class A long-term well leased industrial buildings or some of our high quality office versus some of our probably lesser quality or one-off assets, I think the range is clearly across the board, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re expecting any significant changes in buyers underwriting expectations since the things that we\u2019ve since in the latter half of 2015. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. And to follow-up on the previous question on G&A, I mean I am a little bit surprised that your G&A is kind of flat year-on-year after you've sold probably close to $2 billion this year and last year of assets. But I guess my question is, if you also include the service income or net service income, that's expected to come down a little bit. I know in the past you said that's in a way your buffer that you can use that personnel to do more development or less. But given that your start guidance has come down a little bit, maybe you could comment on the longer-term trajectory of that part of the business, service income and people? Mark Denien : Well, I think that will ebb and flow over time Ki Bin, but our start guidance is down, but I\u2019d tell you that our volume of actual work that we are going to be performing will be even or up in 2016 over 2015. You got to keep in mind we had $238 million of the starts here right at the end of the fourth quarter, so all the work will be done on those starts during 2016. So that\u2019s part of why our starts number is down in 2016 over 2015. So if you think about overhead absorption, it\u2019s more related to the volume of work being done, not the amount of projects that were started. So because of that I think it will ebb and flow, but we\u2019ll still have service operating income come down because of all that volume that we are doing in 2016 for our own account rather than for third parties. James Connor : Well, I think the other thing Ki Bin, I would add on just the G&A, particularly as it relates to your comment about the office sales. We have always tried to be out in front of that and not left to be holding the bag on overhead once the portfolio of sales have been completed. So we\u2019ve typically been out in front of that with either outsourcing projects or rightsizing the staff and the teams as those projects have been market. So we\u2019re carrying excess overhead for a period of time after the portfolios revolved. Operator : And we will move on to the line of Eric Frankel. Please go ahead. Eric Frankel : Thank you very much, a few questions. I can always jump back in the queue, but first, Mark, thanks for providing the leverage target for year end. Would there be any reason that would change over the year? And then maybe into next year depending on your cost of capital and how the public markets are shaping up? Mark Denien : No, I don\u2019t \u2013 I mean no reason they would change based on change in strategy or anything like that, if that\u2019s what you mean, Eric. I mean obviously, they are going to be highly dependent on the timing and level of dispositions and things like that. So we try to provide a range and I think you could expect us to be at the more pessimistic into the range, dispositions coming at the pessimistic level. And the leverage levels will be at the more optimistic level if dispositions are closer to the high level. So that\u2019s really the only thing that I could see changing, but we\u2019re very comfortable to ranges we put out there. Eric Frankel : Would you be comfortable with exceeding your disposition target if you thought asset prices were being priced accordingly? Mark Denien : Well, I don\u2019t know that\u2019s necessarily related to leverage, but I think that we would be very comfortable selling all the remaining office we have and then I think you will still see us take advantage like we did in the third and fourth quarter of 2015 buildings like the Amazon building in Delaware that we sold. I think we are going to sell some industrial in that number. So that\u2019s how you get to the top end of that range is with a little bit more industrial sales. James Connor : Yes, I think if you just do the math, the bottom end of the range is about equal to us exiting the office business. So if there was some move in cap rates, we would be at the lower end of that range as we held on to protect some of those industrial assets. But we are focused on selling those office assets. Eric Frankel : Very helpful. Just moving to supply, I know you mentioned Dallas as being of some concern with overwhelming demand kind of placating that issue always this year. Can you talk about Eastern Pennsylvania and the prospects for your development there and developments going forward? James Connor : Yes. You are talking about our 1.1 million square foot spec building. We have a great deal of activity. That building is just coming in service here in the first quarter. And I\u2019m not worried all about that project. I think it\u2019s a great project. As you can imagine, it's garnered a great deal of interest from a lot of e-commerce clients just given the nature of the development and the features that we put in there. So that one doesn't concern me at all. Eric Frankel : Terrific. I will just jump back in the queue and let others comment. Thank you. James Connor : Thanks, Eric. Operator : We have a question in the queue from the line Dave Rodgers. Your line is open. David Rodgers : Yes, good afternoon, guys. I wanted to ask maybe just about are you seeing any issues at all with tenant credit out there, or any additional look for sublease space out in the industrial market at all, I guess as you see some cracks in energy and other places? Anything to start worrying about on those fronts? Mark Denien : No. Not really Dave, not at all. Obviously, our ears perk up when some of the data you've been reading lately come across the wire, but we had record-low basically non-existent defaults or credit issues in 2015 and we are constantly in touch with the folks in the field and we read the same as you do, but as of now we are not worried of any issues. James Connor : No, if you go down to Texas, our oil exposure is so absolutely minimal. I think if you look at our portfolio Dallas and Houston combined is less than 3%. Well, you have 3% outside of the Dallas and Houston portfolios, only 3% of their attendance renewal and gas industry. So it\u2019s incredibly small. Mark Denien : Yes, so we don\u2019t have a lot of concerns there Dave. David Rodgers : Okay, great. Your 2016 development starts \u2013 I didn't hear if you said this earlier because I got on late today, but how does that breakout between MOB, industrial, and anything else you might be doing? And kind of where the yields on each of the categories that you might be starting? Mark Denien : I think you\u2019ll see the yields consistent with what we generated in 2015, the breakdown for us is typically somewhere between two-thirds and three-quarters industrial and quarter and a third on the MOB side. The advantage we have is again most of the MOB projects really look and function like build-to-suit are very substantially pre-leased like the two that we signed in the fourth quarter. We still got a lot of good build-to-suit activity, so we evaluate spec as we bring projects and service and they get leased up. So that kind of the uncertain portion of the equation is how much spec we're going to take out, but we are still very active of the MOB in the build-to-suit side of the equation. David Rodgers : And I guess just following up on the disposition questions, you had mentioned in your comments I think at some point, Jim, that you expected more volatility. So kind of same backdrop, but with more volatility. In everything that you are reading, does that make you want to hit that $900 million disposition target or what are the odds that you could push past that? And how are you feeling about that sitting here today? James Connor : Well, I think I can\u2019t address that, my first priority operationally is to exit the office business. So that what we are most focused on right now. Some of those projects are already actively being marketed as Mark said. We\u2019ve actually already closed two early in the first quarter then we can start at last year. I think if these continue as we anticipate I think as we told all you guys we will be at the high end of that range. If the market to change and there is an unexpected softening. I think you\u2019ll see us continue to be very focused on the office and working diligently to get those projects sold and we will take the wait and see attitude on some of the other high value industrial once. Just like the Amazon building we sold, if we didn\u2019t get our pricing and very consent to keep that building, it\u2019s a great building. David Rodgers : And I guess last question, Mark, in terms of the additional proceeds that you get from the asset sales, I heard your comment about potential smaller special dividend. But any other options that you could put that money into or are you happy sitting on it where it is? Mark Denien : No, I think we\u2019ll just payoff debt with that Dave, we\u2019ve got $350 million of debt coming due and I think that all these - what I call excess disposition proceeds will go to pay that down. If we could do some 1031s that would be great, but we are not going to over pay for property just to do 1031. So that means there is a small special dividend so be it. David Rodgers : Great, thanks. Operator : We will next go to the line of John Guinee. Please go ahead. John Guinee : Great, thank you. Jim, this is music to my ears and you know why. Looks like your land has gone down from $500 million a year ago to $382 million today. You're down to 4% of total enterprise value. What's the range that your Board expects you to be in when you look at undeveloped \u2013 when you look at both strategic and non-strategic land? James Connor : Well, thanks John. We\u2019re particularly proud of what our guys did last year and clearly, that helped the capital recycling. As we sit here today, all-in, if you count wholly-owned for development and everything else we are just over $400 million. We still have some non-strategic office land for sale that we\u2019re going to try and move out. We do need to replenish some land in some of our markets where we\u2019ve got good development activity. Our goal is to get down is to get below $400 million. We would love to stay consistently in that $350 million range and we think as long as we could keep developing and monetizing land that way. We are buying it in much smaller pieces going forward, so we think we\u2019ve made great strides and most of you can remember back at the start of the last recession when we had literally $970 million or $980 million of land. So we\u2019ve worked diligently to change the company culture here and a run rate of $350 million to $400 million, it is a very comfortable run rate for us going forward. John Guinee : Great. And then Mark, just to clarify a little bit, you had basically said you wanted your dividend to be 60% to 75% of AFFO. I think it was AFFO, so correct me if I got that wrong. But essentially at $1.05 midpoint for AFFO and a 65% to 75% ratio, that would imply $0.68 to $0.78 and your current dividend is $0.72. So it would imply that you are not expecting to raise your dividend in December of this year like you did last year. Is that accurate? Mark Denien : Well, I guess John it is AFFO and I said - what I said is 65% to 75% of AFFO. So obviously we are not going to do anything with our dividend we just raised in the fourth quarter 2015 that\u2019s at a level we want to run out right now. I am just doing the math because I\u2019m not as quick at the numbers as you are, but at the $1.05 midpoint that\u2019s $0.74, which is a little bit higher than we are running at now. If we hit those numbers and maybe even do a little bit better that would imply you could see a dividend increase later in this year, but we need a little bit more time under our belt to see what happens. John Guinee : Okay. Does small special dividend or year-end 2016 imply along the same lines as 2015 or materially different? Mark Denien : No, not materially different, John. In 2015 we paid out $0.20, which was essentially $70 million I think it could be anywhere from zero to around that number. John Guinee : Great. All right, keep up the good work. Mark Denien : Thanks. James Connor : Thanks John. Operator : We will go now to the line of Brendan Maiorana. Go ahead. Brendan Maiorana : Thanks. Good afternoon. So, Jim, on the office side, you guys really did a great job monetizing your office over the past couple of years. But for the remainder that you have, are you seeing a price impact from what has happened in the financing markets and it's probably buyers' expectation that the macroeconomic conditions are a little less certain now than they were maybe, say, a year ago? James Connor : I would tell you we are not. And you got to remember most of the buyers that we are dealing with are not doing kind of the traditional bank financing. We have seen a lot of private equity come into the office portfolio acquisition a la Starwood and Blackstone, even some of the smaller deals that we\u2019ve done. So they are much less susceptible to interest fluctuations. Most of them are looking to put capital to work. The office fundamentals have been good and improving in the last few years. So guys that want to invest in office, we\u2019ve had good buyer pools for all of our products even some of the Class B stuff that we\u2019ve sold in one-off smaller transactions. So I anticipate at least for the first half of the year being comparable to where we were in late 2015 in terms of our pricing expectations. Brendan Maiorana : Okay, great. And then just last one for Mark. You guys have done again this year really nice job getting that spread between FFO and AFFO narrowed again. But you've got a pretty new portfolio; there's been a lot of development deliveries over the past several years so those assets don't require a lot of ongoing leasing. Is it \u2013 do you feel like the spread is sort of abnormally low now, abnormally narrow, and maybe it's going to widen out as we get a little bit more lease turnover in a few years time? Or do you think that kind of where you are you can sustain that level over the longer term? Mark Denien : You know, Brendan, we really think we can sustain it. We think it\u2019s I wouldn\u2019t say abnormally low, but I think you got to keep in mind as long as we can do a good job of always pruning the bottom whatever, x percent of the portfolio out and keeping the youngest portfolio in the industry, that we think we can keep our CapEx down to a lower run rate than the next guy. So we\u2019re really committed to having these bigger, nicer, newer boxes and that just translates into a lot less CapEx on a per square foot and per investor dollar basis. So we\u2019re pretty confident, we can keep this pace going. Brendan Maiorana : Okay, great. Glad to see it. Thanks, guys. Operator : And we will now go to the line of Michael Carroll. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hey guys, this is actually George on for Mike. You mentioned the lease you signed with the large e-commerce company. Are there any markets in particular that will benefit from a pickup and leasing from e-commerce firms? Mark Denien : George, that's an interesting question. And I think in general we\u2019ve seen e-commerce touch virtually all of our markets and one of the phenomenon we\u2019ve started to see in late 2014 and 2015 is while we\u2019ve consistently seen these let\u2019s call it 500 to a 1 million square foot. We are now starting to see in secondary and tertiary and infill markets some of the smaller e-commerce lease is for just in time delivery. So I\u2019d tell you we are seeing e-commerce all over the place. I think you\u2019ll continue to see them grow in the major tier-1 markets, because e-commerce is \u2013 the delivery expectations are not going to get any slower and it\u2019s about putting product in consumers hands as quickly as possible and that\u2019s your tier-1 industrial markets and your major population centers. Unidentified Analyst : All right. And then are there any other opportunities to prepaid debt in 2016 outside of the $250 million coming due? Mark Denien : The only thing George would be the 2017 unsecured maturities we have are coming at us early in 2017. So there maybe a chance to take that out a little bit early, but other than that there's really not. Unidentified Analyst : All right. Thanks guys. Operator : We will go now to the line of Manny Korchman. Your line is open. Michael Bilerman : Hey, it's Michael Bilerman. Jim, two questions. First just on supply. You talked about in your opening comments all, but four of your 22 industrial markets are north of 95% occupied. And I'm just kind of curious as you continue to develop \u2013 granted half of that is preleased. What are you seeing from a supply perspective given these record sort of occupancy levels and whether you see some of your peers or even a return of other merchant developers come into the marketplace, adding to supply? James Connor : Well, I think our peers are just like us. I think they have been selectively developing spec, I think you\u2019ve seen the merchant builders be fairly active across all of the markets. As we mentioned Dallas in particular has a very strong and deep profile of developers down there. I think the expectation is you will continue to see active development all through the year, most of the sources that we use, the brokerage or the consulting companies or the research companies, are expecting that we\u2019ll hit some sort of the equilibrium late this year or early next year. So that would anticipate we will have probably a couple 100 million square feet of absorption and approaching that in the supply side. I think we\u2019ll be all right for this year, I think the question is as we finish this year and we start to go into next year. What do those numbers really look like? And will people have the self-control to pullback a little bit at the end of this year and next year when we get to that equilibrium. Michael Bilerman : Do you have a sense at all, in terms of your preleased projects, how much of that is growth square footage for the tenant versus just musical chairs? James Connor : Well, for us we would net that out, if we were taking somebody out of an existing lease and putting them in a new building. So for us it\u2019s very little. I can\u2019t speak to the overall, the effect of the overall input, but I think net-net when you look at 91 million square feet of net absorption across the country the net debt is very, very positive. Michael Bilerman : Right. And then, secondarily, you talked about your first priority being to exit office I guess from a strategic standpoint of just fully cleansing yourself of that product, which has been going on for a number of years and you've executed extraordinarily well. Post doing that the MOB portfolio will be about just over 20% of the Company and it's been a great source for you from a reinvestment of all the sales proceeds into developing new MOBs. I guess now once you reach the end of this year and sort of use it as I guess house to invest some of that excess capital in addition to deleveraging, does medical office become a strategic pivot point for you in terms of what to do with that portfolio? Or does it - or do you start thinking about that earlier as you think about how the medical office building, healthcare companies have traded, which has been extraordinarily well, being able to monetize that for shareholders? James Connor : Well Mike, I can\u2019t help but think about it everyday because I get asked about it everyday, so I\u2019ll tell you there is always been a lot of interest in our medical portfolio, we believe the highest quality portfolio across the board, we\u2019ve got a great team, even through the succession when Jim Bremner retired and our new team that is running the business, we\u2019re creating a lot of value. So we evaluate that strategically and as I\u2019ve said before right now our focus is to exit the office building and we will always be thinking 12 to 18 months about the direction of the company and what we are going to do with all of our product both industrial and medical and all of the markets that we operate in. So today it\u2019s full speed a head, we are cleaning up the office portfolio, simplifying the business and we\u2019ll see what opportunities are created in the future. Michael Bilerman : If you have a thought, do you think a spin-off of a $2 billion medical office company versus a sale of that portfolio, would you lean one way or the other? James Connor : Well, at this point I wouldn\u2019t lean one way or the other because I\u2019m not really seriously looking at it. I think when we get to that point we will do what any prudent management team will and explore all of our options and what will create the greatest value for our shareholders. Michael Bilerman : Great, thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go now to line of Eric Frankel. Go ahead please. Eric Frankel : Thank you. I will try to make them two good ones. First, with your Chamber Street joint venture; obviously Chamber Street merged with Gramercy Property Trust and so they seem to be undergoing a new strategy. So I was wondering if there's any finality to that joint venture in the near future. James Connor : Eric, that's a good question. We have been winding down that joint venture, and a lot of the activity in the Chamber Street joint venture was slowed by their acquisition by Gramercy. In terms of the overall number of assets I think we are down to under 10. I think probably eight if I am counting correctly. And I don\u2019t think any of those for us are long term holds. So I think I thought has been to let our friends at Gramercy get their arms around the Chamber Street and then we will continue to look to exit most of those assets. Eric Frankel : Okay, thank you. The final question, I found your phrase for how you think about the e-commerce business as an e-commerce real estate solution provider. Without giving away any trade secrets, I was hoping you could expand on that concept a little bit further and how you'd like to grow that segment of your development business. Mark Denien : Well, I think, Eric, like any level of expertise in this industry or anything else, it's really based on people and for us it\u2019s construction and development people who have a great deal of experience dealing with all of the e-commerce providers whether it\u2019s the Amazons of the world or the Walmart.coms, all the way down to the third-party logistics providers who have been a growing source of e-commerce solutions. Looking at and dealing with omnichannel distribution, we\u2019ve just done a great deal of it across the country. We\u2019ve built a lot of it. We understand what our e-commerce providers needs and where those differ from traditional industrial buildings and we are very comfortable with the direction and markets going and making investments in that product and that\u2019s quite candidly what our clients want to hear. 40-foot buildings and heavy parking and losses truck parking. Those are the kind of assets that appeal to our e-commerce clients and we are very comfortable making those investment. So that\u2019s we will continue to do. Eric Frankel : That\u2019s it for me. Thank you. End of Q&A James Connor : I would like to thank you everyone for joining the call today. And we look forward to seeing many of you during the year at industry conference as well as getting you out to see our regional markets. Thanks again. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay beginning today January 28 at 5 :30 PM Eastern Standard Time until February 11, 2016 at 11 :59 PM.

My name is Kim, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2016 Prologis' Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please limit yourself to one question. You may rejoin the queue for any follow-up questions. Thank you. Ms. Tracy Ward, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Tracy Ward : Thanks, Kim, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2016 conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. This morning, we'll hear from Hamid Moghadam, our Chairman and CEO, who will comment on the company's strategy and the market environment; and then from Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover results and guidance. Also joining us for today's call are Gary Anderson, Mike Curless, Ed Nekritz, Gene Reilly, and Diana Scott. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, and projections about the market and the industry, in which Prologis operates, as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice on our 10-K or SEC filings. Additionally, our first quarter press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures and, in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. With that, we will get started and I'll turn the call over to Hamid. Hamid Moghadam : Thanks, Tracy, and good morning everyone. 2016 is off to a great start. The momentum we had at the end of last year has continued into the New Year. We posted record first quarter numbers on rent change, which was stronger than expected at over 20%, and core FFO which grew 24% year-over-year. At this point in the cycle, we're pushing rent growth over occupancy. Nevertheless occupancy is still very high at over 96%. These and other metrics which Tom will discuss in a moment point to continued growth ahead for Prologis. I'd like to take a moment to elaborate on how and where we make our money. Many of you already know this but I believe it's worth repeating. We make over 90% of our core FFO by collecting rents. The rest is generated by fees and promotes from our strategic capital business. Together rents and fees represent a stable cash flow created from our operating portfolio. Separately, the value creation from our development business, including value added conversions, propels our future earnings growth. So our operating and development activities address how we make money. Now as to where we make our money when collecting rents 72% is in the U.S. and 28% comes from abroad, roughly 90% of our net equities in U.S. dollars. Many ask us why we're global. In short, we are global because our customers are global and so we've organized our business to capitalize on this unique aspect of our sector. About two-thirds of our development value creation fees and promotes are generated outside the U.S. As an aside these benefits actually cover more than a 100% of our global overhead. I view Prologis as an owner/operator in the U.S. and a fund manager and developer in Europe and Asia. We have minimal exposure to emerging economies. Market conditions remain favorable under world's most vibrant centers of commerce. In these strategic locations, demand was solid with supply still very disciplined. These business conditions have persisted for several years now. While we anticipate supply/demand reaching equilibrium this year, we see few obstacles on the road ahead that could disrupt that balance. In the U.S. quality properties remains scare which is leading to strong rent growth and high occupancies. We will continue to signal watch list markets. In this quarter we have no new markets to call out. In Europe and Asia, rents are up modestly from last quarter, balanced by slightly lower occupancies. In Mexico, rents were up slightly, and occupancies flat, while in Brazil rents are down modestly, but occupancy is at a 100%. The key drivers of our business consumption and e-commerce continue to grow faster than underlying economies. We have every reason to expect these trends to continue into the future. KCR is all paid off. Our funding activities, specifically the short-term loan associated with that deal concluded less than one year after it was announced and ahead of schedule. With the transaction paid in full, and the portfolio integrated, today's call is probably the last time you will hear us talk about KCR. We have capacity to fund more than five years of capital deployment. At our current run rate, our total annual funding requirement is $600 million. We expect to fund this through the rebalancing of our co-investment ventures, reducing our land bank, and selling our remaining non-strategic assets. These one-time sources total more than $3.5 billion and give us the ability to fund more than five years of net deployment activity. We will further simply our business overtime. Over the last several years we made great strides in optimizing our business to put us on a path for long-term sustained earnings growth. In addition look for us to continue to streamline our business through the ongoing realignment of our portfolio, further G&A efficiencies, land bank optimization, and reduced leverage. Now, let me turn it over to Tom, for further comments. Tom Olinger : Thanks, Hamid. We began the year with terrific results. Core FFO was $0.61 per share for the quarter and increased to 24% year-over-year and driven by strong operating fundamentals and an increase in AUM. Starting with operations, occupancy in the U.S. was 96.6% at quarter end and 95.4% outside the U.S. Leasing volume for the quarter was a record at 46 million square feet. Just a quick reminder that my comments as I go through the rest of the operating and capital deployment activity will focus on our share. GAAP rent change on rollover was an all-time high of 20.1% led by the U.S. of 27.2% and 4% outside the U.S. GAAP same-store NOI increased 7.4% positive across all major geographies and driven by the U.S. at 9.6%. There are two items I want to highlight. First, as we previously discussed, the negative impact on GAAP NOI from the amortization of lease intangibles related to the merger burned off in the second quarter of 2015. As a result, this had a positive non-cash impact of about 170 basis points on GAAP same-store growth in the quarter. Second, expense timing drove an approximate 70 basis points positive impact. After adjusting for these two items, GAAP same-store growth was 5% which is attributable to the strong rental increases and year-over-year occupancy gains. Strategic capital fees were $50 million for the quarter, with the majority coming from our international ventures. Capital deployment activity is progressing as planned. There are two items I would like to highlight this quarter. First, that our stabilization had an estimated margin of 27%, and second, that build-to-suits comprised 42% of our development starts. Turning to capital markets, our leverage on a book basis was 38.1% at quarter-end and 33.9% based on market capitalization. Debt-to-EBITDA, including gains, improved to 5.6 times. As Hamid mentioned, we fully repaid the $400 million term loan associated with the KTR acquisition and liquidity remained strong. Last quarter, I'm sorry, this week we recast our global line of credit, lowering our spread by 10 basis points and increasing the capacity by 640 million. As a result, our total line capacity is now 3.4 billion further enhancing our current significant liquidity levels. We expect to see further improvement in our debt metrics throughout the remainder of the year, as our venture rebalancings were completed this month and the pace of dispositions accelerate. The continued strengthening of our balance sheet was acknowledged this quarter by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's upgraded our credit outlook to positive. We believe we are on the doorstep of an A rating. Before discussing guidance, I wanted to highlight enhancements to our earnings supplemental this quarter. The changes are based on the feedback we received from investors and analysts as well as to better align our disclosure with how we think about and how we run the company. As part of this, we revisited the classification of certain personnel cost in our income statement which had the effect of increasing expenses related to our strategic capital business by $17 million on an annual basis and reducing G&A by the same amount. There is no bottom-line impact on net income or core FFO. For context we completed a significant volume of co-investment activity over the past five years and almost doubled our third-party AUM. With this increase, we now have more full-time employees dedicated to our strategic capital business. Moving to 2016 guidance, we're maintaining guidance for most of our operating metrics, capital deployment, and strategic capital revenues, all of which you can see on Page 6 of our supplemental. On same-store NOI, we are increasing the bottom-end and narrowing the range to between 4% and 4.5% with the bias towards the upper half of this range. For net G&A, we are lowering the range to between $218 million and $228 million to reflect the reclassification I just mentioned. Related to FX, our 2016 earnings remain well insulated from foreign currency fluctuations, as over 95% are hedged. We continue to expect to generate $1 billion of total proceeds in excess of our capital needs in 2016. This consist $400 million in net deployment proceeds, $198 million of cash that we already received from the completion of the Facebook installment sale, and $400 million from the ownership rebalancing in our USLF and PTELF ventures which we will receive in a few weeks. Further we like what we are seeing in the disposition market and are likely to increase our volume. So while operating conditions are stronger than we expected, we are not increasing our core FFO given the potential dilution from increased dispositions. Therefore we are maintaining our 2016 core FFO guidance of between $2.50 and $2.60 per share. This includes $0.17 to $0.19 per share of promotes which were recognized in the second half of this year. If we assume normalized annual net promotes of $0.05 per share, our core FFO for 2016 would range between $2.38 to $2.46 per share. Core FFO will not be evenly distributed for the balance of the year given the timing of our asset sales and venture rebalancing. As a result, we expect core FFO to be $0.03 to $0.04 lower in the second quarter followed by an acceleration in the back half of the year from promote income. In closing, we are off to a really good start. Our focus for the rest of the 2016 is simply about capturing the significant spreads between inflates and market rents, generating profitable returns by putting our land bank to work, and continuing to strengthen our balance sheet. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore. Your line is open. Steve Sakwa : Hi good morning, Steve Sakwa here. Hamid, I guess I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the development business and what you're saying obviously the fundamentals continue to be stronger than may be you've expected. I know you didn't have a huge start figure in the first quarter but I'm just wondering if you sort of look out for the balance of the year was the rest of the starts numbers to the upside or to the downside? How do you sort of assess that at this point and what are your tenants sort of looking for today? Hamid Moghadam : Steve, I think the risk is to the upside because pretty much everything that we're likely to do we know about. So by definition if some build-to-suit left in the door or something happens is going to be on the upside because pretty much everything is baked. The other thing I would comment on generally development start volume is that we're basically doing the same or a little bit more than last year except for Brazil. So obvious reasons, we're not developing a whole lot of new products in Brazil. So I think people have gotten too excited in terms of our guidance being a little bit down on development starts, I don't think you can read that much into that anyway. Operator : Your next question comes from Ross Nussbaum from UBS. Your line is open. Ross Nussbaum : Hey good morning out there. Hamid, as we think about demand for industrial space, we spend a lot of time thinking about inventory levels given the historical correlation between absorption in inventories. And then I look at what's been going on with inventory to sales ratios lately. And I say lately it's been ramping the last couple of years but over the last year or two it's been ramping quite significantly. How do you think inventory to sales ratios are going to play out here going forward? Do you think we're going to see a bit more I guess modest inventory growth given what's going on in the economy and how does that play out in terms of demand for your space? Hamid Moghadam : Ross, that's a very good question and I think the answer is too soon to know for sure but it appears that that secular decline in inventory to sales ratio that all of you are used to seeing in our materials going back I don't know 15 years or something really has reversed in the last three years, and there are lots of explanations for it, but the most credible one I think is the one that as more sales shift to e-commerce, there are more skews, and there is the need to keep more inventory around and as a result there may be a secular shift. If that's the case, that's a unexpected windfall to demand for industrial space. We have not built our business with that expectation but that will be a nice surprise if it happens and if it has legs forever. So too soon to tell for sure but I think the early signs are really good. Operator : Your next question comes from Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust. Your line is open. Ki Bin Kim : Thank you. So going back to your opening comments Hamid, you talked about the $3.5 billion of one-time funding sources and how you're funding your, are you going to be self-funding for the next five years of activity and that\u2019s been a pretty consistent message coming from you guys lately. But I guess the equation to issue equity or not issue equity and how to fund that on activity is a different equation at $40 versus $45 stock price. Could you just talk about, how you think about that? Has your stock price has changed or is it still that $3.5 billion is that still your primary force, how you want to fund the business? Hamid Moghadam : Look, I'm not going to sit here and say that we will never do equity if the stock price is about 60 bucks or 70 bucks, it's something like that. It would be foolish not to do that because that clearly would be higher than our NAV. But our view over NAV we've been pretty open about it, 46, 47 bucks a share that doesn't really include a value for development business and I guess there is a long debate as to whether that business is worth a one multiple or a 10 multiple. I can tell you it's not worth the 15 or 20 multiple that people were valuing it at 2007 that's for sure, but it's worth something, it's worth at least the homebuilder. I think it\u2019s worth $3 to $5 a share pretty easily if you look at it as a homebuilder. So you add of all that stuff the number is around high 40s to low 50s kind of for the way I look at by at our NAV. So I don't even think about it. So I don't think the equation has changed between $40 and $45 because we're still way below where I think the value of the company is? But, you got to look at equity in the context of other investment opportunities. If some portfolio comes up on the market or I don't think this is going to happen, but if something happens where we have an advantage to buy $45 of NAV at $20, we may take advantage of that. But I don\u2019t think that's going to happen and we are not an issuer of equity and I think it is a complete waste of time for people to spend energy thinking about that issue at these kinds of numbers. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Blaine Heck : Good morning out there. You guys have talked about getting your land balance down to about $1 billion or under. Some of that obviously involves monetizing land through development but it also involves disposing of land so. My question is have you seen any movement in land values over the past six months or so, especially as you and some of your public peers have become a little bit more conservative with respect to the expected starts this year? Hamid Moghadam : I think land values in terms of good developable land that's near-term developable has gone up, as rents have gone up. And it's very hard to find good land in the right markets, entitlement costs are going up, infrastructure costs are going up, communities are getting tougher on land, so general trend in land values has been up. I would say among our many, many parcels every quarter we value our land, using a land residual analysis and I would say by and large the trend has been up there are -- I would say three or four parcels add up a very large number may be down but the general trend is up, but it's not up as much as it would have been a year ago or two years ago, the pace of land value growth has, has moderated. The other thing I would point out is that, yes our land bank is about $1.5 billion book value, $1.4 billion book value, but the market value that in our view again based on pretty robust analysis is approaching to may be in the low $2 billion rank. So in terms of what we can work our land bank down is not $0.5 billion down to $1 billion it's like $1 billion down to $1 billion in terms of market value because the market value of land is what we -- we're targeting for. So we've got quite a bit of liquidity that could come out of the land bank to add to that $3.5 billion that we've talked about. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Your line is open. Juan Sanabria : Good morning. I was just hoping you could touch a little bit more deeply on the same-store NOI expense comment about some one-time items related to timing and how we should think about that kind of for the balance of the year and may be if you could touch on the differences by geography? Tom Olinger : Juan, this is Tom, I will start. The decline -- the benefit we got from the lower occupancy expenses in Q1 this year was really a function of Q1 of '15 being higher than normal. So if you go back and look at the increase if Q1 of '15 I think it was around 7%. We had some one-time trueups going on in there some other non-recurring items and that's really what's driving the benefit, we saw this quarter or the decrease this quarter. Going forward, the remainder of year, I wouldn't expect really any meaningful change in operating expenses from this run rate, in any meaningful way. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel with Green Street Advisors. Your line is open. Eric Frankel : Thank you. First just a couple of portfolio specific questions. Could you comment on the occupancy declines in Houston and Pennsylvania? And then secondly perhaps you can touch, perhaps providing e-commerce update and just, if you can relay your experiences with your customers in terms of how they accommodate e-commerce growth during the holiday season whether they see any changes in their supply chain as a result. Thank you. Hamid Moghadam : Yes, Eric, I will start with that. Well obviously Houston and Pennsylvania are two markets that we've called out as markets we're concerned about. Houston pretty obvious reasons why and Pennsylvania is sort of a combination of a spike in supply and demand tailing off. But I wouldn\u2019t draw any conclusions Eric about the specific adjustments in vacancy in those markets but I think that's going to continue for a long time. I think in both cases, we\u2019re going to end up in the sort of mid-90s. But let me say a couple of other things about both of them. So Houston has been on our watch list, vacancy was up a little bit over the quarter and it has 8 million square feet on construction. We're defensive there and I think we've been saying that for a while. While the macro headwind obviously persist, we're almost 96% leased, the pipe is 50% pre-leased and there is still a 6% vacancy rate in Houston and Houston isn't creating a lot of jobs but it's net positive, not negative at this point in time. And then in terms of Pennsylvania, probably we're a little more cautious in terms of Pennsylvania at this point in time. To your point on e-commerce trends, Eric, we don't see any new trends coming out of this prior season. I think that that everybody participating in this space is still that's really trying to figure out the supply chain both the last mile which everybody is talking about these days, all the way to the origin of the product because different participants handle it differently. So, we don't really have anything new for you right now. I don't know Gary if you see anything different in your opinion. Gary Anderson : And I just say that, there are two trends that have occurred over the last two years, two important customer segments one is automotive and the other is e-commerce. And the e-commerce side of the equation isn't a seasonal thing and you sort of pose your question in terms of seasonality, it's really a structural change I think in the way companies are doing business today. And if you look at our own portfolio as an example, two or three years ago it was about 5% of our total portfolio, today it's double that. So it's clearly an important driver and one that I wouldn't think about just in terms of a seasonal type trend. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Michael Mueller : I was wondering if you can comment on any trends you're seeing with respect to the time release respect developments, has it been static, has it been going up at all. Hamid Moghadam : I would say the best way of answering that question is how we're doing compared to our underwriting and we are literally within a point or two and I think we are point or two ahead consistent with our underwriting. So no I wouldn't say our expectations have changed. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi. Your line is open. Manny Korchman : Thank you. Hamid, if we can just turn to the comment you made in the press release and then repeated on the call about sort of trends exceeding underlying economies. Are the economies performing sort of at your expectations and trends are just that much better? Are you seeing a slowing in trends or really kind of what you'd expect with economies are not? Hamid Moghadam : Manny, my pick on economies and now I'm really out of my depth of expertise here, but seems to me that the U.S. economy is sort of a mid-to-high 2% grower minus energy. So that means it's 1.5% to 2% grower, and so the trends that affect our business remember energy doesn't goes through pipeline, it doesn't go through warehouses. The energy pricing generally being lower has led to better consumption numbers and more of that consumption is shifting to the e-commerce channel which is more space intensive. So those two things have made demand for our product better than they would have been based on the overall economic numbers. On top of that, well this issue that I talked about earlier which is the inventory to sales ratio is trending up, which may be a third factor or you may look at it as part of the second factor which is e-commerce I don't know, what are those two? So there are either two or three factors that are making the -- our demand drivers for our business better than the underlying economy. That's my take of it, I don't know for sure but we will see but that's what I think is going on. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick with Capital One Securities. Your line is open. Tom Lesnick : Great, thanks for taking my questions. My question has to do with international markets obviously you guys have visibility into international markets more so than a lot of other industrial landlords out there. Just wondered if you can comment on the trends in fundamentals in both Europe and Asia and then if you're seeing any movement in cap rates as well? Tom Olinger : Yes, let's start in Europe; cap rates are generally flat for the last couple of quarters. Our expectation there though is you could see another 15 to 30 basis points this year, trends are good. For the first time, we are viewing Europe as a potential tailwind. To the company, the outlook when you're looking at market vacancies as a whole is that vacancies not occupancies, is vacancies will drop 60 basis points. So we will be somewhere around market vacancies about 5.8% which is nearing sort of U.S. levels. So we expect Europe to perform well on a go-forward basis. And in Asia, the market there I think are performing well. Japan is sitting there at about 96.3% occupied and we're seeing good net absorption. So Japan is performing well. China is a business that I think some have concern of it, it's a small business for us but one that again is performing pretty well. We're about 92% occupied in our overall portfolio, but if you look at the supplemental, you will see that there is a leased to occupied about 200 basis points. So you should expect the occupancies in China to trend up. The other comment I make about China is that we've done about 2 million square feet of development leasing this quarter, which is about 30% of the total leasing for the quarter for the company. So it's performing pretty well. So net-net I would say that the international markets are performing to expectation and will become a tailwind. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Craig Mailman : Hey guys, may be just going back to Tom's comments about potentially ramping dispositions, what are you seeing in different markets that's given you kind of the confidence that may be you can do that? In which geographies are you seeing deeper disposition pool than others at this point? Mike Curless : Hi, this is Mike Curless. Let me hit that. It's probably important to set the backdrop in terms of what we're selling. To put this in context 80% of what we're selling is in the U.S. and the majority of those buildings are older product in our global markets where the heavy buyer interest continues to be and with a few exceptions, the most we\u2019re selling in the $25 million range. So if you think about it in addition to our usual buyers you can add in local or regional investors and even user buyers that really expands that buyer pool. Buyer pool gives us plenty of confidence to get this work done. So we feel very good about the execution in our way. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Erin Aslakson with Stifel. Your line is open. Erin Aslakson : Hi good morning out there. Can you hear me? Hamid Moghadam : Yes, good morning, Erin. Erin Aslakson : Great, good morning. I think this question for Mike Curless but just in terms of the strong same-store NOI growth you guys put up for the quarter, if you had to break that out across U.S. in terms of which submarkets are contributing or contracting that number that would be helpful. And then also are you still seeing strong institutional demand in terms of asset acquisitions for these potential sales you're discussing? Mike Curless : Do you mind if I pick the Executive from Indiana that will answer that question? Erin Aslakson : Not at all. Mike Curless : I'll do the backup. Gary Anderson : We will let Tom do that, the same-store. Tom Olinger : So on the same-store as far as where we're seeing strength and Gene should weigh in here, it's -- I think you would clearly look at the coastal markets is where you\u2019re going to see the significant amount of rent change that drove same-store growth and I think as we look to the balance of the year, our rent change on roll looks really, really good and may be Gene can comment on that aspect. Gene Reilly : Yes, absolutely Tom is right. So if you look at the coastal markets, where we've been at very much full occupancy there for a couple of years actually in those cases. So it\u2019s all about rent growth. And in places like LA, LA County is less than 2% vacant, actually it's in the low ones, Toronto for example is 1.8 vacant and at those types of occupancy levels lot and lot of pricing power. So it's definitely skewed to those types of markets. Tom Olinger : And in terms of buyer interest, the institutional interest is definitely there particularly in light of where we\u2019re selling and what we\u2019re selling, so healthy activity in that segment. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Brad Burke with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Brad Burke : Thank you. Just a question on leverage levels and uses of cash. There is a modest sequential decline in net debt from the fourth quarter but it looks like you've already realized over half of that $1 billion regarding to -- for proceeds with full-year. So just want to know if there is something else beyond development that we should be thinking about as a substantially use of cash in the quarter and then also whether we should continue to expect net proceeds deployed to reduce net debt over the remainder of the year? Tom Olinger : Hi, Brad, it\u2019s Tom. So I'll take those questions. First on LTV you\u2019re right, LTV you would have appeared didn't decline enough based on our activity for the quarter and what\u2019s happening is it's really a function of the weakening of the dollar and the strengthening of the Yen and the Euro and there is a denominator effect that I'll explain. So, when you think about half of our debt in Yen and Euro but only about 25% of our assets are. So when the Yen and Euro increase against that liability, that debt that increase took our debt levels up in U.S. dollar terms by about $300 million. But we didn't have the same $300 million increase in our denominator because only 25% of our assets are in Euro and Yen. So there is a denominator effect and that impacted leverage by about 70 basis points this quarter. So you really economically, we had about 100 basis points decline this quarter little over actually but that\u2019s FX noise. On your point about deployment proceeds for the rest of the year and how we\u2019re going to use that $1 billion of cash, we\u2019re going to look at our debt stacks and we\u2019re going to determine if there is debt where we can economically or frictionlessly pay that off. We do have a multi-currency term loan that\u2019s out there, that matures in a couple of years that would fit that bill. We always looked at bond maturities to see if there is economically it makes sense to do that or we'll sit on cash. But I would tell you when you look at our guidance, either the debt that we have to pay off is extremely low rate debt, so it doesn\u2019t have a significant impact on our results for the rest of the year. Gene Reilly : And to also state the obvious, the corresponding asset value increase in the same currencies obviously doesn't factor into that leverage calculations. So you need to that into account as well. So it's not as if our debt went up and the asset didn't go up, both of those are in same currency. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Sumit Sharma with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sumit Sharma : Hi question about the G&A. I understand the reclassification and what you\u2019ve talked about. But you mentioned that there are further efficiencies in the G&A line. So wondering whether this -- whether you\u2019re seeing an sort of active decline in G&A as percent of NOI or is it just as more developments come online, the G&A load as a percentage of assets just sort of goes down naturally? Tom Olinger : No, yes, actually it would be up because I think since the development volume is actually coming down a little bit, there will be less capitalized into development over time. The total level of G&A is flat and therefore G&A as a percentage of AUM is coming down. That reclassification doesn't have anything to do with that. We\u2019re looking at total G&A. And the capitalized portion is actually coming down too as the volumes come down. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel with Green Street Advisors. Your line is open. Eric Frankel : Thank you. I wanted to circle back on the increased disposition guidance and make your comments on the selling older assets in global markets. I think we observed the last few years that cap rates spreads between A and B and C quality properties have widened pretty significantly over that time period and so I'm wondering if that spread has somehow decreased over the last year or so and that's why you are increasing disposition guidance. Tom Olinger : Eric, first of all we haven\u2019t increased our disposition guidance. But relative to the spreads we certainly haven\u2019t seen an increase. And I think the pricing that we\u2019re seeing in those markets relative to what we\u2019re selling we're very comfortable with and optimistic of our ability to execute at those numbers. Hamid Moghadam : Again maybe I can clarify on the issue here. We're not selling bad assets in bad markets or anything like that. We're just selling at this point; we're down to virtually all of our assets being in our targeted markets. We're just calling the older assets in those target markets. So we're not selling assets in tertiary markets or whatever, we really been onus in tertiary markets to start with. So the spread widening that you're talking about really doesn't sound effective Prologis portfolio and hasn't even in last couple of years. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi. Your line is open. Manny Korchman : Hey thanks guys. Just thinking about the AFFO guidance percentage and the element of it that includes development gains, how do we think about that business or that part of AFFO going forward? Is that going to cause lumpiness in that FFO or is that sort of $150 million to $200 million a good annual run rate to think about? Tom Olinger : I think the way to think, the way I think about it is that we think about the recurring AFFO as the driver of our dividends and we work really hard to manage the impact of the lumpy part of AFFO that comes from dispositions through a variety of mechanisms like 10/31s and all kinds of things. So but we never think about those things in terms of the dividend structure. Hamid Moghadam : Manny, I would just point out one more, two things. One our payout ratio this year including all the gains will be about 70% payout ratio. If you want to back out all the gains which is not the right run rate but just to stress it that would be about 85% payout ratio. Tom Olinger : Of AFFO. Hamid Moghadam : Of AFFO. Tom Olinger : Our problem is the opposite to be honest with you, how to keep our dividends from getting too high. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Craig Mailman : Hey guys, just a question on the kind of rent spreads here versus what you guys did on the leasing capital in the quarter obviously rent spreads you guys came in a little bit above your expectations. Is there anything that's skewed those numbers this quarter and can you kind of just juxtapose those with the 6.7% of lease value this quarter is that kind of sustainable at those levels or is it just the higher levels of renewals? Tom Olinger : Yes, to the second part of the question, this is really related to the lease term because the 6.7% of the aggregate value of the lease which is obviously influenced by the term to give you some perspective on that. In the Americas, our average term has grown over the last five quarters from 42 months to just under 56. So, we\u2019ve been really pushing term and I think we\u2019ve talked about this on some prior calls as a company overall it's about 10 months. It is pretty dramatic increase, so that's what drives the number. But the same-store let me give you some color on what we see going through the year. So this is driven by the Americas in part because of the health of the market and in part because of the structure of our leases. But we're just under 24% during the quarter. We're not going to sustain that through the year. This is a volatile stat by quarter because it\u2019s just the piece of the portfolio. But we\u2019ll be close to 20% for the year by judging this. So we\u2019re going to be really, really strong on the stat, but there's a little bit of an outlier. Hamid Moghadam : Great. Since that was the last question, let me thank all of you for your interest in the company and look forward to seeing you next quarter. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call and you may now disconnect.",

Baird Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Sumit Sharma - Morgan Stanley Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors James Feldman - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Duke Realty Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host Mr. Ron Hubbard. Please go ahead. Ron Hubbard : Thank you, Ronda. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Jim Connor, President & CEO and Mark Denien, Chief Financial Officer. Before we make our prepared remarks, let me remind you that statements we make today are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For more information about those risk factors, we would refer you to our December 31, 2015 10-K that we have on file with the SEC. Now for our prepared statement, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim Connor. Jim Connor : Thanks, Ron good afternoon everyone. I'll start out with an update on the overall business environment and our second quarter results. Naturally, the industrial markets\u2019 momentum continues to be very strong. Demand outpaced supply for the 25th straight quarter, new supply in substantially all markets is balance and demand for modern bulk space year-to-date continues to beat expectations. Net absorption for the second quarter was 64 million square feet and year-to-date absorption is 124 million square feet. New supply in the second quarter totaled 35 million square feet, resulting in another 10 basis point drop in vacancy nationwide to approximately 5.2%. Our outlook is for these fundamentals to continue to be favorable for the remainder of 2016. We're seeing similar strength in our own portfolio with the completion of 6.9 million square feet of leasing for the quarter this drove our in-service occupancy up to 96.7%, 100 basis point increase from the first quarter and the highest in the Company\u2019s history. Rents on renewal leases for the quarter, grew by 18.6% also the highest on record for the overall portfolio, reflecting continued strong supply demand fundamentals and our solid pricing power. Of particular note was our continued success in leasing recently completed speculative projects and a leasing of second generation space with new tenants within our portfolio. One notable new lease was signed with Amazon for 1.1 million square feet, in our speculative project in Pennsylvania that was delivered in the first quarter of the year. Also we signed two new leases in the Indianapolis with R.R. Donnelley and Stryker, totaling over 1.3 million square feet. On the lease renewal side, we executed two leases with the container store in Dallas in our Freeport Park near DWF Airport, comprised with a 956,000 square foot lease renewal of existing space and 146,000 square feet of expansion space. In addition we executed two significant renewal leases with Hewlett Packard in Indianapolis and Genco Distribution in Columbus, each over 400,000 square feet. I will also note that while our renewal percentage for the quarter was 63%, it was impacted by 4 large expirations that were immediately back filled with new leases at much better rates. The largest drivers of leasing in our portfolio continue to be e-commerce, retail and consumer products distribution, both directly with our corporate clients and indirectly with 3PL clients as well as positive drivers from the food and beverage industry. In addition we\u2019re seeing most of these customers continuing to allocate additional capital to their supply chain and inventory optimization. Our medical office portfolio continues to have good momentum with in-service occupancy increasing 20 basis points to 95.8% another all time record. And we continue to have a strong development pipeline for future development to go along with our existing pipeline. Turning to overall development for the quarter, we started $108 million of industrial projects, given our strong leasing performance we\u2019re allocating more capital to speculative projects in our strategy to grow in Tier 1 markets. Three of these four developments starts are speculative and located in Southern California and Pennsylvania markets, all the while maintaining our pre-lease percentage and our overall development pipeline of over 70%. Our overall development pipeline at the end of the quarter had 18 projects under construction, totaling 6 million square feet and a projected $504 million in stabilized cost at our share that was 72% preleased. We expect these projects to create 20% margins and generate about a 6.6% initial stabilized cash yield. Our development outlook is very solid with a pipeline of prospects, many of which are build-to-suits that will continue strong value creation for the balance of the year. Our land inventory now sits at 344 million, as a result of monetizing about $40 million of land during in the quarter through sales and development. This is our lowest inventory level since 2003 and below our 2004 stated goal to maintain the land bank between $350 million and $400 million. With respect to capital recycling activity, we closed $173 million of building dispositions during the quarter in six transactions. This includes 55 million related to the Gramercy Property Trust joint venture dissolution that Mark will extend on in a moment. Similar to what we stated in the last call, the majority of our expected dispositions for the full year are scheduled to close in the third and fourth quarters and are proceeding as planned. But we also mentioned that we are under contract to sell our 936,000 square foot vacant speculative industrial building in the Indianapolis. This is a user sale and along with a significant leasing we completed during the quarter, raises our Indianapolis in-service occupancy to 99.8%. I\u2019d now like to turn it over to Mark to discuss the financial results and the capital transactions. Mark Denien : Thank you, Jim. Good afternoon everyone. Core FFO per share was $0.30 for the second quarter of 2016 compared to $0.28 per share for both the first quarter of 2016 and the second quarter of 2015. This $0.02 increase is reflective of our continued improvements in our overall operating performance. NAREIT defined FFO was $0.35 per share, the largest reconciling item between Core FFO and NAREIT defined FFO was $24 million for both income recognized related to the dissolution of Gramercy joint venture that I will expand on in a minute. The promote income is excluded in FFO as defined by NAREIT but not Core FFO. We generated $0.27 per share in AFFO for the second quarter of 2016, which equates to an AFFO payout ratio of 67% compared to $0.26 per share in the first quarter of 2016 and $0.25 per share in the second quarter of 2015. Same property NOI growth for the 12 and three months ended June 30, 2016 was 4.5% and 3.5% respectively. Let me point out that the second quarter\u2019s three month figure is negatively impacted by a few individually small non-recurring expense items. These items will have virtually no impact on our full year results as we look out to the remainder of the year. While occupancy growth should slow a little bit in the latter half of the year, we still expect strong rent growth which led to our increase in same-property NOI growth guidance of 1.375% at the mid-point. As I mentioned earlier we dissolved our joint venture of Gramercy Property Trust in which we had a 20% interest. This dissolution transaction consisted of seven of the joint ventures buildings being distributed to Gramercy, one industrial property being distributed to us, and the final property being sold to a third-party late last week. Two of the properties distributed to Gramercy were suburban office buildings. Our $173 million of property dispositions for the quarter includes $55 million for our 20% ownership interest in the seven joint venture buildings that were distributed to Gramercy and our $67 million of acquisitions for the quarter includes $51 million for Gramercy to 80% interest in the industrial property that was distributed to us. Also as I mentioned earlier the dissolution of this JV resulted in a $24 million promote fee being recognized in the second quarter. From a capital raising perspective, I\u2019d like to note that during the second quarter we received full repayment of the $200 million seller financing, that we had extended as part of the $1.1 billion office disposition that we executed in April 2015. We executed some significant debt transactions during the quarter as well. We used the proceeds that have been received from the seller financing I just mentioned and property shelves to payoff secured loans totaling $330 million to bore interest at an average effective rate of 5.8%. In June, we issued $375 million of 10 year 3.25% unsecured notes, which represent the lowest rate on a 10 year issuance in company history. In connection with this issuance, we initiated a tender offer that resulted in the repurchases $72 million of our 5.95% unsecured notes that were due in February of 2017. And we repaid the remaining $203 million of these notes earlier this week. These transactions significantly lower our overall borrowing costs. In the equity capital markets, we issued 4.6 million shares under our ATM program through July 08, 2016 for net proceeds of $111 million at an average issue price of $24.19 per share. With our growing list of development prospects and due to the fact that our shares did not traded at full interest of our net asset value in quite a while. We thought it was prudent to take some risk off the table and pre-fund some of this highly accretive development. We have only $14 million left in our current ATM filing plan to re-up the program to be prepared for future strategic and freedom opportunities. We concluded the quarter with $141 million of cash and lower outstanding borrowings on our line of credit. These capital sources along with the third quarter property sales are more than sufficient for the repayment we just made of the remaining February 2017 notes and the funding of our development pipeline for this foreseeable future. I would also point out that we have only $69 million of debt maturities until our next bond maturity in early 2018. All of these capital transactions coupled with our operational performance resulted in a significant improvement to our key financial metrics and we expect to see further improvements for the remainder of the year, resulting from the transactions and new income producing properties being in placed in-service. This is reflected in our revised guidance. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Jim. Jim Connor : Thanks Mark. In reflection of our strong performance for the first half of the year, and positive outlook for the second half of 2016, we increased our AFFO per share guidance by $0.01 at the mid-point. Given the strong outlook on our development pipeline, we also raised our development guidance to $500 million to $650 million up $75 million from the original mid-point. Also due to continued strong overall operating fundamentals, we raised our same-property NOI growth guidance to 4.25% to 5.5%, up 1.375% from the previous mid-point. Finally, given our capital recycling activities and our recent debt pay downs as Mark touched on, we\u2019ve changed the guidance for all three of our leveraged metrics in a positive direction. Details are provided in the supplemental package in the last night\u2019s press release. We believe these improved leverage metrics put us firmly in a position for a ratings upgrade in the near future. Revisions to certain other guidance factors can also be found in the Investor Relations section on our Web site. In closing, we\u2019re very pleased with our team\u2019s execution through the mid-year and our leasing performance, capital redeployment and balance sheet management. We are very optimistic about a strong performance for the remainder of the year. We\u2019ll now open up the lines for the audience. And we ask participants to keep the dialog to one question or perhaps two very short questions and you of course are welcomed to get back in the queue. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Blaine Heck. Please go ahead. Blaine Heck : Great, thanks. Mark, as you mentioned, you guys were active on the ATM during the quarter with $111 million of issuance on what seemed to be pretty good pricing. But your stock is up almost $4 a share from the average price of this quarter's issuance. So can you just talk about your appetite for further ATM issuance when you re-up the program? Mark Denien : Yes Blaine well if you look at the guidance that we changed for development and acquisitions, if you combine those we raised our total investment outlay by about $175 million. So we kind of looked at that incremental $175 million of investments and where our stock was trading at it was a good way to prefund that. So, we're really taking care of both from a balance sheet perspective and really everything we have baked in our guidance through the rest of the year. I mean certainly we like our stock price better where it is today and we did the deal. So I think we would look at any additional equity going forward as it would have to be to fund incremental investment opportunities above and beyond what's already in our guidance. Blaine Heck : Okay and that's helpful. And then just a follow-up: the increase in same-store NOI guidance is pretty substantial, over 1% higher at the midpoint. So can you give us some color on what you're seeing at this point? It's much better than what you had expected in the beginning of the year, whether it's on the rent side, occupancy side, or even expense savings. And was it driven by better execution in the first half of the year or kind of better expectations for the second half? Mark Denien : Quite honestly Blaine it's a little bit of everything you just mentioned, I mean our occupancy is better than what we had expected and that is reflective in the increase in our guidance. Some of that occupancy hasn't made its way in the rent yet and most of our actions stay on lease sign basis. So as those leases come online we do expect rental increases, some of the leasing we did early in the year or even late last year may have had just some minimal free ground or reduced rent in there that's burning off so you we have, rental rate increases, you've got occupancy increases and then rental rate growth is better than what we expected at the beginning here as well. We reported almost 19% increase in rents this year on a GAAP basis and as we look forward about 25% of all of our leases rolling in the next 18 months were signed in that trough period. So, we do believe we can continue to grow those in the 20% range and you couple those with some newer deals and we still think rent growth is going to look very similar going forward. So, I think it's just a little bit of everything that you mentioned that is driving that. Blaine Heck : Okay. Sounds great, thanks guys. Operator : Brad Burke. Please go ahead. Brad Burke : Hi good afternoon guys. I just wanted to get your updated thoughts on the suburban asset sales that you have planned for the balance of the year : one, whether the pricing and the interest that you're seeing in the market now is in line with what you had expected when you had initially given the guidance for the full year? And then, two, the guidance that you have for the remainder of the year -- the implied proceeds, is that entirely suburban ops at this point or would we expect there to be some industrial sales included in that total as well? Mark Denien : Well, Brad I would say that everything is on track, a couple of kind of general comments. I think that buyer pools in general, while they are still deep enough for us to get deals done are a little shallower than they had historically been, but we\u2019re making progress and we\u2019re kind of on track with everything we have got planned for the remaining office dispositions for the rest of the year, so we didn\u2019t feel it was warranted to change any of our guidance there. It\u2019s not a 100% office as we talk about we sold some buildings in Phoenix this year we sold a couple of buildings in California. And I think through our year-end numbers were projecting about 70%-75% of it could be office and about 25% to 30% of it could be industrial and a couple of one off we do -- we sold the last of our retail things and a few other clean up items. So I would say 70%-75% of it is office. Brad Burke : And just related to that, on my math it's almost $500 million of guidance at the midpoint for the back two quarters of the year for dispositions. So 75% of that -- is it right to think that $350 million to $400 million would be suburban office proceeds? And would that represent the bulk of your suburban office portfolio? Jim Connor : My CFO is sitting next to me shaking his head, so he confirms your math. Brad Burke : He is shaking, yes, okay good. Jim Connor : Up and down. Brad Burke : Good. All right. That's it for me, thank you. Operator : John Guinee. Please go ahead. John Guinee : You guys are really rocking and rolling, how the hell did you ever get down to $300 million of land? Jim Connor : Well thank you John, I will take that as a compliment. As we have talked about this at the last meeting, we have really changed the culture of Duke Reality. Many of you who have followed us over the years, we used to love to buy 500 acre farms and turn them into business parks and it\u2019s really tough to economically carry land for extended periods for time like that, so we have a much shorter time horizon on vacant land that we want to carry, we prefer to take it down and bite those pieces and put it into production as quickly as possible. So as tough as has been for us to get here, it\u2019s really been a welcome change, because the guys that need land can buy land and can put it into production right away. So I appreciate the compliment, it has been a long road getting here from the roughly $980 million we had back in 2008, but we think, we\u2019re in a sweet spot and we think we could stay here for the foreseeable future. John Guinee : All right okay, now. Jim Connor : Now the real question? John Guinee : Yes, one more question. Looking at page 28, looks like you have got a big build-to-suit in Southern California and then a couple 600,000 square feet of spec product. And that's almost half of your stabilized costs of bulk distribution, but you've got -- your yields on these, on the whole page at about 6.3% on a cash basis, what do you -- can you talk a little bit more about where in Southern California these deals are located, and what sort of yield on costs you're expecting in So Cal? Jim Connor : Yes sure John, the -- most of our development in Southern California right now is in the Inland Empire that large build-to-suit that you referred to is out there and several of the other buildings, although we\u2019re doing one into a redevelopment project, closer in, in Orange County, while those cash yields are down from what you have had historically seen from Duke Realty's portfolio in our either more mature or our mid-western markets. They are still -- it is a great spread over what the exit cap would be as you know pricing in Southern California has reached just virtually record levels, every deal we are seeing today is trading now in the 4s, and some of the exception of properties that are trading in the high 3s from a rate perspective. So even in a 63 we are still creating a tremendous amount of value for our shareholders there, if we would look to monetize that which we are not, we want to hold and grow that portfolio out there. John Guinee : Are any of these the Chevron site? Did you win that site? I think it was Chevron. I know it was an oil\u2026 Jim Connor : [Multiple Speakers] none of those has a Chevron site, we do have that under contract and if everything holds that\u2019s probably a very late fourth quarter or first quarter start next year. John Guinee : Okay, keep up the good work. Thanks. Operator : Manny Korchman. Please go ahead. Manny Korchman : Maybe if we just think back to combining your, the desire to do equity or the ATM with the -- through the portfolios that are out on the market, especially when your stock's trading at a premium to NAV, do you look at those portfolios now in a different way than you would have before the recent run in your stock price? Maybe how do you balance between the ATM and the larger equity offering? Jim Connor : Well, I think we'll both chime in on this. We look at every major portfolio that\u2019s out there, and most of the smaller ones and one off deals, it is nothing else just to be apprised of what's going in the market, what investor activity is and what pricing expectations are. So we are abreast of everything that\u2019s going on and we have yet to see an opportunity that we think is available at a price that we could demonstrate value creation. And really fits in our targeted growth portfolio. And for us that\u2019s the West Coast and predominantly the North-East, maybe South Florida. We have got really dominant portfolios in most of the other cities, so if we were on a stretch today, we would be in probably one of those three geographic areas. And we have them tune the right opportunity. So Mark I will let you add a little additional color. Mark Denien : Yes, I think as Jim said right on, I think you still first Manny look at the quality of the property and where the property is located and is it a property we want to own, regardless of what our capital cost is. Just because we are trading at a nicer stock price today than we were six months ago, doesn\u2019t make us want to go out and over pay for properties. So I think the quality of the property and where it is still number one and if we are trading at a nice size premium it may help us justify stretching a little bit it still got to be property that we want. Manny Korchman : So if we combine all of those thoughts together, what's the likelihood that you actually act on picking up a larger portfolio in the next, call it, six to 12 months? Are you seeing anything you like, especially now that you can pay for it? I'll ask it differently. Mark Denien : No, I don\u2019t think we see anything out there right now that we like well enough to do that. And as far as large portfolios, I am not saying that there won't be a one off transaction here or there but no large portfolios out there right now that we see. Manny Korchman : That was it for me. Thank you. Operator : Dave Rodgers. Please go ahead. Dave Rodgers : Jim, I think in your commentary you talked about having a pretty big backlog of build-to-suit activity, but obviously the start to the quarter were all spec. So I don't know -- maybe a little color on kind of was it just a timing issue in terms of what you started and what you plan to start the rest of the year? And I guess maybe a second part of that question is, I guess, looking maybe into 2017 without giving specific guidance, does that give us a good confidence that that pipeline could be equal to or larger going into 2017 than it is today? Jim Connor : Yes. Sure Dave. It\u2019s always about timing and try as I may, I can\u2019t always get my clients to sign leases by quarter end. They just don\u2019t feel the same sense of urgency that Mark and I do. But yes, we took a very close look and we assumed several of you would ask this very same question. Because, if you look at where we are midpoint, and we\u2019d tell you, we were pretty much in line with what we had originally projected. But we do have a very-very strong pipeline for the second half of the year, it\u2019s very consistent with the business that we\u2019ve been doing. A lot of our existing clients in the areas of ecommerce and consumer products some directly with them, some with 3PL providers. And we\u2019ve got a good mix all across the country, so given that we felt very comfortable raising the guidance on the development side. So I think you can look well forward to bigger numbers in the third quarter. I will tell you looking out beyond kind of the six month horizon. We\u2019re still very optimistic, our clients are not showing any skittishness, any pullback. Everything that\u2019s on track to get signed, I would say in the foreseeable future, the next three or four months is going full speed ahead. And our clients are probably more engaged with us today about their future needs whether it\u2019s in the form of build suits or taking speculative space, because the markets have gotten so tight. So you are a 800,000 foot user or a million square foot user in a major market. You don\u2019t have nearly the number of options. So we\u2019ve gotten engaged with much more of our clients, they\u2019ve been much more forthcoming with what their needs and expectations are over the next 24 months. And that has left us fairly optimistic as well. Dave Rodgers : Great, thanks. Operator : Michael Carroll. Please go ahead. Michael Carroll : Thanks. Kind of off of Dave's question, Jim, you seem much more comfortable starting speculative projects today compared to six months ago. Is this a function of leasing up the existing pipeline? Or are you seeing something, this activity in the market, that makes you more encouraged? Jim Connor : Well, I think it\u2019s a couple of those things. If we all reflect back on where we were about seven months ago going into 2016, we were all talking about markets reaching equilibrium sometime in 2017. We were anticipating that absorption was probably going to be in that closer to 180 million to 200 million square feet. And I think all of us are peers and you guys anybody that follows the sector has been very pleasantly surprised. We\u2019re on track to be at or above absorption, the average for the last couple of years if you just look at where we are for the first couple of quarters. And then you impair with that how successful we\u2019ve been leasing virtually all of these major spec projects that we have put. We\u2019ve leased a bunch of them right before they\u2019ve even come in-service, we\u2019ve leased another few right as they have come in-service, the one that we have under contract to sell through user here in Indianapolis that was probably in-service for about six or seven months. It was probably the longest one we had on the shelf. So I think given the confidence in our operating teams, our record high occupancy. And the state of the overall demand in the marketplace, we feel more comfortable accelerating a number of those spec projects. Mark Denien : Yes. And I would just reiterate what Jim said earlier too that this quarter being almost entirely spec, it was just more timing than anything. We\u2019ve got some pretty good datapoints looking forward of build-to-suits in the pipeline prospect so I think just going forward it will be still in that above 50% to 60% prelease range in total, so. Michael Carroll : Great, thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Ki Bin Kim. Please go ahead. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. Could you just comment on what you think lease spread could be going forward? You obviously put about 18% this quarter. If you look at the mix of what's coming due and the strength in just overall industrial market rents, do you think that is a sustainable number, or could it actually get better? Jim Connor : Yes, I will try that Ki Bin. I think it's for the next six to nine months I think it\u2019s pretty sustainable, I think I mentioned earlier about a fourth of our leases rolling into next 18 months for what we still consider to be those trough leases and we're going to push rents really-really hard there and they will be in the, several of those would be in the 25%-30% range. But I think overall we reported 19% this quarter I think we were more or like 14-15 the previous quarter I still think you will see us in that mid to upper-teens on average for the next three to six months. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. And\u2026 Mark Denien : Yes. And Ki Bin I would add to that. If you just if we all step back and we look at the macro numbers today most of the brokerage and research firms are attracting somewhere 165 million and may be 180 million square feet of supply, that's projected to come in-service over the course of the next year and we're on track to have another year of 240 million to 250 million plus square feet of absorption. So I think in the short-term if there is a higher probability that that overall vacancy goes down, before it goes up again, and I think if you see that macro trend you're going to see us continuing to have the leverage to continue to push rent. Ki Bin Kim : And just tied to that, typically I think your expiration profile is about 10% per year. How much do you really pull forward -- so from a practical standpoint, even though you show 10%, is it really like 12%, 15%? Just curious how that looks like. Jim Connor : Yes Ki Bin we don't like to get right up to the day the lease rolls. So, when that lease renews it's typically going to be two to six months before it comes up so you could be looking at pulling forward call it may be six months of the next year's leases so that takes you from 10% to closer to 15%. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. And this is just a question based on your same-store revenue off those two things. But if you are rolling over, like, around 15%, and -- let's give it the benefit of the doubt that you can do 18% market rent growth, how do you get above 2.5%, 2.7% same-store revenue growth or 3% revenue growth on a go-forward basis, even though industrial fundamentals are really strong? What are we missing in that equation? Jim Connor : Okay. I am not sure I followed that one Ki Bin. So, are you quoting a number that we reported, are you looking to\u2026 Ki Bin Kim : No, no. I'm just saying, in theory, if you are rolling over 15% of your portfolio and market rents are up, on a GAAP basis, 18%, how do we get above 3% same-store revenue growth? Jim Connor : Same-store NOI growth? Ki Bin Kim : Well assuming occupancies are flat, right? Jim Connor : Well I don't think we're assuming occupancy to be flat, we're assuming we're still going to drive occupancy. Occupancy growth will slow but we're not assuming flat occupancy. So we believe that we will still grow occupancy in that pool for properties for the next six months. You couple that with the rent bumps, which we have about 2.25% rent bump. You then add the call it 15% that you talked about rolling, that we can push rents up close to 20% and then the final factor is burn off of free or reduced rent and all that together is what gets you up to that number. Operator : Sumit Sharma. Please go ahead. Sumit Sharma : Hi. A question on capitalized interest, so you've increased the guidance for development starts, and that should result in higher capitalized interest, at least maybe in the second half of the year. I'm just wondering what level of capitalized interest savings or what level of overall interest savings are you contemplating from this versus, say, 2015? Jim Connor : Really about the same run rate that we\u2019ve had the first half of the year, even though we\u2019re quoting a start number, we capitalize our interest based on the actual spend, so a lot of the starts that we\u2019re quoting, the development spend won\u2019t happen until late this year, or early next year. So we\u2019re really looking at continuing at about the run rate that we have for the first half of the year. And then to couple that I would say also, with the fact that our overall average borrowing costs are going down, so that actually lowers the amount of interest we capitalize a little bit as well. Operator : Eric Frankel. Please go ahead. Eric Frankel : Thank you. Mark, can you help me out with -- do you have on hand the re-leasing starts for renewal leases if you factor in those new deals that were signed as soon as the spaces went vacant? Jim Connor : Yes, I would tell you that Eric we have always -- are you just talking about the new second generation leases that backfilled, what that would have been? Eric Frankel : Right, yes, yes, just because you threw in the renewal percentages [Multiple Speakers]. Jim Connor : If you just isolated those deals, it would have improved it quite a bit. Eric Frankel : Okay. Jim Connor : In total I would tell you that the total new second generation leasing this quarter, because it was easy, it was like an apples to apple comparison of the old tenants out with the new tenants, in the past we have never quoted that number because sometimes it all take the same space and all that. This quarter it happened to be pretty easy. I would tell you, if we would have quoted that number it would have actually been a little bit better than our renewal. Eric Frankel : Okay. Jim Connor : Not a lot but a little bit. Eric Frankel : That's helpful to know. And just another question; I'll jump in the queue if there's other people, but I'm trying to understand the same-store NOI growth calculation and how development -- contributions from development influence that, just because, as you said, there's a lot of leases that are coming -- there's a lot of properties coming to the portfolio with leases that are just signed. And I'm trying to understand just how that's -- how it's influencing the same-store NOI growth statistic and whether NOI is actually understated this quarter as a result of all of that lease-up that occurred? Jim Connor : Yes and I may have misled you there Eric, it\u2019s not just development it\u2019s leasing in general and an example of that will be those four big backfill deals, they are in our occupancy numbers as the leases are signed, but we\u2019re not collecting rent yet but we\u2019ll start to collect rent on that in the third and fourth quarter, so it\u2019s not just development that is causing that it is just, it\u2019s all that we say we are doing not just development. But the way -- but there may be a specific answer to your development question, the way we do same-property is we put properties in our same-property pool, after they have been in-service for 24 full months. So as you sit here today the only development projects we have in our same-property pool, would have to have been in-service on March -- I am sorry on April 01, 2014, so that you had two-full years in there. But I don\u2019t know if that answers your question or not? Eric Frankel : Okay. I just -- so you think that the timing issue related to some of the leases you sign during the second quarter -- that just hadn't quite flown through? Jim Connor : I think that is right, it's more timing than anything and then as I tried to mention in my opening remarks, in the second quarter there were three or four individually small expense true up type items that hurt us this quarter. And actually if you went back to the previous year\u2019s quarter, we had a couple of adjustments that were revenue related that helped that quarter so when you look at the 2 together it distorts this quarter's NOI growth a little bit. And FYI I think you've heard me say this a million times, I don\u2019t like to look too much at just the quarterly number, I like the 12 month number better because it doesn\u2019t take one little item and multiply it by four and skew your result. Eric Frankel : Understood, okay, we'll do some work. We'll jump back in the queue. Thanks. Operator : James Feldman. Please go ahead. James Feldman : Thank you. With your large build-to-suit pipeline, can you talk about what's happening to the space those tenants are leaving behind? Are these new requirements and space reconfigurations, or are they already in the portfolio? It seems like everybody is looking for new buildings, but how do we think about the fallout from that? Jim Connor : Well Jimmy, I think if you just look at our existing portfolio and the fact that we have been able to raise occupancy, net-net there is a great deal of net absorption out there. If you want us to talk specifically about those build-to-suits, some are absolutely new deals where the client has not given up any space, some of which are consolidations of multiple spaces where they are looking to gain some additional efficiencies, they are generally additional space in there because most of these clients are growing. But as we did this quarter, we have been able to backfill space at very good rental rates. So in that there is probably a little bit of both, but there is a lot of demand out there when you have got overall nationwide vacancy is 5.2% and you have got a lot of big users out there seeking new space. It's a good time for us in the industrial business. James Feldman : Okay. And then in terms of the speculative starts in the quarter, it looks like Eastern Pennsylvania and Southern California. Are there other markets, do you think you'll spread to more markets with the speculative starts? I know it sounds like it will still be pretty measured. And then how would you say the count -- like, other developers in the market, are you seeing them start to get more comfortable with spec, also? Jim Connor : Well, I\u2019ll take the last question first. Yes, there is no shortage of people doing spec development, I think what we are all very happy or pleased with is that demand continues to outpace supply by a find pretty healthy margin. To your first question when we have got I think 18 of our 21 markets above 90%, and 12 above 95% and a couple at 100%. We are in a position to start specing virtually all of our markets. We will probably be a little bit more measured than that. Particularly some of the markets like New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Southern California are the high barrier markets where it takes a little longer to entitle land and improve projects. You probably can't reload quite as fastest as you would like, and that\u2019s a burden we bear for being a little bit more cautious than perhaps some of the local developers. But it\u2019s worked for us very well so far. So you\u2019ll continue to see us take a measured approach do some speculative development in a number of these different markets we mix that in with our build-to-suit, and I think the pipeline will look very-very good in the second half of the year. James Feldman : All right, great. Thank you. Operator : Blaine Heck. Please go ahead. Blaine Heck : Thanks. Just a quick clarification related to the vacant Indianapolis asset you guys have under contract. So was that move to held-for-sale during this quarter, and thus had a positive effect on occupancy during 2Q? Or is that going to be a positive for occupancy in the third quarter? Jim Connor : No Blaine, it was moved in the second quarter. So it\u2019s moved out of our population, if you will down in the held for sale, so that did help occupancy in the second quarter. And when we sell it in the third quarter it will have no impact on occupancy since it has already been taken out. Blaine Heck : Got it, thanks. Operator : Eric Frankel. Please go ahead. Eric Frankel : One more question. How tough it is to buy land today? Jim Connor : Eric, it\u2019s not tough, it\u2019s expensive. And most of our markets that we\u2019re active in land prices have exceeded previous peaks of 2007-2008. I think that\u2019s another reason why our strategy to be very-very prudent on our land inventory is paying off for us. So I was asked so I think it was probably at NAREIT if given where we were, we were going to go out and bulk up on land and we have continually advised our business guys. Now is not the time to bulk up on that. We will buy what we need put it in-service as quickly and efficiently as possible and keep that land inventory at a very efficient level. And we will look to make some key buys somewhere down the road when land prices return to a somewhat more normalized level. Eric Frankel : Okay. Actually, I misspoke. I have one more question. Can you just clarify the valuation of the JV breakup with Gramercy? I think on the back page of the supp, you value a building at $67 million. But I think you, in your opening commentary, made it sound like it was actually closer to -- $53 million was the portion of which that you paid. So I'm just trying to understand the valuation better. Jim Connor : No there were two buildings Eric. We bought two buildings this quarter, I think we quoted 51 million for the value of the industrial building that we effectively bought I am air quotes here from Gramercy and then about $16 million for a medical office building that we had actually had under contract for well over a year. So there were 2 buildings in that 67 million in the supplementals. Eric Frankel : And that $51 million -- for the 80% interest? Jim Connor : Correct. Eric Frankel : Okay. That's all I need to know. Okay, thank you. Jim Connor : All right, thanks. Operator : There are no further questions in queue. Please continue. Jim Connor : I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining the call today. We look forward to reconvening during our third quarter call that is the October 27th. Thanks again. Operator : That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference service. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. And instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Ron Hubbard. Please go ahead. Ron Hubbard : Thank you, Hart. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Jim Connor, President and CEO; and Mark Denien, Chief Financial Officer. Before we make our prepared remarks, let me remind you that statements we make today are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations. For more information about those risk factors, we refer you to our December 31, 2015, 10-K that we have on file with the SEC. Now, for our prepared statement, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim Connor. Jim Connor : Thank you, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019ll start out with an update on the overall business environment and then transition into our third quarter results. Nationally, the industrial market\u2019s momentum continues to be very strong. Demand outpaced supply for the 25th straight quarter. New supply in substantially all markets is in balance and demand for modern bulk space year-to-date continues to beat everybody\u2019s expectations. Net absorption for the third quarter was 77 million square feet, that\u2019s the most since the fourth quarter of 2005. Although 40% of this absorption was in five of our markets, those markets include Southern California, Houston, Dallas, Chicago, and Pennsylvania. On the supply side, new supply in the third quarter totaled 53 million square feet, the most since the fourth quarter of 2008, yet speculative deliveries were down 15% from the previous quarter. The net result was another 20 basis point drop in the overall vacancy nationwide to approximately 5%, just from a historical perspective, the tenure average is about 8% and the recession was about 10%. These positive fundamentals continue to drive strong rent growth, 40% of all markets nationally are expected to post double-digit rent growth in 2016. As we\u2019ve stated on previous calls, demand has been broad based even in the relatively slow 2% GDP growth environment. Containerized traffic flow, transportation industries and consumer confidence all trending in a positive direction with regard to demand for industrial product. We\u2019re seeing similar strength in our own portfolio with the completion of 4.4 million square feet of leasing for the quarter, which drove our in-service occupancy to 97.3%, a 60 basis point increase from the second quarter, which achieved another record high occupancy in the company\u2019s history. Rents on new and renewal leases for the quarter grew by 19%, reflecting continued strong supply demand fundamentals and our solid pricing power. A particular note was our continued success in leasing recently completed speculative projects. One notable transaction executed during the third quarter was a 615,000 square foot lease, for 100% of the space in our speculative project at our Camp Creek Business Center in Atlanta. This lease was signed by a major consumer products company for a term of 10 years. Overall, demand for space continue to be strong from traditional customers of industrial distribution space and of course the powerful direct and indirect demand forces of e-commerce. We believe our platform is in a very strong position to continue to capture this growth. The strong supply demand dynamics help contribute to same property NOI growth with 12 months and three months ended September 30, 2016 at 5.1% and 5.7% respectively. On the development side of the business, momentum continues to be very strong, as I\u2019ve alluded to in the last few calls. During the third quarter, we generated a $183 million of starts across six industrial projects and two medical office projects, in aggregate totaling 3 million square feet and about 50% pre-leased. The industrial development projects were spread across markets such as Chicago, Baltimore, Tampa, Indianapolis and Savannah. Many of you may recall hearing about the Savannah project was in the news recently. The 1.4 million square feet build-to-suit with a national retailer Floor & Decor was for a lease term of 15 years. On medical office side, we started 200% pre-leased projects in Raleigh and Dallas totaling 72,000 square feet. Both transactions were with existing healthcare system clients of ours and both were for lease terms of 15 years. I\u2019m also pleased to share with you that we have started three fully leased build-to-suit industrial projects after quarter end in early October with an expected cost of $113 million and an aggregate totaling nearly 1 million square feet. These deals were all executed with major brand name tenants. They were all executed on our land. These October starts are consistent with our increased 2016 guidance for development starts, which I\u2019ll expand on momentarily. We\u2019ve continued to see strong activity in our development pipeline, and our confident will close at 2016 in strong fashion, and are optimistic about 2017 as of today. Our overall development pipeline at quarter end has 21 projects under construction, totaling 7.2 million square feet and a projected $575 million in stabilized cost at our share. We\u2019re 58% pre-leased in the aggregate. We\u2019ll continue to closely manage pre-leasing levels on new development start opportunities, as noted numerous times in the past. While our company has an excellent track record in competing for build-to-suit projects, we\u2019ll also continue to strategically allocate capital to speculative developments. In fact since the fourth quarter of 2014, we delivered 24 spec industrial projects that were initially 14% pre-leased. These projects are now 85% leased with strong prospects for the remaining space. Margins on the pipeline are expected to continue in the 20% range. We believe our strategy will continue to represent a solid risk-adjusted value creation engine for our shareholders. Turning to dispositions, we closed $227 million of transactions during the quarter at an overall average in-place cap rate of 7.4%. The largest component of these dispositions was the sale of an eight-building 1.2 million square foot office part in Indianapolis that included our corporate headquarters facility. I know there are notable dispositions that I alluded to on our last call with the closing of the user sale on the 936,000 square feet speculative industrial building in Indianapolis that had been placed in service, but was yet unleased. A few other notes on this industrial sale, first we sold this building for more than 20% gain to a major retailer for its dedicated Midwestern regional e-commerce facility. If we exclude this sale from our third quarter dispositions, the reported aggregate in-place cap rate would be 8.2%. For the remainder of the year, we expect $140 million to $260 million of dispositions, reflecting a small reduction in the previous midpoint of our guidance, part of this reduced guidance relates to an office part sale in Indianapolis that we had to put on hold until after an M&A transaction involving the primary tenant in the park is completed late in 2016 or early 2017. In addition, there were a few other assets that we expect to close late in the year, but could ultimately spill over into the first quarter. Overall, we are very pleased with our results for the year and we\u2019re still progressing towards our target of completely exiting the suburban office business by year end or shortly thereafter. Even with these dispositions, we continue to be confident in our ability to growth our AFFO just as we\u2019ve done for the last five years. With this continued steady AFFO growth outlook, and with what we believe is a very defensive portfolio to handle cyclicality. We\u2019re very pleased to announce a 5.6% increase in our regular quarterly dividend. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark to discuss our financial results and the capital transactions for the quarter. Mark Denien : Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone. Core FFO per share was $0.31 for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $0.30 per share for the second quarter of 2016, and $0.29 per share for the third quarter of 2015. The increase in core FFO per share is due to our continued improvement in key operating statistics that Jim just touched on, as well as lower interest expense that resulted from our deleveraging activities over the last several quarters. AFFO for the quarter totaled $103 million, which was a 7.6% increase from the $95 million in AFFO reported last quarter. Our high quality portfolio continues to produce positive AFFO growth and we\u2019re still comfortable with our original full year guidance of AFFO growth on a share adjusted basis of approximately 5%. In the equity capital markets, we issued $3.7 million shares under our ATM program in August and September for net proceeds of $103 million at an average issue price of $28.07 per share. In considering our share price relative to net asset value, the increases in our development pipeline that Jim previously mentioned along with our growing list of future prospects, we determined that prudent to use our ATM pre-funds development. We now raised all the capital necessary to fund the current pipeline as well as the next couple of quarter\u2019s works of expected development starts from a few others on our prospect list and have less than $80 million of debt maturities through 2017. Our recent de-levering transactions have significantly strengthened our balance sheet and resulted in ongoing reductions to interest expense. Along these lines, I\u2019m pleased to note that in early October, Fitch Ratings upgraded our senior unsecured credit rating from BBB to BBB plus with a stable outlook. All of these capital transactions coupled with our operational performance, resulted in improvements to our key financial metrics during the quarter. We expect to see further improvement during the remainder of the year resulting from disposition transactions and highly leased development properties being placed in service. This is reflected in our revised guidance. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Jim. Jim Connor : Thanks, Mark. In review of the year-to-date results and outlook for the remainder of the year, yesterday we raised the low-end of guidance for core FFO by $0.02 per share, narrowing the 2016 range to $1.18 to $1.20 per share, and affectively raising the midpoint by $0.01. Given the strong outlook on our development pipeline, we raised the development guidance to a range of $650 million to $750 million, up $125 million from the previous midpoint. Also due to continued overall strong operating fundaments, we raised our same property NOI growth guidance from a range of 5.2% to 6%, up about 70 basis points from the previous midpoint. Finally, given our capital recycling activities and recent debt pay downs, we changed the guidance for all three leverage metrics in a positive direction. We believe these improved leverage metrics put us firmly in position for a continued ratings upgrades in the near future. As noted in yesterday\u2019s earnings release, the full details on revisions to certain guidance factors can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website as well as on the back page of our quarterly supplemental. Let me reemphasize once again how proud we are to have the company repositioned with a rock solid balance sheet, a low AFFO payout ratio and positioned to support raising the regular quarterly common dividend by 5.6%. Now, we\u2019ll open the lines up to the audience, and I would ask that participants keep the dialogue to one question or perhaps two very short questions, and you are, of course, welcome to get back in the queue. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Kyle McGrady [Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.]. Please go ahead. You\u2019re open. Kyle McGrady : I\u2019m going to get back in the queue, let me ask \u2013 let me get my ducks in a row, call on us in 15 minutes. Jim Connor : Thank you, Kyle. Operator : And we have a question from the line of [indiscernible]. You are open. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Thanks, guys. Just a quick question, Page 22 of the sub, you reported growth in net effective rent slightly differently this quarter, where you wrapped up both the new and renewal leases for medical office and bulk industrial. What was the breakdown by those different property types for a growth in net effective rent for this quarter? Mark Denien : Yeah, Tom, this is Mark. We in our effort can try to provide enhanced and better guidance for everybody. We\u2019ll admit we inadvertently kind of omitted that. So we\u2019ll work on this page for the future and get that back in. But I would tell you two things on that. The medical office piece is just a small piece of the overall pie. It really doesn\u2019t move the needle. So if you look, for example, the third quarter number of 19.3% that\u2019s right about what the bulk was. We only had just a few thousand square feet, 23,000 square feet of medical deals signed in the quarter compared to 2 million square feet on the industrial side. So the medical is just not moving that overall numbers. So the overall numbers pretty closely industrial, I would tell you the medical is probably slightly lower than that and it was just a mix, but nothing now the ordinary there. Unidentified Analyst : Completely fair. And then just one more quick one from me. Acquisition guide was bumped up for the full year. This is kind of bucking trends we\u2019ve seen from other companies in the sector, everyone else seems to be slightly taking down their acquisitions just based on pricing for core assets being still very strong. What was it about? What you guys see in the market right now that led you to bump up the acquisition guide? Mark Denien : Yeah. We\u2019re probably seeing the same things most or overall. But I would tell you the reason, we have ours \u2013 that we raised it is really related to a joint venture transaction that we planned on executing here. So in some existing relationship we have, we already have a part ownership in these assets and we\u2019re just going to take our partner out this quarter. So that\u2019s where most of that fourth quarter activity is going to come from. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks, guys. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we have the line of Manny Korchman [Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)]. Please go ahead. Manny Korchman : Hey, guys. Good afternoon. So, Jim, if I go back to your comments on spec building, you said over the last couple of years, you\u2019ve done a bunch of projects. If I had to rank your confidence now in starting a new spec project today versus if we sat here two years ago, so in October 2014, where would you be more confident in getting a spec project off the ground? Jim Connor : Well, I think, we\u2019d be more confident today, just given the surprisingly strong numbers that we\u2019ve seen year-to-date from both the demand and the supply side. I think it was particularly interesting that that spec deliveries in the quarter were actually down quarter-over-quarter by about 15%. And there has been some speculation that Fed has tighten the reigns a little bit on the money center and regional banks on construction lending, so that that was going to perhaps put a crimp in some of the local developers that were developing spec projects. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve really seen that come to pass. But I would tell you sitting here today, we\u2019re very confident given the track record we\u2019ve had in getting this space leased. And I think you see that by the fact that we announced four spec projects last quarter. Manny Korchman : Great. And then Mark on that the \u2013 I guess the JV buyout, it sounds like that you\u2019re thinking about, what would sort of a cap rate be on that, is that pre-negotiated? Mark Denien : Yeah. It\u2019s a pre-negotiated cap rate, Manny. I won\u2019t disclose it individually, but I would tell you that we believe it\u2019s a cap rates or it\u2019s in a yield, it\u2019s in excess of the cap rate. So we think that there is a \u2013 some good value there that we\u2019re buying. Manny Korchman : So if we\u2019re just thinking about the modeling your total acquisition pool, where would that be now? Mark Denien : Yeah. Total acquisition pool is probably going to be close to 7%, I would say. Manny Korchman : That\u2019s it for me. Thank you. Jim Connor : Yep. Mark Denien : Sure. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz [UBS Securities LLC]. Please go ahead, Jeremy. You\u2019re open. Jeremy Metz : Hey, guys. I\u2019m just wondering your industrial occupancy is over 97%, so I\u2019m just wondering how you\u2019re thinking about this in terms of are you really pushing rents hard enough and then as we think about it going forward should we expect to see that occupancy actually start to tick down as you push around here? Jim Connor : Well, Jeremy, that\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re in a really interesting time. I would tell you that I see the final terms of all of the major deals that we\u2019re doing. And I would tell you, I\u2019m comfortable. I think that\u2019s backed up by 19% rent growth for the quarter. So, yeah, we\u2019re comfortable where it is. I think it\u2019s a reasonable to expect that that\u2019s going to come down. I think we could come down 100 basis points and we\u2019d still be in a very, very good spot. I don\u2019t anticipate that that\u2019s going to happen, because given the volume of leasing that we\u2019re seeing out there. I just think it\u2019s very unlikely that we\u2019ll have an off quarter or two, where we\u2019ll bring a bunch of spec projects in, that aren\u2019t substantially pre-leased. And I think we\u2019re seeing great renewal activity in our portfolio. So, we\u2019re not anticipating getting any major vacancies backed this year or early next year that we can handle with our normal leasing volume. Jeremy Metz : Okay. And then just one on the development front, you mentioned the strong build-to-suit pipeline. I was just wondering is there anything in particular that\u2019s driving that increased activity and then maybe can you talk about what markets those opportunities are really coming in, is that how much of it is maybe e-commerce related? Jim Connor : E-com \u2013 I\u2019ll answer the second question first, Jeremy. E-commerce continues to be a very big driver of our business both on the leasing and on the development side. And you just think about it logically, we positioned the company, particularly the industrial portfolio, focused on the modern large bulk products and that\u2019s what e-commerce users need today. With the exception of some of the smaller infill last mile, which we\u2019re doing a little bit of most of the fulfillment centers today we\u2019re looking at are 800 square feet to 1.2 million square feet that brand new state-of-the-art 36 foot and 40 foot clear and that\u2019s really in our sweet spot. So, we\u2019ll continue to do a lot of business with the e-commerce companies and they will continue to be a great driver of our business. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Mike Muller. Please go ahead. You are open. Mike Mueller : Hi, quick question. On your GAAP rent spreads, they\u2019re running at about two times the 2015 level. And I was wondering in terms of the drivers of the increase from the nine to ten to the high-teens now, would you say it\u2019s primarily higher rate driving it or other dynamics and lease terms changing such as you\u2019re getting bigger bumps longer term. I was just wondering can you give us a little more background on that? Mark Denien : Yeah, I would tell you it\u2019s really all the above. It\u2019s just overall better quality leases. We\u2019re getting as good or better bumps, we\u2019re getting better starting rents. It\u2019s really all the above. It\u2019s not really lease vintage driven, if you will. We\u2019re doing about a third of the leases right now that are rolling or what I consider to be in the trough period. That\u2019s about the same percentage we were running at last year. The overall amount of leases rolling are getting smaller, because their overall expiration schedule is pretty light. But as far as the percentage of the leases rolling, the vintage of them are pretty consistent from 2015 to 2016. So, that doubled the increase, if you will, and that net effective rent growth is really just overall rent growth that we are driving, whether it be starting rent, or rent bumps, or truly all the above. Jim Connor : Yeah, Mike, the only point I would add to that is and you touched on it in your question as lease term. Two things, the more really large deals we do, always tend to have longer terms, 10-year and 15-year lease terms. So that clearly helps there. The other side of it is with our portfolio is well leased as it is, we are doing very, very few short-term leases. Historically, it\u2019s not uncommon to get a tenant to come to us and say, I\u2019m just not really sure what my business is going to do, I want to renew for 12 months or I want to renew for 18 months. And the truth is, we\u2019re not doing very many of those leases. Today, kind of the short-term for us is three years and we\u2019re really looking a lot of tenants up for the longer term, while we\u2019ve got some leverage, so we can push rents and escalation. So, I think it\u2019s all of those things but that\u2019s one point I wanted to add. Mike Mueller : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman. Please go ahead. Jamie Feldman : Great. Thank you. I guess starting with the guidance, can you talk about \u2013 you did some delevering activity, so like if you would just move your guidance on your, kind of core operations, how much you would have increased it and then what was the drag from some of the deleveraging you did? Mark Denien : Jamie, you mean the drag on earnings from delevering? Jamie Feldman : Yeah. Mark Denien : I would say that really nothing in what we reported. There maybe a little drag in the fourth quarter, because we\u2019re sitting on cash in October until we can get that redeployed in the bonds that we bought back just last week in our development pipeline. So you may be looking at a penny drag in the fourth quarter, but it really didn\u2019t have any impact on the numbers we reported, nor would I say it would have an impact as we look forward to next year because it will all be fully redeployed by then. And then as far as the leverage metrics that we are at, I would tell you that they\u2019re a little bit low because of raising the capital that we did in the third quarter to prefund. So, as an example, that debt-to-EBITDA number really close to 5.0. As we look out in the 2017, we\u2019ll probably be closer into the mid-5s. We won\u2019t need to raise any additional capital to fund all of this that I \u2013 like I talked about. So that leverage metrics will naturally move up closer to the mid-5s. But I would also point out that without any additional delivering, fixed charge will continue to get better because we have high coupon debt that continues to burn off. So, fixed charge will get better and debt-to-EBITDA will be kind of in the mid-5s. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then, I guess as you think about next year, big picture activity, like any big dispositions you think we might do, like how you guys are thinking about MLP now? I\u2019m just turing to think about, I mean your core seems like it\u2019s improving, but what are the noise might we see next year? Do you guys continue to make some changes to the business to the balancesheet? Mark Denien : Well, Jamie, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re, at this point in the year, we are not planning to create any additional noise next year. I think the bulk of the heavy lifting will be done. I think we\u2019ve really positioned the company to grow. And I think that\u2019s really what we\u2019re focused on as we start to look forward to 2017. Jamie Feldman : Okay. All right, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : And next, we have a line of Sumit Sharma. Please go ahead. You\u2019re open. Sumit Sharma : Thank you. So thanks for the commentary and all of the disclosure and commentary this quarter. I see that the GAAP rents, but it\u2019s had me confused too, but Ron was instrumental in clearing that up. But I guess it sounds like NOI\u2019s growth is accelerating into fourth quarter, which is great and this may be an early indicator that 2017 could look a lot like 2016, maybe get some comments on that. But more importantly as a owner and manager of industrial real estate, I guess where are you guys most cautious, because if you think about the investor mindset, they\u2019re all trying to say, we\u2019re all trying to figure out well, this is little too good. Jim Connor : No, guys, it\u2019s not too good. You know, it\u2019s good, you should enjoy it. Well, let me take your first question about 2017. Sitting here, kind of towards the end of October, I would tell you we feel fairly optimistic about 2017. There is nothing in the macro drivers of the industrial business, so called storm clouds on the horizon that would really give you pause. We\u2019ve been in a slow growth market, but that\u2019s been really good for the industrial business. Consumer confidence is still up, although as I referenced earlier in my earlier comments the transportation indices are a little inconsistent, but by and large, they are all reasonably positive. I think we look at the, particularly the supply and demand equilibrium in the marketplace. I think that we\u2019ve had a fundamental change in the industrial business that is here for the foreseeable future, which is e-commerce. And if you look at the pace at which e-commerce is growing and the amount of space they need to support that business and most of that is in the form of new big boxes. I think we\u2019re positioned very, very well for the future. In terms of what worries us in the future, I would tell you it\u2019s not the U.S. and it\u2019s not real estate. I think you got to go global macro to anticipate anything that could really put the U.S. economy in a bad spot or have some really negative trickle over into our market right now. But thankfully we don\u2019t see that right now. So we\u2019re fairly optimistic. Sumit Sharma : Thank you so much. If I may just ask one follow-up to that, I mean, if you were just thinking about it from \u2013 like you mentioned bulk distribution, in fact you categorized your industrial portfolio as a bulk distribution portfolio. What if in 2018 or going into 2019, it\u2019s not about the bulk and it\u2019s more about such a smaller, closer to last mile in-fill kind of assets. How are you prepping for that, how are you\u2019re getting into new markets, any commentary on that? Jim Connor : Sure. I\u2019ll give you a couple of data points. First of all, that\u2019s a business we are in and we have been in for many years. And it probably doesn\u2019t get talked about enough and that\u2019s our fault. But Duke has a long track record of redevelopment, brownfield redevelopment, we\u2019ve done a number of these projects in major metropolitan areas all over the country. So we do that, we\u2019re doing business with some of our favorite e-commerce companies, and some of our transportation and 3PL companies right now. So, A, we are addressing that business. The second point is the last mile, which has gotten a lot of attention our industry of late is really fairly small. If you look at and do research on Amazon, for example, They have about two million square feet of these last mile facilities. They average about 50,000 square feet or 60,000 square feet a piece, right. They have 70 million square feet, a fulfillment center. And you need the fulfillment centers to drive this huge volume, I mean this is a company that has 30% market share of the e-commerce business in the U.S., it is growing at 15% or 16% a year. They\u2019re not going to be able to keep up that growth by focusing on 50,000 square foot in-fill, that\u2019s just really small piece of the equation. You look at the number of projects that they have in the pipeline, that are debated out there in the different public forum, they have twice as many of these major fulfillment centers, which average about one million square feet as compared to the number of the last mile. So, it\u2019s an important piece of their business and it\u2019s important piece of e-commerce going forward. But, quite candidly, it\u2019s just not going to move the needle. Sumit Sharma : Fair enough. Thank you for your comments. We will continue the conversation at [indiscernible]. Thanks. Operator : And, our next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck. Please go ahead. You\u2019re open. Blaine Heck : Thanks. Good afternoon. So, I guess just back on the topic of acquisitions you guys have, the best balance sheet, you guys have had in a long time and there have been some pretty significant industrial portfolios on the market. So, if there was an opportunity to expand your presence in target markets with a substantial portfolio acquisition, would you guys consider it or do you think pricing is still at a place that might keep you from kind of chasing a deal like that? Jim Connor : Blaine, if you got one, call me afterwards, we\u2019ll work on the deal. No, guys, the truth is we look at every deal that comes down the pipeline, every deal. And, the ones that we talked about in this last quarter, it\u2019s a combination of the quality of the portfolio, the location of the real estate and the pricing. And all the ones that we looked at, we passed on for a variety of reasons. If the right portfolio came along, if it was, particularly, if it was heavily weighted into the markets that we want to grow in, we know what a reasonable price is. I think we\u2019d certainly try and be willing to pay up for that. And given where our stock has been trading and our balance sheet, I think, our currency is strong and we\u2019ve got the ability to stretch. So when we find the right one, I think, we\u2019ll certainly be \u2013 we\u2019ll certainly try and make it happen. We just haven\u2019t found the right thing. And it\u2019s like you tell your kids, just because you got money in your pocket doesn\u2019t mean you got to go spend it. Blaine Heck : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Mark, you guys have seen very strong same-store NOI performance over the past several quarters and looks like guidance implies another good one in the fourth quarter. It seems as though occupancy has been a big win at your back [indiscernible], but given that you guys announced 97.3%, it will be pretty hard to maintain the year-over-year increase. So I guess, given where rent spreads are and where rent bumps are right now, what kind of level of the same-store NOI growth do you think you can achieve without kind of the benefit of increasing year-over-year occupancy? Mark Denien : Yeah, Blaine, I mean, obviously we\u2019ll give a little bit better color on that again everyone to give our guidance for 2017. But I would tell you that if you just look at where we are today and where we think we\u2019re going to be closing out 2016, about half of our same-property growth is coming right now from rent bumps and rent growth on rollovers. I think that is very sustainable as we look forward, because we\u2019ve got rent bumps filled into really all of our leases. I think we are very bullish in our ability to continue to drive rental rate growth on rollover. So that that half of what we get, or getting right now, I think we feel very comfortable about that going forward. You\u2019re exactly right on the occupancy piece. If you look right now, the remaining half of that same property growth, a good chunk of that is occupancy related. And it is going to be tough to continue to drive occupancy up, and like Jim even mentioned, I think, if we were to bet something right now, we may bet that it may tick back just a little bit, at least early in the year, next year. So let\u2019s just call it out flat and then you got to look at just efficiencies in your portfolio and where you can drive those. So that\u2019s a long-winded answer for San. I think, we\u2019re still very positive in our ability to drive same property growth, maybe not at today\u2019s level. But I will caveat all that by reminding everybody that we don\u2019t put properties in our same property pool, until they\u2019ve been in our population for 24 whole months. So we believe we have just as much NOI upside if you look at total NOI growth on all the properties that we\u2019ve delivered and are going to deliver in our development pipeline. So I think that overall NOI growth can continuously look forward at about the same levels that we\u2019re driving today. Blaine Heck : So can I push a little bit and ask whether it\u2019s kind of between two and three or three and four? Mark Denien : I\u2019ll let you know in January, Blaine. Blaine Heck : Sounds good. Thanks, guys. Operator : And next, we have the line of Eric Frankel. Please go ahead. You\u2019re open. Eric Frankel : Thank you. Obviously, everything is in great shape and you\u2019re commenting on the demand picture or nationally and specifically, some of the biggest markets, Houston, Dallas, Chicago, Pennsylvania, and Southern California. Are you seeing any supply, any \u2013 I know, obviously supply and demand has been imbalanced for last couple of years, where demand has outpaced supply. So are you seeing any big supply issues on the horizon in those markets? I think, just in the local reports, we\u2019ve read over the last couple of weeks, we \u2013 I think, certainly in Chicago and Atlanta supply has picked up immensely. And I think it would, at the current development volumes, it would probably match with what demand has been in the last couple of quarters. Jim Connor : Yeah. Eric, I would answer that in a couple of ways. We\u2019ve seen over the last few years, a handful of markets get, what I would call maybe slightly over built , and that the beauty of the markets today is how efficiently they are operating and you can look at, we\u2019ve talked about over the last number of quarters, we\u2019ve talked about Indianapolis, we\u2019ve talked about Houston, we\u2019ve talked about Columbus. And anytime those markets got slightly out of balance, all developers took their foot off the accelerator, we waited for demand to come back, which it has in all of those instances. So, I think from a macro level, the market is operating very efficiently. Yeah, you look at some of the numbers, we were having the same conversation probably a year ago, about Dallas, when Dallas was pushing I don\u2019t know 25 million square feet of speculative. Dallas is on track to do 20 million square feet of net absorption this year. So, Chicago and Atlanta have kind of joined that club, but they\u2019re both having really strong quarters of absorption and the amount of activity that we\u2019ve got is evidence by that 600,000 foot lease in our Camp Creek Park, is very, very strong. So, I don\u2019t see any, real warning clouds, there is a lot of activity out there to cover this spec development. Eric Frankel : Okay. And that\u2019s helpful. Switching to the build-to-suit side. I am not sure about the cost basis for what you, what you started this quarter. But what you just announced in terms of your three build-to-suit, starts in early October, I guess that comes down to roughly $113 per rentable square foot. Can you comment maybe on the nature of the leases that seems somewhat expensive for industrial. Jim Connor : Yeah. There might be one of those in there, that\u2019s got a little bit higher basis and a little bit more in-fill specialty use to it. Obviously, it\u2019s early we can\u2019t give you specifics on each individual deal, I think we\u2019ll get into more specifics next quarter, when we announce everything, but there is one project there that\u2019s probably skewing the other two a little bit. Eric Frankel : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Kyle McGrady. Please go ahead. You\u2019re open. Kyle McGrady : Great. Great. Hey, Jim if you guys marked \u2013 if you guys have answered this let me know, because I missed the first part of the call. But we noticed that the service operation expectations are declining while G&A is rising, anymore color on what\u2019s actually going on there? Jim Connor : When you say... Kyle McGrady : Page 32. Jim Connor : I\u2019m sorry, John. Kyle McGrady : What you have... Jim Connor : 32 as a couple of\u2026 Kyle McGrady : Service operations essentially was... Jim Connor : So, let me try that John. I think tried nowhere you\u2019re going here. So, if you look \u2013 if you\u2019re talking about from 2015 to 2016 levels, not revised guidance, right, I assume that\u2019s what you mean. Kyle McGrady : Yeah. Jim Connor : Yeah. So, early service operations are declining because we\u2019re taking all of our development expertise and we\u2019re building more buildings for ourselves rather than building buildings for third-parties. It\u2019s not really directly correlated with G&A either, I\u2019ve seeing there\u2019s not some correlation. But it\u2019s really just a change in focus, we\u2019re now on pace to do $700 million give or take a development this year for our own account. We haven\u2019t staffed up to any measurable level on our people. So, what that means is we\u2019re just doing less lower margin third-party projects, because we can do projects for ourselves. So, that\u2019s why service officers going down, that\u2019s really just a focus from third-party work to wholly-owned. And in G&A is actually if you look at G&A, it\u2019s not as much, we were $51 million last year, a bit quite of our range this year is $53 million, that\u2019s really just the lovely cost of our government and being a public company. It\u2019s not really any inefficiencies or anything like that, it\u2019s just increased SECBs and things like that. Kyle McGrady : Okay. And then, Jim and I always talk about this, what\u2019s your long-term expectation for your land inventory, Jim. Are you going to get back up to $1 million dollars or what do you think is appropriate? Jim Connor : Sorry John, I choked a little bit there. No, we have worked really, really hard over the last four years, five years to get the inventory down to the level it is, it\u2019s actually under $350 million right now. We believe we can run this business through cycle with between $350 million and $400 million of land held for development and it\u2019s really we\u2019ve changed the culture on how we approach land. We are not buying it in 500 acre chunks and controlling it for 10 years, we\u2019re buying it in smaller pieces. We\u2019re focused on putting it in to production much more quickly. So I think, it\u2019s taken us a while to get there, but we are certainly in no hurry to get back, and I think you\u2019ll see us continue to stay in that $350 million to $400 million range. Kyle McGrady : Great. All right. See you soon. Thanks a lot. Jim Connor : Thanks. Operator : And next we have the line of Rich Anderson. Please go ahead, you\u2019re open. Rich Anderson : Thanks. Good afternoon. So, earlier in the call given the sort of problems emerging in the industrial space kind of made you chuckle a little bit and I get it, you guys are in great shape, no argument. But in previous past cycle, not so much in industrial, but other sectors, REITs did a really poor job of no one went to walk away from the Blackjack table. So \u2013 speaking specifically about development, your expanding development, what are you looking for, if everything is just track record driven and you\u2019re feeling great and you\u2019re adding to the pipeline, what are you looking for as a signal to get to be early before it\u2019s too late and you have some real problems. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s now, but what are the some of the tell-tale signal that you\u2019re looking for this time around. Jim Connor : Well, Rich, I think we can all reflect back on what the market look like in 2007 and 2008, and there were \u2013 there were comparable levels of supply coming on the market. It was much less preleased. So the entire market had much more spec risk out there. And I don\u2019t have the numbers right off the top of my head. But I would going for memory, I think we were 10% or 15% preleased as an industry last time. And now we\u2019re in the 35% or 40% range. So I think that\u2019s one of the factors that we look at. The fact that demand has continued to outpace supply, and I think the fundamental difference this time and we\u2019ve been talking about it on last several calls is e-commerce and the changes that has fundamentally may do our business. You could step back and look at all kinds of projections and forecasts out there for that side of the business. The most conservative ones I\u2019ve seen have it growing at 8% to 10% a year. The more aggressive ones are 15% to 18% a year. So I think that bodes very, very well for us. But on the outside, we\u2019re looking at the supply demand fundamentals, both from a macro perspective and a local perspective, and even when you get to a local perspective we\u2019re drilling down into specific submarkets. And then we\u2019re looking at our portfolio. We\u2019ve committed to you guys and our investors that we\u2019re going to keep our development pipeline, whatever size it is, at least 50% preleased. We\u2019re going to manage our risk much better this time. And some people have from time-to-time, but a little critical and said we might be leaving some opportunity at the table and if that\u2019s the case, so be it. And we continued to perform very well and keeping that prelease percentage up and today the pipelines at roughly 58% and I think in actuality, that maybe go up in the fourth quarter, given the build-to-suit volume compared to the timing on some spec projects, but that remains to be seen a little bit. So that\u2019s kind of how we\u2019re thinking about it and what the things that we\u2019re trying to manage. Rich Anderson : Okay. So 58% is not quite the floor, but kind of close to the floor, you wouldn\u2019t want to see the overall pipeline go much below that, before you would get some leasing done and then add to it, is that the right way to think about it? Jim Connor : Yeah. I mean I would say, we think the floor is 50% and in the last I think three years, we dipped below that one-time and I want to \u2013 I made a point of telling you guys a quarter in advance that it was going to happen and why. And in that particular case, it was simply just the timing from one quarter to the next of a number of spec projects and yeah, a lot of the markets that we deal in you can\u2019t build in 12 months a year, you can do that in Texas and you can do that in Florida, but in New Jersey and Pennsylvania and Chicago, you can only build about nine months a year or so. There is some of those instances. But yeah, the magic number for us is 50% that we\u2019re trying to stay above. Rich Anderson : Okay. And for Mark, if you could just answer a quick modeling question, maybe we could do this offline, if it\u2019s not right at your finger tips. But FFO from unconsolidated, to bounces around from quarter-to-quarter, but your \u2013 you are going to have a deal in the fourth quarter. Can you give me sort of sense of what the run rate should be \u2013 on a kind of a go forward basis and if that\u2019s not a question you can answer now, maybe offline. Mark Denien : Yeah, Rich, I could probably answer now, but I may not answer it correctly. So let\u2019s try to do that offline. Rich Anderson : Okay. No problem. Mark Denien : I probably think I know, but I\u2019d like to look at [indiscernible]. Rich Anderson : Okay. Sounds good. Thanks very much. Mark Denien : Yeah. Jim Connor : Yeah. Operator : Next we have in line from Ki Bin Kim. Please go ahead, you are open. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. So Mark, you actually I made a quick mention about how you guys have a little bit less lease expirations going forward and I\u2019ll say compared to your peers more noticeably less just because you have longer leases. So how do you maintain 4% to 5% same-store NOI growth when you have less to recoup, even though Mark, rent growths are higher. I know you\u2019ve about \u2013 probably about 2.5% cash rent step ups, but it just seems like it might be a little bit more difficult to get \u2013 to maintain a high same-store NOI run rate, just because you have less [indiscernible]. Mark Denien : Yeah, Ki Bin. I mean, like I had mentioned earlier, I think, we need to finish lowering our budget up for next year before we give guidance for next year on this number. I guess, my point there is I\u2019m not giving guidance, I\u2019m saying that I think it is difficult to imagine we can see this run rate next year. But somewhere, half of that give or take, I think we can get there, there is always efficiencies you can try to drive out your portfolio as well. We\u2019ve done a good job at doing that, so that\u2019s on top of the rent bumps, that\u2019s on top of the rent growth. So it\u2019s somewhere in that, call it close to 3% range give or take, I think, a pretty good baseline start out and then we\u2019ll just see when we roll everything up how much north or south of that it is. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. And now just quickly on G&A, you\u2019re going to exit the office portfolio completely by year end, it sounds like. But your G&A is just \u2013 actually been increasing over the past couple of years. So I\u2019m just curious if there is anything we can expect in the efficiencies on that line item? Mark Denien : No, not really Ki Bin, I\u2019m mean, we\u2019ve already really driven all the efficiencies out of G&A I think for the most part that we can. Most of the \u2013 any additional I should say cost savings that come out of the remaining dispositions we have are really sitting up in property NOI, it\u2019ll be property level efficiencies that we have, what I would call the relatively slight increases we\u2019ve had in G&A, the last couple of years are just kind of what I call cost of being a public company, they\u2019re just raising greater than inflation. I would point out that if you look at our G&A load relative to probably any of our peers, one of the metrics we look at is, G&A is a percentage of gross revenues or G&A is a percentage of gross assets. While I\u2019d acknowledge our G&A has increased a little bit over the last couple of years, I\u2019d still put us best in class. Ki Bin Kim : And just a last quick one. Are you \u2013 our cash lease price generally as a rule of thumb about half of the GAAP lease spreads, how do I think about that? Mark Denien : No. We don\u2019t really calculate that Ki Bin. I would tell you it\u2019s probably less than half. Because the GAAP lease spreads, the lease term matters, so if you got a five-year lease, you may have to divide that number by five even. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Mark Denien : So, it\u2019s probably, if you\u2019re at 20%, it\u2019s probably closer to the mid single-digits give or take. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Thank you, guys. Mark Denien : Yeah. Operator : Yeah. We have a follow-up question from the line of Eric Frankel. You\u2019re open. Please go ahead. Eric Frankel : Thank you. Just a follow-up question regarding future asset sales and asset recycling. So obviously you\u2019ve had this non-core pool of assets [indiscernible] with sell down and use at the fund development. If \u2013 for whatever reason your share price isn\u2019t quite as attractive in a year or two year, as it is maybe today, do you have a self-funding formula for funding development or cap allocation opportunities in the future? Jim Connor : Well, Eric, that\u2019s just the last we talking about our stock price like that. No, I\u2019m just kidding. Yeah, I think we can always recycle assets. I think, as I alluded to earlier, we\u2019d like where the portfolio is. We\u2019ve done obviously all of the heavy lifting as it relates to the office portfolio, but we\u2019ve also harvested some gains, we\u2019ve sold a couple of Amazon buildings, we\u2019ve liquidated a couple of joint ventures. We\u2019ve proven some industrial assets here and there. So, if we need to, we can certainly look at that as an opportunity to raise capital. Sitting here today, Mark will tell you we\u2019ve got the vast majority of our development and borrowings for the next year, pretty well covered. So, even if we don\u2019t like where the price is from an equity perspective, I think we\u2019re pretty well covered next year. Eric Frankel : All right. That\u2019s it. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And speakers no one else has queued up. Please continue. Jim Connor : Thanks, Hart. I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining the call today. We look forward to reconvening during our fourth quarter call, tenderly scheduled for January 26, 2017 and hope to see you many of you at May REIT next month. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does concludes your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and thank you for using AT&T executive teleconference service.

My name is Scott, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Prologis' Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Tracy Ward, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Tracy Ward : Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our Fourth Quarter 2016 Conference Call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. This morning, we'll hear from Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover results and guidance and Hamid Moghadam, our Chairman and CEO, who will comment on the company's strategy and outlook. Also joining us for today's call are Gary Anderson, Mike Curless, Ed Nekritz, Gene Reilly, and Diana Scott. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to state that this call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, and projections about the market, and the industry in which Prologis operates as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings. Additionally, our fourth quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures and in accordance to the Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom, and we'll get started. Thomas Olinger : Thanks, Tracy. Good morning and thanks for joining our fourth quarter earnings call. Our format today will be different than previous calls. I will cover highlight for the quarter and guidance for 2017 and then I'll turn the call over to Hamid who will put this quarter's performance in the context of the recent past and our future outlook. We had an excellent quarter in an outstanding 2016. Core FFO was $0.63 per share for the quarter and $2.57 per share for the year. This is an increase of 15% over 2015 and consistent with our three-year CAGR of 16%. We earned promotes of $0.01 and $0.15 per share for the year. Excluding promotes Core FFO was up 11%. For the full year we leased over 180 million square feet as demand for our best-in-class portfolio remains strong. Our properties are located in major population centers where consumption is concentrated and proximity to consumers has never been more critical to supply chain. Global occupancy reached an all-time high of 97.1% Europe also achieved record occupancy at 96.7%. Our share net effective rent change on rollover was 16%. The U.S. led the way it over 23% the fourth consecutive quarter above the 20%. Notably the U.K. was also above 20% rent change for the second consecutive quarter. Our share net effective same store NOI growth was 3.2% for the quarter and 5.6% for the full year. On the deployment front we had another very productive year creating significant value for shareholders. Development stabilization had an estimated margin of 27% and value creation of over $570 million. Development starts had an estimated margin of over 20% and our net deployment activity generated surplus cash of $1.4 billion. Let's spend a moment on our financial position. We achieved our goal of having one of the top balance sheets in the REIT sector. The rating upgrades of A3 and A- in the quarter are acknowledgment of our prudent financial management and balance sheet strength. Our look through leverage at year-end was 27.1% on market capitalization and 34.6% on a book basis. Debt to EBITDA including gains was 4.7 times and our liquidity was over $4 billion. We remain well positioned to self fund our future employment. We also continue to be well protected from foreign currency movements as we ended the year with 92% of our net equity in U.S. dollars. The bottom line is our balance sheet and liquidity have never been stronger. Moving to 2017 I\u2019ll cover a few guidance highlights on our share basis so for complete detail refer to Page 5 of our supplemental. We continue to expect net effective same store NOI growth of between 4% and 5%. As discussed at our Investor Day are in-place leases are about 12% under rented and this will be the primary driver of same-store growth going forward. Our share cash same-store NOI should be higher than net affected by 5200 basis points for the year. Our development starts are consistent with 2016 levels. However our disposition volume is as much lower as we sold the vast majority of our nonstrategic assets. Going forward you will see a contribution and disposition activity in line with development levels, as we continue to self fund. I want to point out that as a result of the significant amount of cash at year-end, there will be a slight drag on Core FFO of $0.02 to $0.03 per share on the first quarter given the timing of putting the capital back to work. Related to FX, our 2017 estimated core FFO was effectively fully hedged relative to the U.S. dollar and we've already hedged most of 2018. For net G&A we're forecasting a range of $210 million to $220 million down 3% at the midpoint from last year as we continue to become more efficient. For strategic capital I want to highlight that there will be a timing mismatch throughout the year between one that promote revenue is recognized in the second quarter and when all the related promote expenses are reflected. However we continue to expect net promote income for the full year 2017 of between $0.06 and $0.08 a share. Putting this all together 2017 Core FFO including promotes will range between $2.60 and $2.70 per share. Excluding promotes our Core FFO at the midpoint is 7% higher year-over-year. In closing we had an excellent year we entered 2017 with terrific momentum and the business keeps getting simpler as evidenced by the brevity of my remarks as you've heard guidance is unchanged from what we provided at our November Investor Day. However I would say the overall outlook for a business today is more positive particularly in Europe. While we are mindful of potential political and regulatory changes we remain confident given our best-in-class portfolio, balance sheet strength and liquidity and durable NOI growth. And with that I'll turn it over Hamid. Hamid Moghadam : Thanks Tom. I want to use my time with you today to put our recent performance and to the longer-term context and to share my outlook for the next few years. It's hard to imagine that it's been almost six years since we announced the merger between Prologis and AMB. Our initial focus following the merger's closing was to integrate the two companies and to deliver on our promise synergies. Shortly thereafter we announced the quarter plan focused on realigning our portfolio, monetizing our land bank, rationalizing our strategic capital business, strengthening our balance sheet, and investing in technology to make our teams more productive. We met or exceeded the planned objectives almost a year ahead of schedule. Following the 10-quarter plan we transition division 2016. Our strategic plan to capitalize on what we saw is a significant recovery in rental rates following the sharp decline we saw during the global financial crisis. Our forecast call for a compounded 6% per year recovery in rents and the Americas to 2016 which at the time seemed that's an overly optimistic assumption by some. The fourth quarter represented the culmination of Vision 2016. Actual rental growth in our markets in the Americas ended up ahead of our forecast at 8% per year. This help drive core FFO growth of 16% per year substantially in excess of the plan the sector most REITs. 2017 is a very different environment than six years ago when we announced our merger or four years ago when we called for sharp rebound in rents. I believe we're now at the cusp of yet another important market transition to a phase for which Prologis is ideally positioned. As you heard from Tom earlier and as you'll hear from our industry colleagues, markets are as healthy as they been in several decades. Occupancies are at record levels, rental growth is extremely strong and the strength is not just e-commerce. In fact there are sectors like housing that will be the source for additional demand going forward. In the recent recovery phase of the U.S. market, rising tides have lifted our boats. In the next phase, location and quality will matter much more and I'll be a meaningful performance depreciation within the U.S. logistic markets. Continental Europe is lagging the U.S. by about three years. We believe Europe will further extend the growth cycle for our company as its recovery picks up steam. What's been a headwind for us I will become a tailwind for the foreseeable future. There is a significant embedded rental upside in most industrial portfolios and in our case about 12% of our overall and 15% in the Americas but we need to acknowledge that the easy part of the cycle is behind us. Market rental growth going forward will moderate starting in 2017. However our same-store NOI growth will remain strong into the foreseeable future probably well beyond 2019 especially in large markets with high barriers to entry. What we like about this picture is that supply remains discipline and as a result growth will be more sustainable than in past cycles. In this environment it will be more important than ever to be closer to key customers and to offer them the right wheels stay solutions in key markets around the world. Before I turn it over to Q&A, I'd like to share with you our priorities for the next few years including a number of important new initiatives that we've been working on as part of our new strategic plan. In addition to completing the final batch of our nonstrategic sales which remains a priority, the new initiatives are focused around customer experience, application of technology to streamline operations, and advanced data analytics. These activities are designed to further simplify our business, get us closer to our customers and help make us faster, smarter and better. We're seeing tangible results from these initiatives already especially on the customer side and will share these with you in the coming months and years. Let's now turn to your questions. Operator? Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Tom Catherwood from BTIG. Your line is open. Tom Catherwood : Thanks. Good morning over there. Obviously we've seen a lot of statements that have come out of the new Administration. You guys spoke at length about it and the potential impact at the Investor Day. But since the Investor Day how has the outlook changed for your business and how are you planning on potential trade impacts in your strategy going forward? Hamid Moghadam : Yes, let me start with that and maybe I'll turn it over to Chris Caton, our Global Head of Research after this for his comments because he's been setting this pretty closely. So I would say there is a great deal of uncertainty out there given all the talk about trade with China and Mexico specifically. So I think until there is some resolution on this, they will continue to be uncertainty but we haven't seen that translating into any negative impact on our business so far. In fact I would say most of the Euphoria around the election has to do with a brighter economic outlook in the U.S. and a brighter outlook on the part of our customers on the margin. Now let's take some extreme cases of what could happen. In the extreme case and I don't think by the way this is the base case, we pull a wall not just in our southern border but all around this country and will stop trading with the rest of the world. While I think the long term impact of that actually would be negative not just for our business but every business because the rate of economic growth would slow but specific to the industrial business for sure manufacturing will have to take place somewhere which means it will have to take place in the U.S. So demand will go up in the U.S. for sure. Now they're going to be places in the world where demand will suffer and I think Northern Mexico along the border and China would be the two places where demand would suffer. Those two markets account for 2% of our overall activity. The U.S. accounts for 73% of our activity. So while I acknowledge that there will be a headwind on overall economic growth, actually its impact on us could be very positive in the short term but that's not what I want, that\u2019s not what I expect and that's how I'm looking for. I think the more likely outcome is going to be a cleaning up some of the provisions of NAFTA there are some issues that need to be modernized, I think it makes sense to do that and I frankly think that this stage has been set from a negotiating point of view or that can be done pretty quickly and pretty easily compared to expectations. China is a little bit of a different story. I think in China I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re heading for something a little more serious but only time will tell how that's going play out. Chris what you want to add? Chris Caton : I think that's a pretty complete answer. Hamid Moghadam : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust. Your line is open. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. Hamid, can you just comment on what you see in supply trends going forward? I know it hasn't been a huge issue in the past couple years, but at least according to some brokers it seems to be increasing and across more markets. Hamid Moghadam : Our outlook for supplying this year was that supply and demand this year meaning this past year 2016 was that they were going to be at the same level in the low 200 million square-foot range in the U.S. and about 70 million feet in Europe. And actually we were surprised because demand ended up being more like 260 million feet and supply ended up being 180 million feet. So we continue to deficit in supply that has persisted since the recovery. So again this year in 2017 we're calling for low $200 million square feet of supply and demand. We're expecting those two to be about the same which is by the way great because at 56% overall vacancy and at defective vacancy in the kind of product that we traffic in being in the 34% range in most markets, I think that\u2019s in very, very healthy situation. So we're calling for supply and demand to equalize, let\u2019s say we're off let's say supply ends up being 20 million, 30 million feet more across the base that won't even register on the vacancy rate. So I think people are just overly focused on that issue. Fundamentally I think financial the banking system for encouraging undisciplined development has changed. Now something changes in the political and regulatory environment where the banks will go nuts again that's the new ballgame but I don't see that just yet and I don't think those regulations are just U.S. regulations, I think they are Basel III and the like that impose some discipline in the banking system. So it's good to keep an eye on supply I think it's been they clearly feel of the real estate business for as long as I remember. So please continue to ask about it, continue to be concerned about it but I don't think it's going to drive the performance of our business in the next couple of years. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brad Burke with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Brad Burke : Hi, everyone. I wanted to go back to market fundamentals for the quarter. Leasing volume is down a little, tenant retention is below 80%, it looks like leasing costs ticked up as a result. Realizing that market fundamentals remain very healthy, is there any reason to think that demand decelerated in the fourth quarter versus what we saw earlier in 2016? Hamid Moghadam : Demand did not decelerate, we ran at its space to lease. And the reason retention is down as I have told you every quarter we're trying to drive around. So we would like our retention to be a little bit lower and for our rent growth on the margin benefit from that incremental rent growth. So nothing in the quarter surprise me Tom, do you have anything else. Thomas Olinger : No its consistent again as Hamid said we had little role this quarter it's pretty seasonal that we go into Q4 with pretty minimal role and that was the big driver but we certainly don't see any change in the customer behavior, customer activity, customer decision-making all of that quite frankly is tracking better than what we but we would laid out to you guys in November. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Craig Mailman : Thanks, guys. I was hoping to just get a little bit of color on the second sequential decline same-store revenues you guys had. I think last quarter there were some CAM trueups that drove the sequential decline. But we expect that to maybe be more one-time, but we saw a decline again this quarter. Just curious what drove the deceleration this quarter and maybe how it looks on a cash basis to see if we're seeing the same trend. Thomas Olinger : Hi Craig this is Tom, so you\u2019re right - in this quarter the sequential decline was driven number one just lower occupancy in the same store pool if you look to Q3 to Q4 so there's about a 50 basis points lower benefit of occupancy and the second thing would be as you alluded to recovery revenue timing. So there all one-time timing issues that we look into 2017 we see occupancy the levels very consistent year-over-year so the big driver same-store is all about rent change and to put those numbers in context of our guidance of that 4% to 5% range we feel very, very good about that guidance range and if you think about very similar rent change on roll year-over-year about 17.5% and you put that on 22.5% roll you what to contractual role plus is some pulling leases forward very consistent with what we\u2019ve done in the prior-year that gets you right about 4% and when you look at expense leverage and you look at indexation remember we get the benefit of indexation particularly in places like Europe. That all adds up to another 50 basis points. So that puts you right in the middle of our guidance range for 2017. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Vincent Chao : Hi, everyone. I just wanted to talk about the lease rate being at 97% and record occupancy in the U.S. and Europe, and then also your comments about the retention going down, driving rents a little bit harder. I'm just curious if the current availability changes your view on development starts, the mix of build to suit versus spec. And, geographically, it sounds like a lot of the commentary on Europe was very positive versus your previous outlook. Are you more inclined to build in Europe today than a few months ago? Hamid Moghadam : Vincent, Europe is more of a build-to-suit market than the spec market anyway, so, yes, a lot of the development in Europe is going to be build-to-suit. And maybe Mike you want to talk about the flavor of our development activity and it's very much consistent with last year as the way I think about it but Mike\u2026 Mike Curless : Look, last year we did 45% in Americas, 25% in Europe and 13% Asia that was a little bit up in the Americas, slightly down in Europe and slightly up in Asia. I expect in this year's ratio to be about the same and a couple of other things to note 90% of the activities are going to take place in our global markets. And I would point I think yesterday I take the build-to-suit range in the 40% to 50% range, which is comparable to we did last year and I think we feel very bullish on our ability to do this build-to-suits, but that's a good range as we sit here today. Thomas Olinger : Yes, the only thing I would add to all of that is that when we look at our development volume for 2017 at this time of the year, you guys should know about 90% of that is baked in. So really at the end of the day what our development volume does on the margin in the back $100 million, $200 million of it if weather stuff flips into December or January of next year and we don\u2019t do on natural things to meet guidance in that regard, let just be clear about that. For example couple I think three of our 2016 built-to-suit we\u2019ve just done in the first couple of weeks of 2017. And if we have done them in 2016 we were blown through the top of our guidance range. So we don\u2019t really play those kinds of timing games and we let those things happen when they do. I mean we're going to spend the bunch of money dig into through the snow to start a building to call it a start if it doesn\u2019t make sense to do that. Hamid Moghadam : We've got a great head start on our business already for this quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sumit Sharma with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sumit Sharma : Hi. Good morning. Couple of questions on the international markets, saw the yields on the Americas, Canada, Mexico, Brazil development sort of side down about 40 bips q-o-q based on your last disclosure? I guess how much of this is a factor of higher pre-leased activity or the use actually kind of shrinking with other trade shock. And the second question are on the Cyrela stake. We're reading a lot of reports from brokers as well as actually you guys talking about net absorption dropping 60% year-over-year in Brazil in the logistic sector, so interested in what we should read into this move around acquiring the additional stake, are you calling for a bottom to that market? Eugene Reilly : Sumit, this is Eugene. So relative to the first question it's really - this is all mix and it's a lot less Brazil. I mean at this point in a cycle we are not building buildings in Brazil, obviously those yields are much higher. So don't get distracted with that. With respect to what's going on with Brazil in the CCP situation. So demand right now in Brazil is pretty soft and we expected to that in 2017 is going to remain that way based upon the economic and political environment. Having said that we're very, very optimistic long-term, we're calling a bottom I wouldn't say we're calling a bottom, but we see things getting better from this point forward. And related to the CCP announcement Brazilian law requires that public companies disclose even agreements that are not binding. When there is a definitive agreement will have for all you guys the relevant information. But that's the first step towards recapitalizing the business in Brazil. We're very excited about that and as I said we're very excited about the future that market going forward. Hamid Moghadam : I would add to Gene's comments that I think the combination of the currency which is well up to bottom the governance change that happened in Brazil. And the interest rate picture which is one of the few place in the world where interest rates are coming down. I think things will bode well for Brazil and I am bullish on Brazil going forward, it's not going to zoom and sort of add from here, but I think this is a pretty interesting entry point from both fundamental real estate valuation, and also currency valuation point of view. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi. Your line is open. Manny Korchman : Hi, guys. Good morning. I was just wondering - Hamid if you can talk a little bit about just leasing momentum and pace and whether the volatility post election on any of these trade policies have caused either pause or revisit their leasing strategy? Hamid Moghadam : Honest to goodness, we asked that question on a weekly basis of our people and the answer is no, no, no. I'll tell you what I hear it's not like we are being Pollyannish or sticking our head in the sand, it would be a pretty obvious concern and you guys are right to ask about it. But we haven't seen it in fact if we're doing our Analyst Day again today we would be slightly more positive, in the U.S. and a lot more positive in Europe. So the answer is no, we haven\u2019t seen it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Josh Dennerlein : Hi, guys, it's Josh Dennerlein here with Jamie. Could you speak about investor appetite for your funds? Any change post election? And also curious to know the rationale, as well as what sparked L&D's consolidation of its JV fund with PELP? Hamid Moghadam : Well, I think you are - on the last thing you're referring to PELP and ELV Alliance combining together. Look we have been on a strategy we're trying to simplify the number of different vehicles we have everywhere including Europe. And our goal is to get in each major arena in the U.S. and Europe to one major JVM, one major open-end fund and that's a goal. We made a good first step too in that direction here in Europe by combining PELP and Alliance. So that - and those two strategies were identical. Those two funds have the exact same strategy and it was a good thing for us as simplified our business. It was a good thing for Alliance because it allowed them to deploy more capital with us and to have a bigger vehicle and more diversified pull. So that one is done and with respect the demand for our funds, I would say in the U.S. we have a lot of demand from outside the U.S. for U.S. vehicles, including some new sources of capital that we have never seen before including some funds coming out of Japan through the pension system that is going through some changes in regulation and the like. It's early days for that but that's a new source of capital we've seen before. I think the U.S. funds are slowing down a little bit based on what I'm seeing on the margin because they are meeting their allocations by and large, but their allocations are always lagging because the denominator it keeps getting bigger, and so the allocations for next quarter are going to go upside. I don't expect that to be a meaningful slow down I think it's only at the margin. So the simple answer of your question would be no. There is a lot of interest for logistics product, high quality logistics product everywhere around the world. In fact we are kind of surprised by the amount of interest and there is low quality of logistics around the world. So, no we don\u2019t see anything. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz with UBS. Your line is open. Jeremy Metz : Thanks. Hi, guys. Earlier, you'd brought up your expectations for demand and supply to reach parity in 2017, also for rent growth to moderate a bit this year. But can you talk about the ability for market rents to continue to push higher once supply starts outpacing demand? Maybe you can give us your thoughts on this dynamic and what you're seeing in the market to support a runway for market rents beyond 2017. Thanks. Hamid Moghadam : Well, I think as I mentioned in my comments the last four, five years of projected rental growth have been pretty easy, we fell into a deep hole and just climbing out of that hole with replacement costs going up was what we thought 6% rental growth in the U.S. and then dumping 8% per year growth. Going forward I think rental growth is going to slow down because we're calling essentially for a market that\u2019s plus or minus at the equilibrium in the U.S. and given the quality of the portfolio in our locations and the like, I think it's can be inflation plus type of rental growth. I think we've spoken to you guys about a 15% mark-to-market in the U.S. plus 3% growth beyond that in terms of market rent, I think will do better than that but we just had 3% for modeling purposes but I think we will in the near term do better than that, how much better than that I guess we're going to have to see. Europe is interesting, this is an important point I'm trying to communicate so please - this one is what we\u2019re focusing on. There is going to be a time and we think that time is 2018, we\u2019ll know for sure when we get there. While rental growth in Europe can exceed rental growth in the U.S. and that will drive same-store growth for Prologis beyond just our U.S. portfolio and I think that's a unique benefit that we have as a company. I mean we definitely separate the back part of the cycle by virtue of having a European drag on our performance, I think Europe can turn into a positive boost on performance from 2018 onwards. So that would be my commentary on rents. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel with Green Street Advisors. Your line is open. Eric Frankel : Thank you. I know this might be a bit of a dead issue, but do you anticipate any reincarnation of TPP in any form that would hurt you or help your business in Asia and the U.S.? Hamid Moghadam : Eric we don't have any particular insights on that beyond what you and we read in the paper. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick with Capital One Securities. Your line is open. Ryan Wineman : Hi, this is Ryan Wineman here with Tom. How would you guys expect a border adjustment tax to impact demand for industrial real estate in both the U.S. and abroad? Chris Caton : Hi, thanks for the question this is Chris Caton. Hamid gave an excellent outline on the global trends and in particular these efforts focused on stimulating job growth, wage growth in general and U.S. consumer I would be big positive for business. From a - how might things change perspective, I think they're kind to two key point that I would add to Hamid's earlier remarks. The first is the majority of the U.S. markets are really focused on local consumptions and these are not initial shipment points. And then we think about some of these markets that do you have a component that are kind of initial point of contact for international trade, look growth has been excellent in these markets even as a trade growth over the last few years has been moderate. So supply chain modernization continues in this market, some irrespective of the trade - the trade picture. Hamid Moghadam : And that would be LA, Dallas, Chicago and New Jersey. Those would be the four major markets that have a transshipment component to them. So if you\u2019re going to focus on those, those are the markets to pay attention to. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel. Your line is open. John Guinee : I noticed that on Page 26 your land position got down below $1.3 billion, which is probably one-third of what it was at the height. Can you talk about what you're thinking about land right now? And, also, I did notice that I think 50% of your land is in the U.K., Mexico, Central Valley of California and a couple other unusual places. Hamid Moghadam : So John, thank you for acknowledging that. I mean, just the brief history of land bank at Prologis. At the time of the merger the land bank was in the low 2s and the original cost of that land bank I think was in the mid-to high 3s. So we certainly started with a lot of land and it's not as if we haven't been buying land, we've been buying land good land during this period but we've been selling and monetizing more of it overtime. So our share of land is about $1.250 billion and our total land is about $1.4 billion or something like that on that order. Our goal is to get to two years of land that we own and given our pace of development and land as a percentage of total development cost, that argues for about $800 million our share and a $1 billion overall land bank across the board. It will take some time to get there because to be perfectly honest with you there is couple $100 million of land that is the lowest quality land we have, that's the least strategic land I would say 200 of that, that will take a long time for us to sell. So we got to kind of carry that, so think of our goal of 800 million of our share and a 1 billion overall as really being 1 billion and 1.2 billion for a while until we can work our way through that land. But it's a good market for selling land, it\u2019s a good market for monetizing land, and we are getting much more efficient in terms of how middle land we need to support our $2.5ish billion development activity which is good. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rob Simone with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Rob Simone : Hi, guys, thanks a lot for taking the question. I was wondering - and this piggybacks on an earlier question - we know that Mexico is obviously a small part of the business today, but has there been any change in your thinking around your land positions there just vis-a-vis a longer-term outlook for the business? And, if not, what would it take to change your view? Eugene Reilly : Rob this is Gene, let me take that one. So in terms of what's going on with Mexico let me start with what we see happening on the ground. So demand is still very strong in the population centers, I would say customers on the border are little bit hesitant right now for obvious reasons but turning to your question on land, Hamid just addressed this question, overall we feel very good about the progress we've made. We probably have too much land in places like Houston and Mexico absolutely stands out as one of those markets. We have some land in Mexico which is in the bucket and need references to take some time to grind through but we also have some very well-positioned land in population centers and I think what we're actually going to monetize through development a fair amount of that over the next couple years. So I don't think the composition of that land bank is the magnitude of it is too large but the composition of the land bank is in the places that we'd like it to be so I don't think we\u2019re going to change strategy there. Hamid Moghadam : The value of the land bank is Mexico City in Monterey, the acreage maybe in the border cities but the value of the land is in Mexico City in Monterey. And I would tell you there's a shortage of quality land in Mexico City, absorption and development has exceeded our expectations and actually rental growth in peso has been tremendous even throughout all this talk about that bad things happening to Mexico, the issue is that the currency has been week. So I would guard distinction between in land markets, consumer markets and the border markets. The border market yes, the acreage is high but the value of that land is not that much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael Mueller : Yes, hi. I was wondering, are you expecting any cap rate movements in 2017? And have you made any changes to underwriting for acquisitions in particular? Hamid Moghadam : Michael we haven't been active acquires in quite some time. Our volume of acquisitions in 2016 was one of the lowest it's been. So I - we've been saying that cap rates are too low for a long time and we keep getting surprised that they go - keep going lower. One thing I will tell you about cap rates, I don't think they are at sensitive at least in the private market to interest rate movement as the public markets thinks they are. So you know the trade there's some talk of interest rates going up in REIT selloff and six months later they come roaring back. The private market is a lot less volatile with respect to those cap rates and our portfolios have been consistently selling in the marketplace add values that are in excess of our internal NAVs. In fact non-strategic asset sales which is mostly what we've been doing, there's been about a 5% surprise across the board for us compared to our internal carrying values. And this is the lowest quality portion of our portfolio. So we've been wrong and we've been surprised on cap rates being low and lower than what we think. What will happen in the future I think it's a function of how much interest rates do actually increase. Remember cap rates were about the same place that they have been, but interest rates are 250 to 300 basis points lower today than they were back in 2007. So there's nothing that says cap rates have to go up if 10 year treasury is get to 4% or something like that. So I don't know but so far we've had a declining cap rates in recent past as oppose to an increasing cap rate. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Neil Malkin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Neil Malkin : Thanks, guys. Your European exposure the percent of your NOI got 17% and I just wondering if you could talk about what you see happening as far as scenario go you kind of did this earlier in the call with U.S. but there's a lot of very big important election coming up in Germany, France, the Netherlands et cetera. And maybe we know the rise in this sort of Eurosceptic protectionist regime across those countries have gained the popularity in earnest. And I just wondering if you guys have thought all about what would happen if those party got into power and if so, what would have into either the euro currency the impact on your businesses or your tenants, commerce and general over there, any thought would be helpful. Hamid Moghadam : The good thing about our business Neil is that nobody releases warehouse space because they like to do something fancy. They lease warehouse space because necessities of life go through warehouses. And I' don\u2019t see people eating less food, less apparel or less toilet paper because of the politics of the country. I think the best recent example of that was Brexit, I mean there was all this brouhaha, but Brexit just killing demand in the U.K. and we're 99 point something leased in the U.K. and we had probably the best six month run in the U.K. that I can ever remember. So some of these things kind of don't follow conventional wisdom of the sky falling that, I don\u2019t have any particular views on currency, but we run our business in a currency agnostic way, that's why we're 92% in U.S. dollars and that's why we hedged a year or two of earnings ahead of time because we don't - we're not in that business, we're not better than anybody else in predicting currency. But we run our business in a manner where we're in effect hedged against those kind of risks. So, I think as long as consumption continues in Europe and it is the world's largest market is 375 million people may be chopped up into smaller pieces, but those people are still there consuming regardless of what their politics are. I feel pretty good about Europe. Thomas Olinger : Neil, let me just share sort of our base case, I mean we've basically got an up arrow on Europe today and if you just look at what's happening on the ground, this quarter Europe again up 60 basis points. And the big gains actually came in our weaker I would say regions, Southern Europe which is trending up to 95.5% occupied and Central and Eastern Europe which trended up to 96.5% occupied. The other place where we made gains is another place that we are struggling less than hundred thousand square foot basis. Again we went up by 240 basis points up to 93% occupied today. We've had four quarters of positive rental change. And as Hamid mentioned earlier we're expecting a cap rates moderate, so our view is that rents are going to continue to increase. So that sort of our forward forecast our expectation for the next several years, our expectation is that you are going to see a tail end. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Rodgers with Baird. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : This is Dick here with Dave. A lot of my questions have been asked already. But, real quickly, with regards to your 2017 occupancy guidance, this is about 100 basis points lower than where you ended the year. Is this conservative or are you seeing something specifically, given where 2016 ended? Hamid Moghadam : No, nothing particularly, I think there is some level of conservatism in that number, I would expect as to probably be a little higher, but I think what's more important what drives NOI as you all know is average occupancy and average occupancy is what we expect to be very similar year-over-year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Blaine Heck : Thanks. I just wanted to get back to land for a second. Can you guys talk about land prices in general? It seems like we've seen a major increase in most of the primary markets thus far this cycle. So, do you think further increases in land pricing are possible? And how have the increased prices influenced your ability to, number one, purchase land in your targeted markets and sub markets, and, number two, continue to achieve the expectable yields on those developments? Mike Curless : Blaine this is Mike Curless. If you think about our land portfolio we've mentioned this a couple of times here recently, but we view our portfolio to be up at least 17% undervalued and we're certainly seeing land prices uptick particularly in the larger global markets, but we're also seeing rents higher in those markets which justify higher land prices. So we're selected as ever. Our primary acquisitions our expenses of our existing parks and those sites that we think we can turn through in two to three years. So we're being very selective on what we buy and there's a market out there for us to be successful in this environment. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel with Green Street Advisors. Your line is open. Eric Frankel : Thank you for the follow-up. I can understand with the quirky land question I was confused for John Guinee there. I was wondering if you could comment a little bit about, I think we're seeing a little bit more in the press about 3D printing and automation starting to make its way into supply chains -- in very small amounts at this point but I was hoping you could maybe touch upon and give some examples of your customers upon this technology or what you might see going forward. Thank you. Hamid Moghadam : I think 3D is an important technology and I think it will be really consistent with the automation and localized manufacturing. I think what people missed is that they think somehow 3D printing skips the supply chain, but the material that goes into 3D printing is got to come from somewhere and it needs its own supply chain. So I don't really think it really affects demand for industrial real estate in a major way. In fact because the supply chain will be less bulk for 3D printing, because 3D building is -- printing as oppose to mass production is about mass customization and more localized production. I think it requires a more complex supply chain. So but I think it would be very difficult for 3D printing for most products to compete with the price of mass production particularly within the introduction of automation. So I think it's a great technology for innovation, for prototyping, but it's not really great technology for mass production. So that's our view of it. By the way it's not new 3D printing has been around for a long time. I remember actually in 1986 being at an MIT campus visit where they were actually printing models of cars that the kind that they used to make with clay models using layers of 3D printing laying down, I think the auto technologies is a lot for component and body manufacturing. So it's been around for long, long time. It's getting better all the time though. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is open. Ki Bin Kim : Hi. Just a quick question. Any particular reasons why the investment capacity went down from $3.1 billion/$3.2 billion to $2.6 billion this quarter? Thomas Olinger : That's been capacity - we have stopped trying to raising funds as long as we have uninvested funds and queues and as we work down those funds we'll go raise somewhere on a capital. It's not a real issue, I mean we will raise capital when we need to invest capital, when there is deployment opportunities. Hamid Moghadam : Also there is a timing lag just between the redemption that we've done and just normal capital raising that that part of the cyclical nature of that. Thomas Olinger : We actually reduced our share in our funds and allowed some of the accused invest in our funds as a way of satisfying those kits. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Jordan Sadler : It's Jordan Sadler. I just wanted to get a little clarity here on the view on Europe, if you could. First, what's driving the confidence here on Europe? And how can you tilt the portfolio to be a little bit better positioned to capitalize on the opportunity you see coming? Hamid Moghadam : So I think our European portfolio is really well-positioned, I mean we've spent a lot of time in an effort on cleaning up our European portfolio in last couple of years and I think it's really well-positioned and it's a solid. It's by far the best portfolio in Europe. So I think where extremely well-positioned to benefit from that. I think the lagging part of Europe if you\u2019re going to pick on one place it's France and I think we're about to see some major political changes in France. So I think that will help our French portfolio, particularly Paris portfolio which has been lagging. That was the last question. So I really appreciate everyone's interest in the company and look forward to seeing you next quarter not sooner. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

My name is Kim, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Tracy Ward, you may begin your conference. Tracy Ward : Thanks Kim, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2017 conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. This morning, we'll hear from Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover results and guidance and Hamid Moghadam, our Chairman and CEO, who will comment on the company's strategy and outlook. Also, joining us for today's call are Gary Anderson, Mike Curless, Ed Nekritz, Gene Reilly, and Diana Scott. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings. Additionally, our first quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures and in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom, and we'll get started. Tom Olinger : Thanks, Tracy. Good morning and thanks for joining our first quarter earnings call. I'll cover the highlight for the quarter, provide updated 2017 guidance and then I'll turn the call over to Hamid. We had a strong start to the year with core FFO of $0.63 per share, which exceeded our expectations by little over $0.02. The outperformance from all areas of our business with $0.01 from operations, a little less than $0.01 from deployment and the remainder from strategic capital. Asset quality and location have never been more important as supply chains extend closer to major population centers. Our portfolio is well-positioned to take advantage of this secular shift toward the end consumer. We leased over 39 million square feet during the quarter, down from last year as we were effectively running out of space to lease. Global occupancy at the end of the quarter was 96.6%, an increase of 50 basis points year-over-year. Notably, occupancy in Europe increased 180 basis points over the same period to 96.7%. Our share net effective rent change on rollover was a very healthy at 19.6%. U.S. was 29.2% an all-time high in the fifth straight quarter above 20%. Our share net effective same-store NOI growth was 5.8% for the quarter, driven by higher releasing spreads and a pick up in average occupancy. U.S. led the way with same-store NOI growth of 7.1%. Our same-store pool does include development completion that are available for lease. Excluding these development assets, our same-store would have been 5.1% on a global basis for the quarter. Moving to capital deployment, we had an active first quarter. Margins on stabilizations and starts remain very good and build-to-suits were 77% of our first quarter starts. Dispositions and contributions are on track. Fire activity remained strong and market cap rates depressing slightly. As a result, we're accelerating disposition timing. We completed several transactions in our co-investment ventures during the first quarter, further streamlining our business. We sold our investment in European logistics venture generating $84 million in proceeds. Simultaneously we combine those $600 million venture into our targeted European logistics bond resulting in a vehicle with $3.2 billion in assets. In the U.K., we formed a new $1.3 billion development to hold venture, generating $213 million in proceeds. In the U.S., we acquired our partner's remaining equity interest in our North American Industrial Fund or NAIF for $710 million and currently own a 100% of this $3 billion vehicle. Finally, we acquired an additional 25% interest in our Brazilian platform for $80 million and currently own 50%. We expect to recapitalize our ownership in NAIF over time, providing us with about $1.8 billion of future incremental liquidity. All of this activity is consistent with our plan to rationalize our funds into fewer differentiated vehicles. We now have 10 funds down from 20 in 2012. During this same period, we significantly increased our third party AUM and corresponding revenues and now over 90% of our fees from -- 90% of our fees from these vehicles are perpetual life. Turning to capital markets, during the quarter we completed two-yen financing, underscoring our ability to access the global capital markets at very attractive levels. This included recasting our \u00a550 billion revolver at a 40-basis point spread over yen LIBOR and we completed a \u00a512 billion unsecured loan at a fixed rate of 95 basis points and a term of over 10 years. Our leverage increased to 36.7% on a book basis at quarter end as a result of deployment timing. However, we expect to work this back down below 35% by year-end. We ended the quarter with $3.8 billion in liquidity and remain well positioned to self-fund our future deployment. Moving to guidance for 2017, I'll cover the significant updates on our share basis. So, for complete detail, refer to Page 5 of our supplemental. We're increasing our forecast for year-end occupancy to range between 96% to 97%. We're also increasing and narrowing the range for same-store NOI growth to between 4.5% and 5.25%. The impacted development completions on our same-store pool is less than 50 basis points for the full year. Our in-place leases continue to be 12% under rented globally and this will be a significant driver of NOI growth forward. Cash same-store NOI growth should be higher than net effective by over 100 basis points for the year as the lag from longer lease terms and steeper rent bumps begins to close. There is no change to our 2017 deployment guidance; however, you should note that the acquisition of the remaining equity interest in NAIF is not included in these amounts. For strategic capital, we now expect net promote income for 2017 to range between $0.12 and $0.14 per share. The increase of $0.06 at the midpoint is due to rising property values from higher-than-expected rents and slight cap rate compression. I want to remind everyone that there will be a mismatch between the timing of promote revenue and its related expenses. As a result, in the second quarter, you will see a net promote of $0.13 to $0.15 per share with the remaining expenses recognized over the balance of the year. Our 2017 estimated core FFO was fully hedged relative to the U.S. dollar and we've already hedged most of 2018 and almost half of 2019. We also remain well insulated from foreign currency movements impacting NAV as we ended the quarter with over 93% of our net equity in U.S. dollars. With the strength and operations, higher promote and higher deployment, we're increasing and narrowing our 2017 core FFO range by $0.10 at the midpoint to between $2.72 and $2.78 per share. The components of the raise are driven by $0.06 from promote, $0.04 from operations, $0.01 to $0.02 from net deployment timing offset primarily by slower development leasing in Brazil. Our revised guidance represents a year-over-year increase of 7% at the midpoint or 8% higher excluding promotes. The success of our strategy of having the highest quality assets and into locations is evident in both our financial and operating results. 2017 is off to a great start and we remain focused on continuing to drive growth while further simplifying our business. With that, I'll turn it over to Hamid. Hamid Moghadam : Good morning, everyone. As you just heard from Tom, we had another great quarter. The strategies we put in place years ago, combined with strong market fundamentals and relentless exclusion by our team will lead to continued good performance in the foreseeable future. In my commentary, I'll touch on some nuances on the margin, but the basic message is that our business is strong and absent an external shock, we expect it to remain that way for quite some time. Looking at the current market dynamics, following a period of accelerating demand last year, the U.S. industrial market levelled off to a more sustainable pace in the first quarter. Demand was broader than just eCommerce and was driven by other sectors such as housing and transportation. This picture would have been even stronger but for several retailer bankruptcies. Turning to supply, I would like to flag a few markets where we see some risk. In the U.S., strong demand and sub 5% vacancies seem to have encouraged elevated levels of spec development in some regional markets like Indianapolis and Louisville as well as larger markets like Dallas, Houston, Atlanta and Southern California's Inland Empire. Public REITs have remained disciplined, accounting for just 16% of spec start in the first quarter. By contrast the handful of merchant developers, backed by institutional capital are fueling this wave of development. After seven years of demand outpacing supply, we still expect to reach equilibrium in 2017, but given the number of new starts underway this year, we now expect supply to slightly outpace demand in 2018. Nevertheless, it's key to remember that a market in equilibrium at 5% vacancy still translates into pricing power for quality properties in the right locations. For us Europe continues to benefit from the favorable supply-demand balance and record low vacancies, especially in the U.K., Germany and the Netherlands. We expect Europe to boost our growth starting in 2018. Development in Europe remain disciplined in the first quarter and in our case, 100% of our starts in the region were build-a-suits. The exception to discipline in Europe remains Poland what its low barriers to development and builders who continue to lower investors with artificially inflated headline rents. Recently I fielded many questions about the potential of -- potential relocation of manufacturing activities and its impact on our business. I'd like to remind everyone that starting more than a decade ago, we began to realign our portfolio towards major population centers to take advantage of the consumption power in these regions. With very few exceptions such as the border market in Mexico and a tiny piece of our business in China, our holdings are oriented towards the consumption, not the production end of the supply chain. As a result, our logistic real estate is increasingly the last touch on goods before they reach the customer. While we're monitoring policy developments around the world on tax and trade, we remain as convinced as ever that our focus on high barrier markets where land is scarce and new development is expensive and where more than 85% of our portfolio is located will help us deliver strong relative performance over time. To conclude, we continue to have a positive outlook for 2017. Our strategy to own top-quality logistics real estate in sought after locations near consumers has never been more relevant. Over the next few quarters, we'll continue to show how quality and location can create a strong foundation for sustainable earnings growth in the years ahead. With that, I'll turn it over to Kim for your questions. Kim? Operator? Can the participants hear us? Is there a way somebody can send one of us an email or something? I don't know what happened to the operator. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rob Simone. Your line is open. Rob Simone : Hey guys. Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking the question. Hamid, did I hear you right that you expect supply to outpace demand next year? Hamid Moghadam : Yeah best guess, I think demand will be in the low 200 million feet in the U.S. and supply, which is not a lot of guesswork by the way. You kind of know what supply is going to be out in 12 months and the 14 months. I think supply is going to be like 230 million to 245 million. So maybe\u2026 Rob Simone : Oh! Sorry, I was going to ask do you guys have a view for kind of what that may mean for the pricing environment and your roll up? Hamid Moghadam : Nothing. In terms of our forecast, we were pretty much counting on supply exceeding demand in their sub 5% vacancy market in 2018, 2019 timeframe and we're not really saying anything new. We just don't want anybody to be surprised when supply finally responds to demand. And the issue is I would say focused on maybe five or six market and if a few players. Rob Simone : Okay. Great. Thanks. I'll queue up again. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sumit Sharma. Your line is open. Sumit Sharma : Sumit Sharma, but that's okay. All right. Hamid Moghadam : I think it was worst. Sumit Sharma : I've heard it, yeah. So, it's okay. All right so Sharma is on. Okay. So, we've been -- we've been tracking some of the demand for logistics assets in Europe and I guess across the world and have recently noticed more discussions on last mile delivery, particularly as it works in the Continent. I think Amazon was out over the week -- in the headlines over the weekend with some 1300 last mile warehouses needed in Continent I guess. So just wanted to get a sense of how your portfolio, specifically the European portfolio is positioned in terms of last mile versus let's say bulk? And second, I guess how does the CBRE co-venture equal into this equation as it applies to the U.K. side of things? Hamid Moghadam : Okay. That was two questions but since they -- they destroyed your name, we're going to let you go away with it. So, let me start with the last one first. The U.K. joint venture is purely the reason for it is that the capacity of our existing funds to absorb completed product is limited and our U.K. development machine can produce some very good assets at very good margin. So, we needed a home for our excess development volume in the U.K. and that was the purpose of forming this center. So, it's very, very simple. With respect to the last mile industrial real estate, let me give you the cynical view and my view because there are two views out there. The cynical view is that everybody is calling. They're not so great real estate, that old obsolete, poorly located last mile and putting some shine on it to get better cap rate execution on sale. I can assure you that's not what we're doing. We are very deliberately going after the last mile opportunity by actually investing in infill sites in major metro areas around the world, but specifically in the U.S. and Europe and to redevelop and densify assets to do multistory buildings in these land-constraint locations. In fact, we had our ground breaking on our first property of this type in the U.S. last week in Seattle and you can expect us to have further announcements of these kinds of properties. And if you remember, we basically had two company strategies coming together. Before the merger AMB was very much and more of an infill large market player. Prologis was much more of a bulk player. We have now rationalized those two portfolios coming together by reducing everything down to the global market, but there is still a very large component of near infill last mile last, last five miles whatever you want to call it. The name is not important, but infill real estate in major -- metro areas, which were predominantly the old AMB assets. now AMB's presence in Europe was lower than Prologis and so I would say the mix of those opportunities are greater for us in the U.S. then in Europe, but we are just as deliberate about those opportunities in Europe and you can see us getting after that opportunity in a major way with some initiatives that we have ongoing right now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck. Your line is open. Blaine Heck : Thanks. Good morning out there. Just wanted to talk a little bit about the uptick and same-store NOI guidance. I guess it was a little surprising given that you saw same-store expenses tick up a little higher this quarter than they've been running. Maybe for Tom, can you talk about whether the increase in expenses was expected and what's driving that increase? Tom Olinger : Yeah, the increase in expenses is primarily due to just higher real estate taxes. You see the offset in revenues as well. So, they're recoverable. It had about a 30-basis point impact on revenues. So quite small actually. So, same-store revenue growth was still over 4% with OpEx. So, nothing to look into the expenses. It's really a matter of little bit of timing and mostly the real estate taxes, but don't expect that to be a trend this year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman. Your line is open. Jamie Feldman : Great. Thank you. Hamid, you had commented on retailer bankruptcies maybe dragging on some of the demand in the quarter you're seeing across the markets maybe specific markets and maybe what your expectations are going forward? Hamid Moghadam : Yeah Jamie, I don't know if I have any unique insights on retailer bankruptcy, but let me give you this because there are fixed in our portfolio. We monitor credit loss pretty carefully and we underwrite every tenant's credit in every industry sector. In our typical pro formas, we assume about a 0.5% credit loss. We're running at 20 basis points. So, we're significantly below trend and for those of you who have been around long enough as you have, in the global financial crisis we got up to the low 1% range in terms of credit loss. So, if you pinpointed to what some people refer to as troubled retailers, our exposure to those guys is less than 0.5% or 1% of the portfolio and frankly in a lot of those instances we would rather gave up the space than they\u2019ve in the space. So, I don't -- that's not on my first three pages of issues I worry about. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico. Your line is open. Nick Yulico : Thanks. Can you just quantify a little bit more the impact of consolidating NAIF and also what was the benefit to full year FFO and then from a yield basis, it looks like it might be -- you gave some of the pro forma NOI adjustments. It looks, it's not clear if that was for a full quarter or not, but looks like you bought it around six-type yield, is that correct? Tom Olinger : This is Tom. I'll take that. So, first of all from the impact of the earnings on the year, you've got to look at deployment in total. So, as I said in my prepared remarks, we see deployment higher by $0.01 to $0.02 for the full year. Clearly, NAIF is part of driving that increase. However, we've also talked about, I also mentioned that we're accelerating sales as well. So, from a timing perspective those are offsetting to about $0.01 to $0.02 a share. The impact for the quarter in our EBITDA that we show in the supplemental, we do pro forma for a full quarter impact of that. So, you are seeing the full quarter impact of the NAIF transaction in our stock. Hamid Moghadam : Yeah and the real cap rate the way we count it was midsize, but given that the portfolio was pretty well occupied, the actual cash yield was higher than that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick. Your line is open. Tom Lesnick : Hey, good morning out there on the West Coast. Hamid, I appreciate your comments earlier about the shifts in supply and demand and calling out a few markets there. I guess bigger picture with the potential repeal and/or replace Dodd Frank and the relaxation of lending standards, do you think that the investor base this time around will remain more self-disciplined or do you think that the banking system will really have to be the governor once again? Hamid Moghadam : Well I think Basel III is actually the bigger governor than Dodd Frank. So, they need to obviously count based on risk based capital rules and that just makes the business less profitable than it was before given the reserve requirements and they need to retain. So, I think there's that general backdrop anyway. As to people's discipline, I don't know. Memories are not very long in this business, but I think the business has really, really changed in other ways than just the banking system. I think land is much more difficult to come by. The cities are getting much, much tougher on land and those are tougher and more expensive. So, the average cost and size of the industrial building is going up. So, the barrier for entry of smaller players is now higher. There is a ton of information. You get on this call and there are 200 people on this call right. So, all of them just heard me say that I think supply is going to be a different picture in the first quarter next year and there are some people that are potentially getting a little bit over their skis. Well guess what, that word will get around pretty quickly. Now I don't want to give too much credit to Prologis and our role in this call, but I think there is just so much information around that investors cannot escape the reality of what's happening to these markets and frankly they are accountable to their investors. So pretty soon they're going to get called from pension funds, why you're putting out money when the legislator and the business is saying that the market is getting softer. So, I think it's just a different environment than it was in the last cycle. Operator : Your next question comes from the line David Rodgers. Your line is open. David Rodgers : Hey guys and Hamid maybe I don't know if Eugene and Gary want to take some of this too. But I wanted to ask about rent growth and retention. Clearly, you've been driving retention down and driving rents higher. You're down to that point of about 75% retention overall, I think in the first quarter. I guess maybe give us a sense for how that compares across the regions and then also if you could just talk about how that you might level off here in terms of the pushback that you're seeing from tenants moving into the second quarter? Eugene Reilly : David it's Gene. Let me start and Gary can pile on. So historically we've got to put this in context. Historically 75% retention is the number of people actually seek to achieve. So that's a very, very solid level. Now we've been at elevated levels obviously in the 80s for many quarters and if you look at a trend line, we're headed down. But I am perfectly comfortable with mid-70s. Frankly I am comfortable with probably 70% and even a little bit below that because what we're asking the teams to do today is really push rent and be more aspirational in this -- in this environment where we have vacancy rates that we've literally never seen before in many, many markets. So, I wouldn't be concerned about the direction. And so far, at least our activities in terms of pushing rents have bearing fruit and you look at the rent change look at that. In terms of how that's distributed across the Americas, I'd say in the U.S. you frankly it's pretty consistent across markets. In Mexico, we have much more trouble pushing rents right now. That's really a Peso effect and Brazil has a challenging economic and political background. They're not pushing rents there at this point. So, Gary, I don't know if you would add. Gary Anderson : I would say for Europe, we're in a position today where we are trying to push rents in most markets. So, you can see that coming through our numbers. Obviously, occupancies are high. From a market rent growth perspective today, Europe in 2017 we're forecasting of just under 2.5% accelerating here to above 3%. So, things are heading in the right direction certainly in Europe. In Japan, candidly market rent growth is probably around 1% and we're forecasting about the same next year will be different market to market, stronger in Tokyo, less strong in Osaka. And in China, again market rent growth is accelerating. It's probably around 3.5% today and it's going to go over 4.5% next year. So, I'd say arrow up on market rent growth and given the strength that we're seeing in occupancies we will be pushing rents in most of those markets as well. Hamid Moghadam : The only comment I have to add is that if retention had to come in at 80%, I would've been all over these guys that were not pushing rents high enough. Frankly we would have been running it too high and just facing taking the rents as they come. So, we're pushing term, we're pushing credit. Somebody if we have the lease that are concerned on renewal with a tenant we're going to replace them with a high credit quality tenants. So, I look at the lower retention as a positive sign and I actually wish that it were even lower rate. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee. Your line is open. John Guinee : Great. Hamid, because of the butchering of the name I'll get 17 questions for you. So that is full shorter than last time, but we can't. This is a development question, I am looking Page 23 and Page 26 of your supplemental. First on the land it looks like half of your land at share is South Florida, Central Valley, Mexico, Brazil, the United Kingdom and Japan. Hamid Moghadam : Well you just covered half the world economies. John Guinee : Do you own the right land in the right markets? And then the second question as a sort of a second part of this question, if I'm looking at your development portfolio, can you give a little more color on what you're building where? For example, you've got 6.2 million square feet under construction on the West at about $76 a square foot, which seems kind of low to me. Exactly where is that development being built? Hamid Moghadam : All right. Let me make two general comments and then turn it over to other for more specific color. First of all, seriously the markets that you went through Japan, West Coast, Florida and all that, if you had to mile up together, they all probably have the world's economy. But there are two really, really big and significant land positions we have. One is Beacon Lakes in Florida and one in Tracy which is the REIT -- and which relates to your $76 a foot type question. It is low because the land in Tracy at this point is pretty much free because we've pretty much returned our total investment on that land and I know the accounting doesn't quite work that way. But the land at Tracy is like a good $30 a foot of FAR on their market. So, it should be $100 a foot and $70 because we got really good price of land and by the way, we have another 800 acres of it for free. So, you can see us do a lot of business at very attractive land basis over there. Beacon Lakes is not quite as dramatic as that, both in terms of size and the advantage of the land value, but it is significant and those are the two large pieces of land and do you guys want to talk about specifics? Eugene Reilly : Yeah just to give you a little color John. This is Gene, if you look at the overall land bank, we had too much land in Mexico and we're working down as quickly as we can. We have a lot of land in Brazil, but we control much of that through effectively land JVs. So, we're not like carrying that land and that's going to be -- we're going to make a lot of money on that land over the next five years obviously in the last couple of years, not much activity. In terms of what are we building where, Hamid pretty much answered the question. The low cost per square foot is driven by really two things. One, we have a ton of activity out in our park in Tracy, California, which is in the Central Valley. And secondly, we have a really, really high percentage of build-a-suit right now. I don't know Mike if you some color on that, but build-a-suits tend to be bigger and they tend to have lower values per square foot. Mike Curless : Maybe just to tie it all together, for broader view John, overall mix globally is going to be 45% of Americas, 25% Europe and 30% in Asia, which is very comparable to last year. Often, we start with margins in the quarter at 19%. In fact, those are normalized in the 16% range over the year and Gene's comment on build-a-suit, we were at 77% build-a-suit in Q1. That was a function of a lot of continuation of a very successful build-a-suit program. We expect that to normalize over the year in the mid-40s, but I would expect that to be higher than our build-a-suit percentage last year. So, net, net, I think we feel once again good about the mix and the quality of our development volume and the quarter here on NAIF. Hamid Moghadam : On the overall land balance, I would say there is a $150 million of land that we have, that I would not buy all over again. I think the rest of it we're totally good with and we think is going to be a great driver of growth for our portfolio. But there is probably a $150 million of it that with the benefit of hindsight win by and would be disposing over time. Mike Curless : Which is less on sellers that we had at the merger of that stuff. So, we got through a whole bunch of that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman. Your line is open. Craig Mailman : Hey guys. Just curious looking at the starts in Europe, it looks like it was 100% build-a-suits and I know you guys been pretty positive on what you're seeing over there. I'm just curious this is a trend that's likely to continue and maybe what it really indicates here as you look at the existing stock versus kind of the tendency that is doing with the build-a-suit to you guys and where are those build-a-suits. Are they more infill or are they more bulk? Hamid Moghadam : Yeah, I would say that they're -- look we're a 100% build-a-suit. We're not forecasting a 100% build-a-suit for the full year. I think we're going to end up some of the 15% to 16% just like last year. They're spread all around Slovakia, the Netherlands, Italy and the U.K. So going back to the earlier question, is our land in the right place? Of course, it is. If you're doing 50% to 60% build-a-suit on land that you own, by definition your land is in the right place. Most of this I would describe as infill as opposed to bulk. Candidly most of this had to do with retail. It was apparel. It was consumer good and actually one was automotive. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman. Your line is open. Manny Korchman : Hey Tom, a question for you. If we think about capital deployment, especially outside of guidance, do you have an event like the NAIF buyout. Is there anything like outside I contemplated in or out of guidance sort of a big bulky plan like that and B, why are you excluding that from guidance? Tom Olinger : So, don't anticipate any other transaction like that. That was not in our initial guidance because that came together quite quickly with discussions with our partner, but don't anticipate any other large transactions like that during the year. The reason why we don't put it in our guidance per se as an acquisition because those assets are already reflected. They're consolidated on our balance sheet. They're all there. So, we don't reflect them as an acquisition because we're not adding to our portfolio. We're just taking a bigger piece of the portfolio. So that's why we describe it separately and don't try to confuse our acquisitions, which are real incremental adds to our portfolio. Hamid Moghadam : But these things just to be clear, I don't want you to take from what Tom said that we're asleep over here and we're not looking at opportunities. If the right opportunity came along and we could buy it at the right number or we could finance it appropriately at the right number and finance it appropriately at the night right number, we would look at all of those opportunities and we have been looking at all those opportunities. And just that we don't know about any of them right now, but we're always looking and we're always working on things. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao. Your line is open. Vincent Chao : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just seeing with that the line of thinking about the right opportunities coming along, just curious if there are other larger end deals out there that are interesting right now outside of your funds. Clearly a global logistics properties is undergoing a strategic review, but just curious how that factors into the thinking? Hamid Moghadam : I can't think of a significant transaction in the industrial sector in the last three or four years that we have not looked at thoroughly underwritten and had a point of view on. So, you could expect us to be looking at everything. Now we're very selective about what we pull the trigger on, but let's leave it at that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel. Your line is open. Eric Frankel : Thank you. Hamid, could you -- I think the term last mile has certainly gotten some legs over the last few quarters, and it's generated a lot of investor interest in this sector. Could you qualify the term further in terms of what type of functionality and what kind of demographics around the building would really qualify as a facility that would facilitate the delivery of packages to consumers? Hamid Moghadam : The need to be located in a market with a significant population and a high level of affluence, college education, Internet usage, connectivity etcetera, etcetera, it needs to be dense, it needs to be supply constrained either physically or politically because of the nature of its residents. So putting all those filters on the markets in the U.S., I would say the top markets would emerge as San Francisco, Seattle, New York, Miami, possibly Chicago, parts of LA. And the buildings, there is no rules that I can give you about the type of building you will be in terms of size or number of stories, but the new varieties are likely to be multistory. They're probably not as important to have dock height access and demand in smaller truck access and they need to be near thoroughfares. In terms of -- in terms of rent potential, it would be trading really significantly at the different price points at it -- if you will 10 mile out type of real estate. In other words, there needs to be a pretty significant rent gradient and there are some markets who are being close to the center action or not being that far away from that don't have a rent gradient because basically it's a very suburban eyes market. It's very spread out like it's tough to imagine last mile and Houston even though it's a big city and hits a lot of the other greats here because it doesn't have the supply constraints and the concentration of population in neighborhood, it's very spread out. So those would be the criteria and I got to tell you, they are -- it's unfortunate and you've seen us use the word last tough more than last mile because last mile is really not a last mile. It's last drive or 10 miles and it's really the last touch before you hit the consumer directly. There is a lot of really awful old, tired real estate that it rebranded as last mile we always get a chuckle out of that when we these packages come around. So, a lot of those properties don't meet the criteria that I just spoke. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim. Your line is open. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. We talked a lot about that last mile and different markets and supply and demand, but Hamid when you look at the industrial landscape besides development, just more market specific and maybe asset quality, where do you think the best places are to put your capital to work and what I mean by that is it still kind of A assess in A markets or has it gone down to maybe A assess and B markets. So just how do you think about that. Hamid Moghadam : Look, the real estate market is not that different than the bond market. When the waters are warm and calm, people get a lot of courage and people really stretch for pricing of the assets. All fear goes out of the market. Junk spreads collapse and the yield premia of not so great real estate collapses on top of prime real estate etcetera, etcetera. We have been in one of those environments for some periods of time. So, I do think junkier real estate has had a rally just like junk bonds have had a rally. When there is a little bit more fear in the marketplace and people sort of gravitate towards quality, those spread roll out and prime real estate will do better. We're not smart enough and we're certainly not agile enough at almost 700 million feet to trade around that. You guys may be in terms of the stock, but we're not. So, we need to set the strategy and execute on it because we can't trade around the site portfolio we have. Our view is that in the very long term, having infill real estate near the population centers in these quality locations with supply constraints wins regardless of possibly one year out of five or two years out of five when the junk rallies. In the long term, you get much better adjusted returns by being in these markets. And we think in our estimation the cap rates historically if you average it over long periods of time, have been far, far more than compensated for by the higher growth rate of those markets. So yes, you pay the premium in terms of the lower cap rate, be in those markets, but you picked up double maybe 250% of that in terms of incremental growth rate. Just look at where you are today in Los Angeles or San Francisco with respect to those -- where those rents are compared to Memphis just to begin, Memphis, when I started my career in 1980, the rent at Memphis were probably higher than they are today, but not in these supply constrained markets that we talked about. So, if you're playing a long game, not a quarter-by-quarter game, you want to have money invested in supply constrained markets where people want to live and this is going to become much more important as the winners in industrial space are going to be more on the consumption end because of eCommerce than the production and which is the way the world used to work in the old days. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Neil Malkin. Your line is open. Neil Malkin : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just given the focus and bias toward the end consumer, can you give us a flavor or feel for how much of your portfolio currently is that and consumer versus bulk supply chain and how that also stacks up in your development pipeline, I guess if you just focus on the U.S.? Hamid Moghadam : It is a continuum. There is not a bright spot that one property falls in and one property falls out. I think the best way of looking at that is to look at the global markets, which our share is now almost 90% in global markets and the big regional markets, we don't have any tertiary markets. We've sold all of those. Now within the major markets, about a third of our portfolio is around the 100,000 feet or lower. About a third of it is in that 10,000 to 250 range and the rest of it is in the 250 and up range. I would exclude the 250 and up range even though I can think of a couple of larger buildings that are very infill. But I would say, two thirds of our portfolio meets the consumption. I would say the production and the other way of coming at it other than our properties in the northern part of Mexico there is very little production going on. In fact, Chris what's the manufacturing percentage in our portfolio today? Chris Caton : It's less than 5%. Hamid Moghadam : Less than 5% of our portfolio is oriented towards manufacturing. So by definition, the rest of it is on that consumption or in the wholesaler end of the supply chain. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rob Simone. Your line is open. Rob Simone : Hey guys, thanks for the follow-up. Tom this one might be for you, but I was wondering if you could expand a little bit on the tick up in free rent this quarter over last quarter? I think it was about $20 million versus $14 million last year and I guess given where you guys occupancy is today and in that most of the leasing already being completed, I guess you would have expected that tick down. So, I am just looking for additional color and what should we expect going forward? Tom Olinger : Yeah good question, so when we report free rent, straight line rent, that's reported on leases that commence in the quarter, so which is different than what we report when we lease signings right. So, the leasing activity reported lease signing. The straight line rent, free rent is a function of leases that commence. So, when you look at Q4 versus Q1, Q1 had almost 50% more lease commencements happening right. Q1 is our biggest role. We signed those leases well in advance of Q1. So, the signing showed up a quarter or two ago, but the actual commencement is what triggers the straight line rent free rent. So that's what's driving that aspect of it. When you look at concession, I don't have the numbers offhand, but concessions are clearly continuing to tick down right. Even though you're seeing those numbers grow it's a function of commencements, but also we're signing longer leases. Leases are also increasing right. Rents are going up dramatically. All that increases your nominal amount of rent, but when you look at that concession relative to the whole value of the lease, clearly, they're ticking down. Hamid Moghadam : Well, we were just having this conversation earlier. We're going to just put that out in the package next time and show its trend over time because it's obviously a question that comes up every call and we need to just show it to you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sumit. Your line is open. Sumit Sharma : Okay. It's me again. Hamid Moghadam : One question now. Sumit Sharma : Yeah, yeah. They got the name right, so sticking with the old cynical thing and not looking at the bright side of life from the Monty Python thing, I guess how of -- we spend a lot of airtime on last mile and definitions have been exchanged and you mentioned a bit about multistory warehouses. I guess what I'm wondering is how much of this stuff is if you look at some of the experience in London versus Asia, Asia it's done well, but in London it's been viewed as a bit of a science experiment, particularly some properties next to Heathrow had issues with ramps and such. So how do you mitigate that as you are looking towards I'm hoping more builds of that nature in the U.S. judging by your comments? Hamid Moghadam : So, let me give you a story, which you may find amusing, but the developer of MX 2, which is the building you're referring in London went to Singapore is now almost 10, 12 years ago, literally asked us to give them a tour of our Alps project in Singapore, which we did. It took the plans and built the same building in London without thinking about the differentiated truck sizes in those two markets, which is why MX 2 stays on lease for as long as it did. That's the story you can file away. The person in question is no longer in the business. So that's what happened and that building -- why that building didn't lease. It was the wrong building in the wrong pocket. I think it's all a function of land values. I think when land values get to a certain point, multistory will make sense and there are a few markets in the United States that are approaching that point. Obviously in Japan you've got the benefit of smaller trucks and very high land values. So that's why you see the five or six or seven story building. I think you're not going to see that in the U.S. anytime soon, certainly not in my career in bulk. Oftentimes people have asked what's the size of that opportunity? I think there are probably five or six obvious markets in the U.S. where that opportunity exists I think I mentioned them all before. In those instances, it is not hard to imagine that eventually it could have a portfolio of three, four, five million square feet and I'm talking 10 years out. So just for thinking purposes if you got five or six cities at three to five million, you got 20 to 30 million feet of product that is multistory in these major markets and the value of that product is about double what it is for our traditional investor product in our portfolio. So, in terms of value, we could end up being about 10% of the business order of magnitude, incremental over time. That's the best I can do to size the opportunity set for you. Time will tell how successful we will be, but I think we'll be really successful. Operator : Your next question comes from the line at Eric Frankel. Your line is open. Eric Frankel : Thank you. Just two very quick follow-ups. One, what is for your multistory development in Seattle you just started, who are your, who are the tenants that can possibly take that. I can only think of three at this point that are really big parcel delivery companies. So, it's Amazon, UPS and FedEx? And then second on the supply front, do you see opportunities down the road for potentially helping some of these developers recapitalize some projects if they feel like they got over their skis and the profits that developers have underwritten or maybe little bit aggressive? Hamid Moghadam : I think those developers will do fine because they\u2019ve got some institution's money and it\u2019s the old-fashioned game. If it works on the upside, they have their promote and equity interest and if doesn't work on the outside, they got some fee upside, they got some fees and got going for a while and the institution which is oftentimes a pension fund through an advisor ends up beating it. So, I don't think there's going to be a lot of distress because these are by and large not heavily bank financed deals. These are more institutionally financed types of deals. So, I think you'll have some disappointing returns for the investors and hopefully they won't finance them next round of development. I think that's going to how it -- that's how it's going to resolve itself. In terms of your first question, could you repeat the first part of your question? Eric Frankel : Customer composition. Hamid Moghadam : Oh, just stay tuned. I think our issue right now is trying to figure out how to respond to the interests in that project. So, when I am at liberty to talk about it I will. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman. Your line is open. Manny Korchman : Hey just wondering in terms of demand from capital or institutional investors for product, I think Hamid earlier you had said that there's demand ahead of the supply and so developers are getting comfortable building more supply. If we were to take that same analogy I guess and think about capital? Is it more capital chasing assets and their supply of assets? Is that a fair assumption? Hamid Moghadam : Well yeah and that's why cap rates that we keep saying are stabilizing, are going down because the way the capital is pushing those cap rates down, but we don't blame -- we're not building our business around cap rate compression and rents growing at 10%, 12% a year or like they have been. I think we've shared our assumptions with you. They're essentially based on flat or slightly uptick in cap rates and moderate rental growth, it varies by market, but sort of in that 3% to 4% or 5% range in the U.S. market by market. This is market rent. Same-store will actually be pretty much baked in at somewhat higher because of -- because of the mark-to-market obviously. But happy to go through those assumptions, but we're not building a business around the market being exuberant going forward. I think our assumptions are much more sobering. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters. Hamid Moghadam : Okay. Great. Thank you for your time and interest in the company and good luck with earnings season. We'll see you all around pretty soon. Take care. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

P. Morgan Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Jon Peterson - Jefferies Tom Catherwood - BTIG Craig Mailman - KeyBanc Capital Markets Operator : Welcome to the Prologis Q2 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Cynthia and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Tracy Ward. Tracy, you may begin. Tracy Ward : Thanks, Cynthia and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2017 conference call. The supplemental document is available on our Web site at prologis.com under Investor Relations. This morning, we\u2019ll hear from Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover results and guidance and Hamid Moghadam, our Chairman and CEO, who will comment on the Company\u2019s strategy and outlook. Also, joining us for today\u2019s call are Gary Anderson, Chris Caton, Mike Curless, Ed Nekritz, Gene Reilly, and Diana Scott. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I\u2019d like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry, in which Prologis operates, as well as management\u2019s beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings. Additionally, our second quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO, EBITDA and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures and in accordance with Reg G we have provided a reconciliation to those measures.  With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom, and we\u2019ll get started. Tom Olinger : Thanks, Tracy. Good morning, and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. I\u2019ll cover the highlights for the quarter, provide updated 2017 guidance and then turn the call over to Hamid. We had another strong start with core FFO of $0.84 per share, which included net-promote income of $0.18. Net promote income came in above our guidance due to higher real estate values in our USLF portfolio, as well as $4 million promote from our FIBRA that was not in our forecast. Core FFO, excluding promotes of $0.66 per share, up $0.03 sequentially, driven by same-store NOI growth. We leased almost 47 million square feet during the quarter and have just 4% of the portfolio rolling in the second half of the year as our customers are securing space well before their leases expire. As we\u2019ve discussed on previous calls, our strategy has been to push rents to maximize overall lease economics. And as a result, occupancy could decline modestly. Our operating results reflect this strategy. Global occupancy at the end of the quarter was 96.2%, a sequential decrease of 40 basis points. Market rent growth exceeded our expectations, which help drive our share of net effective rent change on rollover to a record 24%. The U.S. was 29%, the sixth consecutive quarter above 20%. Our share of net effective same-store NOI growth was 4.6%, primarily driven by releasing spreads. U.S. led the way with growth of 5.2%. Moving to capital deployment for the quarter. Development starts were the highest quarterly level in the last several years at approximately $900 million. Margins on both starts and stabilizations continue to be very good at over 20%. Dispositions and contributions are on track as buyer interest remains strong and cap rates continue to compress. Recall, we\u2019ve been focused on streamlining our ventures into fewer more profitable vehicles. I\u2019d like to discuss two transactions that further this initiative and highlight our unique ability to source capital through this business. First, as previously announced, we entered into an agreement to acquire the remaining partner\u2019s interest in our Brazil platform for approximately $360 million; second, after quarter end, we contributed $2.8 billion in U.S. assets from our former NAIF fund to USLF at stabilized cap rate of 5.4%. This valuation was structured to be consistent with the buyout of the remaining NAIF investor in the first quarter of this year. Investor interest was very strong and USLF raised over $950 million from 14 new and existing investors to fund this transaction. We received cash proceeds of $720 million and additional units valued at $1.2 billion, which increased our interest in USLF from 14% to 27%. Our current ownership leaves us with another $1.3 billion of built-in liquidity as we redeem our position down over time to our long term target of 15%. Turning to capital markets. We continue to access debt globally at very attractive rates. We completed $2.9 billion of financing activity with the vast majority denominated in sterling and yen. As a result of this activity, we extended our term, lowered our rate and increased our U.S. dollar net equity. Leverage, following the USLF transaction, was approximately 25% on market capitalization basis and debt to adjusted EBITDA with gains was less than 4.5 times. Our balance sheet has never been stronger with liquidity of $3.7 billion and significant built-in capital from future co-investment rebalancing. As a result, we're extremely well positioned to self-fund our future deployment for the foreseeable future. Moving to guidance for 2017 which I will provide on an our share basis. We're increasing the midpoint and nearing the range of our year-end occupancy forecast to be between 96.5% and 97%. We now expect same-store NOI growth for the year to be approximately 5%. Cash same-store NOI growth should be over 6% for the year as a lag from longer lease terms and steeper rent bumps begins to close. Given the increase in market rents, our in-place leases are now under rented by 13% globally and 17% in the U.S. This further builds our organic earnings potential and will drive strong NOI growth for the next several years. Given continued strong demand from customers, we're increasing our starts guidance by $200 million to range between $1.8 billion and $2.1 billion, built-to-suits will comprise about 45%. We're also increasing our disposition and contribution guidance by $250 million in total. Full year deployment guidance excludes the contributions to USLF and the planned acquisition of our partner\u2019s interest in Brazil. Our strategic capital net promote income will be $0.16 for the full year as we have no other promotes scheduled for the remainder of 2017. Again, I want to highlight there'll still be a difference in the timing of promote revenue and its related expenses. We will recognize $0.02 of additional promote expenses over the balance of this year. Putting this all together, we're increasing our 2017 core FFO by $0.05 at the midpoint and nearing the range between $2.78 and $2.82 per share. The main drivers of our guidance increase includes $0.03 from higher promotes and $0.02 from core operations. Our revised guidance, excluding promotes, represents year-over-year increase of 9% at the midpoint. To wrap up, we had a great quarter and are entering the second half of the year with strong momentum. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Hamid. Hamid Moghadam : Thanks, Tom and good morning, everyone. I'd like to spend my time with you today sharing my perspective on the current state of the industry and trends that will affect its future. Market conditions in the U.S. continue to be very strong. We remain vigilant in monitoring potential risks to development starts and oversupply. During the first quarter, we called out several markets with elevated construction starts. But this trend did not continue into the second quarter. On the margin, we\u2019re now even more positive on fundamentals. We're hoping our 2017 forecast as net absorption is constrained by the lack of available space, but we're slightly increasing our expectations for both supply and demand in 2018 when the higher volume of completions will offer more space for customers to absorb. Supply and demand will effectively offset one another and we expect to remain at historic low levels of vacancy. As we discussed at the outset of 2017, we expect that the rate of market rent growth to moderate as the rent cycle matures, and the difference in performance between the best coastal markets and the rest of the country to expand. Our forecast is proven to be too conservative as record low vacancies mean customer have limited alternatives. We see increased activity from our customers and a greater willingness to pay up for quality spaces and locations. Our initial forecast for 2017 called for market rent growth in the U.S. of 4%. Instead, rent growth is on pace to approach 8% this year, driven primarily by high barrier coastal markets, such as New Jersey, Los Angeles, Seattle and the same Cisco Bay area, where we have dominant market positions. Outside the U.S., market conditions are also favorable and the institutional capital continues to chase logistics product, driving cap rates to all-time lows. On the operating side, notwithstanding the quirky quarterly end occupancy stats which doesn\u2019t reflect the additional 450 basis points of leasing we've already completed, Asia remains in line with our expectations. Europe experienced record net absorption and we\u2019ve seen surprisingly limited development starts on the continent. The election result in France is constrictive for economic expansion, which is expected to read nice growth. The UK is the one market that has called slightly and it's coming on several years of exceptional fundamental. Recently, I\u2019ve been fielding many questions on drivers of demand for our product and would like to offer a few observations. I think of demand in three categories; consumption, cyclical and structural. Historically, our business has been highly correlated with consumption and serving basic daily needs as populations grow. This includes categories such as consumer products, food and beverage and apparel. These segments will continue to expand in line with population growth, shifting demographics and consumer confidence. Requirements for our space are also driven by spending on segments that are more closely tie to economic cycles, like residential construction and autos. Logistics space needed for residential construction will increase as the housing recovery accelerates. Housing starts still need to rise by 30% to normalize to a level consistent with population growth. By contrast, we're keeping a close eye on the auto segment as declining sales may dampen growth. Net-net, the changes in housing and autos should be a positive for demand. The remaining drivers are structural and involve fundamental changes in the way businesses operate. E-commerce will remain the most significant of these drives as shopping habits continue to shift online, and will be future energized by millennials for entering their peak spending years. We do, however, expect that the 3x multiplier on demand from e-commerce, that we\u2019ve identified in our research, will decline overtime as customer become more efficient and online sales cannibalize some of the space required by bricks-and-mortar retailers. Lastly, I want to highlight healthcare as a potential new structural driver in the future. We expect its category, which currently represents only 4% of our space, to grow as baby boomers age. In closing, I feel great, even better than last quarter, about the trends that will drive ongoing demand for logistic space located close to end customers. Our portfolio and strategy will further bolster our performance. With that, let me now turn it over for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Craig Mailman with KeyBanc. You may begin. Craig Mailman : Maybe if we could hit some of your commentary on leasing and rent growth here. Maybe if you could just give us a little bit of color, where you are seeing tenant spike for spaces at only in infill locations, or is it more like Inland Empire market? And then maybe you could also address the 3X multiplier decline there. Is that a function of some of these ecommerce guides Whole Foods, Amazon type deal where they\u2019re just going to buy brick-and-mortar, and do more of a hybrid model over there? Hamid Moghadam : Let me take the last part of your question first, and then I'll turn it over to Eugene and Gary to talk about the first part. The 3X is coming down really for three reasons, one, their infrastructure is going in for us. So obviously, there is a lot of space demand. And then the sales are going to follow. So the online customers are squeezing more volume through the warehouses and they\u2019re getting more efficient in how they use their footprints. There are also technologies emerging that are going to make returns smaller, as smaller portion of returns better fit, better sizing, et cetera, et cetera. We\u2019ve talked about that, obviously, virtual reality and augmented reality are two big ones that overtime will affect the return ratio. So those are two biggies. Also, when you get the 3X expansion of ecommerce, you were getting cannibalization on the bricks-and-mortar end. So you have the offset of the 1X happening at little bit later and with a delay. So I think overtime it is likely for that 3X to end up being somewhere in the low 2s, but that\u2019s going to be a decade long process. So still very positive, still any multiple bigger than one is a strong tailwind, and we think it's going to stay way above two, and it's going to take a long time to gravitate that. Now, let me turn over to Eugene and Gary. Eugene Reilly : So on the rent growth question, in the U.S., we have pricing power in lot of markets. In fact, we have pricing power in most. And most U.S. markets are in 6% vacancy range or lower, and that\u2019s where your pricing power is. But clearly, the global coastal markets, as mentioned in the preliminary remarks, are leading that. And to give you a sense of it, the first half of this year leasing rent growth in those markets at nearly 7% just in the first half of the year. And they all trend towards 10% the year. So no question, more power there and good example of the L. A. County that\u2019s a billion square feet of real-estate that has about 1%, so tremendous pricing power. Gary Anderson : And then in terms of the markets, I'll discuss on Europe real quick. The Northern European markets are very strong, Germany, the Netherlands, the UK is still quite strong. Candidly, I would say that companies are starting to compete for space on a broad base basis across Europe. It's one of the strongest markets that I've seen in quite a while. Market vacancy rates across Europe have dropped to 5.6%. They've got a down wheel on them as we approach the back half for the year. So we're now in a position where we're actually pushing rents. So our own portfolio is performing well. We\u2019re over 96% occupied and rate change is starting to come through positively in almost every market. So it's a very good story. Operator : And our next question comes from Dan Occhionero with Barclays. You may begin. Dan Occhionero : Two question. Number one, can you just touch on the strategic rationale behind increasing your exposure in Brazil? And secondly, could you just elaborate a little bit more on the difference between leased and commenced occupancy in Europe and Asia, and what specifically drove that? Hamid Moghadam : So let me talk about the strategy for Brazil. Nothing new that we, like the Brazil market, that there\u2019s long-term fundamentals. It's been a tough two years, following three or four years of excellent performance, two years of slowdown. We think it's a great entry point into Brazil in terms of doubling down. The currency is very attractive and fundamental are kind of at the bottom of the market. And the political change that they went through and the rule of law and it worked, and that's pretty unusual in many countries. I was going to say Latin America, but may I'll drop the Latin point and just talk about America. So I don\u2019t know, I just think that in terms of entry point, it's very attractive. We wanted to control the platform also because eventually we\u2019re going to recapitalize it. And we need to own 100% of it. So for a variety of reasons, this was a good time to try to accomplish this objective. Gary, you want to talk about\u2026 Gary Anderson : On the leased occupied spread in Europe, there is not a big new story that we\u2019re sitting at 96.2% occupied and got a 60 basis points spread to for a lease percentage. So typically, you would see some upward movement in occupancy with that greater spread. The real news is in Asia, particularly Japan. If you look at page 16 of our supplemental and you see the Japan today is 92% occupied, but 96.1% leased, that's more than 10 basis points spread. And the story is a simple one. We had a single 1.2 million square foot building, a speculative building that we leased but the tenant had not occupied the building before it moved into the operating pull from the development to the operating pool. So you should expect not only the Japan occupancy to tick up in the third quarter but all of Asia above 95%, so no real big news there. Operator : And our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. You may begin. Ki Bin Kim : Could you just talk a little bit more about your development pipeline? I noticed a bigger percentage point to expect, I know it's just one quarter and not really a trend but I wondering if you could comment on that. And tied to that, I noticed the development yield is coming down little bit further across the regions. Mike Curless : You hit on a key point there, development stars relative to those is definitely very lumpy, 77% in the first quarter, 35% in the second. Over the year, that 45% as Tom mentioned, that\u2019s indicative of where we see this heading for the year. And in terms of yields, we focused on margins and you see our margins in the 20% range. And through the first half of the year and through the balance of the year, those might normalize a bit into the high teens as we chew through some of the less expensive land. But we feel pretty good about those margins. Operator : And our next question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi. Your may begin. Manny Korchman : Can I just go back to your commentary, and realizing that things are outperforming your expectations; what has sort of changed in the 12 weeks since we last spoke that you\u2019d go from talking about oversupply in a few key markets to, no it's not really oversupply anymore. By the way, we think you\u2019re delivering some continue, and not only that we\u2019re going to increase our starts and the proportion of those starts is going to remain 55% spec. So how do we put that all together over the course of time since we last spoke? Hamid Moghadam : Nothing about supply that I talked about last quarter has changed. You will see a rise in supply in the first quarter in those markets that I indicated on the last call. So that elevated level of starts that we saw will translate into those projects that were started, hitting the market in the first quarter of next year, that remains. What has changed is that that elevated level of starts did not continue in the second quarter. The level of deliveries in the second quarter was actually in a little bit lower than the norm, in line with norm but little bit lower than the norm. So that\u2019s pretty easy to put together. With respect to our rent expectations, we call them as we see them. I mean we went into the year thinking that after multiple-year of almost double-digit growth and the rents nearing replacement cost that it was prudent to be banking on less rental growth, and that\u2019s what we indicated in our internal planning. The reality is that in the markets, particularly the coastal markets, it\u2019s becoming very, very difficult to get built in the space. And remember the buildings are getting bigger, much bigger in the cycle. These buildings require lot of land, transportation areas are getting bigger. So all of a sudden, it is very hard to find flat large sites in these large metro areas, and that\u2019s driving pricing power, because product that already exists there is becoming very scarce. So again, we see them as we call them. And it could be back here next quarter, talking about higher or lower rental growth. We don\u2019t have a perfect crystal ball. Operator : And our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. You may begin. Steve Sakwa : I guess just sort of follow up on that. I mean, if supply and demand are roughly in equilibrium next year and the vacancy rate, I think, is probably getting closer with 20 or low. Is there any reason to think that rent growth next year wouldn\u2019t look very similar to rent growth in \u201917? And I guess secondly, I noticed the occupancy drop in Japan. I am just wondering if I missed any comments on that. Could you just touch on that? Thanks. Hamid Moghadam : The occupancy drop in Japan is a blip, the quirky number in the other quarter. We\u2019ve actually leased that vacancy of a building that came online and the lease is signed, but it doesn\u2019t hit the occupancy statistics till next quarter. So that number, if we were reporting here, that would be 450 basis points higher. And as Gary said, the occupancies in Asia are going to be north of 95%. So don\u2019t even spend a moment on that one. I don\u2019t know what rents are going to be. It's kind of like predicting the stock market to a certain extent. I think all I\u2019m telling you is that the momentum is really good and we are feeling -- we were good last quarter. I got tired of every quarter saying this is the best quarter in my career. And I\u2019m just saying I am even feeling much better than the way I felt last quarter. And the interesting thing about all of this is that with every passing quarter, we have leases that are expiring that were signed at the bottom of the downturn. So you would expect that our mark-to-market would shrink. But given the pace of rents accelerating, our mark-to-market is expanded actually and that expanded mark-to-market not only means that rents are strong today, but it means that the recovery, the glide path for the next three or four years looks really, really positive as we absorb those mark-to-markets. So I think the runway has been certainly extended and somewhat elevated, whether it will continue to get more and more elevated, we\u2019re just going to have to wait. But we\u2019re feeling pretty good. Operator : And our next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. You may begin. Jamie Feldman : Tom, going back to your comments, so I think you had said cap rates continue to compress across markets. Can you give more color on where you\u2019re still seeing that and what\u2019s driving it? And then also, can we expect to see more large-fund transactions in the future, like Brazil and the North American one that we saw? Hamid Moghadam : Let me take that last one. You know that our goal is to get to down to one open-end fund in every major region, and we have two in Europe. So that will be a good place to look, not for certain, but that\u2019s the one that have rationalization I see. Tom, you want to take\u2026 Tom Olinger : On the cap rates, we\u2019re seeing cap rate, I\u2019d say, modestly decline in the U.S. probably 10 basis much lower Q1 to Q2; probably expect similar levels in Europe but given some transactions that we expect to close; in the third quarter, we would certainly expect Europe more expansion and contraction start in Europe in the second half of the year; in Japan, given some pending transactions as well, we would expect top rates to continue to go lower; and with our other pending transactions that are rumored to be potentially closing in third quarter; in Asia, I think it would also be another strong indication of compressing values for assets, but I\u2019d also say how asset management business get valued. Hamid Moghadam : Well, let's be specific on that. I mean logically we\u2019re basically traded at about 10% to 12% higher than what our internal carrying value for, once adjusted for quality and location to our own internal portfolio. And that leads to in a quarter roughly of NAV increase. We and you are looking for more details on the GLP transaction. But the couple of estimates that were out there on this trade were at 260. Actually that\u2019s their IFRS carrying value on their portfolio, which is mark-to-market and the rumored price is 330, something. So there is a 30% difference there in valuation. So I'm not saying that -- we don't have perfect visibility in business transactions, but those bode very well for values outside the U.S. So the cap rate compression issues are much greater or the compressions are greater outside the U.S. than they are inside. Tom Olinger : Jamie, one thing I just would add. What's really driving the compression, particularly in the U.S., is rent growth. And I think given the trajectory of rent growth, higher rents, higher rents are causing valuations to go up and cap rates the cost of that for higher growth expectation. Operator : And our next question comes from Nick Yulico with UBS. You may begin. Nick Yulico : Just looking at your re-leasing spread on a cash basis is highest you've reported this cycle. And you talked about rent growth being even better in the U.S. this year now on track for 8%. So hoping you could give a little bit of perspective on how your mark-to-market spread might look for remainder of this year and even heading into next year? Tom Olinger : So if you're talking about mark-to-market for rents, basically where we are right now looking at our re-leasing spreads, if rent is growing market rents are growing more than 4% or 5% that spread will expand. And that's what we saw in the first half of the year and that's opposite of what we expect. So this year for sure, it'll stay where it's at and maybe expand a little bit. But that's a bit of a threshold that I want to keep 4% or 5% in excess of that you're going to see the mark-to-market. Hamid Moghadam : Our mark-to-market in the U.S. has gone from 15% to 17%. The overall has gone from 12% to 13%, 14% today as we sit. If those trends continue, it could approach 15% as we crossed into 2008. Operator : And our next question comes from Sumit Sharma with Morgan Stanley. You may begin. Sumit Sharma : Hamid, to your comments on the 3X number, I agree, I think it should over time tend to go down just as the supply chain models achieve greater operating leverage. But what caught my attention was you said returns would be one of the variables that bring it down slightly. I guess if returns are just 30% of ecommerce gross merchandize volumes, and my sense was this was always on the fringes of the supply chain with facilities being located away, more labor, everything that points to a sleepy corner of warehouse land. I'm struggling to understand how this materially moves the demand variable, or did I misread your comment? Hamid Moghadam : No, I think the returns are very space intensive, because the inventory needs to be accepted unpacked, restocked and all of that is labor intensive and space intensive. So as technologies allow fit to get better, particularly with the apparel, I think returns are going to go down and that on the margin will affect the amount of the space in the warehouse that's devoted to handling returns. So that's really what's going on. But that's a very long process. I mean some of these technologies I'm talking about don't really exist today, or they exist in very limited ways. Operator : And our next question comes from John Guinee with Stifel. You may begin. John Guinee : Great, okay\u2026 Hamid Moghadam : Let me just say that that was absolutely the best rendition John that I've ever heard. John Guinee : Tracy is going to allow me two questions I'm sure. Refresh my memory, Hamid, have you turned 60 yet, because your stock just did? Hamid Moghadam : Unfortunately, I lost that bet. I\u2019ve turned 60 about nine months ago. John Guinee : And then second, Tom, your revised net earnings estimates about 280 a share. Are you able to shelter all those gains via 1031s, or would we expect your $1.76 dividend to increase, one way or another? Tom Olinger : No, we do not expect any special dividends we can shelter that income. The big increase that you're seeing in our EPS guidance is the expected gain, book gain on the USLF transaction, that\u2019s about $0.87. But we can defer that gain, because the vast majority of that gain, we sold down roughly a third part of the $2.8 billion we put in there. So the other is just basis switching out from direct ownership to indirect ownership. So that gets sheltered. Hamid Moghadam : But I think the gist of your question is still valid. It is not a piece of cake to manage or dividend around here. We\u2019re devoting more and more time on deferral strategies, 1031s and all that. I'm not a big fan of special dividends, but we try to make our dividend policy to be pretty stable, reliable and consistent as it's been in last couple of years. Operator : And our next question comes from Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. You may begin. Blaine Heck : Just wanted to touch on the increase in development start guidance. Hamid, given what you're seeing with higher than expected rent growth and also what's on the horizon is our supply and demand dynamics are concerned. Do you think this case of starts that you're guiding to this year is sustainable into next year, or do you think this is likely to be the peak level for you guys? Hamid Moghadam : I think in the depths of the downturn or shortly thereafter in 2010-2011 time frame we had an Analyst meeting in New York and at that time that\u2019s even before the merger, we said that the responsible level of starts given our global platform is going to be between $2 billion and $3 billion depending on the day in the cycle. And that\u2019s been where we\u2019ve been, sometimes it's in the low 2s now it's approaching mid to high 2s. We make the development decisions from a bottoms up opportunities identified in the marketplace. We do not sit around this table with the executive team and say, we will drive to, I don\u2019t know, $3 billion of starts. I think that approach was tried in previous cycles and what shows in that be a very successful way of doing developing. So bottoms up, deal-by-deal and they have to pass a very rigorous test for market conditions and competitive set and the like. So that\u2019s a long winded answer. I don\u2019t really know what development starts are going to be next year, but we\u2019ll have a better idea of when we rollout guidance towards the end of this year. Mike, if I were going to guess, I would say it would be between 2 in the quarter until now. It\u2019s really tough to find win in some of these markets. Operator : And our next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. You may begin. Michael Carroll : Can I also, the last question, look like the Company is being a little bit more aggressive starting projects outside of the U.S. with about half of the deals in Europe and Asia year-to-date. Is there anything to read into that? Hamid Moghadam : In the last 15 years, this is a little secret of our business. Two thirds of our starts have been outside the U.S. and about 75% of our value creation has been outside the U.S. And I just am amazed that I get questions about why you\u2019re global, because we make a lot of money developing outside the U.S. There is no logistic supply chain much smaller than the U.S., so the opportunities and the run way is actually pretty big outside the United States. Gary Anderson : Just to add, I would say, the markets are very tight. And if you look at the first half of the year for us in Europe, we started 11 buildings -- we started 13 buildings, 11 of them were built-to-suits. So there\u2019s just not space available for our customers so were having to build it. And I would say in China the market dynamics are good for speculative in Japan we\u2019re doing more built-to-suit as well. So it's a pretty well fostered strategy, I would say. Hamid Moghadam : Probably what I\u2019d point out is that while there was a quite a bit of international activity this quarter, the long term next several years that has end up at 45% Americas, 25% in Europe and 30% in Asia, which is pretty consistent with our vision 2020 long view. So give you a perspective on how that looks over the long haul. Operator : And our next question comes from Michael Mueller with J. P. Morgan. You may begin. Michael Mueller : Real quick one, back at Brazil for a second. Can you comment on what the pricing was at a buyout? And I guess that the plan is to ultimately recapitalize it anyway, whether the partner that wanted to sell or can you just give us a little more color on that? Hamid Moghadam : The partner, I don\u2019t think it really wanted to sell, but their primary focus is on their other businesses, retail and office. And I'll let them speak for their strategies, their reasons for selling. We see the opportunity as a really good opportunity, and so did they. But they also see significant opportunities in the other sectors where they can execute better. So also the strategy of recapitalizing Brazil, we\u2019ve talked about this for a number of years. And it's consistent with what we\u2019ve done in China and in other platforms in terms of really building a private or public capital vehicle for owning assets long term, particularly in markets where currency hedging and the like are difficult and the debt markets are not very developed. So we want to manage our currency exposure as well. So all of those things will lead you to a strategy of controlling the platform and then recapitalize it. Tom? Tom Olinger : Michael to your question, so from a yield perspective think about cap rates for operating assets, stabilized operating assets, cap rates for the nine in front of it. We also acquired land as part of this. So I think the yield on combined basis for the four investments we will make is going to have a seven in front of it. And when you think about total NOI from Brazil going forward after we close on this last transaction for Brazil, we\u2019ll be around 2% of our NOI our share. Hamid Moghadam : Yes, I just wanted to be clear, that seven is a combination of operating assets at the nine and then construction in progress and then land inventory. So all of it blend in together, including non-income producing assets are in the seven, one other thing that I would just mention, because it's related to your question. Although not probably directly, the ability for Prologis to source capital around the world and match it with investment opportunities around the world, it's pretty unique because if you would look at the quarter, we bought out our business, our partner in Brazil and we source capital in the UK. Now, within those two things that fund each other directly, because we manage obviously each debt and asset and liability in each country to manage our currency but if you really think about it, we were able to borrow money in the 2s before for a dozen years in the UK and deploy it in the 9s in Brazil at what we believe to be a pretty low point in the currency. We\u2019re not in the currency speculation business, but it's certainly a lower point than the past couple of years in the cycle. I think that's a pretty unique platform that allows you to do that. And I'm not sure that's totally appreciated out there. Operator : And our next question comes from Eric Frankel with Green Street. You may begin. Eric Frankel : Just two quick questions, one is regarding the NAIF recapitalization and contribution to the U.S. logistic funds. The 5.4% cap rate I would assume that's significantly higher than our overall U.S. portfolio. Can you just provide maybe a mix of global and regional markets for that portfolio? And then second, can you explain in accounting terms the difference between your GAAP or you GAAP same-store NOI growth and recapturing high growth? Thank you. Eugene Reilly : I can give you a sense of the cap rate. So that cap rate is at appraised value cap rate, because that was our deal for buying the last tranche of NAIF. And our deal with new investors was that they'll get the same pricing and we turn that around in like 120 days by the way. So let me just take -- I think this is what you\u2019re looking for. So this cap rate is 5.4%, the apples-to-apples cap rate at the same time of USLF is 5.1%, and the apples-to-apples cap rate for all of Prologis is 5.3%. All of those cap rates are now 20 bps, 30 bps lower something like that. As far as the -- I can't give you a market-by-market breakdown, but NAIF has much more exposure to regional market versus global markets than USLF and so that explains. Hopefully, that answers your question. Gary Anderson : Eric, on the net effective versus cash same-store NOI, if you just think about over the last several years, we've been building occupancy and rents have been growing significantly. And concessions have been coming down. However, we have been building a significant amount of free rent up over the last several years, because we're signing much higher dollar value leases, concessions are less, longer leases as well. So they are not on the free rent that we have been building up that\u2019s been growing pretty significantly. Now that we\u2019re in a period where occupancy is pretty consistent year-over-year for sure we\u2019ll be there in the second half, as well as the length of our leases are now pretty consistent. We start to see that build-up of free rent online so that significantly starts to add to your cash same-store NOI. So if you just think about having a three-year lease with straight line rent of one month in every year and now you sign a five-year lease and you have half of year straight line rent per year, the nominal amount of your free rent in that five year lease is going to be bigger, so you'll see a hit when that lease rolls. But once you burn through that, your cash growth comes up significantly. So that is what\u2019s happening. I think you\u2019re going to see the same dynamic happen into \u201918. So when we talk about whatever our same store growth is for \u201918, net effective, you should expect to see cash same store above that. Hamid Moghadam : Let me just add one thing to what these guys said. When the cash was lower than GAAP, you heard from us many times that really that is what you need to pay attention to, because that\u2019s closer to effective rents. Let me say that when cash is greater than GAAP, that\u2019s still same answer still holds. We pay a lot more attention to GAAP around here. We really provide the cash number, because you guys want it but we run our business based on effective rents. Operator : And our next question comes from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Your may begin. Vincent Chao : I know we spent a lot of time talking about market rent growth, but just curious, I mean, it seems that your customers should be at all time high in terms of cost of occupancy. I know it\u2019s not a huge percentage of their business. But is there any benchmark that we need to be thinking about in terms of how far rent growth could go? And then maybe as a coruler to that question, last quarter, you talked about customer retention, which was a little bit lower. Just to make sure you are pushing rents as much as you can, and they were up a little bit here in the second quarter. Is it safe to assume that you haven\u2019t quite found that leading edge of rents pushing rents? Hamid Moghadam : Let me answer your question this way. We had a leadership meeting around here, and we track the reasons why we don\u2019t retain a customer; they wanted too much space; we didn\u2019t have space to accommodate them; they wanted to shrink; they went out of business; so like four or five standard reasons why customers don\u2019t renew. One of them you would think would be because they found space cheaper down the street from somebody else. We could not find one example of that in that quarter. That tells me when we\u2019re pushing rents hard enough. So that we started really, really pushing rents on the margin, because until you start -- by the way, if you love our customers and don\u2019t want to lose our customers. But I mean if we\u2019re retaining all the customers that can be retained, that means we\u2019re not testing the edges of rent growth. And we\u2019re beginning to do a better job of that. I wouldn\u2019t say it's perfect yet. But the pricing pay for that is that your retention rate on the margins is going to come down a little bit. That is totally a price we\u2019re willing to pay. Gary Anderson : And Vincent to your first question on, are we at prior peak rents in some markets. Yes, we are. That was a decade ago. We are 35 % below the last market peak inflation adjusted that\u2019s a point. So in terms of -- the price of everything else has gone up, but the customers have had a tremendous bargain for the last 20 years because cap rate compression has given a bargain on rents at the cost of the capital market. So they\u2019ve got long ways to go before they reach real term rents even forget about the peak, but even going back to 1980, real rents are way, way down. So I think this could be a longer term phenomena. But I don\u2019t want to speculate about it. Operator : And our next question comes from Richard [indiscernible] with Baird. You may begin. Unidentified Analyst : You touched about it at the beginning of the call, but I wanted to dig in a little further on the Amazon acquisition of Whole Foods and any potential impacts on their requests for industrial space. As your largest customer, have you seen any changes in their request for the specific specifications in the industrial building? And are there any asks of them where you put your foot down and say no, we\u2019re not going to go there. And secondly, how far are you willing to move down the supply chain to the nearest mile-delivery facility in order for them to accomplish some of their same day 2-hour delivery objectives? Mike Curless : Richard, with respect to the Whole Foods acquisition, we view that as a real positive for industry reinforces the strategy of getting close to your customers, which clearly we\u2019ve been doing for some time. So I think that\u2019s a good thing in general. And we see them getting more and more active in this business as they compete with major players in this field, namely Walmart and this activity should pick-up and resolve in more activity for logistic players like ourselves and others. In terms of working on, here implication is every single Amazon requirement out there we\u2019re very selective on when we work with them. The buildings that end up being a little bit more specialized, we look at selling those. But by enlarge most of business we do with Amazon is in our generic buildings, it\u2019s very releasable and it\u2019s based that we feel like we can use very well. In terms of going down to the last mile, our buildings that could fit in that requirement in our infill location, certainly, are good candidates for that and we will pursue those opportunities as they come up. Hamid Moghadam : Our strategy to go infill multi-story intensify these sites that we\u2019re executing on in Seattle, as you know, the Francisco Bay Area and New York with the former ABC Carpet business, all of those are multi-story buildings are in attempt to get closer to the customer and take advantage of intensification of urban land, which is very scares. So that\u2019s going to happen whether Amazon leases those buildings or somebody else does, we\u2019ve seen a lot of demand for those types of facilities, modern facilities. Operator : And our next question comes from Jon Peterson with Jefferies. You may begin. Jon Peterson : So you guys made some comments that you\u2019re pushing rents harder which is why occupancy tick down a bit this quarter. So I think I also heard Hamid note that the quarter end occupancy number was quirky, and you\u2019ve already seen 450 basis points of leasing in the third quarter. So I\u2019m trying to put those comments together and figure out whether we should expect occupancy is trending higher or lower, what the magnitude is, and what exactly the 450 basis points of leasing mean? Hamid Moghadam : The 450 is singing one lease in one building that came online, following its stabilization period that was only 10% leased, that\u2019s now 95% leased. And it's only 4.5% increase in Asia. It's just one building in Japan. Mike Curless : So that was the quirky comment. Hamid Moghadam : Yes, that was quirky. Maybe I should have used better terminology. In terms of our overall strategy, particularly in the U.S. and to a lesser extent in Europe, you should expect our retention to trend down and our occupancy on the margin to trend down a little bit, maybe 100 basis points and our rental growth to be higher than it would have been, as we manage 96%, 97% occupancy and not pushing rents that hard. Mike Curless : But it\u2019s not a perfect sign. And certainly, the numbers from quarter-to-quarter and move around, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do. What we\u2019re trying to do is be tougher on rents. By the way, no matter how tough we are on rents, we can\u2019t charge above market rents. So obviously, these are market rents that tenants are pay. It's just that they're higher than what we thought previously. Hamid Moghadam : The only comment that I would make with respect to calendar year 2017 is that occupancy probably going to stay relatively flat, certainly going into the fourth quarter and even trend up a bit. And the reason is that we really have very little to lead -- very little role. Mike Curless : We only have 4% of role. Hamid Moghadam : So U.S. is more of a long term cadence about where occupancies might go over a period of time. Operator : And our next question comes from Tom Catherwood with BTIG. You may begin. Tom Catherwood : Circling back to USLF and the strategic capital business. When it comes to rebalancing your funds, what is the trigger? Are you able to time the rebalancing to match fund new investments, or do we see a gap between rebalancing and putting those funds to work? Hamid Moghadam : Well, we try to match it with investment needs. I mean, certainly, in a place like USLF is today with 27% ownership and -- by the way it's 27 on a big number, I mean that's a $9 billion fund now. So 27% of that is 12 points higher than our 15% where we want to be. So as opportunities come up and we need the capital that's how we dollar cost average out of that fund. By the way, if people think we know how to top-tick that stuff and be really through to that doing that, we don't. I mean it's much more of a strategically driven decision than valuation driven on the last margin. I mean, generally in the next couple of quarters, we're going to be pulling that capital out. And by the way, there's a lot of demand for people who want to invest in that fund. So I think those two things meet well. Mike Curless : And mechanically it's within one quarter. We can execute the redemptions on the quarter. Hamid Moghadam : Yes, from when we want to take a quarter to do it. Operator : And our next question comes from Craig Mailman with KeyBanc. You may begin. Craig Mailman : Just one quick follow-up, I'm not sure I'm thinking about this right on same-store here, if only 4% rolling. I mean, can you pull forward a meaningful amount of expirations from '18 to keep the trajectory on same-store on the GAAP base? Or is that the fall off into the back half of the year? And does that just mean that the spread between GAAP and cash widens, or does cash trend down follow it as well? Tom Olinger : From a same store perspective, as Gary said, we don't have a lot to place to same-store. The really only variable on same-store in the second half is really going to be on the margin with occupancy, that\u2019s what\u2019s still little role each time the vast majority of what's going to get -- what's going to go in service. So that's happening. I think when you think about the same-store in the second half for our midpoint is going to be 4.8%. And when you think about that number that has all rent change. The first half of this year and prior years, we've seen a boost in our same-store from occupancy gains. Occupancies are now leveling off. So it's all about rent change. So when you think about \u201918 rents, same-store should accelerate, because as Hamid said, we have built up in-place to market is -- that gap is wider, which means our rent change on role in '18 is going to be higher than our rent change in role in '17, that's gapping out. So that has to mean our same-store NOI will be higher in '18 than we're going to see in the back half of 2017. So that's really what's going on. Hamid Moghadam : And surely we will pull some leases into the last quarter of leasing like we always do. By the way, the reason the 4% is 4% is because we've already dealt with a lot of those vacancies that by the way is rolled over, and been additive to that 4%. Tom Olinger : And so don\u2019t be surprised if you see leasing volume be slower in the second half of the year, because we\u2019re going really from now on, we\u2019re working on 2018 lease renewals. Operator : And our next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. You may begin. Jamie Feldman : Two quick follow ups, one is, looks like you had a spike in turnover cost on leases signed. Can you talk about what happened there during the quarter? And then also you commented that UK market is cold slightly. Can you just talk about expectations for the UK going forward, and what's driving the pull back? Eugene Reilly : So basically we just had a very high percentage of leases take places in the U.S., the turnover costs are higher. On this metric, I would just point out that over the years, \u201816 to \u201917, our turnover cost as a percentage of the lease value is really how we look at it, has increased. But it's down between 50 and 100 basis points in '14 and '15. So we actually feel pretty good about the trajectory there. Gary Anderson : Hamid mentioned in his remarks that the UK was moderating a little bit, what is really referencing our market vacancy rates. So if you look at the market vacancy rate today in the UK, it's sitting at 5.9%, that\u2019s pretty good. It's actually fallen 50 basis points from a year ago. But in this specific quarter, it actually backed up by 20 basis points. So we had a light leasing quarter. So that\u2019s really the comment that we're making. What does it mean to our portfolio, literally nothing. We're sitting at about, well, we're sitting at 100% occupancy. Last quarter, we were at 99.5% occupied. We still have long-term leases there, very little role. I candidly wish we had more role because that is one of the markets in Europe where we are significantly under rented to the tune of 10% or 11%. So no bad news for us, but I guess what we\u2019re trying to say is let's watch closely what happens with respect to net absorption in the third quarter and what happens with market vacancy rates in the UK. Operator : And our last question comes from Sumit Sharma with Morgan Stanley. You may begin. Sumit Sharma : Hamid, you mentioned it was difficult to acquire land and you mentioned there are challenges of that land and such. So to which I would like to point you to this asset class, called malls. So did you guys -- would you guys buy them all on portfolio falls, or did you buy a mall anyway anytime? Hamid Moghadam : I think that\u2019s a lot of question. But as you, probably when you were in high school, we actually invested in malls and in the retail sector and in '99 for that business. But all things aside, there is got to be lots of stages of grief between realizations dealing with the changing values. We can\u2019t afford to buy -- first of all, there are lots of good malls and they\u2019ll do well and I don\u2019t want to be negative one really good malls. But there are certainly some power centers and malls that should be there and they\u2019re two anchor malls and they could be great logistics land. I think the value expectations of the owners and the realities of the economics of our business are pretty far and far. I think it will take a couple of years with those expectations and realities to match up. But I venture before too long. You\u2019ll see some still anchor Class B malls converted into logistics buildings, that is not too farfetched at all and we're definitely looking at some of them. I think that was the last question. And again, thank you for taking the time to be at our call and we look forward to talking to you in the coming months. Take care. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Morgan Michael Bilerman - Citi Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience and standing by. And welcome to the Duke Realty Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode, and later there'll be an opportunity for your question. [Operator Instructions] Just a brief reminder, today's conference is being recorded. And I'd now like to turn the conference to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Ron Hubbard. Ron Hubbard : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Jim Connor, Chairman and CEO; Mark Denien, CFO; and Nick Anthony, Chief Investment Officer. Before we make our prepared remarks, let me remind you that statements we make today are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For more information about those risk factors, we would refer you to our December 31, 2016, 10-K that we have on file with the SEC. Now for our prepared statement, I'll turn it over to Jim Connor. James Connor : Thanks, Ron and good afternoon, everybody. I'll start out with a few comments on the national industrial markets and then cover our third quarter results. Demand continues to be very strong across the US industrial markets, for the 29 out of the last 30 quarters, we've had demand out pace supply. Nationally we saw 61.5 million square feet of net absorption. Third quarter completions totaled 50.8 square feet, resulting in vacancy dropping another 10 basis points to 4.5%. Year-to-date net absorptions are 160 million square feet with completions totaling 144 million square feet. We expect net absorption to finish well ahead of supply by 10 million to 22 million square feet for 2017. This continued strong demand will push expected equilibrium to mid 2018 at the earliest. Each sellers' market fundamentals coupled with the strength of our regional operating teams contributed to a robust 5.9 million square feet of leasing for the quarter. Some of the more notable lease transactions were with customers such as XPO Logistics, Ford Motor Company, Valvoline, GELS Logistics, International Paper and Siemens. Of particular note is our continued success and leasing recently completed speculated projects, most notable is the 628,000 square foot lease with XPO Logistics in the Lehigh Valley, taking 100% of the new project placed in service. With the strong leasing activity and our stabilized industrial portfolio occupancy at 98%, we continue to be able to push rent as indicated by our rent growth on new and renewed leases of roughly 16%. We reported 2.2% growth in same property net operating income for the quarter. Same property analog for the nine months ended September 30 was 3.9%. Occupancy in the same property fuller properties actually declined 30 basis points from the previous period quarter of 97.7%. The previously disclosed hhgregg bankruptcy had a roughly 80 basis point drag on same store net operating income for the quarter. We have one lease signed of the three hhgregg spaces, totaling 738,000 feet and the second and third lease executions are eminent. I'm happy to report that we were able to grow rents and extend lease terms in all three spaces. On the development side of our business, momentum continues to be very strong. During the third quarter we generated $230 million of starch across five projects totaling 3.8 million square feet, that are 54% pre-leased in the aggregate. The new development starts including a build-to-suit project in Dallas with Wacker.com [ph], a 65% pre-leased project in Indianapolis with a major 3PL that is subsequent to the end of the quarter signed an additional lease bringing the building to 100% and two speculated projects in eastern Pennsylvania and Columbus Ohio. One additional notable development start was a 737,000 expansion tied to a recently acquired 794,000 square foot facility in the Inland Empire market. Our client D\u00e9cor Outdoor Corporation executed the lease for 100% of the space. We continue to see strong activity in the development pipeline and are confident to close our 2017 in strong fashion and optimistic about 2018. Our overall development pipeline at quarter end has 21 projects under construction, totaling 11.1 million square feet and has a projected 696 million in stabilized cost at our share. These projects are 63% pre-leased in the aggregate and our margins on this development pipeline continue to be in the 20% to 25% range. Now, let me turn it over to Nick Anthony to cover acquisition and disposition activity for the quarter. Nick Anthony : Thanks, Jim. We had a very active quarter on both acquisitions and dispositions. I'll start with dispositions. Building dispositions totaled 301 million in the third quarter, including seven medical office buildings and three suburban office properties in Indianapolis, which completed our exit of the Indianapolis office market. After these transactions there are two remaining medical office properties, one of which should close this year. Turning to acquisitions, we closed 390 million during the quarter, including 156,000 square foot facility in the middle and sub market of New Jersey, two facilities in southern California totaling 1 million square feet in the mid count in Inland Empire west markets and one facility totaling 300,000 square feet in Chicago. In addition to these properties, we also closed the first tranche and agreement to ultimately acquire a 10 building two land parcel portfolio in some of the nation's best sell markets from Bridge Development Partners, a transaction that was in the media three weeks ago. The first tranche closed at the end of September and consisted of five leased up facilities, with two in southern California, two in south Florida and one in northern New Jersey, all of which totaled 290 million and 1.7 million square feet and are 71% pre-leased in aggregate. The remaining five buildings to be acquired in the Bridge portfolio comprised 1.8 square feet with the total at just under $300 million. All are located in northern New Jersey and are expected to close later this quarter. These remaining five products are showing just under 70% leased. The portfolio also includes two land parcels of undeveloped land in northern New Jersey, Midland and New York sub markets, for a total purchase price of 62 million upon which construction of two additional properties will commence later this year or early next year. The entire portfolio, when construction on the two land parcels is completed, will ultimately total 4.3 million rentable square feet with a total investment of slightly under $700 million. We agreed to the terms of the acquisition in April, at which point the properties were 58% leased in total. After assuming leasing responsibilities in July this year, we executed additional leases to increase the portfolio to 69% leased. In addition, we believe that rental rates have continued to increase while cap rates have also further compressed. Finally, I should note the definitive and future leasing prospects involve in the lease escalators at 3% and couple of long term market [indiscernible] produced favorable long term total returns. I'll now turn it over to Mark Denien to cover our earnings results and balance sheet activity. Mark Denien : Thanks, Nick. Good afternoon, everyone. Core FFO was $0.30 per share for the third quarter of 2017, compared to $0.32 for the second quarter of 2017. The expected and temporarily dilutive impact of selling our medical office properties was fully reflected in the third quarter. We continue to use disposition pros fees to reduce indebtedness, paying off $149 million of debt in the third quarter, which included the previously announced repayment of $129 million, 6.7% unsecured notes that were originally scheduled to mature in 2020. We have significant built in capacity to fund our growth over the near and immediate term. In the near term, we have $513 million of proceeds from our medical office dispositions holding us grow, which should be used in the next couple of months to fund the acquisitions Nick just mentioned along with development activities, while completing tax deferred 1031 exchange transactions. Over the longer term, we have $426 million of notes receivable from these property sales, due to mature over the next three years to provide a source of funding for future development or acquisitions. They are currently at leverage levels that are much better than our credit ratings would indicate and have the capacity and intention to fund our growth with incremental debt. Our debt ratio is slowly rising back to pre-MOB sell levels and high triple-B levels by the end of 2018. I am also pleased to announce that a few weeks ago, we renewed our $1.2 billion unsecured credit facility and a 5 basis point reduction in our borrowing rate and a term extension to January of 2022, which provides further financing flexibility. Given our optimistic outlook, for long term AFFO growth and given our excellent balance sheet position, yesterday, we were pleased to announce $0.01 per share of 5.3% increase in our regular quarterly dividend. Even with this increase, our AFFO quarter ratio remains at a very considerable level of approximate 70%. Lastly, we plan to finalize and announce our special dividend by late November or early December and expect it to be within the range of previously communicated estimates. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Jim. James Connor : Thanks, Mark. Let me re-emphasize once again how pleased we are having monetized the MOB portfolio and redeploying the capital into very high quality strategically well located industrial business, including the Bridge portfolio. As we stated a few times before, the blended stabilized yield we are achieving on the acquisitions, approximates the MOB dispositions cap rate. When combined with the proceeds being used to fund our development pipeline at significantly higher yield, our total redeployment will be highly accretive to FFO with better risk adjusted growth prospects. We expect to have the majority MOB proceeds reinvested by year end with an under levered balance sheet to fund the substantial portion of our growth in 2018. Lastly, I am pleased that our overall strong performance has allowed us to raise our quarterly dividend by 5.3%. This is the third consecutive year we are increasing our dividend in excess of 5%. We'll now open up the lines to the audience, we would ask that you keep the dialogue to one question or perhaps two short questions and of course you are always welcome to get back in the queue. With that we'll take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] our first question comes from the line of Michael Carroll. Your line is open. Michael Carroll : Yes thanks, can you guys talk a little bit about the company's acquisitions strategy going forward. After the completion of the Bridge portfolio and as we move into 2018 and beyond, will you remain aggressive acquiring assets or do you just want to redeploy the MOB disposition proceeds? James Connor : Well, Mike, we're always looking for value added acquisitions offered at acquisition opportunities. I think, given the cap rates have continued to compress, you'll likely see a slowdown in 2018. We are not giving guidance just yet, but I think logically as long as our development pipeline continues to be as large it is, and we can create substantially higher margins. I think you'll see us scale back a little on the acquisitions side, continue to look for vale add place, but try and fund most of the funnel, most of the proceeds into development opportunities. Michael Carroll : Okay, then what's the lease up expectations on completing these acquisitions of the development projects, does that going to - how many - how long is it going to take? James Connor : Yeah Mike, we generally underwrite around a year on average to lease up our spec element and/or spec acquisitions, I would tell you over the past 12 months or so, just given market conditions, we've been doing a lot better than that, but when we do or disclose underwriting yields, we're generally averaging about a year forl lease up. Michael Carroll : Thanks. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Manny Korchman. Your line is open. Manny Korchman : Yeah Jim, just looking at the sort of lease roll, how much harder do you think you can push lease roll over's, even at the expanse of retention? James Connor : Manny, that's a very good topic around here, I think we like many of our peers had said, we are going to continue to try and push even more at the expense of some our retention. We were at about 70% this quarter, 70.1 I think, which is down a little bit for us. But I think in reality when you got basically 4.5% vacancy across the country, there aren't a lot of alternatives like everybody is - I think the opportunity to put up some pretty good rent growth numbers, so we keep pushing. Manny Korchman : That was all I had. Thank you. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Ki Bin Kim. Your line is open. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks, good morning everyone or good afternoon. I had a couple of quick questions on your capital deployment. So, what are the things that's driving you to buy the key closer markets and I know, that's not a specific to Duke and other guys are doing it. But, what about buying in LA or New Jersey at mid to high four cap raisers, that's much more appealing versus buying something like in Chicago or Atlanta or Indianapolis at higher cap rate. James Connor : Well, Ki Bin, there's a couple of reasons, let me answer I think your second point first which is Chicago or Dallas or Atlanta, we've been in those markets for a substantial period of time and we have a very large possession approximately 15 million square feet in each of those markets. We much rather redeploy our capital there into development, where we are making substantially better margins, we've got land and development teams on the ground there. One of the things that we identified as our need to grow in these Tier 1 high barrier markets and that's really the region you'll see us focusing our investment dollars in those markets. And those are the markets that will consistently give you, the highest rent growth and the lowest occupancy just simply because of the barriers to entry. And we found that opportunity in the Bridge portfolio and a couple of the other assets that we've acquired this year, to do just that, to redeploy capital into really good, brand new, high quality state of the art industrial in three high barrier locations. And it's very unusual to buy a portfolio of that size and not have to get some second, third tier markets. So, when the opportunity presented itself, the timing lined up really well with our MOB sale and we decided to step up aggressively. And as Nick alluded to in his comments, from the time we've shaken hands in April of this year, we continue to see cap rates compress and we continue to see rents grow. So, my expectation is at the end of the day we'll beat our projected underwriting when we get these buildings, all these buildings in service and all these buildings built and fully leased up. Ki Bin Kim : Okay, and if I look at your lease expiration schedule, compared to peers obviously a little bit lower, and some where it does create a little more challenge in terms of keeping up the things for NOI grow phase right because you just have less expiry. As part of the reason you have less expiration, just because lots of assets that you own today are development related assets, were the lease term is originally just much longer or have you guys still signing a longer leases, so that you might be able to change more proactively. James Connor : Your observation is absolutely correct, in a rising market like this, we would love to have a little bit more space available to be able to push rents, as some of our peers do. But you are absolutely right, when you look at the makeup of our portfolio which is primarily larger bulk buildings, many which would run as a result of our development activity, ten year leases in the case of our million square foot facilities 15 year leases. We are happy to lock in that income with goods annual rent escalations built in, but the downside of that is, it times like this, you don't have as much roll. That's unfortunate. We've talked about that at meetings and conversations with our investors in the past. We are working diligently to engage anybody we can and early renew people and continue to push rents. And I think our guys have done a nice job at that. But I think, on the defensive, this portfolio, will outperform our peers over the long haul because we've got a lot less downside risk, given the quality of the buildings, given the length of the lease term and the annual escalations we've got built in. So, little tough today in the short term, but long term will be fine. Nick Anthony : Yeah Ki Bin, I would just add one more thing to that. The tenants that we have in these newer bigger buildings, generally want the longer lease terms as well, so they will simply follow these terms and most certainly not to outturn our people to those [indiscernible] right now, thinking of the cycle. Ki Bin Kim : Yeah, I get that. You can win on both sides. Alright, thank you. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Jeremy Metz. Your line is open. Jeremy Metz : Hey guys, Jim I just want to go back quickly in acquisition, you mentioned obviously, you signed the Bridge portfolio during April, and since that time you've seen a lot, better rent growth, Nick mentioned it earlier, so just managing to put an offside buyers on those expected yield. So, I guess is that the right way, to think about this, in current expectations or maybe just in-conservative at this point, may be settling how much rank guards were you underwriting to get to those yields that's so they are actually higher now, given what we've seen on rent side. James Connor : Well, so let me clarify couple of points, when we agreed with DEO and we underwrite the DEO, the terms of the DEO and our underwriting is frozen at that time. So, as we said, we agreed to terms on the Bridge portfolio in April, and those are the reported numbers that we put out. We know that the rents have continued to grow, and our internal expectations. All set, we will sign those leases at higher rates. We are not re-publicizing or re-evaluating the underwriting., we're going with the original underwriting that we have, which is why sitting here today we are fairly comfortable we're going to beat those expectations by leasing it up sooner or leasing it up at higher rents. Nick Anthony : Yeah, in the 300,000 square feet that we have is so far has done about that performer, so that is optimistic. James Connor : And that consistent journey you probably underwrite in respective element as well. And we do our course effective element; we also come to space with base run, we don't think future anticipate rental growth in those yield and we hope we get it and in often cases, we do the best we have in underwriting. Nick Anthony : Which is still the case on the two land parcels. Jeremy Metz : Very good, appreciate the clarity guys. Thanks. Operator : Next, we have the line of John Guinee. Your line is open. John Guinee : Great, I am looking at your balance sheet, Jim and Mark and there must be a typo, because you are down to a $140 million of undeveloped land, and another 27 non-strategic land. Are those accurate numbers? James Connor : Yes, they are John, I think in total, we are under 200 million - for the first time anybody around here can remember and you might think that inventory is getting too low. We've actually acquired a 120 million of land this year; we've just put more of it into production than we originally anticipated, so, in most markets, we are out looking to take down additional land. John Guinee : And when this all set and done, how is land - land is plug figure on any development budget? What are people underwriting their development pro forma in order to arrive at a land value, these days? James Connor : Well, John I guess it depends, who's doing the underwriting and what their alternate goal is. You know, we are trying to create as much value for the shareholders over the long term as possible. If you are a small local developer, that's looking to sell the building either on substantial completion or lease it, you can probably live on much than a margin, so, it's all driven by the expected margin you want to receive at the end of the day, which you can prepare to pay for the land. And, we've commented before, land is more challenging today and it's more expensive and the entitlement and approval processes is more costly and time killing. So, we have to look at a lot of land sites and do a lot of homework for everyone that we do require and ultimately put into production, because there's a lot of challenging sites out there, that you can't opt out. John Guinee : Yeah, the reason I asked the question and then on wealth, is that your development yield for '17 are still 68, 66 cash and 7 GAAP, which seems extraordinarily high, given what we are hearing is going on in the land evaluation world. Is this employing legacy land or is this all new land recently purchased at market? James Connor : Well, John thank you for the compliment, we start to think that was a compliment. Well, it's a combination of both, there is some legacy land in there, we probably had on the books, could be as long as 10 years I suppose, but a lot of the land is land is that we had just bought, that virtually never hits the box, because its acquired, it's put into production, inside of the same quarter. And, you know, we've talked about, points about this in years gone by, but, you know part of our goals is stand around with not to mass of $ 1 billion land portion, but to take land down in much smaller pieces and put it into production. And, if somebody wants to buy a piece of land and they can't commit to putting a building a production inside the first year, then our attitude is you don't really need the land. So, it's combination of having change to the culture and some development activities by our local teams that I may have forgotten. John Guinee : Great, thank you, talk to you next quarter. Operator : Next, we have the line of Jamie Feldman. Your line is open. Jamie Feldman : Thank you, Jim you had commented on the equilibrium getting pushed out to sometime in '18, do you have high visibility on that number or is it just because it's next year not this year. And how do you talk about the risks, could it even be '19 at this point? James Connor : It certainly could be, but our visibility is the same as yours. We get market data from the, all the service companies CBRE, JLL & Cushman plus the market reconnaissance we get from our own development and leasing teams around the country. I'm looking at you know, demand exceeding supply by 10 to 25 billion square feet this year, looking at what the quarter by quarter numbers had been. I think, while we see the gap narrow from three years ago, that's why I'm saying, I think that will be the earliest it will be in mid 18. But, you know if we can actually do something right, and we as the collective we in this country and we can actually maybe stimulate GDP growth and keeping the subtle going on a little longer. You're absolutely right; it could easily be '19 or '20. And another point that I've made about equilibrium, equilibrium isn't necessarily a bad thing particularly when you reach equilibrium at 4.5% vacancy. Jamie Feldman : Okay and then maybe your question we get a lot is just where are the restrictions on new development? Can you just, I know that your conversation changes now, to talk about the challenges of getting land, but, maybe just a frame how hardly it really is, to find new land sites, and get development in the process or maybe that's eased up more recently, if you could talk about that? James Connor : No, I said we wouldn't tell you it's eased up, I think everybody is encouraged by the strong numbers that everybody continues to report quarter after quarter, and the market dynamics that we are seeing out there, continued absorption. You know from many of our customers that, there are real shortages of available stays around the country. So, people are continuing to build which is why you'll see the supplies of equation probably in the year and the 190 may be ups up to 200 millions of forfeit of new supply this year. But the demands are it's just significantly up pacing it, and our guys do a pretty good job of diligently being outsourcing land and being able to put that into production pretty quickly. We also, internally we do, we also get a jumpstart, we got infrastructure and pads and things like that, so that we show it at the relevant time, up on some projects. And that's, those are some of the things that keep us more competitive on the building the suite as opposed to some of our working building competitors that have to go out to acquire site. You know, we've got site that's ready to go, designed pad built and we can deliver building inside of a 120 days. Jamie Feldman : Okay thank you. Operator : And next we have the line of Eric Frankel. Your line is open. Eric Frankel : Thank you, I was hoping to get a dig into the Bridge profile more detail, I know, you talked of the stabilized yields the portfolio, replicating the cap rate on the medical office portfolio sale? Is that the cap rate that your team quoted when that tells the price, worth the buyer quoted? James Connor : No, we have our own sale numbers Eric. So, each one is a fourth sense, we have a watch at great news Eric. Eric Frankel : Understood, understood thank you, I appreciate that. And then the 70% previous what I didn't appreciate when the sales, acquisitions was announced was that include the two land purchases, the ones that the ones that will get without, I can understand why they are in pretty tight market. Is that included in the pre-leasing number though, the two building to be built? Nick Anthony : No, Eric. The land parcels are not included in that previous numbers. Eric Frankel : It's not, okay but effectively more at 40% to 50% call it pre-lease or maybe more than 50% pre-lease if you include that. Nick Anthony : Perhaps this land parcel is not placed in service until the fourth quarter of next year. Eric Frankel : Okay, okay so, and is there the yield numbers for those are not included in the medical office comparable year? James Connor : They are not included. We are just - they are just like any other portfolio land, that we would go out and which we are doing overtime now and then starting development right away. So, that'll be in our development numbers, once they get started. Eric Frankel : Okay, I think the only other resource to confusion is related to the development land as we use the map, and how much we are allocating to both tranches. I'm getting to an estimated value of roughly a $185 million for those two developed parcels and you're paying $62 million of land that looks like a $140 per square foot for the construction cost. So, I'm just trying to understand about the value number and not the construction cost number, that 185 that I'm computing, and if my numbers are just completely screwing? Mark Denien : It's a value on the land and construction cost on the construction cost. Eric Frankel : Construction cost seems expensive, a $140 to an affordable square foot, is there like a lot of inside work we have to do, or it's just a \u2013. Nick Anthony : Yes, there's a lot of side work and these are in very tight markets, one of them in the New York suburb and the other one is Midland on a very short note. Eric Frankel : Right a bit construction causes, and that's different generally between those areas in any developed country, I'd like also some extraordinary light mannerism or something. But is there something there that I'm missing? Nick Anthony : But there's also side work involved. Eric Frankel : Okay, okay. I will jump back in the queue, I'm sure you'll have a lot more questions, thank you. Operator : Next, we have the line of Rich Anderson. Your line is open. Rich Anderson : Thanks, good afternoon, on the hhgregg you mentioned you got one of the three one of the 748, and you mentioned also there's been 80 basis point head to the same store number. Jim, you mentioned also, that you relieved at higher rates, can you give some color on how much higher and how long those lines? Does that mean in 80 that will have a full reversal of the same store impact, such that it won't be an 8 basis point head but maybe a 100 basis point opportunity or upside? James Connor : Well, let me try to cover part of that, which I think we'll have a full reversal for the second half of '18 because essentially we are looking at the last half of '18 will cover no rent from those buildings. And we got leases either signed or out signature right now, such that rents will come in from all the spaces like early '18. So, when you get into the last half of '18, you will recover all of that 80 basis points decline, then you should have a little bit of decline. But on a full year basis, you are going to be pretty close so to even. So, we did have five months with the rent from the hhgregg buildings in the first half of this year. I would say the wrinkles on those three deals, we haven't got a couple of them signed yet, they're out for signature, but it's going to be pretty close to the average rent falls closing on everything else in our portfolio, we haven't run so close. Rich Anderson : Okay, alright got you. Second short question is on the special dividend, you said in the range of what you said, could you say if you are tethering towards the $0.70 or the $1.15 based on what's going on within the company? Mark Denien : If you have an hour and a half to listen to our catch skies [ph] - Rich Anderson : I do, go ahead, I am ready, good. Mark Denien : I am joking; I think it's going to be probably pretty close to the middle over range. I would call it middle range, or may be lower half, but at least, we still got some moving pieces out there from these 1031 exchanges, which is you know, pretty high capital that what we have lined up, that's going to happen, but we just need some passage of time, to get a couple of things knocked off the list. And then hopefully, later in November we'll be able to disclose something, but I think it will be not too far from the middle point range. Rich Anderson : Okay, great thanks, very much. Operator : Next, we'll go on to Michael Mueller. Your line is open. Michael Mueller : Yeah hi, just a quick question on Bridge. The 70% pre-lease number when does most of that become rent paying and/or start to impact the financials? Nick Anthony : A lot of it is - now, there will be a couple of months of burn outs, but by the end of the year, most of them will paying rent on 70%. Michael Mueller : Got it, and then what's the anticipation for Tranch 2, when that comes on? Nick Anthony : We're actually closed on two developments yesterday and we expect to close the rest in the fourth quarter. James Connor : Yeah towards I would say, Michael, towards the end of the fourth quarter. Michael Mueller : Got it, okay, that was it. Thank you. Operator : Next, we have the line of Richard Schaller [ph]. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hey good afternoon guys, just looking at the assets that you've completed on the development pipeline, high quality big box assets, what are your thoughts about taking some of these to market with cap rates compressing, are you guys still going to focus on similar non-core industrial asset sales. James Connor : Hello Richard, I'll start and then Nick can chime in, so historically we've got a bit of that, we've taken some chips of the table so to speak, we've sold you know couple of the big Amazon deals and some others, with all this possessions we've done this year and having to pay special dividend. You know we are really looking to minimize that, we are in the final stages of putting together the disposition target list for next year. And again, you know managing that against, redeployment of capital and the special dividends. So, for a miracle we can give you any local call around the other markets or things like that. Nick Anthony : Yeah, they put a lot of value creation on the development pipeline, but for the most part, we are just looking at it, in improved in non-strategic asset account forward in the market place and frankly se are seeing great pricing invests for non-strategic markets as a well. Unidentified Analyst : That's helpful, thanks guys and on last quick question for me, I noted ion the real estate alert this week that CABED [ph] is bringing 21 million square foot, warehouse portfolio, this prices may be 1.8 billion or larger? Is it something that you guys are taking a look at or is that just too big, on the acquisitions focus on the development pipeline from here? James Connor : Well, we look at everything obviously, just to stay abreast of what's going on in the marketplace and I would tell you given our size, I don't personally I don't think it's too big. I think when you look at the makeup of the markets and what percentage of the access are in the high barrier tier 1 market and the tier 1 markets, it' about maybe 25%, I know the high barrier tier 1was 17%, it's probably not the best fit for us. By coincidence there are some assets in there that that we sold them in the last five years, I don't generally like to buy stuff back at premiums. So, it's probably not a real good idea. Unidentified Analyst : Sure, sounds good, thanks guys. Operator : [Operator instructions] we'll now go back to line of Manny Korchman. Your line is open. Michael Bilerman : Hey, it's Michael Bilerman, here. So, Jim, I don't know, maybe a theoretical I guess it's a theoretical question, but if you impact April, you weren't going to plan on sudden medical office and Bridge portfolio came to you, would you've done it at that pricing and issued equity to fund it? James Connor : I think so Michael, absolutely. I mean, if you look at what we're strategically trying to do, grow in the high barrier tier 1 markets and quality of this portfolio and what's happened since then absolutely we buy it. Michael Bilerman : And then would you say the same thing going forward, and using your equity currency and issuing equity to buy assets or continue that as a, I recon as a catalog portfolio that does not mean, but given the cap rate environment, there's probably a lot more stuff that's going to come out of the good work given the pricing levels especially your office [indiscernible]. Would you entertain using your cost of equity? You sold the medical office at unbelievable price and exited out of that, and used that as your proceeds to rotate, de-lever, give money back to shareholders and invest in these Bridge assets. I'm just curious how do you think - what your cadence will be in using your common equity to further this expansion? James Connor : Michael, we will certainly look at it, we are trading at a premium to NAV, we like generally where the price is. I liked it little better two weeks ago then this morning, but generally if the quality assets and the markets that they are in, fit our profile and we are comfortable that we're not overpaying and that we could lease for a long term and continue to grow rents with annual escalations, we would certainly think about it. Michael Bilerman : And then did Stockert actually attend the board meeting yesterday or you put-on, as he physically gone through a process? James Connor : Is this one of those highly theoretical questions? Michael Bilerman : No, no I'm just, I'm just curious - I mean, I'm curious what his mind set is? Having lost the company seventeen years ago, right, coming back in, his perception is what it was versus what it is, is just a really interesting thing to have? And I'm sure if Ray Weeks came back, he would have a pretty interesting view of where this combined company is, sitting by the office assets, but. James Connor : Yes, David did attend the meeting; our crack is when we are bringing a new director on, is we do invite them to that first meeting even though they are not officially on the board, they don't have the opportunity to vote, but we do get them inducted in, so Dave in fact was here yesterday and it's great to welcome him back. He's been gone for 17 years. Michael Bilerman : And is there anything, any sort of insight that he was able to bring to the table, having the perspective - having been in the business a long time ago and sort of seeing where the company in the industry is today? James Connor : We brought Dave on not because of his history with the company 17 to 20 years ago, but for his more recent experience running post, his M&A experience, his perspective on corporate governance, so that's really what we look at in terms of Dave's skills to round at our board. Is to give us a little more public company real state CEO perspective and we think he's going to be a great addition. Michael Bilerman : Last question, any purchase options, how many sort of exists within the portfolio? Was that some name should be mindful of at all? James Connor : Very, very few, I would tell you that we probably had about one a year exercise for the last three years. So, we are generally not good at giving purchase options. Michael Bilerman : Yeah, I didn't know if any of these merchant developers may have given that right - and from the leases, [indiscernible] you've inherited more? James Connor : No, that really impedes the value for a buyer, ourselves included, if somebody's built that into the deal, so we and most of our competitors find that pretty difficult, find that pretty hard. Operator : And next we have the line of Jamie Feldman. Your line is open. Jamie Feldman : Thank you, just a follow-up here. So, you're looking at your guidance for 700 million to 9000 million of starts in '17. When you look around your markets, do you think that's the number you can hit again next year? James Connor : I think if market fundamentals are consistent next year with what they did this year, and what our outlook is, yeah, I think that's realistic. If you look a little higher, then our last few years we've been running probably closer to 700, the last few years. But we've been able to rent a few more build-to-suits and our leasing has been a little bit better than we expected. So, I think that's why we were able to increase our guidance at the July meeting. That helps. Jamie Feldman : Yeah, definitely and what do you - of the starts you have this year, what percentage is the build-to-suit and do you think that goes up or down next year. James Connor : I don't have that handy Jamie, we just track the per-lease percentage of build-to-suits partially pre-lease buildings and then leasing is done while the buildings are under construction is included in that 63%. My guess of it is probably 40% to 45%. Jamie Feldman : Anything that's sustainable? James Connor : What's that? Jamie Feldman : Anything that's sustainable into next year? James Connor : Yeah, we are, you go back and look at the last three or four years, the reason our preleasing percentage has been as high as it has and higher than most of our peers is because of our build-to-suit activity. That's good land and the quality of the people that we've got on the ground, as opposed to spec development. We've consistently told our investors, we are going to keep that pre-leasing percentage about 50% and being able to do build-to-suits and substantially pre-lease buildings certainly helps that. Jamie Feldman : Okay and then thinking about the building blocks for next year, the color on hhgregg was helpful, but did you say 3% advance for the Bridge portfolio or across the entire portfolio, on a cash basis. James Connor : Jamie, that's consistent with both today, that's what we are getting on Bridge, that's what we're getting really everywhere today. Our existing portfolio is close to the 22 in the quarter, the legacy leases within our portfolio, we average about two quarter, obviously that average is trending up a little every day as we keep building leases at three. Jamie Feldman : And what would you say is the blend for the entire portfolio, closer to like 275? James Connor : No, no right now, it's a two and a quarter today, so it all depends on leasing activity from here until whenever you're looking at it, but on a 130 million square feet, it will take a while to move at 75 basis points. Jamie Feldman : Got it okay and then what do you think your mark-to-market is for your '18 expiration? James Connor : For '18, it's probably going to be somewhere to what we are at today, in fact in the high teens. Jamie Feldman : Oaky and then Ray, you feel like you are pretty fully occupied at this point, right? Unidentified Company Representative : I think so, it's hard. As Jim said, our same property occupancy went down to 97.5% or whatever it is, it went down 30 basis points. So, I think on what I would call that stabilized portfolio, 124, but we do have a lot of upsides in the newer development and acquisition properties. That's just putting our overall occupancy down. So, I think we are a little bit different than a lot of peers, only about 80% to 83% of our NOIs in that same property pool. We had a lot bigger pool of these newer properties to have a lot of NOI outside. So, I wouldn't say we are full up on occupancy overall, we're probably full up on occupancy on our current same property. That makes sense. Jamie Feldman : Yeah that makes a lot of sense. Okay great thank you. Operator : [Operator instructions] we'll next go to the line of Eric Frankel. Your line is open. Eric Frankel : Thank you, I'll try to keep this brief. Just in the same store portfolio, I know the expense growth was pretty meaningful. Can you just comment on that trend and obviously I assume that the rapid new lease and net lease, I can understand that mechanically, how that works with high expanse growth and how it refines to revenue growth in this quarter. Is there a mismatch in terms of timing? James Connor : I didn't hear your first query, so, you're asking about the entries in seeing property expenses? Eric Frankel : Yes, I apologize if they would say it didn't come through. James Connor : No, I just didn't hear. So, it's really mainly around real estate taxes. A little bit of an increase this quarter from assessments as you would expect probably, but on top of that even more of it because of some refunds we got in the prior period. And I would suggest what's driving a pretty big, whatever it is, 4.5% give or take increase in expenses. It's really real estate tax related. The refund over the prior year and upward assessments in the current year has very little impact on overall NOI because all of that is 98% occupancy level give or take, whether it's a refund or pass back to the tenant, it's an increase in expense, we generally get it back from the tenant, so it has very normal impact on NOI. You'll see a revenue number that went up a lot lower than the expense number and that's just a shear factor of the denominator and the expenses being a lot more together, call a million dollar change in expenses divided by the expense number as a lot higher percent in that same million dollar change on a higher revenue number. So, that was the little bit of a disconnect on the percentages, but I would tell you, it was very negligible on overall NOI. Eric Frankel : Okay, I'll keep to one here. Nick, just related to hhgregg, any other tenant credit concerns just in terms of bankruptcy, has anyone - it's essentially lengthy watch list or any other proxy for measuring credit quality that we should know about? James Connor : Well, we have a very expensive for rating the credit and tracking, anybody that will be concerned about. We always wanted, we've talked about this before, is we have a Sirius lease in the Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania and we are all watching Sirius. The good news for us it's the appliance division, which is probably the only division inside the Sirius that makes money. So, we've had them on the watch list, but beyond that we are in really good shape. Eric Frankel : Is it Barnton [ph] in your portfolio though too? James Connor : Barnton is in our portfolio. Eric Frankel : Okay. That's it from me, thanks guys. Operator : At this point, we actually have no further questions here in queue for us. James Connor : I would like to thank everyone for joining the call today. We look forward to re-convening during our fourth quarter and full year call generally scheduled the same time on Thursday February 1, 2018. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference for this afternoon. We thank you very much for your participation and for using our Executive Teleconference service. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom and we\u2019ll get started. Tom Olinger : Thanks, Tracy. Good morning and thank you for joining our fourth quarter earnings call. I will cover the highlights for the quarter, introduce 2018 guidance and then turn the call over to Hamid. We had an excellent quarter and an outstanding 2017. Core FFO was $0.67 per share for the quarter and $2.81 per share for the year, reflecting an increase of more than 9% over 2016. We earned record net promotes of $0.16 per share for the year. Excluding promotes, core FFO was also up 9%. It's worth taking a step back to highlight that over the last four years we delivered a core FFO CAGR of 13% while also deleveraging by 1100 basis points. We leased nearly 170 million square feet in 2017 with more than 42 million square feet in the quarter. Well located logistics product remains mission critical for our customers. Global occupancy at year-end reached an all time high of 97.2%, a sequential increase of 90 basis points. The U.S. led the way with a record occupancy of 98%. In Europe, year-end occupancy reached to 96.6%, up 120 basis points sequentially setting the stage for rental growth in 2018. Notably France was up 340 basis points sequentially. Our share of net effective rent change on rollovers in the quarter was 19%, with the U.S. at nearly 30%. Global rent change was down sequential due to mix with higher leasing in France, Poland and the Central U.S. Our share of net effective same store NOI growth was 4.7% for the full year and 4.1% for the quarter. The quarter came in below expectations due to an expense forecast miss as well as lower than expected average same store occupancy. On the development front we had an extremely productive year creating significant value for our shareholders. I would like to highlight development stabilizations which came in slightly ahead of expectations and had an estimated margin of 29% and value creation of $583 million. 2017 was also an excellent year for our strategic capital business. We combined several ventures reducing the number of vehicles since the merger from 21 to 8, further streamlining our business. We raised $2.9 billion in new capital from investors around the world and grew our third party AUM to $32 billion. Our strategic capital business delivers a durable and consistent revenue stream with 90% of fees coming from long term or perpetual vehicles. Turning to capital markets. During the quarter we used a portion of our excess liquidity to redeem $788 million of near-term bonds. For the full year we lowered look through leverage by 340 basis points to 23.7% on a market capitalization basis. We continue to have significant liquidity of $3.6 billion and remain well protected from movements in foreign currency as we ended the year with more than 94% of our net equity in U.S. dollars. Moving to guidance for 2018 which I will provide on an our share basis. We expect net effective same store NOI growth of between 4% and 5%. This is set in accordance with the new logistics sector definitions that we announced last week. I am proud of our sector for taking leadership on this important initiative. For comparison, our 2017 net effective same store results would have been 4.2% under this new definition. As I had mentioned previously, we had expected this impact to be less than 50 basis points. Cash, same store NOI growth for 2018 should be approximately 100 basis points higher than net effective as the lag from longer lease terms and steeper rent bumps continues to close. Development starts will range between $2 billion and $2.3 billion, roughly in line with 2017. Build-to-suits will comprise about 45% of this volume. Dispositions and contributions will range between $2.3 billion and $2.9 billion. Given broad buyer interest, particularly for larger portfolios, we may elect to accelerate dispositions and effectively close out our remaining non-strategic assets in 2018. I want to point out that the contribution volume includes the expected re-capitalization of Brazil. For strategic capital, net promote income will range between $0.05 and $0.07 for the full year, consistent with prior years there will be a difference in the timing of recognition between promote revenue and its related expenses. We expect to recognize $0.01 of promote expense in each quarter of 2018. From a timing perspective, we expect to recognize roughly two-thirds of the promote revenue in the first quarter. For net G&A, we are forecasting a range between $227 million and $237 million. For perspective, we have held G&A roughly flat over the last five years while growing AUM by more than $14 billion. Related to FX, our 2018 estimated core FFO is fully hedged and we have already hedged most of 2019. We don\u2019t expect any material impact on our operations or earnings as a result of the new tax reform bill. Putting this all together, we expect core FFO to range between $2.85 and $2.95 a share for 2018. Core FFO growth excluding net promote income is expected to be 7%. This growth is particularly strong given further balance sheet delevering. We expect average leverage in 2018 to be approximately 200 basis points lower than last year. For reference, a 100 basis point increase in leverage translates to approximately 1% of core FFO growth. To wrap up, we had a great quarter and year and are entering 2018 with strong momentum. The mark to market of our portfolio currently stands at 14% globally and more than 18% in the U.S. with an upward bias. This positions us for strong operating performance for the next several years. Our best in class balance sheet had significant liquidity and investment capacity to self fund our growth and to capitalize on opportunities as they arise. With that I will turn the call over to Hamid. Hamid Moghadam : Thanks, Tom. I will keep my remarks short as our business and our markets continue on a positive trajectory. Market fundamentals are strong as they have been in my career. In the U.S., occupancy has continued to test new highs and rental growth accelerated in 2017, led by the large coastal markets. Net absorption was healthy last year, although it was constrained below 2016 levels as a result of limited new supply. Market dynamics today are highly favorable to [indiscernible] and should remain so for the foreseeable future. Today about 30% of our global portfolio consists of in-fill assets which are positioned for last touch delivery. In our view and notwithstanding all the market noise, it will be impossible to duplicate such holdings in any scale for late adopters of the now very popular last mile strategy. In Europe, cap rate declines have lifted value significantly. While we expect cap rates to compress even further, we have now reached an inflexion point for rental growth in New York. Fueled by improved conditions on the continent, we expect rents to accelerate for the foreseeable future and narrow the gap with the U.S. The lag in rental recovery in Europe will carry our momentum beyond the inevitable point that the U.S. markets normalize. Looking ahead, there is plenty of gas left in the tank. We are laser focused on capturing rental growth and deploying capital in profitable developments. The mark to market of our portfolio has increased steadily over the last 18 months, which will also extend the runway for continued rental growth. Our scale provides us with attractive capital sourcing and deployment opportunities around the world. We will continue to deliver value by putting our well located land bank to work and by leveraging our unparalleled customer relationships. I will close by saying that our business strategy remains unchanged. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen and our portfolio is uniquely positioned to deliver strong results well into the future. We remain vigilant about unforeseen risks in this environment but are very optimistic about our prospects in 2018 and beyond. I would like to now turn it over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Manny Korchman of Citi. Michael Bilerman : It's Michael Bilerman here with Manny. Tom, in your opening comments you talked about the 4Q same store numbers and you referenced an occupancy miss and expense growth miscalculation -- I can't recall what words you used. Can you just delve a little bit deeper into what those were, what impact they had, and how that reverts into 2018? Tom Olinger : Thanks, Michael. So about half of the difference was due to the fact that we blew in expense forecast by about $2.5 million, which in the fourth quarter, that\u2019s about 60 basis points impact. And again, we blew the expense forecast, we got it right in 2018. So no impact on 2018. The other driver was, same store average occupancy lower than we had expected. We actually had a 10 basis point negative impact of same store occupancy in the fourth quarter. We thought we would see a positive increase. But to give you context, our share of average same store occupancy in the quarter was 96.5% but our ending same store occupancy was at 97.3%. So 80 bps higher. So as you can see, the leasing happened just later than we expected. Operator : Our next question is from Craig Mailman of KeyBanc. Craig Mailman : On the occupancy guide, Tom, just curious how much of that is just conservatism from where you guys ended the year versus maybe your expectations about lower retention from kind of pushing rents even harder in '18. Tom Olinger : Yes. I think it's the latter, Craig. We are going to continue to push rents to get the right long-term economic results and higher same store growth. And we might sacrifice occupancy in the short-term just like you saw in Q4, for getting the right long-term answer. Operator : Our next question is from John Guinee of Stifel. John Guinee : If you look at what's happening in the office world and the retail world, base building and re-leasing CapEx are going up significant and investors awareness of these CapEx numbers are also going up significantly. When you are leasing space, are you providing turnkey TIs, as when TIs are needed. How much money are you putting into the base building, how much money is the tenant putting into the base building? Talk a little bit about your re-leasing cost. Hamid Moghadam : Sure. John, this is Hamid. Let me start and then turn it over to Gene for some color on the specifics. I think the real estate industry generally, for the last 35 years that I have been involved, and that has always gotten CapEx strong. Because I think there is all these weird things that people count as recurring, not recurring, value-enhancing, non-value enhancing. And I think those problems are particularly acute in the sectors you mention. I think probably apartments and industrial are the most straightforward because we don\u2019t have major [indiscernible] rehabs and all those kind of other stuff that goes on. So generally the problem that you raise is a serious problem that AFFO many years ago tried to address but in my opinion didn\u2019t do a very good job on it. So that is the general comment. I would say many of our tenants invest above and beyond our contributions significant improvements. Typically our improvements once the building is second generation, consists of paints and carpet and maybe a little bit of walls moving around in the office portion. Very little in the warehouse space. Now we have customers that may put in nothing about that and there are couple of occasions where our customers are actually using the buildings for data centers and may put at thousand or more dollars a square foot in there. But that\u2019s really not reflected in the rent that we collect. We are not in the business of over improving space at our expense in temporary and specific customized improvements for anybody just to pump up the rent. I just want to be really clear about that. Just to make this really simple, the way I would like to look at CapEx is actually to add up all the CapEx and look at it as a percentage of NOI. And historically in our business that number has been about 12% to 15% depending on where you are in the cycle. Operator : Our next question is from Blaine Heck of Wells Fargo. Blaine Heck : You guys have come a long way derisking and delevering the balance sheet over the past several years and it looks like you plan to continue that process in 2018. As you touched on, that usually comes with lower growth than you could achieve at higher leverage. So how do you guys think about setting the appropriate level of leverage and finding the balance between safety and growth. Hamid Moghadam : So, Blaine, I think when we did the merger and we laid out some balance sheet objectives, that was really where we what the long-term capital structure of the business was going to be. And I think at that time we said we want to have a top three balance sheet in the industry and got a lot of giggles at that point. And here we are now with just under 24% leverage and an A minus rating, which we are happy about. I think the recent declines in 2017 and the projected declines in 2018 in leverage are not something that we are doing consciously to further improve the balance sheet. They are just a byproduct of executing our capital recycling strategy and you can't do that perfectly. So at some point when we are done with disposing of our non-strategic assets, which we expect to have that completed in 2018, our leverage will probably drift up by a few hundred basis points and thereby propelling our growth to where we really want it to be in the long-term. But that totally depends on investment opportunities and the attractiveness of those capital deployment opportunities. Bottom line, our leverage is lower than we planned it to be but that\u2019s consistent with the other aspects of our strategy. Operator : And our next question is from David Rodgers with Baird. David Rodgers : Maybe Tom, I wanted to go back to one of your comments that you made in the prepared comments about accelerating dispositions in non-core assets as the year progresses. It sounds like that\u2019s not a done deal but I would like to know maybe what would get you over the hump of deciding to sell more. Is that a function of perhaps accelerating developments or finding acquisition, or just maybe new supply hitting the markets that you might be worried about. Any additional thoughts please. Tom Olinger : Yes, Dave, there is no humps to get over. Just to put everything in context. We sold $11.6 billion of real estate since the merger. I think that represents a couple of companies added in our sector. So we have been very deliberate and active in the dispositions market, probably more than anybody in the business. We have approximately 1.6 billion of non-strategic assets left. Bottom line, we sold 88% of what we wanted to sell in the non-strategic area. And honestly, the improvement in the markets and the strength of the markets is such that we got a lot of these other non-strategic assets at least up sooner than we thought we would. So I think 2018 is the time to execute that plan. Mike, you want to add any color to that? Mike Curless : Yes, we saw last year, both in Europe and the United States, some of our smaller portfolios were aggregated. There was a lot of buyer interest in some larger portfolios and so we expect that trend to continue this year and we are very optimistic on our ability to execute our sales plan or even slightly more than we projected. Operator : Next question is from Nick Yulico of UBS. Nick Yulico : Hamid, I want to get your latest thoughts on new supply in the U.S. and which markets, if any, you might be concerned about. Hamid Moghadam : Let me do this, let me have Gene start and maybe Chris to provide some color on that. Gene Reilly : So with respect to new supply, right now we would call out probably Dallas, Chicago and Louisville, as having supply in excess of recent demand. And to drill into this a little bit, as we look forward, Chicago kind of concerns us a little bit but construction is way down in Chicago today. So they had 22 million in the pipe a year ago, now they have 9 million square feet. So that speaks to the conservatism we have seen in the few markets since the -- during this economic recovery. Those are the markets we would call out for excess supply. Operator : Our next question is from Jeremy Metz, BMO Capital Markets. Jeremy Metz : Hamid, at this time last year your outlook called for supply demand equilibrium, moderation in rent growth to the mid single digit range. Rents, obviously, far outpaced expectations coming in nearly 10%. And in your portfolio occupancy reached an all time higher at the end of the year, it was above even your expectations at the end of 3Q. And this is all despite the fact you are actively really pushing hard on rents. So it maybe a very simple answer here but are you seeing anything today other than just being one year further into this cycle such that 2018 can be set up for a similar type of better than expected outcome. Hamid Moghadam : Yes. That simple answer is, no, we are not seeing anything different. In fact, markets at this point are stronger than they were last year. Last year, you may remember, there were a couple of markets that we had seen excess supply, including by the way, Chicago, that Gene just mentioned. And we kind of talked about that and warned the market that maybe some of these markets are getting a little soggier. And then as you point out, we ended up getting between 9% rental growth in the U.S. So we clearly got that one wrong. We were too conservative in terms of what happened. But having said that, I mean nobody is going to go and forecast 10% rental growth into the future. We are in unchartered waters. So I think what we are counting on today is a growth rate much less than that and our assumptions and our guidance is based on numbers that are about half as much as big as that this year. But, who knows, it may be higher or lower and we don\u2019t have perfect insight into the future. So, I don\u2019t know, we will see. My hope is that we will even do better. Operator : Our next question is from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Ki Bin Kim : Could we just talk a little bit more about the supply questions. How much do you think new supply actually impacts your portfolio. And I will use this as an example. For example, if you have an asset in Carson and LA by the Port of Long Beach, I wouldn\u2019t think new supply [indiscernible] practically impacts your ability to raise rents in that asset. So if you take that thinking across your larger portfolio, how would you describe the real impact from new supply. Hamid Moghadam : So in some of the markets like the [South Bay] [ph] just to pick the example that you mentioned, it's impossible to add any supply. In fact there is supply coming off and there is negative supply. San Francisco has had negative supply because people are turning [spots] [ph] to build apartments and all that. So there is very little supply there. And what happens is that there is substitution of locations, as people go further out, compromise on some other parameters just to be able to get the space that they need. So let me throw it to Gene for some more color in there. Gene Reilly : So you bring up an interesting point because if we actually look at our strong markets, there are markets with obviously strong demand and great net absorption numbers. Some have a decent amount of supply as well. And then if you look at LA County for example, the net absorption isn't very impressive, neither is the supply because it's infill. But the rent growth is 17%, 18%. So there are couple of markets who fall in that category today. New York, New Jersey is one of them. 18% rent growth last year. Much of the Bay area falls in that category, Seattle. So your question was really about supply. In many of these infill markets, supply is really one off and as a percentage of what's going on the base, it's very small. Hamid Moghadam : Yes. I think that is correct. Ki Bin, I think, the key differentiator in rent growth last year was barriers to supply, either by markets [indiscernible] versus other, or in terms of product size. So you saw better performance in smaller versus [big] [ph] product. But you know, let's also now let the question go in terms of the rate of supply growth. There has been a real slowdown in the rate of supply growth. Starts last year and for that matter the supply pipeline, I am sure numbers you follow, up 5% to 10%. But contrast in a market environment like we are discussing, historically it would have been double digits. So there is this discipline in the supply side that also is affecting it. Operator : The next question is from Eric Frankel of Green Street Advisor. Eric Frankel : Just have a two part question. One, Tom, I am not sure if you mentioned it, but were the effect of the uniform guideline on same store portfolio construction have an '18 guidance. And by the way, I obviously appreciate you guys working on that together. And then the second question maybe for Hamid or Gene, I think multistory construction has become a much more popular topic in United States. Do you see any pitfalls for any competitors or peers in that strategy going forward? I know you guys are obviously thinking pretty thoughtfully about it. Tom Olinger : Eric, this is Tom, I will go first. So the impact on our same store operating metric is about 40 bps in 2017. So if you look at on a comparative basis, 2017 under the new methodology would have been 4.2%. The midpoint of our new guidance under the new methodology for '18 midpoint is 4.5%. So we are seeing acceleration on a comparative basis on same store year-over-year. Hamid Moghadam : Okay. And with respect to the multistoried product, I am not sure how popular it is. There are lot of people talking about it, my knowledge is there is only one multistory building being build in the U.S., but for sure overtime there will be more. We have got couple in the pipeline. And it's all about land value and growth pressures like the one Gene talked about in some of these infill markets that you know well. So I think there is more talk than action. These are not easy things to do. I mean eventually people will get the technology right but it's tough to find a 10 to 20 acre piece of land in a major metro area to build one of these things and all the mitigation measures and traffic and height limits and all that, really make it difficult to do this. So I think it's only in those markets where rents are sort of solidly in the mid double digits, mid to high teens, low 20s, that is penciled to do this kind of construction. Gary Anderson : Eric, the only thing I would add which Hamid really implied, is that development schedule is much much longer. So this is an investment that requires a lot of patience and you are looking way into the future. So I think it's a different type of development. I am not sure a lot of people in this sector will ultimately jump in. Very expensive and very long schedules. Hamid Moghadam : You know some of these things can be in the U.S. which is cheaper than Japan, can be easily $150 million, $200 million, and a couple of the ones we are looking at are $0.5 billion in investment. You know they are kind of approaching good high rise office type numbers and I am not sure there are that many people around that can right those checks. Operator : Our next question is from Tom Catherwood of BTIG. Tom Catherwood : Following up on NREIT, if I am remembering correctly, I think the talk was that your portfolio was roughly 14% below market on a leased basis. Given the 19% leasing spreads, kind of your share of those this quarter, what's that below market leasing looking like as of right now and how do you see it trending through 2018. Tom Olinger : Thanks. It's Tom. So as I said, our current in place to market at the end of the year, 14% globally, over 18% in the U.S. Two things you need to consider, is roll and the composition of the roll and rent growth. Those are the two drivers of what that mark to market, how that will move. Looking into 2018, I think there is an arrow up on the mark to market just as we were going to have about 20% roll, and you look at the composition of that role. And as Hamid said, thinking about 5%ish global rent growth. So I think there is an arrow up on that number. Operator : Next question, Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Vincent Chao : Just curious on the demand side, if you are seeing any shifts in where the demand is coming from over the past quarter or two. And maybe if you just give us your best guess for the year and maybe for the quarter. What percentage of your leasing has been more specifically for the ecommerce channel? Hamid Moghadam : I will take that and others may want to jump in. So the customer segments that have been active really haven't changed much over the last couple of quarters. There has been transportation, construction, food and auto have also been strong and ecommerce as a percentage of the demand has also been fairly steady. And as we look out into this year, that\u2019s a tough thing to predict because there are several participants in that sector who have big plans for new distribution rollout. How much of that ends up being absorption in this year is really tough to say. But I would guess, on balance I would see an upper arrow for ecommerce in 2018. But those other industries I mentioned also very very strong right now. Gary Anderson : Just to add a little something on Europe, European market continues to strengthen. As Tom mentioned in his opening remarks, we saw at least significant leasing activity in southern and central Europe, which is a huge positive for us. So demand is starting to pick up in those markets. I think the important statistics in Europe is that market vacancies are down to 5.5% and we are forecasting them to go even lower in 2018. So you should see increased opportunities for rental growth going forward. Hamid Moghadam : I think construction -- I thin resi construction, resi related absorption is going to be higher next year, or I mean 2018 in the U.S. Operator : Next question is from Nick Stelzner of Morgan Stanley. Nick Stelzner : So occupancy decrease in America is for think [fifth] [ph] straight quarter. Can you provide some color on what's driving that and do you expect to inflect any time soon? Thanks. Tom Olinger : Yes. I think if you are looking at owned and managed, you are going to see Brazil drag that down a bit. If you remember, we consolidated Brazil in the third quarter, and occupancy on that owned and managed portfolio was 78%, kind of staying there. We obviously think it was a great time for us to get in there and get that portfolio. And more to come on Brazil but I think we are definitely going to see a turnaround there in 2018. But when you look at the U.S. for example, in Q4 U.S. was a record 98% occupied. All time record. Hamid Moghadam : I mean outside of Brazil the occupancy was very high. Very high in Mexico, I might add. Operator : Next question from Joshua Dennerlein of BoA Merrill Lynch. Joshua Dennerlein : Question on your development pipeline. Should we expect maybe a mix, a shift between spec and build to suit development going forward. I was thinking there would be more build to suit. Mike Curless : Josh, this is Mike. Last year we did about 47% in terms of build to suit. As we look out over the next year, we expect to range in similar zone and I think why we are seeing those high levels of build to suits driven margin because of dearth of type of space our customers want to be, particularly in global markets. And we expect that to be a number that feels pretty solid for 2018. Hamid Moghadam : Well, 47% historically is super high. So probably the number across the cycle is more like 25%. So I don\u2019t know of anybody get used to those kinds of numbers. We were surprised by that number being that high. Operator : Next question from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : I know there has been a lot of questions on development. I guess Hamid I am just trying to think through the land bank and your desire to get the land bank down but also continue the development pipeline. How are you guys just sort of thinking about replenishing land today and what are you seeing in terms of land across and development yields on kind of new land being purchased. Hamid Moghadam : Yes, Steve. Our goal is to get down to two years of development of land supply and our development guidance, I mean it bounces around every year but you may -- actually you will remember that back in 2010, the dark days, 2010, 2011, I think the first analyst meeting we had as a merge company, we talked about development volumes being between $2 billion and $3 billion in aggregate. Not our share but in aggregate. And that\u2019s exactly where we are. We are now sort of around $3 billion in aggregate. And roughly the land that goes with that is about $750 million type of land. So about a quarter of the total investment volume. So if you literally want to own two years of land, that\u2019s about $1.5 billion of land and that\u2019s more land than we currently have on the books. Maybe not in market value but just in terms of book value. So we are pretty close to our long term goals with respect to land. We may want to push it a little bit lower but not too much lower than where it is because we need that land to support our business. Getting land is very very difficult today. In the markets that we care about the most. The exactions, all the fees that people pile on, the traffic mitigation measures and all that, are getting to be really hard. So some of these parcels of land, you got to work on for a number of years before you get entitlements for it. We are pretty fortunate that we have land for almost $8 billion, $9 billion of development on our books. But on the margin we have been adding land, call it at the rate of maybe $400 million a year and chewing through land at the rate of maybe $600 million to $700 million a year. So waddling down the land bank by $200 million to $300 million a year. And that\u2019s how we have gotten down to where we are. About $150 million of our land bank is what we call C and D category land bank. Probably more details than you care about, but those are essentially parcels of land that we inherited that we wouldn\u2019t have bought. And those things are slower to absorb. So you kind of mentally have to put $150 million of land bank on this side and say, look, we are not going to monetize that. We are going to over time sell it, probably to users and alternative uses. We chewed through a lot of that lands and that number was more like $450 million when this exercise started. So we are getting near the end of that but I kind of mentally figure out the best outside of the target land bank that we would like to have. Tom Olinger : Steve, the other thing to think about from the land that you don\u2019t see show up in our land bank is our redevelopment opportunities. So when you think about multistory, that\u2019s going to go on land that\u2019s either sitting in the operating portfolio today or sitting down in other assets. I think we have done a really good job over the last four to five years of buying what we call covered land plays, which has some sort of income stream, whether it's a truck terminal or something like that, where we are going through entitlement, we are flipping a coupon. So that\u2019s over and above the $9 billion or $10 billion of development build out potential that we have that Hamid mentioned. So there is more redevelopment opportunity there than that just sits in the land bank. Hamid Moghadam : Plus we have an increased emphasis on option agreements which will continue to add capacity to it. Operator : Next question is from Jon Petersen of Jefferies. Jon Petersen : As we are thinking about tax reforms and its impact on demand for warehouses, I am just curious as you talk to your customers, and I know you guys have a committee of customers you are talking. I am not sure you have spoken with them since the tax reform bill. But I am thinking about demand for leasing warehouse space and one aspect of it is expensing equipment over the next five years and if that might cause businesses to accelerate growth plans and buy equipment that will obviously need warehouses to go in. I know if you have any bigger thoughts on the tax reform bill or may be that specifically in what it means for warehouse demand. Hamid Moghadam : So we essentially get two questions about tax reforms. One is the one that you asked and let me just answer that one. No, we haven't had a customer advisory meeting in January yet. So other than casual kind of decisions, we haven't had a really organized high level meeting with a bunch of customers to report any trends. But I think the net of the tax program is going to be that U.S. growth by people who know a lot more about these things than I do, is projected to be faster by about 25 to 50 basis points. So that additional growth is going to translate to obviously more demand for our kind of product. The second question, and I don\u2019t know what but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it's 30 million, 40 million feet more absorption if the product were there. I am not sure the supply is going to respond quickly enough for that product to be there. But I think it's going to be good for business. The other question we have gotten is, whether the tax act, the new tax act, is going to shift more of the demand to the middle of the country because the coasts got hammered in the tax thing because of salt and all those other stuff. On the margin, the 25% to 50% extra GDP growth is going to lift boats. I am not smart enough to know whether that\u2019s going to lift the boats in the Midwest more than the ones on the coast but I think all of those boats are going to be raised and there could be that some of the lower tax states and with lower residential cost and lower tax rates we get a disproportionate benefit. But I think pretty much everywhere will get a benefit as a result of that higher GDP growth. Operator : Next question from Manny Korchman of Citi. Manny Korchman : If we think about sort of shadow supply and maybe using the [same clubs] [ph] closures and conversions as an example of that. How much of that type of supply do you think about or worry about coming and disrupting maybe more sort of vanilla construction or is it down where you guys are doing. Hamid Moghadam : Manny, that\u2019s a good question and I think that\u2019s a problem that certainly has hurt the office sector in the past at inflexion points. We got a pretty good handle on shadow space because we track utilization on a quarterly basis and we have done that pretty consistently for the last ten years. So we both have sort of period to period comparisons and actually absolute level comparisons. Right now utilization continues to be at the highest level it's been, within very few points of the highest level it's been. So there is not a lot of slack in the system and people are not hoarding space the way there were in the first dotcom in the early 2000s where a lot of people were just leasing twice as much as they needed in the hope of burying into it. I think people have been pretty disciplined after the global financial crisis and then as the vacancy rates went from 14% to 4.5%-5%, they just don\u2019t have the opportunity of doing that. So we don\u2019t think there is a lot of shadow space at all. Operator : Next question is from Craig Mailman of KeyBanc. Craig Mailman : Just two quick ones. I guess, first, on the 1.06 billion in non-core that you guys would still sell over time. Kind of what's the growth rate or internal growth rate on that versus the rest of the portfolio. And then second, just on the development starts, you guys are about 400 million higher on the initial guide here versus where you were last year. I guess I am just curious what the current visibility on the 2 billion to 2.3 billion at this point. And just a sense given, I guess the mix of built to suit to spec, kind of how we should think about margins. Tom Olinger : Craig, it's Tom. On your first question regarding the relative return on what we are selling versus what our in place portfolio, I don\u2019t have those numbers readily available. But clearly the rent growth that we are seeing in our whole portfolio is substantially greater than the rent growth in what the non-core markets that we are selling. Hamid Moghadam : Yes. Historically that number has been about a cap rate differential of about 150 basis points across the cycle and a rental growth benefit of 250 basis points. So there has been roughly 75 to 100 basis points of free lunch, if you will, by taking it slightly lower yields in the more constrained markets and making it up in growth. I am not smart enough to know exactly what it is on the mix that we are selling. Mike, what don\u2019t you talk about visibility of the development? Mike Curless : In terms of visibility, it's well over 90%. I would say that\u2019s as good as it has been since the merger which gives our confidence in our forecast year. And then margins, your question there, you should expect us in the mid to high teens and good solid numbers based on the level of activity as well too. Hamid Moghadam : And Craig when you look at our share of starts, they are pretty comparable year-over-year. Tom Olinger : Yes, maybe that\u2019s the confusing number. I mean the total development volumes are more like 3 billion and our share is in the low -- 2.22. Operator : Next question is from [David Harris of Unit Plan] [ph]. Unidentified Analyst : I have a question on protectionism. Could you give some comment as to your thoughts on the impact if the United States would walk away from NAFTA? And secondarily, could you give also some comments on your thoughts over the Brexit in Europe next year. Hamid Moghadam : Yes, welcome back, David, haven't talked to you in a while. With respect to protectionism, obviously there is a lot of protectionism but as you know, we are not so focused on the production side of that supply chain. We are focused on the consumption side of that supply chain. So frankly as long as people in LA and New York and all that continue to have to feed and clothe themselves, I really don\u2019t care whether that inventory is coming from China or Kansas or Mexico. So we are really focused on where the consumption takes place and that\u2019s where we have chosen to concentrate our investments. I think if your concern is mostly on the production side which it would have to be because all kinds of interference whether it's trade interference or tax regimes or whatever can shift that around, I think you are probably better off talking to people focused on those strategies. I don\u2019t know much about that topic. With respect to Brexit, look a lot of people got all excited about Brexit when it was first announced as a surprise. I think our stock in one day went down five bucks but our occupancies in the U.K. went up and we had significant rental growth. And I would say the U.K. has slowed a little bit from that torrid pace back in 2016 but together with Germany it's probably, U.K. and Germany are the two best markets we have in Europe, and I would put them up against any markets anywhere including the U.S. So we have not really seen any evidence of Brexit having an impact yet and when it happens I don\u2019t think it's going to be material either. Because what happened is that Brexit scared away a lot of capital and a lot of development that would have occurred didn\u2019t occur. So the market actually ended up being tighter in the U.K. and I think that will continue. Operator : Next question is from John Guinee of Stifel. John Guinee : Another thing that came up, Hamid, my understanding is that Amazon has 30, 35 build to suits out there in the market which is a new prototype, much smaller footprint, maybe 100 to 200,000 square feet, but 75 feet clear height, multiple levels. Highly automated elevator systems. Can you comment on that prototype and how you feel about it? Hamid Moghadam : So I can comment but I am going to let Mike comment because I am not sure what part of our discussions with them are confidential, what part of them aren't confidential. So Mike, why don\u2019t you talk about that? Mike Curless : Yes, John, there is certainly a lot of buzz about the sizable rollout they have underway. But just to put some things in perspective, in any given year there is a massive amounts of RFPs that are suggested in those would could play out over a couple of years. This years, yes, a little big different. Some more unique approaches to the buildings. It's very early days on that and we are taking a hard look at that, just like we did to other buildings we have done at Amazon and to the extent they are very unique or we have the opinion that it would be better serve to sell those, we will certainly look at doing that as well. So very early in the process but you can always look at Amazon for being an innovator and we will keep up with them as well too. Hamid Moghadam : Yes. The only thing I would add to that, John, is that look, Amazon has pretty much got the same strategy we do. They want to be near where the consumers are. And those market are, I should say, we have the same strategy as them, Amazon. I suppose we went public earlier, so. But look it's kind of being harder and harder to find large plots of land that support single storey, 800 million square foot type buildings in these urban areas. So they need to be able to squeeze that much business into a smaller footprint by going vertical. And even in the 800 million square foot, they mezzanine them at three levels. So operating multiple levels with low clear heights are not anything unusual for them by any stretch. But I think the key point is what Mike of sort of mentioned. Any building that we do for Amazon or anybody else, we go through the analysis, do we want to own this building in a soft leasing market without Amazon renewing. And if the answer to that is that the building is fungible and divisible and we can lease it to a normal tenant, we keep it. If the answer is, no or maybe, we will sell those and there are planning people that want to buy that credit for 15 years. So there is not a shortage of capital for that kind of thing. And we have to do that otherwise they will end up being a very big portion of our portfolio and we kind of want to manage it to a lower number than our potential business opportunity with them. Operator : And our last question is from Manny Korchman of Citi. Michael Bilerman : Hey, it's Michael Bilerman. Hamid, Prologis has been a leader in sustainability certainly within the real estate industry but I would say across all corporate. I guess how do you sort of react and sort of what's the impact to the new tariff and taxes on solar panels. How does that impact your desire to get up to 200 megawatts of self-sustaining power? Is it generally impacting the U.S. or the other countries that you are doing it in? Things like that. Hamid Moghadam : So, Michael, you know there are so many different proposals coming in the early morning of everyday that we don\u2019t really have the time or the ability to react to every single one of them. We will continue to have that commitment but as I have always said to our people, we don\u2019t do this stuff to go to heaven, we do this stuff because it's good for our customers and we can make money doing it. Sustainability is a good investment because in the long-term the life cycle cost of operating the building are more favorable to our customers and eventually that translates to rent. So to the extent that tariffs or anything else might change those dynamics on the margin, the economics will change and we will do less in some areas and more in other areas. Once there are some specific proposals to react to, I can probably give you a more clearer answer. But we have never been in the business of saying, okay, we shall have x megawatts of power on our roof and therefore we are going to do that, whether or not it pencils or not. It's always been an economic calculation for us. Michael, I think you were the last question. So thank you again for your interest in Prologis and we look towards to seeing all of you soon in the next couple of months. All the best. Take care. Happy New Year. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Kim and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Also note, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Tracy Ward. Tracy, you may begin. Tracy Ward : Thanks, Kim, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2018 conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. This morning, we'll hear from Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover results and guidance. And then Hamid Moghadam, our Chairman and CEO, who will comment on the company's strategy and outlook. Also, joining us for today's call are Gary Anderson, Mike Curless, Ed Nekritz, Gene Reilly, Diana Scott and Chris Caton. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under Federal Securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates, as well as management's assumptions and beliefs. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K and SEC filings. Additionally, our first quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures, and in accordance with Reg G we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom and we'll get started. Tom Olinger : Thanks, Tracy. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. I will cover the highlights for the quarter, provide updated 2018 guidance and turn the call over to Hamid. By now you've seen our supplemental reporting package which reflects the harmonization of our operating metrics with the logistics sector we announced last quarter. As we previously mentioned, the new definitions had an immaterial impact on our operating metrics. During this quarter, we've also taken the opportunity to report our leasing data based on commencement date versus signed date. This change better aligned our NOI metrics and is consistent with how we manage our real estate internally. Now let's turn to our results. We had a strong first quarter and are well positioned to deliver another year of sector leading earnings growth in 2018. Core FFO reported was $0.80 per share which included $0.09 of net promotes. The net promotes we earned was from our China venture and came in higher than forecasted due to increased property values as well as favorable foreign currency. Core operations also came in better than expected driven primarily by same store NOI and lower interest expense. Our share of net effective rate change on a roll was approximately 22% led by the US more than 32%. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of global rent change above 20%. Occupancy ticked down sequentially to 96.8% in line with normal seasonality. Our share of cash same store NOI growth in the quarter was 7.9% led by the U.S. at more than 9%. While these results reflect the excellent market conditions around the globe they were favorably impacted by two factors. First, we had approximately 150 basis points of free rent burn up in the quarter which was primarily driven by higher lease commitment in the first quarter of 2017. Second, we had approximately 50 basis points of non-recurring adjustment that also benefitted same store. For the full year, we expect cash same store NOI growth to be higher than our initial forecast and I'll cover this in more detail when I give guidance. Moving to capital deployment for the quarter, I'd like to highlight development stabilization which had an estimated margin of almost 30%. Margins on starts remained very healthy as well. This is notable given that build to suit accounted for nearly two-thirds of our start volume in the quarter. We completed more than $600 million of contribution and dispositions and a weighted averaged stabilized cap rate of 5.2%. Buyer interest for assets remained strong and market cap rates continued to caress particularly in Europe. Turning to capital markets, we continue to have significant liquidity and the internal capacity to self-fund our growth for the foreseeable future. I'd like to spend a minute on two financing transactions we completed in the quarter. In January, we issued a two-year EUR 400 million note with an all-in effective interest rate of negative 10 basis points. This transaction underscores our ability to access capital globally at very attractive rates. We also realized the gain from the settlement of a swap that reduced interest expense order. Looking forward, we expect the quarterly interest expense run rate for the remainder of the year to be approximately $5 million higher. Now moving to guidance for the year. I'll cover the significant updates on our share basis but for complete detail refer to page five of our supplemental. Based on the strength of our first quarter results, we're increasing the range of our cash same store NOI by 50 basis points to between 5.5% and 6.5%. Given the market rent growth in the first quarter, our in place rent continue to be below market by more than 14% globally and 18% in US. This continues to position us for strong operating performance for the next several years. For strategic capital, we now expect net promote income for 2018 the range between $0.11 and $0.13 per share, which is up $0.06 from our previous guidance. We expect to recognize the remainder of the revenue in the fourth quarter. Given our strong leasing pipeline, we're increasing our development starts guidance by $200 million to range between $2.2 billion and $2.5 billion. Build to suit were comprised about 50% of this volume. We're also increasing our disposition guidance by $475 million to a range between $1.4 billion and $1.7 billion. With this volume, we will effectively close out our non-strategic asset sales. This initiative began in 2011 and upon completion will total $14 billion on an owned and managed basis. As a result of our deployment guidance changes, we now expect to generate an additional $300 million of net sources for the full year. Putting this all together we're increasing our 2018 Core FFO [ph] by $0.08 they are in the range between $2.95, and $3.1 per share. Our revised guidance represents a year-over-year increase of 6% at the midpoint or 8% excluding promotes. This increase is particularly strong as we expect average leverage in 2018 to be approximately 250 basis points lower than 2017. The capacity we have to normalize leverage will be a catalyst for future earnings growth as every 100 basis points and additional leverage translates to about 1% Core FFO growth. To sum up we had a great quarter and are excited about our prospects for the remainder of the year and beyond and with that I'll turn it over to Hamid. Hamid Moghadam : Thanks Tom and good morning everyone. I don't have a whole lot to add to what Tom talked about because our results speak for themselves. While we remain vigilant and on the lookout for any signs of market weakness, we feel great about our business or optimistic about our company prospects. Let me now turn it over to Kim for your questions. Operator : Your first question comes from Manny Korchman from Citi. Your line is open. Manny Korchman : Hi, good morning everyone. Tom, if we think about your increase in starts guidance. How much did the percentage of built to suit in that starts guidance changed and is that what gives you confidence that the supply picture remains healthy as you and others think about starting new projects? Mike Curless : This is Mike, I'll take that one. As Tom mentioned our build to suit had a great first quarter and almost two-thirds. That should normalize around 45% to 50% over the year which is a very solid number and so that's driven a lot of our confidence in raising our development guidance. 90% of our activities identified and I should point out the spec that we're doing in our parks and cities that are 97% waste, so those two-combined give us a lot of confidence to raise the guidance in a manner that we did. Operator : Your next question comes from John Guinee from Stifel. Your line is open. John Guinee : Great. Is everybody smiling out there are you guys pretty happy? Tom Olinger : We're always happy John. Especially when we hear from you. John Guinee : Great news on all the build to suit. Somebody told me the other day that Amazon has a new prototype out there 30 or 40 they're considering throughout the country where it's a multi-level but not multi-truck court level elevator oriented six or seven storey 100,000 to 200,000 square foot footprint on six or seven storey prototype that they're thinking about. And I'm sure you're in those discussions with them. Can you elaborate at all? Mike Curless : John it's Mike again. We don't give out lot of details about any particular customers plan. Safe to say, we certainly have to happen reading on few of these opportunities and its very early days on that right now more to come on that future. Tom Olinger : Hey John, let me give you also a background without getting specific on Amazon. Generally, if you want to get closer and you got to shrink your footprint and go vertical. So, anybody who's trying to get close in to where the population is has to be thinking of that and the idea of a multi-level warehouse or Amazon specifically is not a new one. The number of stories may be at some point, but certainly you've seen new mezzanine levels in our building that we've stored with investors. So, shrinking of the footprint and going more vertical would be a logical extension of that getting. Operator : Your next question comes from Tom Catherwood from BTIG. Your line is open. Tom Catherwood : Thank you and good morning. Hamid can I speak on that point that you mentioned tenants trying to get closer and closer to population centers. 30% of your portfolio is buildings under 100,000 square feet. I assume this include the number of legacy assets in more densely populated areas. Given the challenge of acquiring land today, how much of an opportunity is available to redevelop some of these older well-located buildings? Hamid Moghadam : Actually, quite a bit and we're adding to it all the time. And if you look at what we've done in San Francisco we bought a lot of parking areas, a lot of older obsolete buildings. Interestingly they all need to clear heights for rapid in and out distribution. So, some of those buildings work really well and you need to assemble a fairly good-sized site before you can put a multi-storey building on it. So, there are lots of ways you can increase the value of those older assets by just basically cleaning them up and using them for more rapid infill delivery and also eventually for the larger parcels knocking them down and building something multi-storey. I just want to remind you that the old, this is not a new strategy the old A and B strategy was very much in fill in the larger market. So, and that's probably I don't know a third maybe 40% of our portfolio. So people, you got to offer product along the entire size of the supply chain. You have to have 500 mile product, you have to have 50 mile product, and you have to have the last 5 mile products. So, we're active in all those different segments. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman from KeyBanc Capital Market. Your line is open. Jordan Sadler : Hi, it's Jordan Sadler here with Craig. Regarding same store, cash same store was a big driver of the gross last couple quarters unconsolidated in particular has been a bigger driver particularly on the revenue side. Can you talk about the driver of the unconsolidated same store growth versus the more flattish looking revenue growth you're seeing in the consolidated same store portfolio? And then just maybe as a follow-up there's a big spread between cash same store and effective this quarter almost 260 basis points and wondering if there was anything in particular going on there? Hamid Moghadam : Let me take the latter and you can answer the former. I think on the issue of cash versus GAAP I think we have unsuccessfully described our preference for GAAP for several years. But everybody asked us about cash. So, we basically said okay starting 2018 we're just going to report cash because that seems to be what everybody is asking us all the time. We do have the GAAP number in the supplemental, so it's not like we're not providing that. But it gets really confusing if you start talking about all that, our share, cash, GAAP and all that. So, we're really going to our share and cash as the relevant number that you guys need to look at or seems to want to look at. So that was a decision that I made. Now Tom, do you want to? Tom Olinger : Yes. So, Jordan on your first question. I think, I'm not sure if you are looking at owned and managed. But clearly when you look at it graphically the U.S. versus outside the bulk of our share is going to be driven roughly 75% by the U.S. and I don't see anything performance difference between on an our share basis by geography, very consistent. Hamid Moghadam : Yeah, it's just mix. It's just that our fund business is a heavier percentage overseas than it is in the U.S. We own more of our U.S. portfolio. But within the U.S portfolio, consolidated - unconsolidated, we don't even manage our business that way. We don't even look at the\u2026 Operator : Your next question comes from Jeremy Metz from BMO. Your line is open. Jeremy Metz : Hey good morning. In terms of your cap rate compression is really held back any pick up in rent growth. At the start of the year Hamid you talked about possibly nearing an inflection point on this dynamics. I'm wondering if you can just give us an update on what you are seeing on the ground over there in terms of rent growth, which markets perhaps are seeing rent growth early materialize ahead of expectation and has your outlook changed at all over there from a few months ago. Hamid Moghadam : I think with every passing quarter, we get more optimistic about rental growth in Europe. I think I talked about the cross-over point being later in 2019 and 2020, backend of 2019 and 2020. So, we're some distance away from that. But Europe continues to accelerate in terms of rental growth. The best market - I would say the highest absolute rental growth in the past has been U.K. followed by Germany and Northern Europe and probably the laggard has been Poland and maybe France, if you want to put it in that bucket. So, but even those markets are picking up inter-activity and decreasing. So, I think we're going to get more pricing power in those markets and I think rental growth in Europe will be a couple of points this year and we're in that\u2026 Operator : Your next question comes from Jamie Feldman, Bank of America. Your line is open. Jamie Feldman : I'd like to get your team's big picture thoughts on trade war risk, how people should be thinking about what it could mean longer term for the warehouse business. And then maybe, just as you talk to your clients or maybe your clients aren't really talking about it, but what's the sentiment among tenants about what they are seeing in the press and the tweets and what this all might mean? Hamid Moghadam : Let me give you the bad news first and I'll tell you the good news next. I think the bad news is that any kind of trade war or which way, I don't think we're quite there yet. But any kind of trade war is bad for economic growth generally. And that will affect everything including our business. So, if the economy grows at 30 to 40 basis points slower than it would have otherwise, which is what I see most people talking about, that's not good for anybody's business including ours.  Now, on the mitigating side of this, first of all, its' really early in those discussions. Those tenants haven't even kicked in and who knows what the latest pronouncements on TVP - I mean I don't know what to read into any of that stuff. So, and I would say most of our customers, all of our customers that I'm aware of have basically - have their head down doing their business and not paying too much attention to what comes out in the tweets in the morning until there is something specific they can react to. The other thing that I would point out to you is that most of the tenants at least to-date have been on intermediate material or raw material that goes into production. And as you know we are not that active on the production end of the supply chain anyway. We're at the consumption end of the supply chain. So, it has less of an effect on us than our places that are focused more on production. So - and by the way a lot of these goods don't even go through a warehouse. Steel doesn't go through warehouses, aluminum doesn't go through warehouses. So, I guess the simplest way of thinking about it is that we are concerned by the talk. We are not yet concerned by the action and we'll just see what the action is going to be. Operator : Your next question comes from Blaine Heck from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Blaine Heck : Thanks. Good morning. Hamid can you talk a little bit about what you are seeing with respect to supply in general and more specifically on construction financing, we've heard that banks and other lenders have recently become a little bit more willing to lend for industrial construction in particular. Is that consistent with what you are seeing and does that give you any concern as you look out into 2018 and 2019? Hamid Moghadam : Yeah, I don't think the banks were hesitant to lend on industrial construction. They just wanted to lend at equity in the deal which made it more difficult for developers to finance projects. So, you can get bank finance, and you just have to have 40% equity in the deal, which means that you usually have to bring in a partner and that complicates. And the partner has to get the returns and the developer has to get his return. So, it just gets to be a tighter calculus. Having said that, I think actually the bigger constraint on industrial development is really land availability and entitlements. I mean these buildings are getting bigger. The need for flat ground is getting in large parcels is getting to be more intense and the sublicense streams are more severe than ever. So, that's what's really constraining the supply, particularly in the markets where a lot of demand is. So, Gene, do you have anything to add to that? Gene Reilly : I mean I think our concerns about supply have revolved around the same markets, I believe the last two years, and that's basically South Dallas, Atlanta, and Central Pennsylvania. And what we've seen is these markets will bounce from a temporary over supply being imbalanced to oversupply, currently all those three are in a supply [ph]. But otherwise supply is [ph]. Operator : Your next question comes from Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Vikram Malhotra : Just maybe the last few quarters, you sort of outlined the strategy of willing to sort of push rent at the expense of occupancy to some extent. Maybe just big picture, if we look out over the next few years, certainly there is a lot of room in terms of mark-to-market. So, how much would you have to see occupancy adjust to sort of step back and say, maybe we need to tweak it a little bit? Gene Reilly : So, Vikram, this is Gene and I'm probably a little unsure of exactly what the question is, but we don't really think of it as, you know intentionally dropping the occupancy achieve a certain result from the rent change side. We think of more so focusing more on what rent we really ought to be achieving in each case. You know, when you are in a dynamic market environment, there is a bias typically in the field managed for occupancy. If you manage to a budget every year, you are naturally going to do that. And we're trying hard to get away from that basic way of doing business. So we're really looking to push rents and we've frankly been pretty successful doing so. But it isn't based on some sort of calculation dropping occupancy. As a natural result, you will leak a little bit, but at these levels of occupancy. Hamid Moghadam : Let me make that a little more specific for you. If you are the person leasing space in X market, and you have a vacancy, you have a tenant lease coming over for renewal in the middle of the year. If you don't make that deal, it's likely that that space will remain vacant for the balance of the year and you'll miss your budget, because particularly you don't have benefit of diversification of a really large portfolio like we do sort of at the company level. For that person, that's a big miss on the budget. If you're not careful that sum of all those individual decisions will bias you towards more conservatism so that you want to increase the probability of renewing that lease, with a virtual certainty. And that makes you leave a lot of money on the table. So, we got to derisk that behavior for the field, so that that individual doesn't have the incentive to just keep renewing at whatever old rent they can get. So, there is some behavioral stuff that we're working on over here that maximizes the bottom-line for the company while individual locations and individual people may underperform and some of their other colleagues will over perform. So, what maximizes the benefit for an individual - or performance for an individual is not necessarily the same thing that maximizes the performances for the company. That's what we're trying to do. Operator : Your next question comes from Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Vincent Chao : Hey good morning everyone. Just wanted to go back to the discussion of land and maybe on the covered land side if you could provide some additional details around what the size of that portfolio looks like to maybe on a square footage basis or NOI being generated today, and you know how long it might take to realize that covered land bank? Tom Olinger : Hey Vincent, this is Tom. I just want to put our land in three buckets. You've got land we owned, we've got land under option, and then we have covered land plays. I think the covered land plays probably from a total build out and this could be over the next five plus years, but that number is probably north of $2 billion of incremental development and Hamid said, that we work really hard at continuing to increase that pool, but that's the magnitude and there is probably more upside over the long-term. Hamid Moghadam : And remember there is no - in the short-term it shows up as operating real-estate because by and large you are getting a yield to very close to what you would have gotten, had it had a building on it. So, that that's why it's called covered. So, in the short term, it's an operating asset and in the long-term position redevelopment to the tune of the two [ph]. Operator : Your next question comes from Dick Schiller, Baird. Your line is open. Dick Schiller : Thanks. Good morning everyone. A quick question on the loan package you guys took our $400 million at a negative interest rate. Does that give you guys comfort to be more aggrieve on acquisition front or if - looking at development starts, be putting more money capital to use into the development pipeline. How are construction cost bouncing your IRR and expected return from that development pipeline. Hamid Moghadam : Look, we look at our overall cost of capital, weighted average cost of capital and that varies by geography and just because on a given maturity in a given day in a given currency, we can borrow money on a very attractive basis. We don't run around trying to match that with uneconomic deals. So, our thresholds for what makes sense for us to deploy capital remains pretty much unchanged other than big changes in plus capital in different locales, so no change in that. And generally, I would say in terms of the incremental yield that we're looking at for development, it's usually on the order of 100 to 150 basis points of yield above the exit cap rate and if you want to translate that to margins, it's about on the low-side 10% for a really safe and secure build-to-suit and at market land value is about a 15% on spec, but we keep exceeding that because of excess rental growth and excess cap rate impression. So the margins as you've seen have been a lot higher than that and some of our land as older basis so that further boost the margins. But at market, like I've always said spec development should about 15 and build to suit [ph] and we're getting better than that now. Operator : Your next question comes from Rob Simone from Evercore. Your line is open. Rob Simone : On the free rent impact on same store, I guess with the 150 basis point impact, does that kind of imply that impact should - or that benefit should trail off as the year progresses, just given that you know you guys have been saying the difference between gap and cash will be about 100 basis points, plus or minus. And then I have a really quick follow-up after that, if possible? Tom Olinger : This is Tom. So, you are right. The free rent impact as I mentioned was about $150 basis points in the quarter and it was driven by the high amount of the above average amount of lease commencements we had in Q1 2017. If you look at the rest of 2017 by quarter, the commencements are much more in line with what we did in Q1 and if you want to just think big picture cash same store looking forward, and I do think it's going to moderate the spread between cash and GAAP to about 100 basis points. And if you think about the components of the cash same store NOI, you are going to have rent change, we're going roll about 20% of the portfolio of cash. Rent change is going to be 10%, so call that 200 basis points. You are going to have bumps on the 80%. That's not rolling, that's about 250 basis points of same store occupancy. We talked about a year-over-year occupancy impact of about 50 basis points last quarter and then you have free rent and indexation which is another 50 basis point. So, that's a nice high level way to think about cash same store going. Rob Simone : Great. Thanks. That's really helpful. And just really quickly on the promote, so the balance of the revenue is going to be recognized in Q4, but will you guys like in past year also had some amortization in Q2 and Q3 that could drag on those quarter slightly? Tom Olinger : That's correct about $0.01 of capital expense related to -- because of the timing difference spin revenues all upfront and the mode expense comes in over time. Operator : Your next question comes Eric Frankel from Green Street Advisor. Your line is open. Eric Frankel : Thank you. Can you just identify the markets at which you plan to sell assets? What is the source of the increased disposition guidance and then second, I think there are a couple larger portfolios in the market for purchase. So, I wanted to just understand what your criteria are for [ph] and whether you're going to end with some capital partners to join in those purchases given increased investor interest. Thank you. Mike Curless : Yes. Our disposition strategy Eric haven't really changed. The timing of it may have been accelerated because the market, we're leasing up some of our other strategic assets faster and so they're becoming positioned earlier for sale and the market is good so we're taking advantage of those opportunities. But they're generally that remaining non-strategic assets in Europe and the U.S. that we identified long time ago we're not changing that, it's just that we're getting through it faster than we would have otherwise. With respect to capital deployment, but we look at everything and you know I mean since we are we in the really big, buy a big portfolio and before Katie are within buy a big portfolio. Just that a lot of these instances and quality of what's available and our desire for maintaining the portfolio that we have, so diligently constructed over the last five or six years I mean we've sold $14 billion real state as Tom mentioned. I mean we really worked hard at perfecting the quality of this portfolio. When we look at a portfolio or most of these portfolios we would have to sell 60%, 70% of them to get down to the 30% or 40% we like. So, obviously we got to price them so we can sell them and still come out as a good valuation for what we want to keep and that becomes kind of difficult to do. So, we're buying large not a big portfolio buyer because of the fifth issue but in terms of return requirements again I go back to my previous answer we have a cost of capital that is different for each jurisdiction and we need to get an appropriate spread before we deployed capital. Operator : Your next question comes from Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust. Your line is open. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. Good morning everyone. So, I kind of imagine that one of the bigger challenges that you guys have is finding smart ways to deploy development capital in size. So, could you talk about where are the next rounds of opportunities are globally? Tom Olinger : Sure. I mean there we have a really great way of deploying capital which is in the market that's in the high 4% we can deploy capital development which will not only service the needs of our customers but will also monetize our land bank and we control based on our current land bank and the option land and even excluding the covered lamp place we have a close to $10 billion opportunity to deploy capital. So, that's a couple of years of activity that doesn't depend on anything else or any portfolio acquisition or the like and we are - it's not a static number we're always adding to it and growing it. So, I think primarily the global development platform very few people actually attribute any value to is a driver of our growth and it's a pretty unique and special driver of deployment and earnings growth. So that's our primary way. The acquisition stuff tends to be more value added tends to be cover land played there's got to be an angle. If we're going toe to toe on just the cost to capital race with the latest sovereign wealth fund or pension fund that wants to be out there that's generally not our ammo particularly when you are related to quality that I talked about earlier. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Miller from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Michael Miller : Thanks. Hi and I apologize. I missed some of the intro comments if this was asked. But looking out to 19 and 20 it looks like you have about 13% to 15% of square footage expiring each year. How much pull forward should we expect on top of those levels? Tom Olinger : Hi Michael, this is Tom. I don't think you should expect a lot of pull forward to those levels. We're obviously I think you're going to see our churn over time naturally come down slowly because of longer lease duration. So, I wouldn't expect. Hamid Moghadam : But I think what he's asking is that in a typical year we lease about 5% more than the rollover we have. So, I think in the 15% roll here it's going to be about 20% because we're pulling basically six months of the next year-end. We're always running ahead. Although you know we're getting a little smarter about that. It took us a while to figure it out. But by moving things forward, in the rapidly escalating market you are actually blocking and lease rates at a lower rate than you should have and that's another behavioral thing that we're working on here. So, I think the answer is, specific answer to your question is about 5% more but there's a rent aspect to that that you got to keep them. Operator : Your next question comes from John Guinee from Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open. Mike Curless : Hey, Mike Curless follow-up call. When you're looking at development overall lot of moving pieces, land, and entitlement costs, hard costs, required, yields by you and others as well as rental rates. What do you think are good examples of what's happening to land versus hard costs versus required yield in various markets that you're looking at new development? Tom Olinger : We're certainly seeing. As Gene mentioned the scarcity is well at this side particularly in the markets that are closer to the customers. Scarcity there is going to be driving up and is driving up land prices, construction costs are being driven up in select markets as well because that's going on with steel. But in the places that we're doing business, we're seeing the corresponding rental rates being there and emerging. Hamid Moghadam : I got to tell you this construction cost thing is no joke in the bay area. Construction costs are 20%, 25% percent up last year. That by the way thanks to other parts of California too. So, they have been stable for many years and now it's the time for the contractors and stuff and buyers to make some hay while the sun is shining. So, construction costs are really tough and some of that has been mitigated by yield compression on the required return side, but it's getting tougher to pencil spec development in some of these markets and that's good news I guess for rental growth over time because that marginal product coming to market is [ph] now. Operator : Your next question comes from Eric Frankel from Green Street Advisor. Your line is open. Eric Frankel : Thank you. I just want to address the topic of rent paying abilities among tenants. Obviously, the rent increases you are pushing through the tenants especially in close markets. They don't think much of rent I guess is what's been phrased the last few years. Can you talk about what how higher rents fit into your tenants supply chains at this point especially population dense markets and it certainly seems for you know potential multi-storey development in the future that you need rents to be in the $15 to $30 range for the economic to work. Can you talk about which tenant can actually afford those types of prices? Tom Olinger : Sure. First of all, keep in mind that while nominal rate rental rates have increased a lot in terms of real rants we're still way below the high water marks of the late nineties and early 10,000 substantially below. So real rent is really what matters over time. Second, a lot of these marginal player, marginal in terms of bad but marginal meaning players that need close and can fill space are really substituting retail space so the difference between retail and industrial is blending and they get a lot more throughput in last you know last touch delivery and therefore by eliminating a retail rounds and another a lot of other supply chain costs. I think they can afford to pay a lot more, those particular tenants can certainly pay a lot more for higher cost real estate. The third consideration is that there are not a lot of these opportunities around to develop so it's not like a greenfield situation where you can go and all these new buildings and all that. But probably the most important factor is that industrial rents are a tiny tiny tiny portion of the entire supply chain cost. I mean certainly under 5% and in many many cases under 2%. And in particular categories like parcel delivery, food, construction, municipal items and all that you got to be there to provide those services close end. So those tenants tend to be less rent sensitive. If you're distributing tires you're not going to be in those locations because you're very rent sensitive. But those are not the kind of tenants you are finding in those locations. Operator : Your next question comes from Jon Petersen from Jefferies. Your line is open. Jon Petersen : Great. Thank you. So, the promotes this quarter came in well ahead of your guidance. Just wondering if you can give some color on why it was so much higher than the outlook you gave a couple months ago. I think it was often the China fund. And then kind of stepping back to the bigger picture. I'm just curious when you provide guidance, how do you go about underwriting what the promote potential is? Do you guys assume a 25 basis point increase in cap rates or slower NOI growth or something conservative like that to derive the number just trying to think about how you guys I think about that when you get guidance. Tom Olinger : Jon, thanks for the question. So, our approach on promotes is we generally provide guidance based on smart valuation and what we saw on the first quarter was China values pretty meaningfully and we had a positive tailwind from Fx. The RMB strengthened against the dollar in the quarter and vis-\u00e0-vis from our calculations obviously be sensitive to valuation. So, we give you the sport values on promotes. As we mentioned the fourth quarter promote is based on fund in Europe and we'll recognize all the revenue. Hamid Moghadam : Yes. It's more like an option price, I mean it's an effective call on appreciation of the portfolio plus the preferred return. So, it's very sensitive to that exit value and cap rates have been there and rent. So, we do our best we're not trying to step on the scale or anything in. Sometimes most of the times it and the downward compressing cap rate environment it's just been price to the up side. Operator : Your last question comes from Jamie Feldman from Bank of America. Your line is open. Jamie Feldman : Great. Guy's sticking with your last statement just on compressing cap rates, I mean what are your thoughts and how much lower cap rates can go or maybe a better day to ask you that is just to talk about demand you are seeing out there for industrial assets and what the transaction market looks like and what underwriting assumptions look like for buyers? Hamid Moghadam : I think that's based on what we're saying people are paying mid for cap rates for some very mediocre export polio than in the past markets. Like LA some of the cap rates are would lead to that market are in the high three. So. and that translates into maybe a 5.5 on leverage IRR are on a good day. So that's what we're seeing in the marketplace. And what it should be I don't know, we're not buying a lot of real estate at 0.3 cap rate. So, I don't really know what was the most the first party question. Jamie could you ask the first part of your question again. Okay, you're gone. All right you can call me privately, I forgot the first part. Anyway, thank you very much for your interest in the company and look forward to communicating with you over the course of the quarter.

And welcome to the Duke Realty Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference to our host Mr. Ron Hubbard. Please go ahead, sir. Ron Hubbard : Thanks, Greg. Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Jim Connor, Chairman and CEO; Mark Denien, Chief Financial Officer; and Nick Anthony, Chief Investment Officer. Before we make our prepared remarks, let me remind you that statements we make today are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For more information about those risk factors, we would refer you to our December 31, 2017, 10-K that we have on file with the SEC. Now, for our prepared statement, I'll turn it over to Jim Connor. James Connor : Thanks Ron. Good afternoon everyone. I'll start up with a short update on the business environment we're seeing today and then cover our second quarter results. Demand for logistics space has never been strong. An expanding economy and the rapid pace of supply chain reconfiguration and expansion continues to provide tailwinds for logistics real estate. Across the U.S., industrial market fundamentals maintain the momentum we saw in the first quarter. Demand outpaced supply by 10 million square feet for the quarter. Year-to-date, net absorption was about 105 million square feet, slightly above the rate for 2017, but similar to what we've seen for the last few years. Completions year-to-date were about 90 million square feet also relatively similar to the last few years. U.S. industrial market vacancy now stands at 4.4% which is down 20 basis points from a year ago. Nationally, rents grew 6% for the quarter compared to the second quarter a year ago and we would expect that rent growth to remain constant through the remainder of the year. We're seeing new construction across the country maintaining a somewhat level pace. Total supply under construction is about 230 million square feet. Yet we expect demand to continue to outpace supply which bodes well for continued tight fundamentals and rent growth for the foreseeable future. Let me touch on the topic of trade tariffs, which are currently in the headlines. We are not currently seeing or hearing of any impact from our customers today. I would also point to business inventories and industrial production, both of which grew in the second quarter. Consumer spending rates a data point that's highly correlated to the demand for our type of product are at the highest level since the 2008 recession. This news combined with strong consumer sentiment leads us to believe the tariffs will not materially impact our business for the foreseeable future. Even if the situation would escalate and the impact on consumption or consumer confidence, we believe the supply chain trends occurring today with the demand for larger more cost effective facilities and last mile infill development will continue to drive demand on our sector. Switching to the construction side, we have seen increases in steel pricing and labor costs and those increased have pushed our total hard costs up by about 5% to 6%. However, market rents continuing to rise. These increases have of not really impacted our yields. Turning to our own operating results, we\u2019re seeing similar strength in our own portfolio with stabilized in-service occupancy at 98.2%, which is down slightly from the last quarter, but still very strong. Total in-service occupancy is up 40 basis points to 97.4% due largely the leasing progress in our spec projects. During the quarter, we executed 7.8 million square foot of leases across 16 markets, which is very strong in light of the high occupancy and relatively low lease explorations in our portfolio. The lease activity included space from recent acquisitions as well as spec developments and exceeded our underwriting on both lease-up timing and rental rates. A few notable leasing transactions for the quarter included a 1 million square foot 20-year lease in the Lehigh Valley, which is our newest speculative facility, was delivered the same month. This lease was with a major parcel carrier, logistics firm and brings the occupancy of our 2.7 million square foot 33 Logistics Park to 100%. Secondly, there were three leases executed in the Bridge portfolio, which brought that entire 3.4 million square foot portfolio to a 100% lease, compared to 58% lease when we agreed to terms just over a year ago. The leasing in this portfolio exceeded our original expectations both in terms of timing and rental rates. In general, the performance of these acquired Bridge assets as well as other investments funded from the 2017 MOB sale has contributed to our decision to raise full year 2018 occupancy and earnings expectations, which Mark will discuss in a moment. Overall, the leasing activity is strong fundamentals led to another outstanding quarter of rent growth of 9% and 22% on a cash and GAAP basis respectively. Turning to the development for the quarter, we started $393 million of projects across 9 markets. These projects were 53% preleased in aggregate and are projected to earn an average initial cash yield of 6.5%. Our development outlook for the remainder of the year looks very solid. We have a healthy pipeline of prospects across our entire platform. This combined with the outstanding year-to-date results is driving our increase guidance for development work, which Mark will also cover in a moment. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Nick to cover acquisitions and disposition activity for the quarter. Nick Anthony : Thanks Jim. We close 301 million of disposition in the second quarter with all of those proceeds were from the Columbus portfolio, which we mentioned in previous calls and a deal that went in news from the buyer's press release back in May. As you recall, this was a 3.8 million square foot portfolio located about 50 miles west to the Columbus, Ohio that Bon-Ton stores, a company and liquidation contributing 20% NOI. In context of this risk and some other lease expirations in the few years, we believe we achieved very strong price in the sale of $61 per square feet. We've recycled the portion of these dispositions proceeds into acquisitions which totals $187 million for the quarter. The largest one was a 1.1 million square foot, 3 buildings state-of-the-art logistic portfolio in Miami, Florida. These assets are located in the Medley Submarket near the Miami airport. Moreover, we expect this recycling from the Columbus assets and to infill Miami to be accretive on a long-term IRR basis by approximately 90 basis points, given the near-term vacancy and rollover in the Columbus portfolios compared to those tech players and expected better market rent growth in Miami, we were pleased with the execution of our redeployment. I will now turn our call over to Mark to discuss our financial results and revised guidance. Mark Denien : Thanks Nick. Core FFO for the quarter was $0.33 per share compared to $0.30 per share in the first quarter of 2018 and $0.32 per share in the second quarter of 2017. Core FFO increased from the first quarter of 2018 due to the typical first quarter spike in non-cash G&A expense related to our annual stock-based compensation grant in February, along with continued overall strong operating results. We reported FFO as defined by NAREIT of $0.33 per share for the quarter compared to $0.31 per share for the first quarter of '18 and $0.36 per share in the second quarter of 2017. NAREIT FFO in the second quarter of 2017 was positively impacted by $20 million of promote income we've recognized in connection with the medical office sale. Same property NOI growth for the quarter was 3.9% on a cash basis, up from 3.4% in the first quarter and growth is 3.7% year-to-date as a result of continued rental rate growth on releasing as well as free rent periods burning off on leases that commenced over the last few quarters. Year-to-date, same property NOI on a GAAP basis is about 130 basis points higher than our cash basis due to free rent and some prior straight line rent bad debt expense. Looking out for the remainder of the year, we expect same property growth to continue to accelerate in Q3. We finished the quarter with $232 million in available cash to redeploy into new investments. We also have $277 million in interest bearing notes, of which a $145 million will mature over the 12 months and no outstanding borrowings under unsecured line of credit. As discussed last quarter, our capital needs for the remainder of the year includes the prepayment of two secured loans in September totaling $227 million which were interest at an average rate of over 7.6%. Let me now address our revisions to our 2018 expected range of estimates, which is an exhibit at the back of our quarterly supplement as well as on our website. To reflect the continued leasing momentum and overall strong rental rate growth which continues at a pace that significantly exceeds our original expectations, we have further increased guidance for core FFO to a range of $1.29 to a $1.35 per share which equates to $0.03 per share at the midpoint. As mentioned in April, the majority of this growth will be generated from newer developments. A perfect example of this is our second quarter development deliveries. We delivered 2.9 million square feet representing an investment of a $198 million that were 57% preleased when we started the projects, but were delivered at 100% leased. The margin on these deliveries was almost 50% well ahead of our original expectations. We continue to have tremendous earnings upside from our platform that will not be included in our same property results, but is nonetheless a great outcome. W will balances with continue solid growth in our same property population, which is impressive given the risk return nature of this population at 98% occupied with very little rollover the next couple of years. This increase in core FFO guidance is indicative of an 8% to 11% increase for the second half of 2018, compared to the first half of 2018 and an 11% to 15% increase over the second half of 2017. We\u2019ve been saying that we believe, we are positioned for strong growth by the second half of this year, and this guidance update reflects that. We also increased our ranges for average percentage lease for both our stabilized and in-service portfolios with midpoints increasing my 30 and 40 basis points respectively. We increased our estimate for development starts by $100 million to a range of $758 million to $950 million for the year and reduce the high-end of our acquisition guidance by $100 million. In addition, we increased our range on dispositions by 85 million at the midpoint to arrange a $472 million to $600 million. Reverse revisions to certain other guidance factors can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. Now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Jim. James Connor : Thanks Mark. In closing, we\u2019re pleased with our team\u2019s execution through mid-year across our operations, capital redeployment and development. Logistics real estate fundamentals are firing in all cylinders. It appears the economies on solid footing and our strategy and platform is work very well positioned to capture growth opportunities for our shareholders. We will now open up the lines to the audience. We asked participants that you keep the dialogue to one question or perhaps two short questions. You of course are welcome to get back in the queue. Operator, you may open up the lines. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our question today -- first question today comes from the line of Manny Korchman. Please go ahead. Manny Korchman : Jim, I appreciate the comments on sort of the tenant health or trade environment. I was just wondering at the top, how you measure sort of the health of your sort of tendency or especially in the growth plan? And how it relates to specific properties in your portfolio? James Connor : Well, I think there\u2019s two components there, Manny. The health or what we would refer to as the financial health, we\u2019ve got fairly strict credit rating and underwriting guidelines that we\u2019ve always maintained. So, those are in place and those haven\u2019t changed. In terms of our client outlook and in particular their reaction to all of the headlines about tariffs, we have meetings and conversations with our major tenants on an ongoing basis. We sat personally with three of the larger ones just this week and had those same conversations in terms of what they\u2019re feeling, what they\u2019re seeing, if they\u2019re changing any of their expectations for their use of space and their need of space for the balance of this year or next year. And we have yet to see one of our major clients tell us, they\u2019re putting things on hold or pulling back. So, we\u2019re still pretty optimistic that the overall positive direction of the economy is going to continue to hold from a logistics sector. Manny Korchman : And then in terms of your development pipeline, as a pipeline grows in your pre-leasing stats have come down a little bit and getting closer I guess the lower end of your comfort zone? Does that comfort zone shift at all given how well the economies doing and given sort of your opportunities that for development? James Connor : Manny, I think it\u2019s really the change if you see the last couple of quarters is just timing. Given the nationwide nature of our development activities, we do more development in the summer month. So typically the second quarter result is probably our strongest development quarter. So we had anticipated that that preleased percentage would come down the lower end of the range. And it may yet come down again towards the bottom of that range in the third quarter. But again that should we expected and as long as we keep leasing than going build-to-suit, we expect to stay above 50% and continue to push our development volumes across the country. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Blaine Heck. Please go ahead. Blaine Heck : Jim, clearly you guys had a big win with the UBS lease this quarter. So I wanted your thoughts on the Lehigh Valley market in general. There has been some off-and-on talk of oversupply there. But I'd be curious to hear, how you think it's positioned at this point? James Connor : That would not make the top of our caution list. There is a fair bit of space out there, but there always been demand and it tends to come and go in pretty big increments. The ones that we historically always talked about have been in no particular order probably Atlanta, Dallas and then the Inland Empire East, which is where there is a lot of spec base out there, but there continues to be good demand. So in short order, I would tell you we're not concerned about the Lehigh Valley. We've got another 130,000 foot building that's under construction become in-service here the next couple of weeks and we've got really strong activity on that as well. Blaine Heck : That's helpful. And then I noticed the cap rate you guys are using in the value creation calculation on the development pipeline increased from last quarter. All of the commentary we've heard points to decreasing cap rates. So I'm assuming it's a mixed issue, but wanted to get some commentary on what exactly drove that change? James Connor : You're exactly right, Blaine. As far as the population driving this cap rate, it's entirely mixed. I'll let Nick to comment on the overall cap rate environment because I think it's the opposite. Nick Anthony : Yes, that's correct. We continue to see some cap rate compression. CBRE just came out what their cap rate survey and I think they noted that Tier 1 markets cap rate compressed by about 10 basis points and the Tier 2 markets decreased about 15 basis points. Blaine Heck : Great. James Connor : Just a mixed issue this quarter. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Rich Anderson. Please go ahead. Richard Anderson : So, on the asset sales in particular Columbus and Bon-Ton component to that and then the redeployment, can you talk about and if it's in your some place I missed it that there is kind of the spread -- cap rate spread that you -- that impacted perhaps your numbers and maybe some dilution from that trade in particular that perhaps could allow you to grow your FFO guidance even further had it not been for that trade? Mark Denien : Well, the in place cap rate for the Columbus portfolio was fixed. But once Bon-Ton vacated, it was high-4s. And that compares to the acquisitions which were mid 4s. So, it's actually sort of a wash when you factored into the fact that Bon-Ton vacated. And then as we noted on our long term basis, the yields are much higher on the Miami transaction. James Connor : So, it is a little dilutive from what it was in the first half of the year, but it wasn't only dilutive for the last half of the year once that Bon-Ton lease rolled. Richard Anderson : Right but in terms of what your run-rate was because you did have fixed working for you at this point in time? James Connor : Yes, it is dilutive, you're right, for the second half a year. I guess my point is, it would have been dilutive what we did to Miami transaction not because of the vacancy that was coming out of some Bon-Ton. Rich Anderson : And then, I want to talk about property taxes and as I just chatted with Ron a little bit pre-earnings about the fact that you\u2019re largely triple net like a lot of your peers. And I\u2019m curious to what degree do you worry about property taxes given that a lot of that would be passed through and how you\u2019re managing that issue in particular? James Connor : Well, [Brad], I would make a couple of comments. Property taxes are our second biggest expense in operating the portfolio and even though we\u2019re 98% leased and most of these buildings are our true triple net leased. The fact the overall gross rent that we can achieve in the marketplace, so we\u2019re always very sensitive to tax increases, we also very sensitive to markets where they have tax abatement and tax basement burns off. So, it\u2019s a big part of our asset management strategy and we pay a lot of attention to it. Mark Denien : And we do, Rich, have an in-house real estate tax consulting team that works with our tenants. They try to bring that down as best we can. So we do, we can't. Rich Anderson : And what\u2019s the growth rate in property taxes, if I could just tag on assumed in your guidance? James Connor : Well, effectively at zero because like you said, it is all the pass-through. So at this occupancy level, it really doesn\u2019t affect our bottom line for the short-term. It\u2019s just the flexibility to grow overall rents over the long-term. Operator : And we do have a question for the line Jamie Feldman. Please go ahead. Jamie Feldman : I just wanted -- I was hoping to get more color on the markets and where you think you can grow the development pipeline given you raise the guidance. So kind of which markets and what gives you more confidence to raise that number here? James Connor : Well, I would give you a couple of answers, Jamie. First of all from a spec development perspective, the state of our portfolio in terms of occupancy and near-term role, we could build stacking in literally every one of our markets that we\u2019re not going to, but we\u2019ve got operating business guys that are chopping at the build to build more spec. So, it\u2019s a blend of how much leasing we get done in the existing spec development and the existing portfolio and how much build-to-suit. Right now, we\u2019ve got a very healthy build-to-suit pipeline that kind of refers back to the original conversation about tariffs. We spent a lot of time talking to our clients about their needs coming up here for the next 18 months and everything remains very positive. So, the ultimate about of development we do is really a function of how much fact leasing we do and how many build-to-suit we do. Because we can always do more spec development, but we\u2019re just trying to manage our risk. Mark Denien : Jamie, perfect indication as just where we built in the second quarter because if you look at our year-to-date starts, we're already and what was the previous low-end of our guidance. So, we really didn\u2019t raise guidance that much and respect to future development for the year. We\u2019re already at the low-end of the guidance. So with the strong second quarter we had that\u2019s a good indication of where the markets too strong. Jamie Feldman : And then as we\u2019ve seen, as the trade stocks have been more vocal. And you guys were always a little differentiated, having more of a Southeast focus, Midwest focus, less around the major port markets. The Bridge portfolio obviously grew you into some of those markets. Do you I mean do you think going forward you'll try to get back to your kind of formal market concentration? Are you still feel very good about the recent plan -- the more recent plan that kind of grow in some of these more global trade markets? James Connor : No, Jamie, you're going to see us remain consistent to what we've talked about in terms of our strategic plan. We need to grow in more of the Tier 1 and more of Tier 1 high barrier market. So, you'll continue to see us focused on that. But I don't think those markets bear any more risk than any the other logistics markets around the country because you're talking about logistics and supply chain. So, warehouses are full all over the U.S. right now and as long as we continue with the economy unreasonably stable footing and growing we should be in pretty good shape. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Jeremy Metz. Please go ahead. Jeremy Metz : Jim, you might have just touched on this a little bit. But going back to the trade topic, you've talked about not seeing any business plan changes from your tenants. But as you think about the development and the lead time to build and to lease and taking on some of this spec, obviously, you don't want to be called holding a bunch of vacancy, if your tenants do change your plans and unless they do change them suddenly. So, as we look at in next year, could we see proactively maybe hit the pause button a bit and see others plays out or at least maybe pause some of the developments in those markets most potentially impacting for many strange trade dispute? James Connor : Well I think, Jeremy, the governors that we put in place would come into there. So if demand started to diminish in the second half of this year the beginning of next year or build-to-suit started diminish or both, you would automatically see us pullback dramatically on stack, because again, we're not going to go below that 50% pipeline. And as we're looking at the lease up times on all of our speculative projects across the system, and monitoring what that's doing, that factors into all of those spec decisions. So I think as long as we stay committed to the operational goals that we've stated to you guys and our shareholders that will happen. So, if you see spec space start to slowdown, if you see build-to-suit start to fall off, you'll see our development numbers come down appropriately. Jeremy Metz : And then second for me, you mentioned demand, we obviously continue to hear plenty of our last mile demand and the significant upward pressure on ranks to those assets. I was wondering, if maybe you could bifurcate your market between coastal infill and poor markets and then central? And what difference you're seeing today in terms of your ability to push ranks, demand, timing to lease space, et cetera? James Connor : Yes, I think my answer would be pretty consistent with what we've seen for the last few quarters, which is the high barrier markets continue to perform at the top-end of the rent growth range which is upwards of 10%. And the second tier markets are probably in the mid-single digits 4% to 6% given that. So we saw last quarter you're overall at 6%. So that probably averages out. I think you're seeing that very consistently. There is such demand for that infield space in these urban areas and these high barrier markets that we're continuing to be able to push rent pretty dramatically. And I think the biggest fundamental thing that we've learned and we've talked about it in some of our previous calls is. The last mile is necessarily small as everybody thinks it is. Amazon and UPS and FedEx are not doing 20,000 foot releases. They\u2019re outdoing 200,000 foot releases and 400,000 foot leases. And that\u2019s really what drives the last mile. It\u2019s the package delivery guys and the e-commerce guys. It\u2019s not local guys doing 20,000 foot leases. And we\u2019ve talked about some of those deals that we\u2019ve done infill deals for UPS of 400,000 feet and on the surface, people wouldn\u2019t necessarily think of that as last mile, but that\u2019s exactly what it is. Operator : And we do have a question for the line of Eric Frankel. Please go ahead. Eric Frankel : Just given the success of your sales of the Columbus portfolio, what are your thoughts of more actively recycling some of the assets that you want to or in markets where you want to reduce your exposure? James Connor : Well, let me start and then I\u2019ll get let Nick give you a little bit of commentary. I think what we\u2019re seeing in the market with our increased guidance on disposition and development and our reduce guidance on acquisitions is pretty indicative of our outlook. I think you are going to see us accelerates and dispositions because we\u2019ve got more than ample opportunities on the development side to put that money to work, and I give Nick and give you a little bit more. Nick Anthony : Yes. And I think the reality is that we\u2019re always looking at improving our high quality portfolio through strategic dispositions. But the reality is the acquisition opportunities out there at regional prices are still pretty slim. So, we got to be very cautious about doing that. We don\u2019t want to accelerate and dispositions and not be able to redeploy the proceeds. Eric Frankel : And just a quick follow-up question. I just noticed with the start, I think this is referenced earlier. I know the new starts that your developing margins are a little bit thinner and even look like some of the build-to-suits are coming at a pretty high cost per square foot. So, can you just comment on the build-to-suit business and whether you\u2019re amortizing a lot of improvements since your costs basis and whether you\u2019re properly compensated for that? James Connor : No, that\u2019s not a problem, Eric. Yes, we\u2019ve all continue to see costs increase across the country. We talked about in previous calls and meetings we talked about the cost of land. The cost of entitling land, we talked a little bit earlier about construction costs. So yes, we\u2019ve continued to see prices go up. One of the reasons you probably have seen some erosion on those margins are or yield is we\u2019re not compromising our underwriting by amortizing a bunch of e-commerce, material handling equipment or everything else into our building. We\u2019ve been very consistent in terms of what goes in to the base of our buildings. So, we\u2019re very comfortable with the cost of those buildings because what these guys put in, they got to take out at the end of the lease, whether it\u2019s mezzanines, material handling, robotics, all of that stuff comes out and we\u2019ve got a good quality box. The other thing that\u2019s driving some of these costs increases, particularly on the larger buildings is the amount of parking, trailer storage, truck docks and clear heights that are going into these buildings. So today a million square foot building is 40 foot clear. A few years ago that would have been 32 or 36 foot clear. It\u2019s not uncommon to have 500 trailer spots that\u2019s two or three extra acres of land going in. So that\u2019s some of what you\u2019re seeing contributing and this in addition to land cost and construction costs. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Michael Carroll. Please go ahead. Michael Carroll : Jim or Nick, can you provide some color on the recent acquisition in Miami? I mean these deals are completed at low yield. Is that because you saw additional benefits from increasing scale in that market? Nick Anthony : Yes, that's a higher barrier market we're very focused on. The in place escalator on the existing leases are 2.5% to 3%. And we think long term rents are going to grow there at much higher pace and obviously Columbus Ohio. Michael Carroll : Okay. And then since you've lowered your acquisition guidance, should we assume Duke is less focus on the acquisition market going forward? Are you not seeing as many attractive deals available? Nick Anthony : We are very focused. We probably underwritten close to $2 billion worth of deals this year, but I think we're not seeing as many opportunities. And we're seeing a lot more opportunities on the development side to offset that. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Ki Bin Kim. Please go ahead. Ki Bin Kim : And my question is on development. So you guys have about $1 billion development pipeline of which, 55% fleet which is pretty amazing. But if you look at profit margin at the midpoint it's about 17%, you're earning about 40 basis points spread. Some of your peers because they're growing more spec, we seen might be much higher rate to fit the 300 basis points spread. So my question is, when you start thinking about development philosophically about your pipeline. How you think about allocating capital to build to suite at which seems like to be a very low spread versus spec? And one of the factors I was thinking about and as a fact that maybe have a deep personnel bench development team. Does that make you ultimately run faster on the treadmill because you had to put people at work? Is that part of that decision making process? James Connor : Let me take the last question first. We're not interested in keeping people busy. Our people are plenty busy. And in terms of the spreads of the yields on the build-to-suite, everyone obviously everyone that we do we've approved, we don\u2019t approved a lot of those deals, because it's competitive marketplace out there. And we may have underwritten something a little bit more considerably than some of our peers. So in spite of our pretty strong track record, we don't win them all or we don't choose to necessarily pursue them all. But as we've talked in the past, there is competitive pressures out there and there are some deals getting done at some various in margins. In terms of the amount of spec, Ki Bin, we thought long and hard about that over the years and we debated internally from time-to-time. And we remain consistent to what we said when we started this cycle, which was this cycle isn't going to last forever. And we're going to keep that development pipeline above 50%. You're right, we could probably tell you that we were going to get better theoretical margins, but high risk high reward. Not all spec projects deliver what they're underwritten to. And at this point in the cycle, I don't think it's a prudent to be turning up on the aggressive scale and doing more and more spec development. Particularly when we've got ample build-to-suite opportunities we've got great leasing spec leasing volume going on to be able keep it there. Ki Bin Kim : And just one accounting question maybe for mark. With a new lease accounting change, I think you guys had already put a lot of thought into it. Last week, you capitalized about $19 million for internal leasing costs. I know this accounting change is not -- it\u2019s not just a pure good thing, there is something that will have unintended detriment to companies like you who have skill, but maybe you can provide some comments on how much you think will impact your report FFO next year and maybe any other comments behind it? Mark Denien : Sure, Ki Bin. Yes, you\u2019re right. I mean it\u2019s sort of complicated and I think this was an unintended consequences the accounting literature. It wasn\u2019t really directed at us. It was directed more on the lesser side. Nonetheless, we\u2019re doing with it. We have a leasing team in-house fully staff. We do all of our leasing in-house, obviously, we pay out several brokers on the tenant side, but we do all of our own representation on our side. And we pay our people on a combination of salary, bonus and commission. And under the new accounting only the commission will be able to be capitalized under the current accounting it's a portion or if you\u2019re effective on the leasing you do, it\u2019s a lot of the salary and bonus as well. Not to mention dedicated attorneys for example. We have an in-house leasing legal team and under the current accounting, we can capitalize the cost for that. Under the new accounting you can. Some of our peers and whether it\u2019d be in our sector other sectors outsourced a lot of those functions. So, they\u2019re writing checks to law firms and they\u2019re writing checks to brokerage houses. We\u2019ve done our own analysis from the amount of those checks that they\u2019re writing versus the payroll costs in our house or we believe we\u2019re doing a cheaper at a minimum. We\u2019re doing it for equal. We\u2019re doing it more for ourselves. So we think our business model is the right business model on the accounting to us is secondary. Having said all that you\u2019re right it\u2019s probably a $0.04 to $0.05 difference in recorded FFO from the old accounting to the new and it will be -- what will be expensing that extra $0.04 or $0.05? Our plan right now is to adjust our core FFO so that we\u2019re apples-to-apples with our own reporting from year -- from current year to next year. But also apples-to-apples with peers whether it\u2019d be in our no sector or other sectors that are outsourcing that and paying same dollars, but capitalizing and running expense again. So we will, and we do plan on adjusting for that. So the way we look at it, we like our business model, the way it is, we think it adds value and we\u2019re going to keep doing what we do. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Tom Catherwood. Please go ahead. Tom Catherwood : Jim, question for you. I want to circle back to the question on oversupply and look at it slightly different angle. Are there any markets where labor availability could limit tenant demand? And how could that impact your capital allocation decisions? James Connor : Yes. Tom, that\u2019s a great question. For the first time since I\u2019ve been in this crazy business. We as a developer have started doing labor analytic studies. Anytime, we go to buy a big site or anytime we go to build a building because we want to have the answer to the question before we\u2019ve got the investment made. So it does drive a lot of our investment capital allocation decisions today. If you spend any time out in business parks, you\u2019ve always seen help wanted. Now hiring signs, you\u2019ll see them more than ever and that does affect decisions that the tenants are making, when they\u2019re out in the marketplace, whether they\u2019re doing spec leasing or they\u2019re doing build-to-suit. They\u2019re very, very concerned about labor. So, we have that ammunition upfront so that we\u2019re comfortable when we\u2019ve made an investment in a site for development in South Florida or the Lehigh Valley or we go to build a building we know the answer to the question in terms of our clients ability to get labor in there what it's going to cost what the ability is. Tom Catherwood : Mark, question for you. Can you remind me other than maturities how they kind of roll in for the loans outstanding from the MOB portfolio sale? And when those are paid back, do you have to do 1031 exchanges to avoid tax impacts? Mark Denien : Yes, Tom, it's right around $115 million a year. And it's called a give or take June of each year. So, it will come in June of '19, June of 2020, and there is a little payment and early '21. And no, we do not need to do 1031. We basically just deferred the game on those into the years that the cash comes in and that will be taxable income and the year comes in, but we planned that where we had a cushion and it wouldn't cause any issues. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Eric Frankel. Please go ahead. Eric Frankel : Thanks just a couple of quick follow-ups. One, I noticed a lot of your start this quarter were in Atlanta and that seems to be a market that's always targeted as one with a lot of developers and suppliers. And maybe just you can comment on prospects there? And second, I think there was that news article this morning from Cranes that highlighted that Bridge development with developer whom you bought here large portfolio last year. They're under contracted to buy a large site in Brooklyn. Maybe it sounds like you're going to picking a pretty massive development in terms of dollar value. So maybe wanted your thoughts on developing the burrows in the future? James Conor : Yes, sure, Eric. In terms of Atlanta, a little bit of it is timing, but we do develop in Atlanta in a number of different submarkets and some of those are larger bulk buildings on a couple of those are what I would called mid-sized multi-tenant building. So when we look at that, when we made those decisions particularly on the last couple, we wanted to make sure we were comfortable with our risk and our exposure land and portfolio it is really good shape right now. So we're comfortable with those decisions. In terms of Bridge, we knew they were going to take the money, we gave them go out spend it somewhere. So I haven't heard that they were under contract in Brooklyn, but good for them. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we do have a question from the line of Michael Mueller. Please go ahead. . Michael Mueller : Just the quick one market exposure. Looking at Page 11 in the sup and the occupancies and for the stabilizing service, the one market that seems to just jump out at DC Baltimore which around 90% and everything else is closer to 100. Just curious, if you can give us little color on that market? James Conor : Yes, we've got one spec building there that came in service earlier this year, Mike. And I think we've got, I think we're about to commit as substantial piece of that. And our holdings there are not that significant compared to some of our others. So on a percentage occupancy basis, it looks a little low, but I think it's really a couple of 100,000 square feet. So it's not really high on our radar, and I think we've got decent activity. And I would say we'll have some substantial leasing done next quarter. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And it does appear at this time, there are no further questions from the phone lines. Please continue James Connor : Thanks Brad. I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today. We look forward to reconvening in our third quarter call scheduled for October 25th. Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using the AT&T Executive Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Emily, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Also note, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tracy Ward. Tracy, you may begin. Tracy Ward : Thanks, Emily, and good morning everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2018 conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under Federal Securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings. Additionally our third quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures and in accordance with Reg G we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. This morning, we'll hear from Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover results and guidance; and then Hamid Moghadam, our Chairman and CEO, who will comment on the Company's outlook. Gary Anderson, Chris Caton, Mike Curless, Ed Nekritz, Gene Reilly, and Colleen McKeown are also here with us today. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom and we'll get started. Tom Olinger : Thanks, Tracy. Good morning and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. First, I'll start with an update on our $8.5 billion acquisition of DCT. Our financial and operating results reflect this mid-quarter transaction which closed on August 22. The integration went exceptionally well and is complete and we refinanced the $1.8 billion debt we assumed in the transaction at an average interest rate of 2.4% in a term of over 13 years. We've already hit our expected annual synergies run rate of $80 million with the vast majority of that in cash savings. Now, our focus is on realizing the incremental $40 million of future annual value creation from development and revenue synergies. Turning to market conditions, fundamentals remain healthy and well located space continues to be in high demand. There were several notable bankruptcies announced recently and our exposure to these firms is minimal. These customers leased from us about less than 30 basis points of our net effective rent. We've been monitoring these companies for some time and are confident we'll be able to quickly lease up any spaces we get back from these customers at higher rent given they're approximately 10% below market. Broadly we feel very good about our business. Market rents across our portfolio are growing in line with our forecast with Europe slightly ahead. Switching to results, core FFO for the third quarter was $0.72 per share. Our share of cash same store NOI growth was 5.9%, led by the U.S. at 7.1%. Our share net effective rent change on roll was more than 22% and was also led by the U.S. at over 30%. Occupancy was up more than 120 basis points year-over-year to 97.5%, with Europe at 98%, up 260 basis points over the same period. Leasing volume totaled approximately 37 million square feet with an average term of more than five years. This includes 5.3 million square feet of development leasing. Development stabilizations in the third quarter had an estimated margin of 36%, bringing our year-to-date total value creation of $475 million. So far this year we've realized $329 million in gains on the monetization of development projects. Disposition and contribution activity in the quarter was approximately $460 million. As previously announced, we closed the $1.1 billion sale to Maple Tree in early October with our share of the proceeds totaling over $600 million. We expect to close the second phase of this transaction totaling $170 million by year end. During the quarter we reduced our weighted average interest rate to 2.7% and extended our weighted average term to six years through the issuance of long duration tenors up to 30 years. Our balance sheet remains one of the best in the business and we continue to access capital globally at attractive terms. Our $3.5 billion of liquidity and over $6 billion in potential fund rebalancing allow us flexibility to self fund our development well into the next decade. This substantial amount of dry powder positions us to capitalize on attractive deployment opportunities as market dislocations arise. Looking forward, I know many of you are looking for 2019 guidance but you'll have to wait until our fourth quarter call, as this is our normal practice. For 2018 guidance, I'll cover the highlights on our share basis. So, for complete detail refer to Page 5 of our supplemental. Also note, our guidance includes the impact of the DCT acquisition. We're maintaining the midpoint of our cash same-store NOI range of 6.5%. For net promote income, we're forecasting approximately $0.05 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.13 for the full year. Our share of net deployment proceeds at the midpoint remains unchanged at $350 million. We are nearing the range for 2018 core FFO to between $3.01 and $3.03 per share. To put this in context, when we laid out our three year plan at our investor forum in November 2016, we called for 7% to 8% percent annual growth excluding promotes. At the midpoint of our 2018 guidance, we'll have averaged 9.3% for the first two years far exceeding this plan. Importantly this will be achieved while completing the realignment of our portfolio and reducing our leverage by almost 500 basis points. With that, I'll turn it over to Hamid. Hamid Moghadam : Thanks, Tom. I'll keep my remarks brief as our results were once again strong and straight forward. I'd like to address four key areas. First, I know many of you are focused on topics of trade, tariff and retailer bankruptcies, which have dominated the news lately. As you might imagine, we're keenly focused on these potential risk as well. But to date we've seen no measurable impact on our business. Sure, if we search real hard we can point to one or two companies who backed out our lease negotiations in the U.S. but the impact of those isolated cases was negligible in the context of our overall leasing volume. There are plenty of other customers that are waiting in line for quality space and are frustrated by the shortage of suitable options. In fact our latest forecast for the U.S. this year has revised up net absorption by 15% to 260 million square feet. Completions in 2018 will fall short of demand for the ninth consecutive year, this time by an estimated 10 million square feet. Second, I want to talk about Europe which remains a bright spot for us. Our markets in continental Europe are strong and getting stronger, vacancies are at historic lows, customer sentiment is improving, and escalating replacement costs are driving up rental rates. In spite of somewhat moderating rents in the U.K., overall rent growth in Europe for the first three quarters has already made 2018 the strong year more than a decade. Looking to 2019, there's a real possibility that market rent growth in Europe could overtake that of a very strong U.S. market which is great news for us in terms of continued same store growth well into the next decade. Third, our multi-year disposition plan is now complete. Since the Prologis-AMB merger in 2011, we sold more than $14 billion in non-strategic assets and reinvested the proceeds into acquisitions and development, the combination of which increased our percentage of holdings in global markets from 79% to approximately 90% today. I'm very proud of our team who worked tirelessly to accomplish this long term objective. As a result, our portfolio has never been in as good a shape as it is today. While we realize the benefits of this high quality portfolio in the good times the real differentiation will become apparent in tougher market environments. Fourth, as we close this chapter in our Company's evolution, we enter a new era where we can capitalize on the tremendous benefits that come from scale. These benefits include one of the lowest cost to capital in the industry, unparalleled purchasing power, the most streamlined and efficient organizational structure, and intense focus on customer service, the ability to invest in innovation and technology, and down the road the opportunity to capitalize on proprietary data opportunities, all for the benefit of customers. We worked hard to create these advantages and look forward to putting them into action to create value well beyond the NAV of our underlying real estate. Emily, let's open the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Craig Mailman from KeyBanc Capital Market. Your line is open. Craig Mailman : I know this question kind of being asked in the past but just given where retention rates were this quarter, I think the highest in the past two years along with your commentary about the focus on proximity, just curious updated thoughts here on the tenants ability to absorb further increases how hard your team is pushing? I guess I'm just surprised that you're able to push 11% cash-rent spread and still keep 82% of tenants. So, maybe just an update on the environment and maybe where the mark-to-market is and how you guys feel that's trending? Hamid Moghadam : The markets are really strong and that's why we're getting these increases. And not every discussion with every tenant starts out with the intention of them staying, in fact many of them when they hear about the new rent get a little spooked and when they go shop the market they tend to come back and renew their lease because what we told them was an indication of where the market was. So, we're doing our best to push down retention but obviously not hard enough. So, we'll work harder in future quarters. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeremy Metz : Sticking with rents and your comments about Europe accelerating and could actually maybe pass the U.S. next year, I was wondering if you guys can give a little more - perhaps a market specific color on where you're seeing the most acceleration in Europe and conversely where in the U.S. you're starting to see things moderate the most? And then in terms of the continuing trade fight year that we're overseeing with China, are you starting to see and seeing any impact from your tenants particularly on the West Coast where you have more that import exposure? Hamid Moghadam : So, I don't know why that statement led to the conclusion that actually we've seen a couple of notes that have been published and just because we think Europe is going to do really well on a relative basis, that means the U.S. is going to do less well. That wasn't our intent. The U.S. is doing extremely well. Europe was later in recovery and has more to recover and we're getting it more all at once, we think in 2019. 2018 was really the turning point for Europe and we just see that spread accelerating going forward. We fully expect the U.S. to continue to be a strong market. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we haven't seen really other than one or two tenants and we sat around this table and talked really hard about the examples that we would come up with these for you guys, but we could come up with two that were possibly customers that decided not to go forward with the leases because of potential trade wars. Now, put that in the context of 289 leases that we signed last quarter. So\u2026 Jeremy Metz : In the U.S. only. Hamid Moghadam : \u2026in the U.S. only. So, it's really irrelevant. I mean, I can think of 20 other reasons why tenants stopped negotiating or a drop out of a negotiation, and certainly the trade stuff has not yet in anyway translated to any action on the ground that we can tell. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Steve Sakwa : Hamid, I was hoping you could maybe just talk a little bit about the development business and given the rise in import prices and steel and concrete. I'm just curious how you're looking at the development business today and whether you feel like that volume could accelerate into next year? Hamid Moghadam : I don't think the volume would accelerate into next year. But give us another quarter to really refine our numbers and come back to you on that. We're not really ready to talk about that but when we talked about our thesis for rent growth many years ago now, a lot of it was recovery from obviously the global financial crisis. But if you may remember and you will remember because you were there, we talked about the next leg being escalating replacement costs that are going to provide an umbrella for pricing product and that's happening right now. Construction cost have been gone up at double digit rates in the U.S. We don't like it but it translates into higher rents. And as you can see from our margins, they roughly doubled. The margins on completions is double the margins on starts because as good a job as we try to do on figuring out what margins are on starts, we've been surprised by rental growth beyond our projections, and to be perfectly candid, more CapEx compression than we ever hoped for. So, so far the construction costs are not affecting margins or development decisions.. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman from Citi. Your line is open. Manny Korchman : Hamid, if we expect to sort of tenant discussions, has there been any changes in the pace of leasing especially for developments or spec developments and the time that is taking tenants to make decisions on whether to take a spot or not? Gene Reilly : Manny, this is Gene. That's a very good question. So we track the time it takes from when we commence a conversation with a customer through the entire leasing process to completion. And there's four steps and I won't get into the details but basically that time frame is about 46 days at this point and it has stayed relatively stable over time. So that's something we watch really carefully, how long is the gestation period for a deal. So, so far no change to it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Jamie Feldman : So, I just wanted to focus on the guidance. So, if you add up the other assumptions from the press release, it looks like those items add up to about a net almost a penny of higher guidance. So, I'm just curious like what was the offset or the drag that kind of kept your number as it is? And then also as you think about the DCT integration, can you just talk about things that were better than you expected, things that were worse than you expected as you put the two portfolios together? Tom Olinger : Jamie, this is Tom. So, on your first question on the guidance, I think when you think about guidance, you need to look at it for the full year. We've increased guidance meaningfully over the full year both on core and on promotes. As we get into the back half of the year, particularly Q4, we've got very little role. So your ability to move that number with higher market rents and the like is limited. As it relates to DCT, we hit our synergies right on the mark. We did outperform on the cash piece of interest but when you look at actually what's running through the GAAP income statement, we were again right on the mark. So we feel good about hitting those synergies and particularly how well and quickly we've integrated the portfolio. Hamid Moghadam : Yes, we also had about $0.60 of - not $0.60, $0.06 of extra, you know if you will - what do you call it, severance and other charges related to some turnover which was anticipated and planned for. So, actually I think we did better than we thought we would do and if we didn't have that we would do even better than that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust. Your line is open. Ki Bin Kim : Hamid, can you provide an early glimpse into some of your big data initiatives and some of the services you're trying to develop for your customers and how you see that evolving and perhaps impacting your business over time? Hamid Moghadam : Yes, too early to talk about the data stuff, that's more of a three to five year thing. We're working right now on revenue management, that's the first initiative for big data. On that one we'll have something to talk about early next year. But on the other initiatives for customers, let me ask Gary to talk about some of those. Gary Anderson : Yes, so, Ki Bin, we have setup a procurement organization and I think we discussed this in the past and that is up and running today, focused both on sort of G&A, OpEx, and CapEx activities. We're also focusing on our construction supply chain. So, taking advantage of the sort of $2 billion plus in hard cost spend and what we're looking at now is to really support our customers - particularly the smallest customers relative to their paying point. So, anything that they need with respect to moving into a facility, we're looking at providing. And we're really in a process right now of rolling out an MVP product and testing it in a couple of markets. More to follow I think next year though with respect to what that really means with respect to earnings and revenues. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Vikram Malhotra : Sticking to sort of rent growth - and this is really maybe a six month and year sort of question. You talked about the first leg being recovery, second leg of it essentially being the higher cost. I wanted to get a bit more color on your rent growth versus market assumes no market rent growth but it also assumes that logistics as a percent of the real estate, as a percent of supply chain or real estate as a percent of supply chain does not really change. Can you talk about if you were able to see more efficiencies whether it's transport or warehouse operations, how could that rent growth spectrum be elongated, if you can give us some sense of any sensitivity that you may have done or any\u2026? Hamid Moghadam : So, Vikram, that's an excellent question. And I really invite you to go look at the last three papers that Chris Caton and his team have put out. Because that's really the heart of the question that we try to answer in those, and I'm not going to do a justice. But fundamentally 3% to 5% of supply chain cost are warehouse rents and obviously there are lots of savings because of ecommerce you're eliminating some retail rents, not everything is going in ecommerce but some of it is. And over time, transportation and labor costs are probably going to go down. In the short term they're actually going up because of oil prices and the labor costs, but in the long term they're coming down because of renewables, autonomous, driving in trucks and more automation being introduced in these buildings. So we think for locations that are really special and that is the real close infill stuff that does not have substitute. Customers can pay not 5% more, or 10% more they can pay double or triple. I mean think of it as the old retail or retail minus type of price sensitivity because the turn of those spaces is really high and there is very little of them. And by the way they are not going to look like a traditional 36 foot clear warehouse with doors galore. I mean they\u2019re going be all kinds of spaces that are funky and maybe older and much more infill and we got lots of those in our portfolio. So, on that segment the price sensitivity is very low it\u2019s all about service levels and serving the customer in a quick window. So there you could have very significant doubling, tripling of rents and we're seeing to some extent examples of that as we\u2019re rolling over in those spaces. And as we are frankly building new multistory infill product the rents have been very encouraging on that. The stuff that\u2019s further out and there's more land and more competition, I think you can expect a - normal rate of growth on that because it's not quite as scarce as the really infill stuff. So I would differentiate it between those and it\u2019s not a binary thing it's just a continuous relationship the closer you get to the customer and the more infill the need becomes the less price sensitivity you have at this point in the cycle. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Blaine Heck : Thanks. Related to that I just wanted to get a little color on asset pricing here it seems as though we've seen cap rates holding steady or even continuing to decrease in the infill and coastal markets given the kind of wall of capital that continues to flow into those locations. So, I\u2019m wondering if you're seeing any markets where maybe there has been an inflection and you\u2019re seeing cap rates increase at all as interest rates have crept up recently. Mike Curless : Blaine, this is Mike. We\u2019re certainly not seen any isolated markets and conversely just continue to see additional cap rate compression and in fact seems some other portfolios that are out in the market we\u2019re continue to be very encouraging in which way pricing is going. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Guinee from Stifel. Your line is open. John Guinee : Sort of one multi-phased question. First your thoughts on prop 13 in California. Second I think you retrofitted an industrial building and delivered a powered shelf Amazon web services in Northern Virginia a while ago sold it as sub five cap. So are you active in the data center build to suit at all. And then third what's your current thinking on Amazon's newest prototype which I've heard is maybe 100 to 150 foot floor plate but 120 foot vertical for their infill distribution business? Hamid Moghadam : Let me try to hit them quickly and maybe the guys can elaborate. Prop 13 not this time probably in the next election, we\u2019re going to get it in 2020 or 2022 I mean at some point that's where the money is and that's where the competitions are kind of looks. So I think you probably will have a split actual that is my guess. In Northern Virginia we don't really start out building data centers we even start out building our traditional office warehouse product and customers come to us because of the unique attributes to those locations and has a lot more rent, better credit and longer term leases. And they put in all the improvements for data centers. So nice good there, but not because we\u2019re so smart, it's just because that location has some unique characteristics. And finally on Amazon prototype let me not specifically talk about Amazon, but generally you could imagine that people who need distribution space in major cities has to go more vertical to use up less land because these markets are totally out of land. So, anybody who can go multilayer and squeeze more density on a smaller piece of land is going to try doing that. Mike do you want to say anything more about that. Mike Curless : Yes, I mean we\u2019re obviously staying very close to what\u2019s going on with Amazon because they lead the market in terms of trends. We have plenty of activity underway to understand there ever changing needs and we\u2019re on top of it as you\u2019d expect we\u2019re going to be in the middle of those discussions going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Your line is open. Nick Yulico : I want to turn back to the tariff issue. I mean the data when you look at it for the LA Long Beach ports shows it's the most exposed to the Chinese tariff issue, net import markets by a wide margin also is more exposure to Chinese imports and the rest of the U.S. So when we think about your Southern California portfolio your largest market, perhaps you could just dig into that regional bid and understand how tariffs could potentially impact demand for space over the next year. Imagine and it\u2019s not an issue for the entire portfolio there, but only some portion of it love to hear your thoughts? Hamid Moghadam : We\u2019d love to buy more real estate in LA. So if you think anybody is spooked by the trades and tariffs, turn them our way we\u2019d like to increase our position. That is the most dynamic market in the U.S. the LA base and the accounts were well over 50% of what comes in to that region. And California is now the number five economy in the world. So we love that market and everyday you got costs going up entitlements are getting tougher, real supply constraints not just in terms of physical land, but in terms of all the other stuff hoops that you have to jump through to be able to build the building. So we love those markets. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Derek Johnston : Could we follow up on the densification? Could you guys talk about your multilevel warehouse strategy just give us an update on the lease up of your Seattle project if you could and how our approvals going for your project in San Fran. And are there any updates to the six markets which you feel could be potentially caped for these types of developments in the future? Hamid Moghadam : Let\u2019s start with the last one. No, our feeling is that the real opportunities in those six markets and there are couple of other global markets we would add to that London would be certainly one of them, Paris is the other one in Europe. And the ones in Asia that we can act on is primarily Japan so limited number of markets but a fairly substantial opportunity. The development approval process for San Francisco is a multi-year process. We\u2019re going to have to go through a significant EIR process, but you know our San Francisco does want to preserve those kinds of jobs because a lot of them have been eliminated by conversion of those buildings PDR buildings to office space and the like. So they actually look at those kinds of living way jobs in these buildings as a good thing. So you can\u2019t predict these political issues but while we wait we\u2019re clipping in 5%, 6% return on that site and we\u2019ll be very patient in terms of securing the ultimate approval. It\u2019s a big project so it\u2019s going to take awhile. With respect to Seattle, substantial completion is going to be at the end of the month and we have activities for well over 100% of the space. So I would expect by the end of the first quarter will be full up there at very strong rents much stronger than we underwrote. Remember a three story product nobody has ever had experience with it so you really need people to see the product up and running and if you haven\u2019t seen it, I would encourage you to go look at it it's pretty impressive. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tom Catherwood from BTIG. Your line is open. Tom Catherwood : Moving over to labor for a second, in September you guys announced a community workforce initiative in Southern California with unemployment kind of a low which has been in 50 years. How do you incorporate workforce capacity into your investment decisions? And are you seeing your tenants either look to different markets to gain access to labor or make additional investments in automation to make up for a smaller employee base? Hamid Moghadam : Yes, so with respect to labor being an important issue I mean we think it's so important that we've added a section to our investment committee memos where we value the acquisitions and developments that covers labor availability directly. On our community workforce initiative let me turn it over to Ed Nekritz whose been running with that. Ed Nekritz : So we introduced our first program in LA and the conversation with the customers now about something other than rent, it\u2019s about how do we make their lives better. How do we help their jobs and what we\u2019re doing with that is internship programs in our communities where we\u2019re developing assets - and making sure that our customers are tied in to our customers. Our customers our tied into our the labor needs and we are focused on making sure that these students, young students have the ability to get jobs in their communities, stay in their communities, create better economies for the labor and our pool over operating. Hamid Moghadam : Yes, we\u2019re not going to set up if you will nonprofits all around the country to improve the labor situation. What we\u2019re really doing is finding the best NGOs that are in this business and we're supporting them with our capital and supporting them with employment opportunities following graduation and completion of the program. So it\u2019s really about bridge building and supporting it with capital and we\u2019re quite serious about this. And I think it's a really important thing for us to do. There is a whole other discussion about the social impact of this and you know limited opportunities for our high school kids and all that with a lot of the traditional jobs going away. So, we think it\u2019s important that we take the leadership on this initiative. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Michael Carroll : Can you guys talk a little bit about your initiative to pursue more gross leases to the marketplace today versus the net leases? How aggressive is Prologis in the market right now of pursuing those and what has tenants responses has been, have they liked the new structure of going to gross versus a net lease structure? Gene Reilly : Michael, this is Gene. So the lease you\u2019re talking about we call the clear lease and it is effectively a gross lease structure. A 100% of all leases in the United States today and in Mexico soon in Europe are proposed as clear leases. So we\u2019re taking this very seriously. I think we have something like 70%/75% adoption at this point so we've done 100s of these leases already. And in terms of the customer reaction it\u2019s been overwhelmingly positive more so than we expected. And just to touch on this, this is really about simplifying the lives of our customers and frankly the lives of our people who manage these properties and so some parts are going great. Hamid Moghadam : I mean - by the way they have the reason Gene said almost gross leases is that the property taxes are excluded from that calculation. But in other words the tenants get the builds from property taxes directly because we\u2019re not in position to control those any better than they are. But if you really look at the structure of our business it\u2019s crazy, I mean we're asking a tenant who may have one location in one city, a 100,000 square-foot small to medium-sized business to underwrite for snow removal and fixing our dock levelers and fixing our air conditioning units and all that. And really it sets up for very, very unusual situation where they gladly pay the rent which is the big number and then we spent all our lives negotiating nickels and dimes of these little things. We\u2019re in a much better position to underwrite those costs because we got a big portfolio though we can spread it over. And we have good purchasing power to drive economics with vendors by aggregating all this demand. So the way the business was done historically was when the industry was fragmented and the landlords had one or two buildings. I think when you get to our kind of scale we got to put that scale to use for our customers and ultimately that translates into rents that ultimately flows to our investors. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel from Green Street Advisor. Your line is open. Eric Frankel : Just a few quick questions. First just regarding development you start this quarter and margins were a little bit better than what we see in the last three quarters. So I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s a mix issue related to build to suit. My second question is related to G&A, can you just comment on the severance and turnover that you have within your team. And then third, I just noted in your same-store statistics your operating expense did increase a good amount over 5% and so I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s all real estate taxes and so wouldn\u2019t be affected by your new gross lease structure? Thank you. Tom Olinger : I'll start with your last two questions so on the increase and expenses in the same-store forward what you\u2019re seeing as the impact of reimbursable expenses which hit both revenues and expenses. If you back that component out, I think you\u2019re going to see rents grow at around 4.5% and expenses grow like 60 basis points. So it\u2019s all reimbursement noise you\u2019re seeing around through there. On the G&A question, it was really as Hamid mentioned we have done some restructuring and making some investments in personnel around technology. And as a result, we were bringing in people and some people have left and you\u2019re seeing those expenses go through and that would be the main component of the G&A. Hamid Moghadam : Yes. I\u2019m not going to get into the details of our personnel decisions on our earnings call that for sure. With respect to margins Eric, I'll take mid-30s margin everyday and we thank our blessings. We go into this stuff thinking that we\u2019ll then get 15. So the fact that we're getting more than double that is good news and I can't possibly see how that could be anything other than good news. But it\u2019s not going to last forever I mean the margin in this business - have historically been in their low to mid-teens and that's what we're assuming in all our activity and that's how we\u2019re underwriting stuff and to the extent we get better than that we\u2019re blessed. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael Mueller : Is the market rent growth in Europe does go ahead of the U.S. next year in 2019. How long until the same thing happens with rents spreads and NOI growth? Hamid Moghadam : A while because you need many years of rental growth to create that spread. The mark-to-market in Europe I think the last time I looked at is around 10% its 9% or 10% and obviously it's in the high teens in the U.S. what is it 19% or so. 19%, so the U.S. is double what Europe is and you need to have a couple of years of pretty steep rental growth that are not been captured by the role of releases to widen that wedge. So you know awhile I don\u2019t know I haven\u2019t done the math but awhile. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman from Citi. Your line is open. Manny Korchman : Just thinking about dispositions discussion in light of the DCT deal, should we expect disposition volumes to increase next year because you have those assets within DCT you want to sell do you think that pace will be consistent with what you've done in the last couple of years? Hamid Moghadam : So Manny as I mentioned in my prepared remarks in the last seven years of the merger we sold $14 billion real estate that\u2019s 2 billion a year or 0.5 billion in a quarter. And we talked about DCT being $560 million of nonstrategic assets. We are in no hurry to do that and at our historical pace that\u2019s a quarter worth of work. So it\u2019s not at all a big deal, but we're not in a hurry to do that as far as we're concerned the big strategic part of the disposition program is done and over with, with the Maple Tree transaction the last one that we announced and it subsequent phase. And of course even if you turn over and call 1% to 2% of a $90 billion portfolio, you could have $1 billion to $2 billion of sales every year and we're certainly going to do that in the normal course of action. Business when somebody comes to us and offers - a user comes to us and offers a price that we can\u2019t refuse or the person next door wants to control our site at the premium price, there are always going to be opportunities to call the portfolio profitably and we\u2019ll be always looking out for that. But that sort of different than a nonstrategic disposition program that program has come to an end. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Harris from Uniplan. Your line is open. David Harris : It's not clear at the moment whether we're going to get a hard Brexit or a soft Brexit. Could you just explain how you're positioned around this and what your contingency planning and also if we do get a hard Brexit next spring, would that affect your view that Europe will be as positive as you first outlined? Hamid Moghadam : Well yes, I wish I knew all those answers with precision I mean I don't know. Our U.K. portfolio is in the high 90% lease, the average lease term in the U.K. is well over 10 years. The credit is exceptional as you know particularly the U.K. is a tough place to get entitlements and processing land is a multiyear exercise. So we think the - and the U.K. has been on fire. Literally I would put U.K. right on top of the list since the global financial crisis in terms of rent recovery and performance compared to the best of the best markets in the U.S. I mean LA, San Francisco and all that. You would expect that to moderate at some point I don\u2019t if its related to Brexit or not but still I would take the U.K. as one of the best markets in Europe or anywhere. It\u2019s just not as crazy as it was a year or two ago. Year or two ago you had Brexit that spooked up a lot of people that were planning to put on development and demand didn\u2019t change so you had a very, very unusual situation that led to very big rent increases. But we\u2019re very comfortable about the business in the U.K. Gene Reilly : David the other side of that is just - we obviously - you can see we have significant liquidity and financial capacity on our balance sheet and in our funds. So if there's an opportunity for us to take advantage of we will certainly do that. Hamid Moghadam : I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll get that chance. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel from Green Street Advisor. Your line is open. Eric Frankel : Just a clarification and another follow-up question. Just regarding development, I\u2019m just referring to development start this quarter so I think you have development profit margin of 17% which is I guess the lowest bid cycles. So I\u2019m just trying to understand how that\u2019s emanating whether it\u2019s a construction cost issue or whether it just more competitive in terms of development environment. And then obviously I don\u2019t want to get too much into what guidance is going to look like next year but part of the rationale for the DCT deal if that will be better external growth opportunity relate to that. So I\u2019d assume that there would be also higher overall development volume as a result of having our larger asset base and more opportunities to grow with your customers. So I was hoping you can remark on that? Thank you. Hamid Moghadam : As you go through the cycle couple of things happen. You use up the really old lower basis land at book value. And therefore everything else being the same your margins are going to go down because we now have used up more and more of really old basis land and you're buying more land on the margin of market. So you would expect pro forma margins to go down on starts and we\u2019re pretty conservative about those. And I don't think, yes you correctly point out the pro forma margins on starts is the lowest it\u2019s ever been, but it\u2019s twice as big as it should be. So we don't lose a lot of sleep over that honestly. And in every case it\u2019s come in higher then what we performed right so we\u2019re pretty comfortable with those. I\u2019m not sure I got your second question, second part of your question is that, oh, DCT part. Look on DCT, to answer your question very clearly you would have had to have known what our development volume would have been without DCT and then you can compare it to whatever we guide to next quarter and reach your own conclusions. But I think the easier way to do that would be just to look at the development that we\u2019re doing on the DCT land in the near-term and that will give you a very good indication of the extra volume that we\u2019re doing. Tom Olinger : Yes, so Eric just put some numbers around that in '18 we\u2019ll do about 100 more 100 million more in development than we otherwise would without DCT. And then we had a land bank that supports 500 million to 600 million of additional development. And when we give you guidance for 2019 that will be embedded in it how much of it, what we will do I can tell you at this point but for sure will expand the volume a bit. Hamid Moghadam : Yes just to be clear, I mean we feel great about the DCT deal I mean the only reason that we did it is that we think long-term it\u2019s really accretive, actually short-term and long-term it very accretive to our business. And we love the quality of the portfolio. So you'll see those numbers coming through our growth rate is going to be pretty good. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman from KeyBanc Capital Market. Your line is open. Craig Mailman : Just a few follow-ups, as it relates to guidance for development starts and dispositions looks you have some wood to chop here in the fourth quarter. Just curious on what the pipelines look like there. And then just second Tom you had noted it would have been I think around 4.5% same-store revenue growth this quarter if you pull out the reimbursable impact. Do you've kind of how that's trended over the last two to three quarters on the same basis? Tom Olinger : Craig I\u2019ll take your second one first, I think we've been kind of in that zone of around 4% when you strip out, and that makes sense when you look at our rent change and what you're saying that would be - I'll check that but I think that's in the zone of what we're saying. And then on your other question on starts and dispo guidance, remember, we just closed in early October a $1.1 billion Maple Tree transaction. We've got another $170 million in the second phase that's right behind to better close this year, and the balance on - so that's the dispo side and I'll let Mike address the starts. Mike Curless : Yes, to put a finer point on that with those two incremental closings, we're 85% away to the work to be done on disposition. This time last year we were been about 60%, so way ahead of the game there. With respect to our confidence in the development starts volume, we had the last couple of years have done approximately a $1 billion in each of the four quarters. Our visibility to the remaining pipeline is as high as it's ever been in this quarter and we feel very confident in our ability to do those kind of numbers through the end of this quarter. Hamid Moghadam : Yes, development is always back-end-loaded into the fourth quarter. It's just the way the business works or something. Anyway, Craig, thank you for that question. It's the last one, and I want to thank everybody for joining our call. Look forward to talking to you at May week. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Also note that this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tracy Ward. Tracy, you may begin. Tracy Ward : Thanks, Kim, and good morning everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2018 conference call. The supplemental document is available on our Web site at prologis.com under Investor Relations. I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under Federal Securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings. Additionally, our fourth quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures and in accordance with Reg G, we have provided reconciliation to those measures. This morning, we'll hear from Hamid Moghadam, our Chairman and CEO who will comment on the Company's outlook. Then Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover results and guidance; Gary Anderson, Chris Caton, Mike Curless, Ed Nekritz, Gene Reilly, and Colleen McKeown are also here with us today. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Hamid. Hamid Moghadam : Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. We had a great fourth quarter capping out our strongest year ever, and Tom will go over the details of all that later. What I want to do right off the bat is to address the issues that are probably top of mind for most of you. Namely, what we're seeing in the up to the minute data, what we're hearing from our customers and the steps we're taking to manage through this period of increased uncertainty. First, let me start with what we know. The proprietary forward-looking operating metrics, which we monitor regularly, such as showing average deal gestation period and lease conversion rates are holding steady. We signed 17 million square feet of leases in December and in the first 20 days of January, usually the slowest part of the year. Based on specific data, which we can elaborate on in Q&A, customer interest is robust. We expect activity to remain strong with our most dynamic customers building out new and improved logistics networks. While we haven't seen any softness even in the slower growing segments, we wouldn't be surprised if some users hit the pause button until they saw further clarity on the direction of the economy. Now for what we think this means. Our crystal ball is not any clearer than anybody else's than we're navigating in uncharted waters, since the factors causing market volatility are a 100% self-inflicted and don't lend themselves to fundamental analysis. If the government shuts down and the trade disputes with China are resolved soon, the market can very quickly bounce back on its prior strong trajectory. After all, confidence is the cheapest and strongest form of stimulus. Now, what are we doing about all this? With the completion of our 14 billion non-strategic disposition program, our portfolio is now focused on the highest quality properties in the best markets. Our balance sheet is one of the strongest among REITs and our funds have ample investment capacity. In short, we've already done the hard work of preparing for all parts of the market cycle. Also, property fundamentals remain our strong as I've ever seen with vacancy at a historic low, utilization at a historic high, limited new supply, absence of shadow space and e-commerce providing a secular tailwind to the logistics sector. We\u2019ve taken several additional steps to account for the increased risk of the capital market volatility. First, we\u2019ve raised the bar for all new speculative development starts. Second, we\u2019re monitoring our proprietary forward-looking indicators on a daily basis and are actively engaged in customer dialogues to asses any changes in market sentiment. And third, in the last two weeks, we have tempered our 2019 business plan assumptions and guidance to account for higher potential risks in the environment. Again, I want to emphasize, we are not seeing any signs of weakness in the market, but to ignore the turbulence of the past month would be responsible. We\u2019re not telegraphing an inflection point in the economy, we\u2019re just trying to be prudent in running our business. Looking back, this environment reminds me a lot of the dot com era. In the two years following the market peak in March of 2000, Nasdaq lost two-thirds of its value, the S&P 500 was up 20% while REITs appreciated by nearly 60%. We\u2019re not naive enough to think that we can predict the market, but there are uncanny parallels between the environments today in that. Sure, today\u2019s generation of tech leaders are real companies making real money, but there are plenty of unicorns that are highly dependent on the abundance of cheap capital -- risk capital for their survival. History doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it does often rhyme with the past. My bet is that well managed REITs will shine once again because of their defensive characteristics and its attractive risk adjusted yields. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom. Tom Olinger : Thanks Hamid. I\u2019ll cover highlights for the fourth quarter and introduce 2019 guidance. We had an outstanding year and quarter. Core FFO per share was $3.03 for the year, which included $0.14 of net promote income and $0.80 for the quarter, including $0.05 of promotes. Global occupancy at year-end held steady at 97.5% while the U.S. ticked down 20 basis points as we continue to push rates and term. Our share of net effective rent change on rollovers in the quarter was an all time high at 25.6% with the U.S. at over 33%. We leased 35 million square feet in the quarter with an average term of 83 months also a record high. The spread between our in place leases and market rents was extended modestly to more than 15%, driven primarily by Europe where we now estimate our leases to be approximately 11% below market. Our share of cash same-store NOI growth was 4.5% for the quarter. Given the longer lease trends this quarter we had more nominal pre-rents, which had 50 basis points drag on cash same-store. It's important to note that pre-rents as a percentage of lease value declined sequentially by 20 basis points to 3.7%. 2018 was also a good year for our strategic capital business. Investor demand remains strong for well located logistics real estate. We raised $2.2 billion in new capital and grew our third-party AUM to more than $35 billion. Our strategic capital business continues to deliver a durable revenue stream with over 90% of fees coming from perpetual or very long life vehicles. On the deployment front, we had an active year and created significant value for our shareholders. Development stabilizations were approximately $1.9 billion with an estimated margin of over 35% and value creation of $661 million. The $1.1 billion of asset sales in the quarter marks the completion of our multiyear non-strategic disposition program. Turning to capital markets, our balance sheet remains one of the best in the business, our credit metrics are extremely strong and we continue to access capital globally at attractive terms. We have minimal refinancing risk as more than 75% of our debt is denominated in foreign currencies where base rates are near or at historic lows. And with the recast enough size of our global line of credit, we now have liquidity of over $4 billion and more than $6.5 billion from potential fund rebalancing. We can self fund our run rate deployment for the foreseeable future. Now for 2019 guidance which I'll provide on an our share basis. As Hamid mentioned that less resolved soon, the volatility in the capital markets and the related self inflicted political paralysis are bound to affect consumer and business confidence. We revised our outlook and corresponding guidance in response to this ongoing uncertainty. Clearly, there's upside toward guidance should these issues to be resolved. We expect cash same-store NOI growth between 3.75% and 4.75%, and period ending occupancy to range between 96% to 97.5%. For strategic capital, we expect revenue excluding promotes of $300 million to $310 million and net promote income of $0.10 per share, which is based on today's real estate values and FX rates. Consistent with prior years, there will be timing difference between the recognition of promote revenue and its related expenses. We expect to recognize majority of the promote revenue in the third quarter and incur $0.01 of promote expense in each quarter of 2019. We have reduced development starts from 2018 levels and expect a range between $1.6 billion and $2 billion. Build-to-suits will comprise more than 30% of this volume. Dispositions will raise between $500 million and $800 million, well below our $2 billion run rate over the last several years. Contributions are expected to range between $1 billion and $1.3 billion, which includes the formation of our Brazil venture that closed last week. Our share of net deployment uses at the midpoint is $400 million, which we plan to fund through a combination of free cash flow, modest leverage and potential fund sell-downs. There is a timing lag to reinvest our significant deployment proceeds back into development, which will reduced first quarter core FFO by approximately $0.02. For SG&A we're forecasting a range between $240 million and $250 million, representing year-over-year growth of 2.5% at the point, while managing 18% more real estate. Putting this all together, we expect 2019 core FFO to range between $3.12 and $3.20 per share, which includes $0.10 of net promote income. Our guidance reflects the impact of the new lease accounting standard. For year-over-year comparison, our 2018 results reflected $0.04 of internal capitalized leasing costs. As the midpoint, core FFO growth excluding promotes is almost 7.5%. To put this growth in the context, the three year plan we provided at our Investor Day in November 2016 called for 7% to 8% annual growth excluding promotes. At the midpoint of our 2019 guidance, we'll have averaged 8.7% for this three year period outpacing our high reach expectations. To wrap up, we had an excellent quarter and year. While we remain on the lookout for signs of market weakness, we feel great about our business and are extremely confident in our ability to outperform. With that, I'll turn it over to Kim for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust. Your line is open. Ki Bin Kim : If any slowdown should occur where should we expect that first, is there a geographic tilt to that? Or is it the amount of pace that it's looking for or the rents or type of tenants, any color around that? Hamid Moghadam : I think it's likely to be a demand driven problem, because any change in situation is not likely to come from the supply side, there is a lot of visibility on supply for the next 12 months. So it's really the demand side. So you would -- where you would see it is obviously on leasing volumes and rent change on leasing and the like, probably not as in same store because that takes a while and it's very occupancy driven. And we're trying to drive down occupancy, so you see the rent change and leasing volumes and all that. Where we would see it a bit earlier than you are some of those forward looking indicators like traffic through our buildings, like how long it takes to make a deal, like what is the conversion rate of showings to actual leasing activity and all that. So we see those on a daily basis literally. I can tell you what happens at the end of today. And those are the forward indicators that I was referring to. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Bilerman from Citi. Your line is open. Michael Bilerman : Hamid, I was wondering if you can spend a little bit of time talking about development starts. And I think one of the comments you talked about is trying to be conservative in managing the land bank and managing starts. As we think about 2018, you've put out a range with the midpoint of $1.8 billion in terms of starts, which is down about 30% from the $2.5 billion you did late this year and certainly lower than the guidance you came into as well into 2018. So how much of that is a demand side versus a yield expectation side that's dropping that you don't want to play in. And maybe you can talk about those, or how much of it's just purely don't have the land bank to support a larger pipeline. Maybe you can help with the context? Hamid Moghadam : First of all, if you look at our development guidance, there is build to suite and there is spec. And on the built and suite front, we have assumed a small fall off rate. But essentially the built to suite activity that we have and we know, we have great visibility on. On the specs we've reduced the starts by maybe 40%-ish, maybe 45%, only because why get off in front of skies. Last year was the biggest development start number that we had in a decade. I remember way back when people kept always looking for higher and higher development guidance and I mentioned three or four years ago maybe five years ago now that our development is going to raise between $2 billion and $3 billion a year. Last year, we exceeded that and this is gross numbers not our share, our share numbers are smaller. But at this point in the cycle, why project a more spec development than you have visibility for? So as you know, we're building mostly in parks and we're building off in that sixth or seventh building in the park. We usually have a couple of patch ready to go. So if we're wrong about market demand and strength of the market, we'll just continue at a higher level of spec development where we totally control that, so there is no point counting on that and getting expectation to that level. It's certainly not because of lack of land bank, because while we pruned our land bank significantly, our land is really good and developable and entitled. And it's certainly not because we're not getting the yields. I mean, you've seen us now for five years project yields in the teens and we end up in the 20s and 30s. So the land bank provides for almost $11 billion of build out if we were to build all of it. So we got capacity for many years of development and feel good about that, and are not going to be afraid to put that capacity to good use in terms of additional starts as we watch the year unfold. Operator : Your next question comes from Jamie Feldman from Bank of America. Your line is open. Jamie Feldman : I was hoping you could just provide a little bit more color on the changes you did make in the guidance, sounds like in the last couple of weeks you revised lower. Can you talk about where you did make the cuts and then also how conservative is this number? I mean, what would it take to actually -- how much worse things have to get for you to actually miss what you put out? Hamid Moghadam : Well, the second part of that or the last part of that is really hard to answer. Obviously, as the world falls off the cliff, so there's always downside to any scenario. But there's certainly less downside in this scenario than it would have been in our original plan. I would say we tweaked our plan in a couple of general areas and Tom can get into the specifics. But we moderated rental growth this year. We are glide path to stabilize occupancy of 95%, which is the norm in our business. We've got there. We accelerated the glide path down to that. We cranked up our credit loss a little bit and we obviously reduced the development guidance or development expectations for the year going forward. Those are the big parts of it. Tom, do you want to\u2026 Tom Olinger : So on rent growth, we tempered that by about 200 basis points. So for global, our share rent growth in '19 will be in the mid 3s. Same store NOI, we talked about that's down about 50 basis points driven by lower average occupancies, lower market rent growth and little bit of bad debt if you need mentioned starts. We talked about core FFO down about $0.05%, a combination of about $0.02 from same store and NOI, about $0.02 from lower deployment and a slower pace of deployment and about $0.01 from lower fees just related to lower transaction volume. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Your line is open. Nick Yulico : In terms of the guidance for occupancy declining this year, would you break down the drivers of that impact between on the one hand your strategy of pushing rents more at the expense of occupancy versus whether there is a bigger impact from supply demand imbalance or even some of your conservatism on demand because of a weaker economy? Hamid Moghadam : There is no supply demand imbalance. I mean, even last year in 2018 much to our surprise demand exceeded supply. Now, we've been sitting here telling you for four or five years that one of these days the supply will exceed demand by a little bit here and we're going to say that again this year. We've been wrong in the last four or five years. But even if demand falls short of supply with an effective vacancy rate in the market of the high 4% range, even if 50 million square foot shortfall between supply and demand won't move vacancy rates by more than 10 or 15 basis points. So I don\u2019t think it's those things. It's just that we are trying to maintain pricing power and push rents. Frankly as the market has spoken, our occupancy levels have not budged in fact moved in the wrong direction. It is our stated objective not to be running so full, particularly when you look at the underlying utilization of these buildings. It's not only that vacancy rates are low, it's also utilizations are really high. So every indication we have is that our customers need more space and they're really tied, but we do want to drive pricing. So you might critic us by saying why do reduce your rent growth forecast if you\u2019re pushing for more rent and reducing occupancy levels? And my answer to that would be, we\u2019re trying to be prudent in this environment, things move around quite a bit. And if we turn it to be overly prudent during the year, we always have the opportunity to adjust that in subsequent quarters when we thought to. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Derek Johnson : I wanted to get into the mix between development yields and the weaker global growth environment that has you guys prudent. And when I look at the 6.2% fourth quarter development yields certainly a bit lower than full year '18 at the 6.5% level. So is this the new norm for 2019 the lower yield environment and is due to construction costs? Can you share some of this cost impact on new development and how those pressures breakdown, I guess between labor and materials? Thank you. Hamid Moghadam : So I wouldn\u2019t read too much into the lower yields, it's partly mix and its partly obviously we moderated our rental growth, so whatever we had in the mix before its going to be a little bit lower because of that moderated rental growth but it's still very profitable development. And as you can see, we keep guiding to built-to-suit margins in the 12% range, the spec margins in the 15% range. And we every year have come out ahead of that 500 to a 1,000 basis points of margin, maybe some more in prior years. So look, I don\u2019t know what it's going to be, we\u2019re going to find out what it is, but we\u2019re taking our best guess at it. And we feel pretty good about there being profitable, ample profitable development opportunities. Again as I said in response to the previous question on development, it's not like we\u2019re reducing our guidance because we don\u2019t think we can get the margins. If the market holds up anywhere near where it has been, I think we\u2019ll get really good margins. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Craig Mailman : Hamid, you had mentioned in your opening remarks that you raised the bar for new speculative starts. Can you maybe just give a little bit more detail on where you tweaked it from maybe yield expectations? And then just a follow-up, Tom, maybe to Jamie\u2019s question. Could you just -- I think I heard 50 basis points. But could you just clarify where cash same-store was before you guys took a haircut to it? Hamid Moghadam : Tom, go ahead and answer that and then I'll\u2026 Tom Olinger : So Craig, yes, 50 basis points lower same-store based on our assessment of the market volatility versus our original plan, 50 basis points more. Hamid Moghadam : And I thought I answered the first part of the question but if you want to ask the different way, maybe I can see the nuance in it. Craig Mailman : I was just -- I apologize if I didn\u2019t hear you. I just wanted to get a sense of where -- what exactly you're tweaking it for, is it a yield bar that you're raising here on new stars or is it just\u2026 Hamid Moghadam : No\u2026 Craig Mailman : So the underwriting is\u2026 Hamid Moghadam : No, it's not. What we said is we sat around the table and we said, okay, let's see what happens to our built to suit loan yields, let's whack that by 15%. So let's say what can happen to our spec volume and let's whack that by 45% and we size those numbers around and that's where we came out. So it was not -- I mean it was not a bottoms up deal by deal build up of the spec starts, it was that way for the built to suits. But by definition the spec starts are not that bottoms up exercise. Operator : Your next question comes from Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Vikram Malhotra : I just want to focus on the rent growth comments I know you've just tempered expectations more just to be conservative. But can you give us some color on what you're baking in for coastal maybe versus other markets in the past, you've talked about high-single-digits in coastal and mid in others. And then are there a couple of markets you can call out where you're maybe seeing some turn in fundamental that's driving this any market specifically? Hamid Moghadam : The short answer to the question is that coastal is more like 4, 4 plus and in land is more like 2, 2 plus. But there's a lot of variability even in those numbers and we have a very detailed market-by-market analysis of rent. We forecast rents market-by-market and we update our forecast couple times a year. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeremy Metz from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeremy Metz : Two questions from me, the first I just want to go back to the supply conversation, just given some of the rising costs and just the overall limited amount of quality intra land sites that are out there. I'm wondering if you can comment on how much of new supply being built today is really just not competitive or a threat to your U.S. portfolio just given all the repositioning you've done at this point. And then the second one is one for Tom just on guidance. I just have the DCT portfolio under roof for a few months now. I think originally you're expecting about $0.07 of accretion in 2019 from that. Can you just talk how it's trending and do you still feel like that's the appropriate amount? Tom Olinger : Jeremy, I'll go first on that. The accretion in '19 is more like $0.05, because in 2018 we had $0.07 annualized. So we got $0.02 plus of that in 2018. So the real incremental increase in '19 is $0.05. But all our expectations as we said, we hit all of our day one synergies way back in Q3 everything is going I would say overall better than plan. Hamid Moghadam : And with respect to markets, I would say there're some markets that are I've had too much supply in the last couple of months, and I would say Chicago -- starts have really picked up in Chicago, so we're watching that pretty carefully. Atlanta and Houston and Central PA, those would be the markets where we would have a concern about supply. And if you wanted to expand that list internationally, I would say I would add Madrid and Osaka to the list. And on the positive side, we feel better about Dallas than we did a couple of months ago. It seems like we're over the hump over there. So these numbers will move around but you'd probably see them more naturally in the less supply constrained markets. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Michael Carroll : Tom, can you provide some color on what's your bad debt assumptions are for 2019, and are you seeing any specific tenants that you conserve in the portfolio? I know last quarter I think you highlighted there is roughly 30 basis points of revenue that you would say that that\u2019s at risk. Or is it more of just the uncertain macro conditions and that's why you increased those assumptions little bit? Tom Olinger : It's really -- it's the later. If you look at where bad debts have been trending over the last several years, they've really been at historic lows around 20 basis points of revenue historically. We see that number more like 50 basis points over long periods of time. We feel really good about our credit quality. I think our exposure to total tenants is quite small, extremely small I would say. But yes, in this from how we approach our budgeting, we have assumed that bad debt expenses rise towards, not all historic norms. So they're coming off the bottom rising towards historic norms. But again, I feel great about our credit quality, I feel great about our exposure. This is just in the spirit of being prudent as Hamid mentioned. Operator : And your next question comes from Tom Catherwood from BTIG. Your line is open. Tom Catherwood : Just sticking with development here, your guidance for 2019, it looks like stabilizations are going to outpace new starts by roughly $250 million, which make sense considering you did $1.4 billion of starts in the fourth quarter. But if we look at 2017 and 2018 combined, the starts outpace stabilizations by nearly $900 million. So all else being equal, I would assume the amount of stabilizations would be even greater in 2019 than what we're looking at. Are the new developments that you're starting taking longer to construct or stabilize, or the other factors that account for this lag in the stabilization? Tom Olinger : I'll go first, this is Tom Olinger, a things. I think when you look at '17 and '18, particularly '18, we had a lot of starts in the back half of the year particularly Q4. And then I throw a little bit of mix in there. But from a stabilization standpoint, we are stabilizing assets generally I would say across the board consistently ahead of underwriting, number one. And number two as I think you're going to see a lot of stabilize NOI come in 2020 is going to be when that really unwinds. And when you think about, particularly overseas where we're building multi-story if that takes longer to go. So that has to be factored that's part of the mix component. But we're leasing up you could see in our development pipeline we're leasing up at good rates or at a good pace, I would say, ahead of where we thought we'd be. Rents are higher than we thought they would be, margins are higher than we underwrote. So I feel really good about all that. Hamid Moghadam : So the only thing I would add is it's just put an underline on something Tom said, which I think is generally misunderstood. 2020 is a huge year for incremental return out of development stabilizations, that volume we've already paid for. And the only lift we've gotten to our income statement is through capitalized interest, which is a very low number. And when those yields convert to sort of the 6 plus yield given the volume, it doesn't take a lot of math to figure out that 2020 is going to be a really, really good year in terms of growth coming from the lease up of the outlook pipeline. But we're not going to guide to 2020, so don't even go there. Operator : Your next question comes from John Peterson from Jefferies. Your line is open. John Peterson : Great thanks. So just looking through your operating metrics and your supplemental, leasing terms this quarter was about 83 months. It's been pretty consistently around 60 months for the past four quarters or probably longer than that. So, is that -- is it a mix? Is it Prologis pushing for longer lease terms or the customers wanting longer lease terms? And do these contracts look any different I guess in terms of free rent or escalators, anything to read into there? Gene Reilly : Yes, John, this is Gene. I'll take that one. There is a bit of mix because the development lease terms are actually a 148 months, during the quarter, but the operating portfolio was 71 things. So that's increasing, but at the quite the pace you see with 83. And I also warn everybody, this is volatile quarter to quarter. We have been pushing term really high, it\u2019s good to see it going in the right direction. You're probably not going to see an 83 next quarter, but sort of that trailing average should be changing up. Operator : Your next question comes from Eric Frankel from Greenfield Street Advisors. Your line is open. Eric Frankel : Thank you. Just a quick question on the fund management business, maybe you guys can just give a sense of what the investor outlook is, is like for logistics at this point in terms of how much you can grow your AUM, if you wanted to and whether you have the appetite to do so? And then, if a trade war with China really does escalate and we put tariffs on all their imported goods, do you have a sense of what geographic markets in the U.S. will get impacted the most by that? Hamid Moghadam : So, let me take a stab at the second one. I think, if you think about most of our U.S. markets, the vast majority of demand comes from consumption of the population in those markets. Now, there are couple of markets like LA and New Jersey where you have an incremental flow through coming from imports, so those would slow more than the ones that are just consumption markets because the location of where goods are coming from will change on the margin. But those things take actually a lot longer than most people think, and the currency effect is usually also mitigating some of the tariff. But you would think it would be those markets on the coast by a little bit. Chicago is an inland port, so I would throw that one in there too. So, what was the first part of your question, Eric? Eric Frankel : Fund management\u2026 Hamid Moghadam : Fund management is very strong. Our cues could be a lot longer, if we weren't concerned about the amount of time that it would take for investors to get their capital invested. There's no sense raising a lot more money, if we can't invest it. So, the sector seems to be defying gravity in terms of investor demand, pretty much everywhere. Operator : Your next Question comes from Dave Rodgers from Baird. Your line is open. Dave Rodgers : Yes, good morning out there. Tom, I wanted to follow up on the 3.5% market rate growth. Can you give that by Asia, Europe and the U.S. just kind of a broad stroke? And what you\u2019re expecting for \u201919? And then maybe Hamid, or Gary way in on where your rent growth has been in Europe, cap rate trends just over the last couple of months with some of the uncertainty and what you might be seeing post the Brexit vote in the China slowdown? Tom Olinger : Hey, Mike, at this point we won\u2019t breakout the different components of global. Our shares, it's in the midst 3s as I said and it's down about 200 basis points from our original expectations. Gene Reilly : With respect to market rent growth, I mean, Europe has been sort of in the 5% range plus or minus, and we do expect it to be greater than the U.S. in 2019. We have tempered our view slightly with respect to next year, downward in terms of market rent growth, but still sort of in the mid 4s. Another part of that question? Tom Olinger : No, I think you get it. Operator : Your next question comes from John Guinee from Stifel. Your line is open. John Guinee : Great, you guys have making it look easy, aren\u2019t you? Your office brethren right now is suffering from a really difficult cost to capital, you guys don\u2019t seem to have that problem. But when you\u2019re looking at your cost to capital, how are you analyzing your open end fund business versus your common stock price? And what point in time does it make sense to really push the fund business versus common equity or to just not even look at that way? Hamid Moghadam : First of all with respect to common equity, I think we\u2019re truly the only company in this sector that hasn\u2019t raised any equity. You could call issuing equity to buy DCT an equity raise, but we haven\u2019t raised equity and I mean \u201918 or more anything like that. So our view is that we have a self funding model, and we\u2019re very committed to that. And as we have shown you, we\u2019re over invested in most of our funds. So, there is -- and there is ample demand for people who want to expand their position into our fund. So, we\u2019ve got some like 10 years of capital from those sources, based on our normal run rate, not M&A, but just a normal run rate. So, our philosophy is pretty simple on raising equity, which is we\u2019re not going to and we don\u2019t have need to anytime soon. So with respect our private capital business, this is really important. And I\u2019m going to say it again John, you and I have known each other for a long time, we don\u2019t look at that as a different business, it is our business, it's -- I mean, our capital has invested in that. So it's not like, we do the lower yield deals in our private capital vehicles and our good deals in our balance sheet. We do all deal in our vehicles that are invested in that locality. So we treat all business as the same. I think cost to capital today the way I think about it, is probably in the mid to high 6s, approaching 7 total cost to capital. And I think in the environment where inflation is generally around 2% and leverage is around 25%, 30%. That\u2019s an appropriate risk adjusted return given the volatility of the asset class, and I don\u2019t see that much of a difference between the public sector and the private sector because generally in our sector they seem to trading in line with one another. I think that private side is probably a little bit more richly valued than the public side, but they're reasonably within 5% of one another. So I know that that difference is much wider in other sectors, but part of that may have to do with the growth expectation of the different sectors. We go around capping everything, but we're not very good at capturing different growth rates. So, I think if you looked at in on in IRR risk basis, they're going to be very similar between different sectors. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Bilerman from Citi. Your line is open. Michael Bilerman : Hamid, it definitely sounds there's certainly a built in prudence to how you've gone about forecasting for this year, given a lot of a macro uncertainty. A lot of the data and the stats support robustness. And I think you talked about in your opening comments how your discussions with tenants have indicated, continue to robust demand. So I'm wondering, if you can sort of draw parallels to what your tenants are telling you relative to the conservativeness or the prudent is that you are taking in your forward expectations and maybe a mismatch that could be there? Hamid Moghadam : Okay. You know, at the end of the day, I don't think our customers really know that much more than we do. Everybody is guessing as to what the implications of this last 15 days of weirdness are going to be. So, I think basically what we're hearing from our customers is that, they were going pretty much with very strong business plans through the end of the year. Their companies probably haven't had their earnings call yet, so we'll see what they say on those calls. But as far as the real estate department and procuring capacities concerned, they haven't gotten the memo that the businesses is slowing. They may in a couple of months, but they haven't gotten it yet. Operator : And your next question comes from Jamie Feldman from Bank of America. Your line is open. Jamie Feldman : I wanted your thoughts on some of the consolidation we're seeing in this 3PL industry. Just kind of how do you say, if we continue to see as how do you think this impacts tenant demand and your business over time? Hamid Moghadam : I think it's good to have more profitable, more consolidated larger customers. It is an extremely fragmented business. We don't think the level of concentration, if it's even continued for a long time. This is really going to change the dynamic, the landlord tenant dynamic because it's still going to be a very fragmented business. But I rather have, it's little, the masses have to little from point A to B. The consolidation doesn't do anything about how much the boxes need to move. It's just that this is more profitable and moving those boxes around and to more, better capitalized, profitable customers, we prefer that. So I think some pricing discipline coming into that business in terms of how they price their services is all good. Operator : And your next question comes from Sumit Sharma from Berenberg Capital. Your line is open. Sumit Sharma : Thank you for taking a question, a quick question on your utilization. So, your last BI report says, it's around 87%, 86.5%. I'm assuming, it's pretty much the same based on your comments. I was just trying to wonder whether you could comment on the range of that distribution, and if the median has shifted higher lower year-over-year just trying to get a sense of the skewness? Hamid Moghadam : So, that's above my pay grade, and Chris Caton will answer that. Chris Caton : Yes, hey, Sumit, thanks for the question. As you've seen in reports, the historical utilization rate can range between 82% and 87% and we're right bang on it's a peek of that over the last 12 months. So utilization is running at peak levels. Operator : Your next question comes from Eric Frankel from Green Street Advisor. Your line is open. Eric Frankel : Thank you. Just a quick follow up. Hamid, I know we've talked about maybe few quarters ago just one the trade wars talk really starts to accelerate. Just kind of how stuck company were in their supply chain. Has there been any talk of anything different in terms of changing their manufacturing origination in terms of how their goods are moving? Hamid Moghadam : Not that I can tell and certainly not that supported by the data because notwithstanding all this talk. I think deficit from China was at record levels last time it was recorded. I don't know if that's because of the lag between the lag and the action and anticipation of people doing more volume prior to any cares taking place I don't know. But we haven't seen any of events of that. I think the macro point I can make is that generally people are shifting more production to Mexico in terms of manufacturing, but we were having the same exact conversation about Mexico year and half ago. So, these things can move around faster than people can react so. Operator : Your next question comes from Blaine Heck from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Blaine Heck : Thanks. Just wanted to get a little commentary on asset pricing here, it seems as though we've seen cap rates holding steady or even continuing to decrease in the infill and coastal markets. But I'm wondering, if you're seeing any markets out there especially in the U.S. where maybe there has been an inflection and you're seeing cap rates increase at all? Hamid Moghadam : I'll have to tell you though on the last couple of transactions that we pursued, upscale, we have been blown away -- we were literally blown away by other interest in those portfolios. And if those deals closed that bows very well for us NAV, so let's leave it at that. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason Green from Evercore. Your line is open. Jason Green : Good morning. Just wanted to ask quickly on institutional capital demand in Brazil given the recent JV you guys announced and the elections that happened about months ago, 13 months ago at this point? Gene Reilly : So this is Gene. You're talking about sort of general institutional demand, we may not be the best people to ask, but it is a business environment that has a lot of optimism right now. The new President is certainly business friendly, and we've certainly seen a lot more demand from customer activity down there. And obviously, we did recently sign a very big JV. But as far as broadly speaking, my guess is that there is a more institutional demand at this point given the political changes. Hamid Moghadam : Being that that was the last question, let me just add one more comment that I found the most interesting. Probably, the most interesting statistics that I've seen about the timing is something called the global economic policy uncertainty at index. That I actually saw in couple of weeks ago, and it's a scale we're spending more time trying to understand that, but it's a tail of the degree of policy uncertainty around the world. And let me give you a couple of points. During the 9/11 attack and the Iraq war breaking out, that index was at 200. At the peak of the global financial crisis, it was at 210; and Brexit, it got to 300. And today given the China war and the government shutdown and all that, it's well north of 300. Now, I have no idea whether there is any academic rigor or anything related to this index, but I just found it fascinating that the world thinks we\u2019re in a much less certain environment. Now uncertain is usually viewed as bad, it can be bad or good because we saw how quickly the Mexico stuff turned around. But the reason that we've taken the position that we have this quarter is exactly because we're living in this kind of world. And as I said before, don't read too much into this, we need to stay tuned, be vigilant, really keep a sharp eye on what customers are saying and doing, and I think we're have a business that's just fine. Thank you for your interest and look forward to talking to all of you soon. Operator : This concludes today's conference call, you may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ron Hubbard. Please go ahead. Ronald Hubbard : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Jim Connor, Chairman and CEO; Mark Denien, CFO; and Nick Anthony, Chief Investment Officer. Before we make our prepared remarks, let me remind you that statements we make today are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For more information about those risk factors, we would refer you to our December 31, 2018, 10-K that we have on file with the SEC. Now for our prepared statement I'll turn it over to Jim Connor. James Connor : Thanks, Ron. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start off with a few comments on the national logistics market and then I'll cover our first quarter results. In the national markets according to CBRE vacancy across the U.S. remained at record low level 4.3% and has now been below 5% for over 13 quarters. First quarter asking rents grew and estimated 8% over the prior year nationally. For the full year, CBRE and other expect rent growth on asking rental rates to be in the 5% to 6% range. For the first quarter supply exceeded demand by about 1.6 million square feet. So, still fairly in balance and it represents only the third quarter in the last 36 quarters where supply outpaced demands slightly. We see supply and demand in balance for the remainder of the year and expect both to finish in the 200 million square foot range. We believe this balance combined with historic low vacancy rates will continue to provide an environment for strong rent growth. In addition, the March macroeconomic figures had been solid with favorable retail and e-commerce sales consumer incentive business inventories and employment data points. Even with 2019 GDP growth projected to be in the low-to-mid 2% range, we still feel confident in the macro demand drivers for logistics space like increased truck tonnage poor traffic and intermodal volume all support a very favorable outlook. Now turning to our own results, we followed up a very strong 2018 with a solid start to 2019. Given the significant leasing we had in the fourth quarter of 2018, we had a comparatively light quarter with leasing volume of 2.8 million square feet. We simply did not have that many expirations particularly any of any size to renew or backfill. We increased our stabilized occupancy by 40 basis points to 98.4%. This was primarily driven by leasing up three speculative facilities totaling 927,000 square feet. Our in service portfolio was 95.5% leased. This is down from 96.3% the previous quarter which was due to speculative projects just placed in service as well as a slight impact from acquisitions that were 72% lease. We renewed 83% of our expiring leases during the quarter and rent growth averaged 23.4% on a GAAP basis and 9% on a cash basis which was impressive given that less than 10% of this activity came from South Florida and there were no second generation leases in any other coastal markets. Rent growth was broad across all building sizes and all leases sizes as it has been throughout this cycle. Once again, this demonstrates if you have high quality assets in the right sub market with a top-tier operating platform all of which we have, you're in a position to capture demand and rent growth in all markets. We had a good start to the year and new developments with a $165 million across five projects totaling 2 million square feet. All of these projects were speculative starts in key sub markets with tight fundamentals across our Southern California; Dallas; Houston; and South Florida markets. Looking at the landscape today, our leasing prospect list is strong for our recently delivered and soon to be delivered spec projects supported by my earlier comment about the stabilization this quarter of three previously delivered spec projects. We also have a nice backlog of build to suit projects with requirements between 100,000 square feet to over 1 million square feet all across the country.  In aggregate, it's possible our pre-leasing percentage may dip slightly below 50% during 2019 due to timing but overall we're very comfortable with our development pipeline and the speculative projects we have underway and their ability to contribute earnings growth beyond 2019. Our overall development pipeline at quarter end had 20 projects under construction totaling 9.2 million square feet at a projected $765 million in stabilized costs for our share. These projects are 52% preleased and our margins on the pipeline are expected to continue to be in excess of 20%. With stabilized occupancy at 98.4% these projects provide a valuable source of future growth. Now I'll turn it over to Nick to cover our acquisition and disposition activities. Nicholas Anthony : Thanks Jim. We had a light quarter on acquisitions and dispositions. Require two state-of-the-art 36 foot clear logistics facilities totaling $78 million in Seattle and Eastern PA. In aggregate, the two assets total 577,000 square feet and were 72% leased on average. On dispositions we saw on JV asset in Indianapolis with our share of the proceeds totaling $8 million. However, as I alluded to on the January call, we have quite a few assets projected to be sold in our Middle West markets this year with time expected in the third quarter. Regarding the broader acquisition market, we continue to look at many opportunities. However, the market is extremely competitive and thus making it difficult to find select assets in our target growth market which is reflected in our modest full-year range of guidance for acquisitions. I'll now turn it over to Mark to discuss our financial results and guidance update. Mark Denien : Thanks, Nick. Good afternoon, everyone. Core FFO for the quarter was $0.33 per share compared to core FFO $0.35 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018. Core FFO was negatively impacted by an approximate $0.3 per share increase to non-cash general and administrative expense compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 which is a normal first quarter item resulting from the accounting requirement to immediately expense a significant portion of our annual stock based compensation grant that takes place every February. Core FFO per share increased by 10% from the $0.30 per share deluded reported in the first quarter of 2018 as a result of grocery development as well as continued improved overall operational performance. We reported FFO was defined by NAREIT of $0.33 per share for the quarter compared to $0.31 per share for the first quarter of 2018 with the increase also being driven by improved overall operational performance. AFFO totaled $119 million for the quarter compared to a $108 million for the first quarter of 2018. This 10% increase was driven by the same positive factors impacting FFO in addition to lower capital expenditures that our modern portfolio affords us. This impressive AFFO growth continue to be the driver of future dividend growth. Same property NOI growth on a cash basis for the three months ended March 31, 2019, was a very strong 7.2%. In addition to increased occupancy and rent growth our same property NOI growth this quarter benefited from about 300 basis points of burn off a free rent compared to the first quarter of 2018. This was attributable to some acquisition and development properties that stabilized in late 2017 and had some free rent in early 2018. Same property NOI for the first quarter on a GAAP basis was 4.3% which is lower than the cash number due largely to the lack of the impact from the free rent burn off on a GAAP basis but nonetheless still very strong. We do expect subsequent quarters to remain solid based on continued strong rent growth and high occupancy levels but to decelerate a bit from the current level as there will not be as much lift from free rent and 2018 occupancy comparables get tougher. Also the last half of the year will be negatively impacted by about 40 basis points or about 20 basis points impact for the full-year due to one unique situation. We have a tenant in two different spaces in our same property portfolio totaling about 425,000 square feet. They were looking to consolidate and expand and needed 620,000 square feet. So, we're building a new building for them which should be completed by the end of the second quarter. This is a great transaction for us and will increase total NOI but will be a drag on same property NOI for the last half the year until we can release their former space. In addition, we would like to stress that about 14% of our total cash NOI for the first quarter came from our non same property pool and with 73% occupied reflecting substantial NOI growth prospects from this segment of our portfolio. I would now like to address some refinements to our 2019 guidance that we announced yesterday. First we've increased our guidance for core FFO to a range of $1.39 to $1.45 per deluded share from the previous range of $1.37 to $1.43 per deluded share which equates to $0.2 increase at the midpoint. We have also increased our guidance for NAREIT FFO to a range of $1.36 to a $1.46 per share from the previous range of $1.33 per share to $1.43 per share. Although, growth in same property NOI will moderate from the 7.2% reported this quarter, we still expect solid results and have increased our guidance for same property net operating income to a range of 3.5% to 5.0% from the previous range of 3.25% to 4.75%. We are also revising our guidance for growth in adjusted funds from operations on a share adjusted basis upward to a range of 5.9% to a 11% from the previous range of 5.1% to 10.2%. Finally, we increased our guidance for a stabilize portfolio average percentage least to a range of 97.5% to 98.5% which is up 0.3% at the midpoint. Now I will turn the call back over to Jim. James Connor : Thanks, Mark. In closing, just a couple of comments. Logistic demand drivers for modern facilities remain very strong in both traditional distribution and e-commerce fulfillment. The macro front maybe a little bumpier than prior years and we are mindful of those risks yet we still feel very good about 2019 as represented by our increase in expected ranges for key growth drivers. And finally, we are confident in our overall ability to drive high single digit AFFO growth and corresponding dividend growth for the foreseeable future. We will now open up the lines to the audience, we would ask participants to keep the dialogue to one question or perhaps two short questions, you of course are always welcome to get back in the queue. Louise you can open up the lines for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Jeremy Metz. Please go ahead. Jeremy Metz : Hey guys. I was just wondering if you could talk about how you think about the trade-offs between pushing rent and occupancy at this stage given the strong rent spreads you achieved and continue to achieve balance against the upward revisions to your occupancy guidance here and just some of your comments on your outlook for supply and demand balance at this point? James Connor : Well thanks, Jeremy. I would tell you that's always a question we're asking and I think at the end of the day when we look at our cash and GAAP rent growth and we look at our CapEx to net effective rent which are both very strong numbers and we were able to improve on occupancy, I think we're really hitting on all cylinders. We've all talked about this before, it always costs us more capital to retain at a building than it does to renew a tenant. So, if we can continue to keep our renewal percentage high keep our occupancy percentage high but maintain these roughly 25% and 10% rent growth numbers that we're getting I think we'd hit the right balance. Jeremy Metz : I appreciate, and --. James Connor : And on supply and demand, I think we're in a really good spot. The difference between the two of this quarter of 1.6 million square feet in the U.S. logistics market that's one or two deals. So, it could have been timing or anything else. I think we've all been prepared for a point in this cycle when we're going to reach some level of balance and we may in fact be there. And if we are, I think at 4.3% vacancy that's a pretty good spot and I think we'll continue to be able to maintain our occupancies and continue to push rent growth. Jeremy Metz : I appreciate it. And just second one from me, I just wanted to touch on the development starts here. The 170 million in the quarter was all spec, so maybe just what the leasing prospects look like for that as well as what you just placed in to service in the quarter and then from here should we just expect to see that next layer starts to be more tilted to build the suits at this point? James Connor : Yes. As you guys know, quarter-to-quarter it's all timing. I didn't put in the script but we've actually already this quarter signed three builder suits. Would I love to have them in the first quarter? Absolutely. But that's just what it is. So, yes I think you'll continue to see us maintain that balance. Our builder suit pipeline is as good as it's ever been and it's as I referenced in the script it's anywhere from a 100,000 square feet up to north of a million square feet and pretty consistent across all the markets. So, I think you'll see us continue to have very positive results on the new development pipeline. Jeremy Metz : Thanks Jim. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Manny Korchman. Please go ahead. Manny Korchman : Hey guys, good afternoon. Nick, I've got one for you. If you think about sort of the acquisition pipeline and maybe especially the two acquisitions you closed, why are those buildings I guess leasing quicker? Is it something wrong with the way that the developer and the owner is trying to lease them if demand is so good and you guys proved out the bridge how quickly you can get them lease, why aren't they leasing them before selling them to you or others? Nicholas Anthony : Well first of all, one asset was already fully leased in Seattle. The other building with we bought in the Lehigh Valley had just delivered and they signed a lease in that and we've got three RFPs on that space right now. So, we do expect it will you know we underwrite 12 months but we fully expect that we will beat that underwriting like we do typically on other acquisitions we've done. So, I don't think there's not a lack of demand. Manny Korchman : And if you look at the rest of the pipeline, are those similar deals whether new out of the ground and either not stabilized yet or getting closer to stabilize or is there going to be a different flavor to sort of value add than that MO? Nicholas Anthony : You mean the other assets we are pursuing? Manny Korchman : Sure, yes. Nicholas Anthony : Yes. Most of the acquisition we've been pursuing are pretty well leased. In fact, this last acquisition that was half lease was unusual for us. I think it was the first one we've done in the last 18 months. Manny Korchman : Thanks, Nick. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Nick Yulico. Please go ahead. Nick Yulico : Thanks. Jim, I guess given all the positive commentary on fundamentals and the trends here in the overall market and in your portfolio as well, have you considered increasing development start activity? It is but I guess and just wondering why not? James Connor : Yes we have and we actually talked about that from a guidance perspective and I think as indicated by Jeremy's question with five spec buildings in the first quarter, we thought it would be prudent to wait to reassess at the end of the second quarter and hopefully get a little bit more build to suit volume and a little bit more releasing teed up before we made a move on the development pipeline. I think sitting here today I would tell you we think it's trending toward the high end of the range that we had announced in January and as we've said feels an awful lot like it has the last couple of years. So, we would hope we'd be able to get these build to suits signed up and be able to give some good news in the second quarter call. Nick Yulico : Okay. And then Mark, just question going back to the guidance. I mean it sounds like there are, we should think about occupancy not being as high as we get into the back half of the year. I guess because I'm just wondering though I mean what's going to what would surprise to the upside there? I mean is it just tenants willing to stay in place more, is it even better leasing on the spec projects I mean what's sort of the upside to occupancy? Mark Denien : Yes I think Nick it's everything you said, you had around in your head. I would tell you that first off in the first quarter we were surprised a little bit to the upside based on our occupancy levels. We quite frankly did not budget or underwrite than our renewal rate would be as high as it was in the first quarter. So, that was part of the reason we're already off to a better start in Q1 and what we had budgeted. We do believe occupancy will tick down a bit from here. One, because as those leases that roll we're pushing rents like Jim said and I don't think that we believe will keep the same retention rate for the remainder of the year that we posted in the first quarter. So, we're anticipating a little downward tick there. I mentioned the two spaces that we have a tenant in that totaled 425,000 square feet that we know is coming back to us at the end of the second quarter because we're moving into a build to suit. So, that will bring occupancy down as well. So, to the upside it would be the quicker releasing of space like that. It would be retention rates coming in for the rest of you closer to what they came in in the first quarter compared to our what I would say normal run rate of closer to 75% percent. So, be some combination of all that that could cause it to go to the upside. Nick Yulico : Thanks. Mark Denien : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jamie Feldman. Please go ahead. Jamie Feldman : Great, thank you. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the types of demand you're seeing. I think there's been a lot of discussion in the market about smaller tenant demand in some markets versus larger. Have you seen any split in that along those lines in your portfolio? James Connor : Yes, thanks Jamie. No, we really haven't. We had picked up on some of the chatter and that question some of our peers. So, we took a look at our first quarter results which obviously with only 2.8 million square feet of leasing wasn't a particularly deep pool of data. So, we went back and looked at all of 2018 as well and the truth is it all performed really well. I mean I'm not going to kid here for us in actuality, the big space is north of 500,000 feet did perform the best for us in terms of occupancy and rent growth and the smaller under a 100,000 was probably the lowest performing but you're talking about the under 100,000 foot buildings being 97.2% compared to the over 500 at 98.9. So, they're all really good. Rent growth was probably the strongest in the big buildings at 31 and 10 and 22.4 and 7.1 in the smaller buildings; again really good numbers for any which way you want to slice it and it's funny because a lot of people think of our portfolio and we get a lot of credit for the million square foot Amazon buildings. But you have to remember that we have 300 buildings out of our 504 that are in service that are under 250,000 feet and that totals 40 million square feet of our 146 million that's in service. So, we've got a fair bit of exposure and we're really active in this size range. So, I'm happy to tell you it's good all over the board. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then as you guys think about growing a portfolio through acquisitions I mean do you have a bias, would you want to get more into kind of smaller footprint and small type assets or are you contend staying investing even more in kind of larger bombers? James Connor : I would tell you under a 100,000 feet we don't have a particularly strong appetite unless it was part of a package or deals like that but between a 100 and a million, it fits in our portfolio like anything else and a number of the one-off deals that Nick and his team have acquired this year and last would fall into that 100,000 to 250,000 square foot category and many of those are multi-tenant building. So, that's a product type that we've always played in. We're just probably not as well known for that as some of our peers but we've got a lot of that product and we do a lot of that leasing. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And the ones that Nick's been buying is that's just more because you can find them or that's more because you felt like you wanted to round out the portfolio with more of that? James Connor : Well, we're really just refining our geography a little bit with those small amount of acquisitions we're doing then using disposition proceeds for it and it's very selective in just a handful of high breed tier one markets. And those assets tend to be a little smaller. Jamie Feldman : I'm sorry? James Connor : And those assets tend to be a little bit smaller. Jamie Feldman : Right, okay, alright thank you. James Connor : Good. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Blaine Heck. Please go ahead. Blaine Heck : Thanks, good afternoon. So, you guys are a little slow out of the gate this here on the disposition front relative to kind of the quarterly taste hit guidance. You talked last quarter about getting Midwest dispositions done in the first half. So, is there anything to read into that related to the appetite for properties and tier two markets? Are sales taking any longer to complete then kind of your expectation or are those sales still on track? Nicholas Anthony : No, there are no issues. In fact, we have about a 100 million of volume nonrefundable right now that we expect to close very early in the third quarter and we've got most of our target disposition list and various stages of the process. So, traditionally dispositions have always happened later in the year and we always for whatever reason people wait till the end of the year to get things sold. Blaine Heck : Okay, I got it. And then, maybe sticking with you Nick, on the acquisitions just to get from the 3% in place to the 4.5% stabilized in there, is it just a matter of leasing them up to a stabilized level or is there any rent growth assumption built in there? Nicholas Anthony : No rent growth assumption built into it, it's just a one unit that needs to get leased up. Blaine Heck : Got it, thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Eric Frankel. Please go ahead. Eric Frankel : Thank you. Jim I guess you might have answered my question partially with your comment on the build to suit one this quarter. But just looking, I understand you have your 50% of kind of prelease minimum requirement for your development pipeline but you combine your unstabilized portfolio with your under developing portfolio I think the occupancy decrease from safe or lease percentage decrease in about 45% about I think 37% or so. Could you guys, are you guys thinking about altering your measure kind of what your risk cap is in terms of development and unstabilized assets? James Connor : No Eric, I can't tell you -- we're going to start looking at it any differently than I think we historically have. I think a combination of the occupancy of the underdevelopment the in service and the stabilized was the right cross section of all of our occupancy matrix to look at. And then, as big as we are we have to look at the development pipeline in totality. And we look at every spec project and measure the risk that we're taking on and as we talked in the past, that's not just from a company perspective but also looks at what's going on that business unit. What we got coming at us in the next 12 to 18 months in terms of lease role. What kind of rent growth and occupancy and that absorption we're seeing in those specific markets. So, I think we got our hand on the pulse of the right matrix, we'll be making all of those decisions. But we're always happy to talk about slicing and dicing the data differently if there is a better way to do it. Nicholas Anthony : Yes. The only thing I would add to that Eric I like Jim said. The 50% kind of preleased and the development pipeline is an easy thing to talk about. But we got a whole lot more matrix in that and totally that we look at before we pull the trigger on any new. Eric Frankel : That's helpful to know, thank you. I just have one follow-up and then I'll go queue back in. just on the build to suits that you're seeing for the rest of the year, have the margins at all changed for what you're able to offer, I mean it sounds like it's all supplies in check, it still seems that and most like a more even more competitive environment and then what it was a year or two ago. So, any thoughts on build to suit margins? Nicholas Anthony : No, our margins, we're projecting our margins to continue to be north of 20% which is where they literally averaged for the last probably 10 years. And that's a makeup of some of the more competitive build to suits, are probably in the mid-to-high teens, maybe 15% to 17%. And the speculative development particularly on land that we bought right, is probably 25%. Eric Frankel : Okay, I'll queue back in, thank you. Nicholas Anthony : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ki Bin Kim. Please go ahead. Ki Bin Kim : Hey, guys. So, if you look back at the industrial market for the past few years, I don\u2019t think it matter where you owned it, you pay I mean money on it. James Connor : We're okay with that. Ki Bin Kim : Yes, and I didn\u2019t make any money on this, well here there goes on our story. So, but going forward, how do you think about long-term market mix. And is it better to buy things in LA four caps even at this point versus and selling assets in the Midwest that low to mid five caps. I just want to get a sense of your broader thoughts on that topic. James Connor : Well, keep it up. I'll give you a couple of comments. We've done a pretty good job of analyzing the REIT growth in our portfolio and market dynamics and I think that's one of the big reasons you're seeing us as we've transitioned the company over the last few years pushing into those coastal markets. Because those coastal markets are where you had historically always gotten the strongest rent growth. When we go into a downturn over sessions, all of the markets are going to move the wrong way but typically those costal markets particularly the high barrier ones that we talk a lot about, those are the markets where you get the greatest returns. I would tell you our primary focus is on development and not necessarily acquisition, although we do do a bit of that. But I much rather be developing in and as you referenced LA, at a 5.5 as opposed to buy it at a four. But in today's world you're creating value with either one. Ki Bin Kim : And like the asset in 4375 Paris Boulevard, I'll be honest I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s our market, others saw market as a good one or bad one. I know it's only mile or a two mile stop at the other development that you have that was fully leased. But is development or our build to suit activity taking you away further way from the city center and is there some risk with that? James Connor : Well, if you want to look at individual assets, we do a combination of infill redevelopment and more traditional Greenfield development. So, if you look at what we're doing or what we've done in Southern California, when you go out to Perris in the Moreno Valley, that's more traditional Greenfield development. But when you go into the IE West and into Orange County where we've done a number of projects, that\u2019s much closer in infield. It has a higher degree of difficulty because you're generally dealing with having to assemble a complicated site. There's probably environmental issues. The development process in California as you know was a challenging one. So, in order to get the site fully entitled, you probably looking at 12 or 15 months with the work. But again, we do it all, we're doing a lot of infield development, we own a lot of infield properties, we'll continue to have a focus there. But we're also doing the bigger Greenfield because if you're in the Los Angeles and you need a million square foot distribution center, you can do it in Orange County if it doesn't exist. That's why all those big those big million square footers have gone out to the IE because that's where the land is available for those kind of developments. Ki Bin Kim : Alright, thank you. Operator : Next question is from the line of Michael Carroll. Please go ahead. Michael Carroll : Yes, thanks. Tim, I just wanted to touch on I guess your development leasing. I'm sorry if I miss this but I know you recently completed a number of projects where there has been some available space. And last quarter you gave us some pretty good details about the trends of those projects. I guess are those trends, are you still happy with leasing progress and we should expect to see some leases signed here over the next few quarters, is it still just a prime thing and why some of that space is still available? James Connor : Well you better expect to see some leases because I expect to see some huge sign. We will be in some serious trouble. No, I'll tell you Michael, the thing that we look at and again you can't get hung-up looking at an individual building because when we underwrite a speculative development irrespective of how good we think it is or how mediocre we think it is, we put in 12 months at least. And some of those buildings gets leased the first month and some gets leased in month 12 and unfortunately some gets leased in month 18. If you look across our entire portfolio for the last two years or three years? Nicholas Anthony : Three. James Connor : Three years, we've been averaging across all our speculative development complete lease up and stabilization in month nine. So, we've been running ahead of our underwriting. A lot of winners, a lot coming on on budget but a few losers. And that's what I think you'll continue to see, that's the nature of the beast with speculative development. Michael Carroll : Okay. And the, I guess your highlight on the build to suit pipeline, should we read into that since you started for the many spec projects in 1Q that you're going to be more focused on build to suit less on spec over the next few quarters or a spec's still interesting to you? James Connor : No, spec is still very interesting to us and we're always focused on build to suit because that's what has enabled us to drive new development to the levels that we have. What I would tell you and we've talked about this from time-to-time when I've referenced our development pipeline may dip below 50%. As we have worked our way into high barrier markets like Northern New Jersey and further into the Southern California infield markets like Orange County and even in Dade County where we have some very expensive land tied up. It pays for us to put that into production absolutely as soon as we can. So, in years gone by, I might have wanted to move some of those around from quarter-to-quarter to maintain that 50%, but in these instances we think the market is strong enough and the carry on the land is significant enough that we're probably going to move ahead and put those into production as soon as possible. And that's what driving that, what's behind my statement of where it may dip below, it's not going to go to 35% or 40%. But we just may choose from a timing perspective to move ahead with a few spec projects sooner than we thought we would have in the past but you'll also continue to see just as I referenced earlier since we already signed three build to suits have a good number of build to suit projects. Michael Carroll : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go to the line of Richard Anderson. Please go ahead. Richard Anderson : Thanks, good afternoon. So, Jim or anyone, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about obsolescence, not maybe this year but as the business of logistics moves closer in and this kind of been just underwriting this call, away from perhaps these huge fulfilment centers into smaller spaces. Even Amazon is doing that more and more. What is an alternative us of a million two square foot rectangle. James Connor : Well, we've talked in the past, we've never lost Amazon from any one of our facilities, now that isn\u2019t to say they haven\u2019t moved out and so and eventually someday they'll move out of lot. And as we've spent a lot of time --. Richard Anderson : They moved out of Coffeyville I believe I recall reading that but that's a long time ago. Anyway, okay. James Connor : That wasn\u2019t one of our projects. Richard Anderson : I know, yes. James Connor : So, but you know what, some day they will, you're absolutely right. And what we want to remind everybody is we own just the box, okay we don\u2019t own any of the material, handling, equipment or mezzanines or robotics or anything like that. And we've got restoration costs. So, at the end of the day I own a good clean functional 1.2 million 1.1 whatever the size is box with plenty of parking and plenty of tailor storage, plenty of loading facilities. That building can be released to Walmart, to Procter & Gamble to target, that building could be divided into half or quarters, I can do 500,000 foot leases or 300,000 foot leases. So, we've always got an eye towards the future in any of our development whether it's speculative of build to suit and we think we've underwritten those at the right basis that at the end of that lease term if we were to lose in Amazon, we'll be able to compete for deals very favorably. Nicholas Anthony : Rich, the other thing I would say is these, take Amazon for example, these 90,000 80,000 square foot buildings are not replacing anything, and they're purely additive to their supply chain. They also still serviced by these fulfilment centers. So, it's just maybe that the fulfilment center is servicing both the direct and consumer and those delivery stations or whatever you want to call them. So, they're not replacing anything, they're just additive to their supply chain. Richard Anderson : Okay, fair enough. And then another thing that was touched on then and on off was explicitly answered, you don\u2019t have a bent either way about having your average asset size go higher or lower over the course of the next few years. Do you or you're thinking in terms of well maybe you said 100,000 or a million square feet fit into our kind of business model. Are you kind of showing your cards a little bit that they'll be willing to get a little bit smaller? Nicholas Anthony : Yes, I would tell you we do not have a component of our strategic plan or our annual budget. That says we want to get our average building size bigger or our average tenant size bigger or the inverse, smaller by any stretch of the imagination. Our local operating teams are out just trying to do good quality business. And we own, we still own, I'm looking at the latest numbers here, we still own 95 buildings under a 100,000 square feet, 202 between a 100,000 and 250,000 feet, a 140 between 250 and 500 and 87 over 500. I mean that's pretty good balance across all sizes. And I'd happily take more of any of those. Ronald Hubbard : Yes, and if you look at our pipeline of what we're building Rich, we're building everything from a 140 to a million and everything in between. Richard Anderson : Yes. Ronald Hubbard : It's more about where the asset is and what it's going to serve and how big the asset is. Richard Anderson : So, size doesn't matter, is that right? James Connor : Rich, I'm not going there, buddy, not on a public line. Richard Anderson : I kind of partially stumped, okay you guys stumbled first time, alright thanks, that's all. Operator : Our next question is from John Guinee. Please go ahead. John Guinee : Great, thank you. Mark, by the way you're building a 77,000 foot building in Indianapolis to say now. Mark Denien : That's true, I forgot about that one. Nicholas Anthony : True John, you're right. John Guinee : So, big picture, Jim. Not all these sub markets are created equal and some of them are basically out of land clearly out of Greenfield land and into repurposing land. Can you talk about the bigger markets say Atlanta, Dallas, Chicago, you guys have a great team in Atlanta, great team in Dallas. Maybe whatever markets you care about that where are you essentially out of land and where particularly with sub markets as the DFW sub market and then where are those land as far as the eye can see and then take it into the ability to have long-term pricing power in these markets where you're essentially out of land? James Connor : Well John, you've hit on what is the key to some of these Tier 1 markets, I do we might have some data handy because I thought we might get this question. So, if you take Dallas for example which by and large in its entirety is reasonably healthy, has good strong net absorption but you drill down to the sub market level and you go to on the South Dallas and we've all talked about South Dallas before. No barriers to entry, plenty of available land, good expressway access, reasonably new intermodal and a vacancy in South Dallas is 15.3%. So, like four times the national average. You go to the DFW sub market which you and I would call infill and there's very little available land, there vacancy is 6%. If you go to Chicago, it's the same extreme. You go under the I80 corridor, again not a lot of barriers to entry, good expressway access and the vacancy down there is a 11.7%. You go to the O'Hare Market, we've all been in toward through the O'Hare Market. It's 2.4% vacancy. So, you're absolutely right, not only do you not have pricing power today when the vacancy in those overbuilt markets, is where it is but you can anticipate having any pricing power over the long-term. So, when if you have a building down there and you got lease role coming at you, your tenant probably has the opportunity to look at a number of different spec buildings or potentially go to a build to suit whereas you go to these infill markets around the airport -  and some of the other high barrier Tier 1 markets that we've talked about and those opportunities don\u2019t avail themselves and which is why you can generally get up to twice the rent growth in those markets that you can and some of these low barrier markets. John Guinee : Well said, good job, thanks. Operator : The next question is from the line of Michael Mueller. Please go ahead. Michael Mueller : Yes, hi. I guess in the released upfront, you called out that you're going to have a little level of lease for wherever the rest of 2019. Because I'm curious, is there anything you need to you're trying to point out about this year that you are trying to get us focused on because when I like at the first quarter '18 stop, it was the same exact dynamic. James Connor : No, I don\u2019t necessarily think so, Michael. I think it's just its lower risk. I mean, we may not have the ability to push rent growth quite as much as some of our peers but at the same time there is a risk related to do in that. So, it's a little bit around the guidance that we gave on same proper NOI. That's another reason that it will decelerate a little bit for the remainder of the year because we won't be rowing as many tenants as maybe we would like to in this environment. But in the long run we like the balance of what we have. Michael Mueller : Okay, so it's nothing really atypical about this year then? James Connor : Not necessarily, I think this year was still a little lower than the past because we did just a tremendous amount of pull forwards in the fourth quarter that we talked about on the fourth quarter call. And when I say pull forwards, some of them were just four to six months early, not like they were dramatically early. But we just took care of more of this year's expirations at the end of last year than I think would be normal, not a lot more but a little bit more. Michael Mueller : Got it, okay. That was it, thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll move to the line of Eric Frankel. Please go ahead. Eric Frankel : Thank you. I think one market and then I just want maybe some we might have some better clarity on, is Atlanta we've done some spec development. Can you just describe the recent activity there and how quickly you're taking the lease up your recent development? James Connor : Yes, we got really activity down there and I note when you look at Atlanta in its entirety, people see 6%, that's actually down first quarter of 2018, it was 6.8%. And I think Atlanta had depending on who you talked to, 18 million square feet plus or minus. So, a lot of good activity. But there is as you pointed Eric, a fair bit of development down there. So, we've got three buildings. One of which is 589, one of which is a 193, hold on I'm searching for the other one. The other one's 498. The 498 is I'm looking at a prospect list right now, we got two good prospects. The 193, we've signed a lease for over a half of that building that will be announced at the second quarter. So, we got over 90,000 feet there left and my sheet says we got two prospects for that. And then, the big building the 598, we got three prospects forward. And so, we're continuing to see good demand across the board and we always are evaluating at this point in the cycle whether we want to hold out for full building tenants or we're into break the building up. And that's a little bit of what's going on depending on the kind of activity that we're seeing. But again, those buildings have a fair bit of flexibility. So, we can do single tenant dealings or we can break the building up and lease it to two different tenants. Eric Frankel : Okay. And then maybe another market just to touch on Central PA, any concerns there, I hear that recent activity is a little bit softer and there's since there has been a lot that in development it's going to be coming online in the next few quarters. James Connor : Yes, as I mentioned in the past, Central PA is has been a little bit slow, we've got a big building there, looking forward on my list here, 832. We got one full building prospected to partial building prospects, half and then three quarters of the building. So, I would tell you activity is good but that building came into service in the third quarter of last year. And as I like to remind my leasing team out there, I think it's ripe for leasing. Eric Frankel : Okay. So alright, we'll see it happen. Are there any tenants on the watch list in terms of credit that's that we should know about or there might be a factor in same-store guidance? James Connor : No, nothing new other than we do have one tenant, one new event I guess you'd say, ZGallerie filed bankruptcy back in March. They are current on the rent, they're down in about 200,000 square feet in Atlanta. From everything we've been told, it's a chapter 11 situation, the facility is pretty critical. Those are a supply chain. So, we think it'll be business as usual but if something were to change in that, the rent is below market. So, I think it would be a situation of kind of like the HH spreads, there'd be a period of time to retenant it if that would happen but it be at better rounds. Other than that, nothing new Eric. Eric Frankel : Okay, final question. You might have seen pretty sure heard of off from the Journo yesterday about a fairly large portfolio platform coming online that might come to market this year. Do you think there's actual appetites to take down a super large portfolio that's worth say $15 billion or $20 billion? James Connor : Eric, on that I don\u2019t know that order of magnitude, there is an awful lot of dry powder out there chasing logistics properties and I think a number of the deals that have been done over the last couple of years in the let's call it $3 billion to $7 billion range, have had multiple bidders. So, I don\u2019t think it's out of the question. I don\u2019t think it's out of the question that you could create a partnership that could take down a project of that magnitude. But I was selling guys earlier. Looking at big deals like that, it's a little bit like shopping for a new big boat. It's really fun to look at it and talk about it but it's financially hard to do. Eric Frankel : Yes, understood, okay thank you. Operator : And there are no further question. Thank you. James Connor : I want to thank everyone for joining the call today. We look forward to see many of you at the NAREIT conference in New York in early June. With that, you may disconnect the line. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and we're using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Also note, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tracy Ward. Tracy, you may begin. Tracy Ward : Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Prologis second quarter earnings call. If you have not yet downloaded the press release, it is available on Prologis' website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. This morning, you'll hear from Tom Olinger, our Chief Financial Officer and Gene Reilly, Prologis's Chief Investment Officer. Also, joining us in today for the call is Hamid Moghadam, Gary Anderson, Chris Caton, Mike Curless, Ed Nekritz and Colleen McKeown. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry, in which the company operate, as well as the beliefs and assumptions of management. Some of these factors are referred to in Prologis' 10-K or SEC filings. Additional factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, the expected timing and likelihood of the completion of the transaction with IPT, including the ability to attain the approval of their stockholders and the risk that the conditions of the closing of the transaction may not be satisfied. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and the actual operating results may differ. Finally, this call will contain financial measures, such as FFO, EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures and in accordance with Reg-G, the company has provided a reconciliation to those measures in our earnings package. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom. Tom, will you please begin. Tom Olinger : Thanks Tracy. Good morning. And thank you for joining us today. We had another excellent quarter. Our proprietary operating metrics continue to reflect strong demand. Showings, average deal gestation and conversion rates remain either in line or better than last quarter as our customers further build out their supply chain capabilities in the face of strength. Market conditions in the U.S. continue to be very healthy. Demand is diverse and overall supply is disciplined. Starts in the U.S. are concentrated in low barrier markets, while supply in the high barrier markets is not keeping pace with GDP growth, let alone demand for logistics facilities closer to the endpoint of consumption. Continental Europe remained strong and we expect rent growth this year to be the highest in more than a decade. In Japan, despite moderating economic growth, business is quite good. Demand continues to be boosted by ecommerce, while supply is being steadily absorbed. With the improvement we are seeing in the Osaka market, we are removing it from our market watch list. We are raising our 2019 global rent growth estimates by approximately 100 basis points to over 5.5% as low vacancies and rising replacement costs continue to push market rents higher. Looking to the quarter. We leased 37 million square feet, including 5 million square feet in our development portfolio. Period-end occupancy was flat sequentially. Rent change on a role continues to be outstanding, but are shared over 25% and led by U.S. at 30%. We expect rent change to trend higher in the back half of the year. Our share of cash same-store NOI growth was 4.6%. Notably, Europe was 5.3%, driven by rent growth which we have anticipated. Core FFO was $0.77 per share for the second quarter. G&A in the quarter was higher than expected, driven by stock-based compensation, resulting from the increase in our share price. This impact was mostly offset by higher than forecasted promo to them. For deployment, starts were $324 million in the quarter. The pace of starts will increase meaningfully in the second half of the year. In fact, we've already started 250 million of build-to-suits in the first two weeks of July. We completed over $600 million in dispositions and contributions, resulting in $200 million of realized gains in the quarter. Now, for 2019 guidance highlights which are on an our-share basis. And note that our guidance does not include the impacts from the IPT acquisition. We are increasing and narrowing our cash same-store NOI guidance to a range of 4.5% to 5%. We're holding the top end of our range as we continue to prioritize the rents over occupancy. We're raising the midpoint for both development starts and contributions by $100 million, and realized development gains by $50 million. We still expect about $400 million net usage, which we plan to fund with free cash flow and a modest increase in leverage. Net promote income for the full year is now expected to be $0.16 per share, an increase of $0.02 from our prior guidance. Effectively, all of the remaining net promote income will be earned in the third quarter. For the full year, we are increasing our 2019 core FFO guidance midpoint by $0.05, and narrowing the range between $3.26 and $3.30 per share. And our revised midpoint growth and core FFO per share, excluding promotes, is 9.5% higher than last year. Over the past five years, our growth has clearly been exceptional with a CAGR of almost 12%, while de-levering by 800 basis points. As I mentioned, this guidance does not include IPT. The acquisition of this high-quality portfolio, which Gene will cover in more detail, captures significant costs and revenue synergies, delivering shareholder value on day-one. We planned a whole new portfolio through one or both of our U.S. private vehicles, and expect the transaction to close no later than the first quarter of 2020. Depending on the ultimate allocation, our investment via the ventures is likely the range between $1 billion and $1.4 billion, which we will fund with cash and debt. The resulting annual core FFO accretion is expected to range between $0.05 and $0.06 per share on a stabilized basis. This transaction will have a minimal impact on leverage with loan to value rising about 150 basis points upon the completion of the non-strategic asset sales to approximately 21%. We do not plan to add any corporate overhead in connection with this acquisition and as a result expect G&A as a percentage of [AUM] decreased by 4%. I feel that several questions lately about how we will continue to grow given our size, we think about growth and three components. The first is organic and based on the quality and strength of our portfolio. This is by far the most important and sustainable driver of growth that also deserves the highest multiple. The second is the value creation from development and to build out of our land bank. The third component is arbitraging the pricing between public and private markets. This is episodic, out of the hands of management and not sustainable over the long-term. We focus on the first two components, which have been the driver of our superior performance, and will continue to be the foundation of our long term growth. To sum up, the second quarter was a continuation of what has already been a very good year. I have never felt better about our growth outlook. And with that, I'll turn it over to Gene. Gene Reilly : Thanks, Tom. I'm pleased to share the details about our merger agreement by IPT. Portfolio comprises 37.5 million square feet and 24 U.S. markets, 22 of which are the largest target markets. The assets are located in sub-markets we consider strategic and where we already have the benefit and scale, and a proven operating presence. The portfolio is slightly younger than the balance of our existing U.S. assets and otherwise, very similar in terms of customer profile and physical characteristics. Over the normal course of business, we anticipated disposition program of approximately $800 million or 20% of the portfolio. The $4 billion price works out to 4.5% stabilized cap rate and a cap rate of just under 4.9% using current market rents. And then $106 a square foot, we believe we are purchasing the portfolio at a small discount to replace some costs. We are not purchasing the IPT operating platform and therefore, our incremental hiring activity will be limited to leasing and property management personnel necessary to manage the portfolio. As IPT leases roll overtime, the Prologis teams will have the benefit of deeper market knowledge and relationships, greater flexibility, access to better information, bigger market share and ultimately, the ability to provide the best service to our customers and generate more revenue. The $0.05 to $0.06 of accretion that Tom mentioned does not include the potential benefits of procurement, ancillary revenue sources, or our other platform initiatives currently underway. During the past eight years, we've integrated over $45 billion in very large portfolio transactions, including the AMB Prologis transaction, KTR and DCT. In each case, we outperformed our synergy forecast and we expect to do so here. So in short, we're highly confident in our ability to integrate these assets into our portfolio. And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jeremy Metz with BMO. Your line is open. Jeremy Metz : Tom, you mentioned your allocation to IPT will be in the 25% to 35% range of your share. Even though in the past, you have a queue of investors waiting to get into the funds. You've talked about wanting to bring your stake there down to the 15% level give or take over time. So is there a thought to take even less of this deal initially and then sticking with that? Maybe you can talk about the Promote opportunity, and how much that $0.05 to $0.06 of accretion is fee driven? Thanks. Tom Olinger : Thanks Jeremy. A couple things. So the way to think about our incremental investment. If you split the portfolio equally between the two funds, our ownership is 41%. And USLV, it does not use equity, USLF does. So we would think about 50% leverage targets to fund this deal from an USLF transaction. So think about $3 billion of equity that needed to come to the table our 40% of that is $1.2 billion. When you think about the accretion, the accretion is, primarily the vast majority of the accretion is operating efficiencies. So the $0.05 to $0.06 is $0.035 of operating efficiencies between $0.015 to $0.02 of incremental leverage and about a penny about a half of penny or less of actually purchase get to us. And so the accretion is quite strong. Most of that is cash. The fee components would be baked in that $0.035 I talked about and that's roughly $0.02. Jeremy Metz : Yes, at the beginning of that Tom mentioned, you won't require any equity. You meant that doesn't require any debt\u2026 Tom Olinger : That's right. Operator : Your next question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi. Your line is open. Michael Bilerman : It's Michael Bilermanhere with Manny. I guess if you step back from it, there's such a strong amount of NOI potential within this portfolio. Why not own the whole thing? And clearly, you have the ability to finance at lower rates, whether it's in Europe or in Asia, which would provide you even more accretion buying in U.S. portfolio and owning $4 billion of assets, and getting all of the 40 basis points of upside in the market rents would all flow to the bottom-line versus the trade-off of the incremental fees you're getting. Certainly is there to be able to do it too, at north of $80, you certainly could issue equity and/or debt a little bit as well? Hamid Moghadam : This is Hamid, Michael. We don't really view our strategic capital business as where we put our bad deals or the ones that are not accretive. It is an integral part of our business. And it is part of our strategy going forward. And that's the vehicle -- those are the vehicles that we've established exactly for doing this thing. So we're sticking to that business plan and it's not like the good ones go to the balance sheets and the bad ones go to the fund. We all do it the same way. Also, the return on equity in the funds is obviously greater, because of the leverage through the asset management fees and the like. So, that's the strategy. It's been the strategy and it will remain the strategy. Tom Olinger : Michael, on your debt question about U.S. versus non-U.S. debt. We only would do that to the extent we're matching foreign assets with foreign debt. About 79% of our debt today is non-dollar. We have not assumed in our accretion that we would use any non-dollar financing peers, all U.S. dollar financing. Do we have the ability to do a little more non-dollar financing? Sure, but none of us that's baked into these numbers. Operator : Your next question comes from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Derek Johnston : I guess, switching to Europe. Certainly, a strong contributor in 2Q and this is while EU and global consensus gross estimates were falling. Is there a lag that we should be concerned about filtering through to the back half of '19 leasing metrics? And is there any further update on the outlook for rent growth? Or the healthy absorption rates that we've seen in the EU post 2Q? Gene Reilly : This is Gene. I'll start with the answer and I think Chris Caton will pile on as well. So, we just don't see headwinds in the operating environment. And you've got basically 3% vacancy rates across the continent. You get steady demand. You get demand in excess of very low economic growth but you have steady demand. And we just don't -- we don't see trade concerns, we don't see Brexit coming up in any customer dialog. So things look pretty good right now. And we also don't see excessive supply other than in some very isolated individual markets. Chris Caton : Yes, Gene is spot on. The market is unfolding a lot like we anticipated at the beginning of the year. That's low 3% vacancy rates, that's rental rates on a net effective basis that are on pace to rise. More than 6% on the continent rents are call it, more than 3% in the first half of the year. So there's really good momentum and we feel confident looking forward. Hamid Moghadam : But on the other side of that, the UK has slowed down a bit and the continent is stronger than we thought. So, I don't think Brexit not having any effect, its right. I think definitely the UK had slowed down some, particularly in the midlands. Operator : Your next question comes from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Caitlin Burrows : Maybe back to the IPT acquisition. I was just wondering if you could comment on what the interest level was like, or the competition from other potential acquirers. And what do you think differentiated Prologis, either in your assumptions, financing, or something else allowing you to ultimately win this deal? Hamid Moghadam : Well, ultimately, I can't tell you who bid on the portfolio. I can tell you it was a competitive process. And as I think everybody knows on this call, there is plenty of capital interested in this real estate. As for our competitive advantage, I don't think it's any of the items you've listed. But I do think certainty of close, particularly for a vehicle like this publicly held vehicle was critical. And so, I think their confidence and our ability to negotiate complete this transaction smoothly, was important. Gene Reilly : Yes, also the proxy will have plenty of the details from what they looked at on the other side. So, we'll both find out. Operator : Your next question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Steve Sakwa : Thanks, good morning. I just wanted to see if you could comment a little bit on the NOI guidance, Tom. You did about 5% in the first half of the year. The high end, you kept unchanged at 5%. So that assumes flattish growth in the back half at the low end assumes 4%. And I realize you're facing some tougher occupancy comps the back half of the year. But just can you help us think through the low and the high end, given where we sit here today and what drives you to both of those two points? Tom Olinger : Yes, Steve, you nailed it. It's really occupancy impact. We are continuing to push rents. We are seeing occupancies dip a little bit. I think we certainly have room to push rents more. If you just looked at our retention, you look at our occupancy you look at our rent growth. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I think we're going to see and we will see rent change on a roll accelerate in the second half. We talked about rents growth increasing and why are we taking the top end up is because of occupancy. We're going to push rents and we don't have a lot of role in the second half. But this is really setting up for just longer durable runway for same store growth where our mark-to-markets holding at over 15% even with rolling 25% in the quarter. And if you really look at same-store, think about -- as we said in the last couple of calls, 2019 is a transitional year for same-store in that we have lower occupancy. So that's been a headwind this year. But if you think about the real driver of your same-store rent change your roll, it's been accelerating. Our trailing fourth quarter rent change on a roll is up over 300 basis points in the last four quarters. It is going to go higher, going forward. So the fundamental driver of same-store is intact and it is growing, and it will grow. But one thing on retention, we're seeing retention is very high on the larger spaces. And we're pushing rents across the board. I think we have an opportunity to push rents across all of our space sizes. Operator : Your next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Jamie Feldman : I know you had said that you expect your development starts to ramp up in the back half of the year. Can you just talk about what, both build-to-suit and spec pipeline looks like today? And as we think ahead to next year, do you think that -- and we're hearing across a lot of markets that there's an expectation that pipelines may actually shrink given less available land and even maybe less capital to put to work? I just want to get your thoughts on how you think things are shaping up over the next 12 months or so in terms of the supply and demand story and your ability to keep putting capital to work? Mike Curless : Jamie, its Mike Curless. So I'll hit the build-to-suit and then I'll flip it to Gene on the spec. Certainly seen -- a lot of you've seen some public announcements from some of our larger customers with major plans for significant rollouts. So, I'd say there's definitely an up arrow on the requirements and the demands. It is more challenging to deliver build-to-suits these days, zoning and land availability and some of the more global markets. But we're certainly working through that. Our build-to-suit percentage lows in the 27% range this quarter that's very lumpy, as you know Jamie, I think you got to look at it across four quarters. And I fully expect very robust quarter coming up as we speak right now, as Tom mentioned, with $250 million build-to-suit stars already underway. And I'd look towards our build-to-suit percentage to be in the range in the high 30s, largely driven by some significant national rollouts. Gene, on spec? Gene Reilly : So Jamie we've, as you can see, taken out the midpoint $100 million. Some of that\u2019s captured by the increased build-to-suit activity Mike talked about. So, I'd say there's a very modest increase in spec. But I don't -- we don't -- when we see opportunities, as you know, we have a robust land bank. So we have the ability to start building, but we're not going to do it unless we see market opportunity, and we do. So, basically, the answer to your question is, we're going to have a modest increase based on our prior guidance throughout the rest of this year. Operator : Your next question comes from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Vikram Malhotra : So just wanted to clarify, I think you said mark-to-market across the four portfolios holding at 15%. Can you break that between the U.S. and Europe? And also, just clarify what the mark-to-market is in IPT? Tom Olinger : I'll take the first piece. So in our portfolio today, Prologis U.S., is around 17% and Europe is around 11%. So our blended is about 15.5%. Gene Reilly : IPT is pretty much in line with the rest of our U.S. assets. Operator : Your next question comes from Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Craig Mailman : A quick questions for you, just looking -- I know you guys didn't buy the whole IPT portfolio relative to the numbers that they had in their financials. But it looked like '17 and '18, they were trending below 2% same store growth. And I'm just curious, I know you guys have some operational efficiencies baked in. But as you guys look at your legacy PLD portfolio growth profile versus what you're ultimately going to bring into the portfolio. Will this ultimately be accretive to your growth portfolio or inline or dilutive from your perspective? Hamid Moghadam : I think slightly accretive. And I mean to be frank we have not studied their historical operating performance. What we have study is the location and quality of the assets, which we like. We bought them onto our platform, I'd say, it's a marginal increase. Operator : Your next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is open. Ki Bin Kim : I guess a couple of questions on IPT portfolio. First, can you just talk a little bit about what prompted this deal? What was the thinking behind it, I don't think its scaled. Do you have enough of it? And even the financial accretion was quite a success it seems like that by and itself wouldn't prompt the deal of this size. So, can maybe talk about the other points that we haven't covered? Hamid Moghadam : I think that level and the availability of high quality portfolios is dwindling. And these portfolios are going into capital sources that are permanent. And I think there's a limited supply of this stuff and they're really good market. So whenever there is an opportunity to pick up some of those assets and scale, you'll see us competing for those opportunities. And because of the clustering effect around our own portfolio, which is also focused on the same markets, we can really squeeze a lot more juice out of those oranges. Operator : Your next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Your line is open. Nick Yulico, you're unmute, so your line is open. Nick Yulico : For IPT, I think you said 20% of the portfolio is a sale candidate non-strategic asset. Can you just talk about why they're non-strategic and how you underwrote those assets from a -- how we should think about a cap rate on sale those assets? Hamid Moghadam : Could you repeat the first part of the question? Nick Yulico : So, I think you said that\u2026 Hamid Moghadam : For sale portfolio, which is 20%, a small portion of it is two markets, Memphis and Salt Lake City, which we're not present in. So that's about 5% of it. And the balance of it is the pruning of the markets where we have a presence, but we don't really see a fit between that portion and our assets, that portion of the portfolio and our existing assets. So, it's a combination of market exits in those two cases and pruning in the case of the rest. Gene Reilly : And I just want to pile on that a bit. These disposition assets are good assets. They're not assets that are consistent with our strategy. But I think these assets will be relatively easy to dispose of as compared to some of our prior activities. Hamid Moghadam : Yes, one other data point for you. This is not the first time we've gone through cleanup of assets. We've sold about $14 billion of assets in the last five or six years. And you might be interested that on average we've exceeded our expectations by about 6% on the sales prices. So we're pretty comfortable that we can exit these assets at the premium. Operator : Your next question is from Dave Rodgers with Baird. Your line is open. Dave Rodgers : Yes, for Tom or Hamid, just maybe talking about the construction pipeline just nationally, or maybe even internationally. You said you took Osaka off the watch list for as a market. Have you added any and where do you see the most competition today? I think Tom you referenced the supply in your comments? Gene Reilly : It's Gene, I'll start and I think Chris will finish the answer. But if we look at the globe as compared to last quarter, there really aren't very many differences. As you heard us say over the past four or five years, frankly, certain markets in South Dallas and certain markets in Atlanta, i.e. in Chicago, Central Pennsylvania, once in a while, Inland Empire East and the U.S. come-on and come-off the list. And what's interesting is that in prior cycles markets never came off the list, they just kept over-building them until you're in a crisis. So that picture really hasn't changed internationally. The one note that we have is Osaka. Osaka's vacancy was very elevated. It's now, I think 9% or 10%. So it may come back on the list. But at this point, we're pretty comfortable. A lot of reduction in that vacancy rate recently. Chris, I don't know if you have\u2026 Chris Caton : Yes, Gene, You're spot on, I'd add, in fact there have been no additions this year. And that you have to look back to last year for the additions to this list. And as we mentioned in Midland is a market and then also Houston were addition late last year, so no additions this year and one subtraction. Operator : Your next question is from Jon Petersen with Jefferies. Your line is open. JonPetersen: Probably a question for Gene or maybe Chris Caton. I think with the DCT transaction, you talked about how -- when you get a certain concentration in sub-markets you're able to push rent a bit harder, I forget exactly how you framed that. But I'm curious with the IPT transaction if you call out any sub-markets that you now have a dominant market position that you didn't have before? And then second one probably for Tom. Just to clarify, this transaction won't require any new common equity for Prologis, right? Chris Caton : I'll take the second one, absolutely not, no equity. Gene Reilly : So, the way we look at asset clusters and that's one way we describe this is if we're adding assets to the market that, let's say, we have 20 buildings, 25 buildings and call that 3 million to 4 million square feet. There is a clustering effect that we have tracked and we have tested. And there is no question you get incremental NOI. I'm not going to go into any specific details on that. But you have a situation when you're adding to a cluster, or you're adding enough to a smaller concentration that we already own. And you then created a cluster. And in this case we have one market that, you for sure, have created a cluster that will be Portland. There's a pretty good concentration here in Portland, PA and Baltimore, also fall in that category. And otherwise, we're just adding on to very, very big, big concentrations. And Chris, I don't know if you want to add anything to that. Chris Caton : I think that was perfect. The only thing I would add is that the benefit doesn't just accrue to the newly acquired portfolios, also, accrues to the existing portfolio, which is by far the more important of the two pieces. Operator : Your next question is from John Guinee with Stifel. Your line is open. John Guinee : Hamid, first congratulations. As I recall, you acquired DCT at about $118 a foot and a 4.2 in place cap rate. Talk a little bit about the quality difference between IPT and DCT, which obviously has the same initial investment and strategy in the initial roots? Hamid Moghadam : Yes, so we bought DCT at 4.6 cap rate and it was stock for stock deal. So, it was more of a relative valuation exercise than an absolute valuation exercise. So, I don't think you can conclude much about market cap rates based on looking at that. But this one in terms of quality, I would say, if you look at the whole portion, DCT was 95% hold, this is 80% hold and 20% sell. So in that sense, I would mark the DCT portfolio as better, because it has less to dispose. But if you look at the 80% and the 95%, I would say they were comparable. Operator : Your next question is from Eric Frankel with Green Street Advisors. Your line is open. Eric Frankel : Just to go back to the price of the IPT deal, that's a 4.5% cap rate, you quoted that based on your definition of stabilization. So maybe the cap rate would be a little bit higher based on current input occupancy. And then second, do you guys believe that you paid some maybe aggregation premium rather than if you brought this entire portfolio on a one-off basis? And then finally, based on where interest rates have gone the last few months. Do you think cap rates, in general, have declined for good quality industrial assets? Thank you. Tom Olinger : So couple of comments on the cap rates. I mean, cap rates are really difficult things to talk about, because all kinds of people use different approaches to them. Just to be clear, the way we call it something a cap rate is that it's the purchase price plus all the closing costs, plus the CapEx required to get it to stabilize occupancy, if necessary. And includes a vacancy allowance, which is critical because the portfolio is over leased 95% we adjust it back down to 95%. So our cap rates oftentimes we shake our heads to the reported cap rates that we see in the marketplace, because that's certainly not the cap rates that we underwrote. And you can imagine that we look at pretty much every deal. So that's one commentary on methodology. With respect to the direction of cap rates, I will tell you that this was since DCT the third significant portfolios that we looked at and competed for and obviously, in the other two cases, we were not successful. Our pricing did not change as to the whole portion of those portfolios at all pretty consistent. I'm not smart enough to tell you whether there was a portfolio or not, but we did not attribute one to the portfolio on this one or any of the other ones. But on the other ones, we were unsuccessful and on this one, we'll be successful, so who knows. Hamid Moghadam : Erick, just one more thing. On the cost side of that equation, we also mark any debt to market. And I think, often people leave that out of the equation and you have to, you have to factor it. Tom Olinger : And in this one, there wasn't any of that. But on the others, there're actually been significant margins. Operator : Your next question is from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Michael Carroll : Can you provide a quick macro update? I know you included some conservatism in your prior guidance ranges. Did you remove that conservatism in the updated range? And how's the logistic real estate market remain largely inflated from the headline trade fears that we continue to hear about? Tom Olinger : So I'll start. No more conservatism in our guidance. And I would just tell you from what we see from our customer perspective, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we're seeing very consistent sequential quarter activity as it relates to showings, gestation, conversion rates, all that's holding or slightly better. So from what we see in our pipeline, it continues to be quite good. Mike Curless : This is Mike. From a customer perspective, no meaningful impact other than perhaps a little blip with some increased inventories and spot examples, but nothing significant. Hamid Moghadam : Yes, I think you maybe referring to the commentary on the fourth quarter call, where we were just coming off of a significant stock market sell-off and things were a little wobbly, generally with the overall economy in January. And we talked about having in the most recent two weeks, reduced our internal planning, that's all done. We're back on track. So, if you're referring to that, you can ignore all that. Operator : Your next question is from Michael Mueller with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Michael Mueller : What's the timeframe to dispose of the remaining IPT sale assets? Will it all be done in 2020? Gene Reilly : Michael, this is Gene. We tend not to put our deadlines on that. In the current environment, I was telling, I think we need to do it fairly quickly in that timeframe. But we do it on the normal course of business. It has to be consistent with everything else we're doing. And then we have to see where the demand patterns on it. Sometimes you can aggregate a portfolio and move quickly, other cases maximizing value means one-off. So -- but that timeframe within 2020 is probably reasonable. Operator : And our last question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi. Your line is open. Michael Bilerman : It's Michael Bilerman. I had a few more. I'm hope you can address one at a time. But just in terms of\u2026 Hamid Moghadam : Michael, you can go continuously, because you are the last one. So we can go on with\u2026 Michael Bilerman : How much time do you have? Hamid Moghadam : Don't get carried away\u2026 Michael Bilerman : So, just in terms of upside potential, squeezing more juice out of these oranges in this portfolio. You talked about, I think, you mentioned the 4.5% stabilized and 4.9% cap rate assuming current market rents. But then when another analyst asked about the mark-to-market, you mentioned the Prologis portfolio was 17% but these assets were similar. But the difference in cap rate 4.5% to 4.9% is only about 8% upside on market rents. So, I didn't know what the difference was or what maybe driving down the yield, the numbers didn't match up. Mike Curless : Its cash, cash versus effective cap base\u2026 Michael Bilerman : So, the 4.5% to 4.9% is a cash. So your mark-to-market on a cash basis in the Prologis portfolio would be 8%, 9% also. That 17% is a GAAP number? Mike Curless : It's about 10%. So the 4.5% and 4.9% are not precise numbers either, obviously. So we were going to take out four decimals, Hamid didn\u2019t like that, so\u2026 Hamid Moghadam : Michael, the other thing is that there's a difference between the hold portfolio and the sell portfolio. So, the hold portfolio has a bigger mark-to-market, because those are stronger markets by and large and they've had more rent appreciations. But the primary difference is the cash versus GAAP number, which is about 5 points. Michael Bilerman : And then just to go through actually on the whole portfolio. Is the plan to warehouse that $800 million of assets on Prologis' balance sheet? Or is the entirety of the $4 billion going into one or the two funds and those assets will be sold out of the funds? I'm just trying to understand the dynamics going on? Hamid Moghadam : It's the latter, Michael. It's the latter. Mike Curless : The assets will be going to the funds. Any sale assets will be sold by the funds. Michael Bilerman : By the funds, and that will just reduce your effective ownership or your contribution in those funds? Hamid Moghadam : Not really, Michael, because we have a revolving line of credit that we pull up and down. So we're probably not going to pull capital out of the funds. We'll just leave it in there for future growth. Michael Bilerman : And then just I wanted to come back to my original question about doing this wholly owned versus in the funds. And I recognize DCT was a stock-for-stock transaction. But that didn't alleviate you from having the ability to sell DCT assets to the funds, if you chose to. So I'm just really trying to understand these two larger scale M&A transactions. One yes, it was stock for stock. This one is a cash deal, the non-traded public REIT that you're doing for all cash. I guess, why was DCT all balance sheet and why was IPT a fund asset? Hamid Moghadam : Good question. First of all, the choice of currency is not always ours. Sometimes the settler demands different kinds of currencies. But yes, that deals we do on balance sheet. And to them buy a deal and then sell it to the fund, there're just too much frictional cost associated with that. And oftentimes, the structuring of the transaction prevents that for some period of time. So, it gets complicated to do that. In terms of cash transactions, or cash portion of certain transactions, we're committed to do those deals, as I mentioned to in the funds. I mean, that's our business model and we'll continue to do that. These are, by the way, now very, very significant funds. I mean, you'll look at where a USLF will be at the end of this deal, it's going to be north of $12 billion. You look at where our European fund PELF is. It's about an $11 billion vehicle. I mean these, on a standalone basis, could be some of the largest REITs out there. So, they have ongoing needs. They're very successful vehicles. And we like the fact that we have the ability to use cash and currency to address a range of opportunities. Michael Bilerman : Just last one just in terms of Asia and the macro environment. At least coming out of Citi's earnings yesterday, there was a slowdown in loan activity out of our Asia client base, in particular everything that's happening with China and the U.S., the Chinese corporates borrowing less money given the uncertainty going on between the two countries. Is there anything that you're finding at least locally in Asia? And I know what's happening in the U.S. But anything in Asia that you've seen would indicate any slow down on the industrial side? Hamid Moghadam : Okay, this is going to be your last question, because somebody jumped in. But look, China is definitely slower but the overall -- slower than it has been for some time, and we see that on the ground. But the dynamics of the industrial real estate market in China are much more driven by availability of land from the one seller that has land, the government. And they've been always reluctant to supply the market with what it needs in terms of industrial land. And the reason for that is that industrial users don't generate taxes. And there is no property tax system in China. So they get their tax revenue based on registered capital. And people don't usually register their capital where their warehouses are. So there's always a shortage of land in the key markets in China. So even with a more modest economic growth, there's just not enough supply of product in a lot of these markets. So, the strength of the industrial market is driven by domestic consumption and a shortage of industrial land. Consumption for the first time slowed from the mid-teens to the high-single-digit. So, that's really important to keep in mind. And by the way, my commentary about the shortage of land applies to the Tier 1-1.5 type markets in which we operate. Some of the outlying areas you can get more land, but that's not relevant to our business. And remember, the tailwind of e-commerce in all of these different places where the consumption takes more space than normal consumption would have a decade ago. Operator : The last question comes from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks for leaving the follow up. Sorry for the background noise. Just one quick question, sorry if I missed this. Did you change the disclosure of the same store NOI calculation? I believe you used to provide same store revenue and expense separately. Could you give us those two components? Tom Olinger : Yes, we'll be giving those components. If you look at the back of our sub, you can see the detail in order for you to calculate same store own and manage. The SEC did their annual review of our K, we had one comment and that one comment was that they asked us to modify our owned advantage NOI disclosure. That actually approved our disclosure quite a few years back. But in light of their view around pro rata financial information, they asked us to modify the disclosure, because they took a view that this was pro rata and they just asked us to modify it. So, we can't show you the percentage. But if you look at our footnote and back this up, you can calculate the percentage. Hamid Moghadam : Great. Thank you, everybody. Look forward to seeing you next quarter if not sooner. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. At that time, please limit yourself to one question. If you have a follow-up, please get back in the queue. Also note that this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Tracy Ward. Tracy, you may begin. Tracy Ward : Thank you, Michelle. Good morning everyone. Welcome to the Prologis third quarter earnings call. If you have not yet downloaded the press release, it's available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. This morning, you will hear from Tom Olinger, our Chief Financial Officer and also joining us for the call is Hamid Moghadam, Gary Anderson, Chris Caton, Mike Curless, Ed Nekritz, Colleen McKeown and Gene Reilly. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under Federal Securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which the Company operates as well as the beliefs and assumptions of management. Both of these factors are referred to in Prologis' 10-K or SEC filings. Additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include but are not limited to the expected timing and likelihood of the completion of the transaction with IPT, including their ability to obtain the requisite approvals of their stockholders and the risk that the conditions to the closing of the transaction may not be satisfied. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may differ. Finally, this call will contain financial measures such as FFO, EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures and in accordance with Reg-G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures in our earnings package. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. And, Tom will you please begin. Tom Olinger : Thanks, Tracy. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call today. We had another outstanding quarter. Customer sentiment remains positive and we see no meaningful impact on our business from uncertainties surrounding trade. Our proprietary operating metrics reflect healthy demand, showing deal gestation, conversion rates are positive and in line with last quarter as our customers improve their supply chains and response to consumer demand for ever faster delivery times. U.S. market fundamentals are strong. I'd like to share our assessment of third quarter market statistics as we've seen more divergent viewpoints than normal. We see historically low vacancy in the mid 4s, with supply and demand balanced at 75 million square feet each. Rents have outperformed and as a result, we are raising our 2019 U.S. rent growth forecast from 6% to 7%, leading to an 80 basis point increase in our global rent forecast to 6.5%. Activity across Europe remains healthy. In the UK, while overall demand is solid and our build-to-suit pipeline is very active, we are highlighting the Midlands as a supplier risk. We continue to forecast 2019 rent growth on the continent to be the highest in more than a decade. Fundamentals in Japan are improving with vacancy in Tokyo had less than 3% and Osaka at less than 6%, the lowest points in five years. From an operating standpoint, you will see that our quarterly results reflect our strategy of prioritizing rents over occupancy to maximize long-term lease economics. We leased 38 million square feet, including nearly 6 million square feet in our development portfolio. Quarter end occupancy was 96.5%, down 30 basis points sequentially and remains above our five-year average. Rent change on roll for the quarter hit an all-time high of 37%, led by the U.S. at 41.7%. Our share of cash same-store NOI growth was 4.3% for the quarter, which was impacted by a 60-basis point reduction in average occupancy, again consistent with our strategy to push rents. Globally our in-place to market rent spread widened by 40 basis points in the quarter and is now almost 15.5% or over $400 million in nominal terms. Core FFO was $0.97 per share for the third quarter, which included $0.18 of net promote income from our Co-In venture. The promote came in above our forecast as Europe valuations increased more than 2% in the third quarter. For deployment, starts in the quarter were $577 million with an estimated margin of 22% and included about two-thirds build-to-suits. The pace of starts will increase significantly in the fourth quarter. Stabilizations were $658 million with an estimated margin of 37% and value creation of over $242 million. We continue to access capital globally at very attractive terms. During the quarter we issued $2.8 billion of debt primarily in euro at a weighted average fixed interest rate of under 1% and a weighted average term of more than 14 years. It's worth pointing out that we have an annual need for an incremental $600 million of non-dollar debt to naturally hedge our growing international assets. These issuances lowered our total weighted average interest rate by 10 basis points to 2.4% and lengthened our weighted average maturity by about two years to just under eight years. We continue to maintain significant investment capacity on the balance sheet with the $11.7 billion of liquidity and potential fund sell downs. In addition, there is an incremental $5.4 billion of existing third-party investment capacity in our ventures today. Guidance for 2020, which I know many of you are looking for will be provided at our upcoming Investor Forum on November 5th. For 2019 guidance, I'll cover the highlights and then I'll share basis and note this guidance does not include the positive impact of the IPT acquisition. We are increasing the bottom end of our cash same-store NOI guidance by 25 basis points and now expect a range of 4.75% to 5%. We are raising the midpoint for development starts by $250 million and now expect starts to range between $2.2 billion and $2.5 billion. Build-to-suits will comprise more than 40% of total starts which is above our initial expectations. We are projecting $650 million of net deployment uses which we plan to fund with free cash flow and debt. Net promote income for the full year is now expected to be $0.18 per share, an increase of $0.02 from our prior guidance. For the full year, we are increasing our 2019 core FFO guidance midpoint by $0.03 and narrowing the range to between $3.30 and $3.32 per share. And our revised midpoint growth in core FFO per share excluding promotes is 10% higher than last year. Over the past five years, our growth has clearly been exceptional with a CAGR of almost 12%, while de-levering from 27% to 18%. As I mentioned, this guidance excludes the acquisition of IPT, which we expect to close in January of 2020. We plan to split the $4 billion portfolio equally between our two U.S. vehicles. Private capital investor interest continues to be robust as evidenced by the record fundraising in our ventures in the third quarter. Our pro rata investment will be approximately $1.3 billion, which we will fund with cash and debt. We continue to expect the annual core FFO accretion from IPT to range between $0.05 and $0.06 per share or roughly 2% on a stabilized basis. The acquisition of this high quality portfolio will capture significant revenue and cost synergies and deliver shareholder value on day one. To sum up the third quarter was a continuation of what has already been an excellent year. I feel great about our outlook for the rest of the year and beyond. And with that, I'll turn it to Michelle for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Craig Mailman from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Craig Mailman : Hey, guys. Maybe just wanted to hit here on demand and kind of where you guys have the availability in the portfolio. Could you guys just kind of talk through what you're seeing in the demand profiles between kind of larger and smaller tenants, and your ability to push rents there and maybe improve credit quality. And then kind of talk a little bit about what you guys see as your ability to push the occupancy in under 100,000 or under 250,000 square foot space where you have more opportunity? And maybe talk is there any more frictional vacancy in those type of spaces than in your bigger box? Or could we see those kind of spaces kind of narrow to where your average occupancy could be? Hamid Moghadam : Now, that's some question\u2026 Gene Reilly : Did everybody write down? Well, let me take a stab at this, first maybe talking about the smaller spaces. So these are spaces where we can push rents and we're seeing pretty broad-based demand frankly across all sectors. But I think those with the smaller segment is where we can reach rent growth and I think if you look inside rent change numbers which are obviously at all-time highs that would be the highest. In terms of the composition of the demand from an industry perspective, again, that's pretty broad based. Obviously auto is weak, almost no matter where you are in the globe. But otherwise, we're still seeing pretty broad-based growth. We're seeing continued growth from the e-commerce sector and that's probably a combination of reconfiguration of the supply chain as well as net demand. So that's a start on it. Tom Olinger : Craig, this is Tom. So two of your questions, one on credit quality, our credit quality continues to be exceptional. Our bad debt experience has been below 20% or 20 basis points of rent -- below 20 basis points of rent for the last six years continues this quarter. So I feel great about our credit quality and then just regarding your question on small spaces and frictional vacancy. We do have many more units in our smaller spaces. So naturally there is going to be more churn in that particularly as Gene pointed out, we are pushing rents. So you could see a higher -- a little higher frictional vacancy, but the pay-off is much higher rents. So the economics are clear to keep pushing rents. Operator : Your next question will come from Jeremy Metz from BMO. Your line is open. Jeremy Metz : Hey, good morning. Hamid, FedEx on its earnings call last month, they added they were citing more challenges ahead in 2020. They talked about the typical the global trade disputes and concerns over economic slowing having created significant uncertainties. In your opening remarks, Tom did mention that you hadn't started that that you hadn't started to see that in your customer behavior yet, but clearly those risks are out there. So just wondering, has that surprised you at all that you really haven't seen it in the customer behavior yet? And then maybe just any broader thoughts on how this all impacts your outlook for development starts beyond call it $2.3 billion you have under way in terms of cadence or desire to take on spec et cetera? Thanks. Hamid Moghadam : Sure. I think both statements can be true at the same time. FedEx cares more about flows and obviously those become very volatile when its trade wars one day and no trade wars the next day. And they have a very fixed cost basis infrastructure planes and trucks and all that. So erratic volume cannot be good for them because they either miss the peaks or can handle -- either, they can't handle the peaks or have too much capacity for the troughs. We are in the stock business. So actually uncertainty in the short-term is extra demand for our space, because when you don't know when that mix good is going to get to you, because the tariffs are at what cost, you're going to carry more inventory and more stock closer to the customers. So I think FedEx is right as far as the metrics for their business are concerned, and I think the metrics for our business are just different. Operator : Your next question will come from Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Derek Johnston : Can you discuss the leasing process for the multistory facility in Seattle where Amazon and Target ultimately signed, and how competitive was this bidding process? How many interested parties did you have? And where did rents shake out versus underwriting? And what type of future demand do you anticipate? Thank you. Hamid Moghadam : I would say the rents and the economics turned out better than our expectations. It took a little bit longer to lease up, but it leased up at higher rents and the reason it took a bit longer to lease up is that nobody ever seen a multistory building before, so they wanted to look at it, lay out a lot of different configurations and make sure they could get the efficiencies out of it. So we couldn't be more pleased with the quality of the tenants or the financial performance of the asset. With respect to its implications, look I -- for some reason this building has gotten a lot of attention and people think that there is a multistory strategy. There is no multistory strategy. The strategy is to provide space at places where our customers want to, which is increasingly close to their ultimate customers. The solution in some places, it's multistory and in other places is single story. So we're not in the business of building so many multistory buildings, we are in the business of growing our infill position. Operator : Your next question will come from Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks for taking the question. So Blackstone just sold part of their original GLP acquisition. Wondering if you looked at that portfolio and if you can just more broadly, give us any sense of any portfolios across regions and sort of how pricing or cap rates are shaking out? Hamid Moghadam : Vikram, you can assume that we look at everything. People know our phone number and they know we are -- what business we're in. So we absolutely, positively have never thought of a material transaction that we haven't seen. So you can assume we look at everything. I think the implications are you're going to have to ask Blackstone, but obviously they bought that portfolio and presumably, they paid the pretty good price to get it and presumably, they sold it to these guys two months that presumably paid a really good price to get it. That was attractive enough for Blackstone to sell it. So I can't be any more specific than that, because I'm not in Blackstone's decision making rooms, but those would be -- those assumptions would be probably pretty fair. Operator : Your next question comes from Jamie Feldman, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Jamie Feldman : Thank you. I want to get your -- more of your thoughts on just the supply outlook. I mean we do have historically high supply coming online. But you just said your development starts were 63% pre-leased in the quarter, and you want to start more. You expect to pick up in the fourth quarter. So can you kind of paint the big picture of how we should be thinking about the supply risk heading into '20? And as you think about your development opportunities, the pre-leased percentage and what gives you comfort at these -- this level of volume? Hamid Moghadam : Hey, Jamie, Hamid here, I think there is a lot of confusion about supply numbers. People mix supply which is annual concept with what's under construction, which is a snapshot that they've given point in time. So let me have Chris take you through those numbers because they are materially different as construction duration has lengthened. Chris Caton : Yes, absolutely. Jamie, let's talk about three concepts. First, completion. Completion is actually are on pace to be down this year by about 8%. When we look at a more real-time indicator like starts, starts are flat this year. Now as Hamid mentioned, duration to build projects has gone up and so we've seen under construction rise, that time to deliver product has gone up by about a third in this cycle for all the challenges around supply that we've previously discussed. And so deliveries out of that pipeline now are much less than kind of 100% in a given following four quarters. So you got to look at the time to deliver product to understand what deliveries will be in the following four quarters. Hamid Moghadam : So basically if you had the same level of supply, the same level of property under construction, you would have two-thirds the annual supply if the trends of the recent past continue. So those two concepts need to be really kept apart. Operator : Your next question comes from Blaine Heck from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Blaine Heck : Thanks. Hamid in the press release you pointed out the exceptional interest that you're seeing for your strategic capital ventures and you guys have obviously done a great job raising money on that side of the business. Can you just talk about whether there are any specific groups that you're seeing incremental interest from? And then on the flip side, what do you think could cause that investor interest to decrease I guess is there anything that kind of sticks out to you as a threat to that capital source in particular? Hamid Moghadam : Yes. The sources are pretty much from everywhere. I would say the U.S. pension funds are probably a flat to down compared to their call it 10-year type numbers, but Japan is up significantly. Generally Asia is up significantly as these large institutions, sort of the pension system gets active on alternative investments. So it's everywhere. On the margin, I would say U.S. is a little less and Asia a little bit more. With respect to the threats to that, it's the same old threat that we've seen in every cycle. It's the denominator effect. If these guys are generally at today's investment levels under allocated to real estate and alternatives generally, and really under allocated to industrial because it's a tough property type to access. But if the stock market goes down and the bond market goes down and the rest of the portfolio goes down, the same percentage allocation to real estate will have to go down and that's usually been the cause of reductions in the capital flows. Operator : Your next question is from Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust. Your line is open. Ki Bin Kim : Just two questions, Hamid. What's your view on the potential impact from growth for e-commerce on the warehouse business and how PLD would potentially a play a part? And second, just on lease spreads, obviously it's some really good numbers and interesting about the mix of what roll this quarter that might be different going forward? Hamid Moghadam : Yes. I'll let Tom answer the second part. I think there are three things that drive the share of the economics to drive the share of the e-commerce in our portfolio and for the space devoted to it. Number one is, penetration increasing, penetration of e-commerce as a percentage of total sales, retail sales. That number is going up every year. And I think it will go up for the foreseeable future as more categories become e-commerce friendly. And as you know the millennials, I guess they are non-millennials, the generation, the years, could grow up with an iPhone start entering their prime shopping years. So the iPhone, I think is 11 years old and 12 year olds who are now graduating from college or 11 year olds who are graduating from college basically have never known the world without an iPhone in e-commerce. So I think as those guys enter the population to spending part of the population, I think the percentage will go up. And then there is the old 3X factor of space that e-commerce takes which are well on top of the gaining share of e-commerce and underlying retail growth which is probably the slowest of the three factors, maybe 2% type of thing. All those three factors combined should make for a really good environment for e-commerce demand over time. Now I don't -- the real strategic question is, how does automation affect the 3X factor? It -- does it reduce it, does it expand it? The answer on that is unclear at the moment and in certain instances, the increase, the need for real estate and in certain cases it reduces the need for real estate, but one area that for sure over time, we'll get more efficient is the returns business. And returns are really caused by free shipping and free returns and all that sort of thing. And over time I think fit and issues like that will get better, so I would guess that part of the demand in warehouse space will go down. Anyway the biggest, biggest strategic driver of all this, long-term secular driver of all this, is the need for speed and choice. Because the more choices you want and the quicker you want them the more inventory, you need to position near the customers. So, that's all really good for our business. Tom Olinger : Ki Bin, this is Tom. On your question about rent change for the quarter. We did see higher mix this quarter in the West and East region, so the coastal markets the U.S., that being said almost every region had its all-time high or near its all-time high in rent change. So we're seeing very positive rent change across the board, almost without exception. You ask about a trend, our four quarter trailing average rent change is right at 28%. This quarter, I think that's a pretty good outlook in the near term for where rent change should be. But remember, when we talk about in-place to market at being 15.5% below market, that means rents need to grow 18.3% to get to market. Right. So if you're 15% -- 15.5% under rented, you need to grow by 18.3% that's just math to get to market rents. So think about are in-place, built-in rent change of being 18.3% and think about what's rolling, near term is obviously signed further ago, so naturally our rent change would be higher in the near term. And then the last thing I'd point out is rent change. The rent change on roll of that four quarter average, we're now at 28%, that's up 600 basis points in the last year. So we've seen that number move up meaningfully and I think we can hang around there based on our in-place to market. Operator : Your next question comes from Eric Frankel from Green Street Advisors. Your line is open. Eric Frankel : Thank you. Just two quick questions. One is related to portfolio sales is based on the Black -- information Blackstone activity, do you see any meaningful differences between portfolio sale prices versus smaller transactions you guys might pursue. And then second, just on the demand front, you know, obviously there's a lot of press kind of given to smaller buildings in multi-tenant leasing, my conclusion is that that kind of leasing and the rent -- the rent growth you can get is really more dependent on location than property size, can you affirm whether that's true or not, or is a smaller building in some Midwest market getting record rent growth as well. Thank you. Hamid Moghadam : Eric, let me jump in the middle of that before Gene starts on the first part. The most important thing with respect to rent growth is location in terms of macro market and the micro sub-market. By far, more important than tenant size and all the stuff we talked about before, so you're spot on that one. And those were the scarcest properties. Gene, do you want to answer it. Gene Reilly : Yes, Eric. With respect to the portfolios, I mean as, Hamid mentioned, of course, we look at all these things we price them and for sure lately portfolios are selling at a -- what we consider a premium to the sum of the parts. So I think that that is true. Having said that, there is also plenty of one-off transactions and very, very good market pretty stunning metrics associated with it. Operator : Your next question comes from Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Caitlin Burrows : I was just wondering maybe on the development side, the total development portfolio declined slightly since last quarter, but the 2019 starts were actually up. So is -- this just a function of pulling forward previously expected activity and what's your confidence in being able to sustain that level of starts going forward as Prologis grows? And then just on the yield side. Those have come in a little I think from about 6.5% to 6.1%. So what's driving this and could that increase back up? Tom Olinger : Yes. The second point, that's really basically mix. But having said that, you have generally seen cap rates declining frankly over the last -- well for 20 years, but over the last couple of years, cap rates have been declining and you will see some change in the returns on costs as well. In terms of the development volumes, what we are implying is a big fourth quarter about $1.2 billion, but I think that's about right on top of what we did in the fourth quarter of last year. We're highly confident that and in terms of the future beyond that we'll talk about that when we give guidance in the future. Hamid Moghadam : Yes and this reminds me of a previous question that something I answered which is what's our attitude toward spec development, and I would say the bar on spec development has been high and continues to be pretty high, and you can see the results of that in the build-to-suit percentage being a lot higher. Operator : Your next question comes from Manny Korchman from Citi. Your line is open. Manny Korchman : Tom, just thinking about your year-end occupancy guidance, your retention in the quarter was actually higher than the trailing Q and yet you commented in the press release that you're focusing on rent growth versus occupancy. So does that mean that new leases aren't happening as fast as you thought? And is that because the rent levels or is there something else that does not connecting between retention rates and occupancy? Hamid Moghadam : So, this is not Tom, but I'll answer your question. The retention ratio you're dealing with tenants that are already in this space. And today, labor, is a huge issue for people. And every time they move, they have to go higher bunch of people, because now the workers have choice and they're not going to change their commuting patterns, etc, etc. So customers that are in existing space have a much higher propensity to stay regardless of almost rent, which is an afterthought for a lot of them. So where you see the effect, the primary effect of pushing rents is on capture of new leasing in the developments, that's where you're likely to see at the most. And that of course doesn't affect the retention numbers that we report. Operator : Your next question will come from Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Your line is open. Nick Yulico : Thanks. I just had a question on the leasing spreads. I know you -- Tom you gave some infill on what drove it higher this quarter. I just want to make sure as well though that the switch to the clear leases in the past year, has that had any impact on the way you guys measure the releasing spread? Tom Olinger : No impact at all. Operator : Your next question will come from Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Michael Carroll : Yes. I just wanted to follow up on the, I guess PLD stands on pushing rents over occupancy. Haven't -- hasn't that's been your stands over the past two years or are you just being more aggressive today and is that a good fair way to say is what's being reflected in lease spreads and how they're pretty much doubled than what they were for the trailing four quarters? Hamid Moghadam : It's been our stated objective to do this for previous quarters, but they are these messy things called human beings and people feel that there have been need to change their mindset, and that took a couple of years to really get that going. We track why we lose tenants, when we don't renew somebody and we track them for a long, long time. And I'm not kidding you. But there were years that we had literally zero tenants leaving because of rent on renewals, literally. So that number is no longer zero, but it's a lot lower than I think it should be or I would have expected it to be. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore. Your line is open. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Hamid, I just wanted to clarify, when you talked about the -- you and Chris talked about sort of the construction pipeline or time to build getting longer, is that 9 months to 12 months or is that more of a 12 month to now 16 months. Just trying to understand that. And then are there any markets in the U.S., you didn't really call anything out, but just trying to get a sense of the markets in the U.S. that you're a bit more worried about or really just seeing much less rent growth today? Hamid Moghadam : Yes. By the way the on the duration of construction it depends on where. In Japan, they will be, they were 16 months. And I don't know what they are today, but it takes longer to build the multi-story building. But let's focus just on a single story U.S. style warehouse and Chris as the numbers for you. Chris Caton : Yes. Hey, Steve its going from eight to nine months to something more than a year, call it, call it 13-14 months. What I think we will see is that deliveries over the next four quarters, can be roughly 75% of the under construction pipeline, that's how we see the numbers coming together. As it relates to market, we talked about how we -- on the last call how we haven't added any markets to our supply risk list, that's remains the case today and in fact markets like Chicago comes off that list this quarter. So... Steve Sakwa : I know. Osaka came off a little bit earlier. So... Chris Caton : Yes. Osaka is a market that came off. And then on that list included Atlanta, Pennsylvania, Houston, Spain and the Midlands was covered in Tom's script. Hamid Moghadam : I would say the one that I would point out as being more at risk today than last quarter, even though it was on the list is Houston. There is a lot of space under construction in Houston. And I think some people are going to get surprised. Now and some of it is not in the best sub-markets. So some of the outlying sub-markets in Houston you need to watch. Fortunately, we are not exposed to the sub-markets. Operator : Your next question will come from John Guinee from Stifel. Your line is open. John Guinee : Great. I think Mike Curless is in the room. I was just looking at Page 24, and I noticed an uptick in a pretty sizable land acquisition year-to-date and also acquisitions and other investments in real estate. Can you walk through -- Mike, where you're buying the dirt? And also what the other investments in real estate might be? Hamid Moghadam : Probably, Gene should answer that question since Mike has a new job, but Gene, go ahead. Gene Reilly : Yes, and Mike can maybe offer customer color where they want the dirt. But John, where we generally need to replace dirt is in the coastal markets where we've got a lot of development absorbed a lot of land bank. So there is a piece in LA included in that, but as we look out going forward, replacing land is very, very expensive these days. As you know, we've done a lot of work to work this land back down to what we considered a manageable level. As we replace land going forward, we're trying to do it creatively, we're trying to tie up land through options, but it's going to be more expensive. And we will see the land bank pick up a little bit, but we're going to remain very disciplined on that front as we have been. Hamid Moghadam : Our biggest needs for land, I would say are Southern California -- we're good in Seattle, good in the Bay Area. Southern California, we need more land. Chicago, we need more land, and I would say in New Jersey we need more land for sure. Those are the top three that I would call out. Gene Reilly : And with respect to the customers and where they want to be two, three years ago, 80% of our land that we're doing build-to-suits and we're in -- were global markets, those numbers are closer to 95% these days. Tom Olinger : And John, your question about the other investments, just think about those being covered land place, not land but will become land soon. Hamid Moghadam : Yes. Those are actually yielding, probably pretty close to the local market cap rate maybe a tad below maybe 20-25 basis points below, but they're basically current land place. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Mueller from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Michael Mueller : Yes. Hi. I was wondering, do you expect the elevated mix of build-to-suits to be a little bit more of the norm over the next year or so? Mike Curless : This is Mike Curless. We did have a robust quarter at almost two-thirds build-to-suits. If you look across the year that's blending in the high '30s and I would expect in our numbers to be in the low '40s as we look forward. I think this was an unusually high quarter but directionally indicative of how important the build-to-suit part of the business is to us these days. Hamid Moghadam : You know, I'll compare to five or 10 years ago or 15 years ago, I mean, that number would have been 20%-25%. So I think the tightness of the markets is forcing the build-to-suit percentage up. Operator : And your next question will come from Craig Mailman from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Craig Mailman : Hey guys. Just wanted to kind of hit on some of your liquidity here in the funds and on balance sheet, your cost of capital is clearly advantageous. But you have a lot of kind of well-heeled competitors as well. I'm just kind of curious you guys look at the acquisition landscape, you've been successful in some, missed some others, but just kind of how you look at return requirements for on-balance sheet acquisitions here versus the in-funds. And just talk a little about what you're seeing on the quality spectrum of portfolios that you have traded or may be out there and kind of interest level? Hamid Moghadam : Let me start that and Gene jump in if you'd like. I think the quality, the pricing for quality differences is getting compressed, in other words, cap rates for a lower quality, lower growth assets are compressing high quality assets and location. And that always happens in this part of the cycle. People are really anxious to get into this asset class. And if it's industrial, it's industrial and they become less discriminating over time. Also if you're a leveraged buyer to the end you're really looking at locking in the cost of capital, debt capital today and you employ a lot of it. Obviously this is a really good environment for you're buying things and financing them. With respect to the way we look at our unleveraged [WACC] our cost of capital, I would say, we look at that every quarter or so, and we occasionally and only in a very limited way have dropped our requirements. I would say for a U.S. high-quality portfolio probably a 6 IRR would be the right number today, very high quality portfolio for us. And, you know, take it up from there but unfortunately some stuff in the marketplace even for low quality assets is getting priced to tighter than that. Now a 6 IRR in a 1.6% or 1.7% 10-year environment is pretty attractive. I mean those are some of the wider spreads, I've seen in my career. And so, yes, then our absolute numbers sound low but would in relation to cost of capital or debt capital they are actually pretty attractive. Operator : Your next question comes from Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks. Just wanted to follow up on two things. One for Chris, you mentioned sort of some of the rent growth and obviously it's different by sub-markets. I'm wondering if you're starting to see any divergence from recent trends within sub-markets within MSAs meaning more divergence and what you've seen recently. And then just one for Tom on the clear leases, wondering how that's -- if any impact on the expense side and if it may be positively or negatively impacting NOI growth? Mike Curless : Yes. Hey, as it relates to rent growth. A couple of ways to look at that, one is we continue to see that divergence between in-fill and non-infill as Hamid was discussing earlier in terms of sub-market strategy. As it relates to markets, we've seen better outperformance in the East in New York and in Toronto for example, and we continue to see really good growth in Europe, much like we telegraphed last year and the year before. And what you see there is some of the early recovery markets continuing to outperform whether that's Germany or the Netherlands or Czech Republic, and some late recovery markets really starting to pop rents comes to mind. So that's how the rents are trending. Tom Olinger : Great. Vikram on your question around the clear lease and expenses, those leases are set up where we fix all the cost for real estate taxes, the tenant bears that. And we are collecting slightly more on the expense reimbursements right now. But essentially, call it even. So we set it up that way to be expense neutral. So no impact on NOI, and to go back to next question, just on the clear lease and did that have any impact on how we're calculating rent change? It does not. That clearly, just think about it simply having a rent component and an expense reimbursement component and the rent change is calculated on the revenue, the rent component, not the expense component. So no impact. Hamid Moghadam : Yes. I just want to clarify something Tom said. We actually don't collect reimbursements, That's why it's a clear lease. But we do track what it would have been under a triple net lease. And actually for the last 1.5 year or two years that we've been implementing this, the numbers have been remarkably on top of one another and that's the advantage of having an 800-million square foot portfolio to spread this stuff around. Operator : And your next question will come from Manny Korchman from Citi. Your line is open. Manny Korchman : Yes. So Hamid, I had a follow-up from my -- on my previous question that I have a new one for you guys. But so you mentioned leasing as developments, I guess that wouldn't impact your occupancy guidance. But just going back to that in isolation of retention is where you expect, it's at 81%, and you've lowered your occupancy guidance. That means that your pace of lease-up in already vacated space or space to be vacated is going to be slower. Is that the wrong read through? Hamid Moghadam : We are pushing -- remember the part that I said that we -- in the year as we had zero people that we were losing as part of the renewal discussion that number is not zero, but it's not as high as I would like it to be. You're also talking about occupancy declines from 98%, and I've been doing this for 37 years, there was only one year where we were in the 98% range. And I said guys don't get used to this. We're going to push this number down. So I think we were very clear on what our strategy was. And I would say it was executed as exactly the way we described it. Operator : Your next question comes from Jamie Feldman from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Jamie Feldman : Thanks. I was just hoping you could explain more why developments are taking so much longer to deliver. And then also just thinking about the TI number in the quarter and what we've seen this year, I mean are you spending more on leases -- on TIs on leases, and if so, can you explain what those -- why that's happening or what that's going to and is that impacting your ability to push rents as well? Gene Reilly : Jamie, I'll take the first one. It's Gene. It's basically a combination of construction time frame and there is some entitlement timeframe in that as well, and which by the way can affect the projects through its construction. And as you pull secondary permits as you go forward. So it's really those two items. And of course depending on where you are geographically, there is pretty wide range of outcomes. Hamid Moghadam : We've also had kind of weird weather patterns that I think most of you have noticed that definitely methods quick construction schedules. Tom Olinger : Jamie, on your second question on the turnover costs. I -- it's a little higher this quarter. I think it's due to two things, its mix and timing. But I go back and look at what our -- what we've been on a trailing four quarters, I think that's a better representation. We have been coming down pretty clearly over the last, on a trailing four-quarter basis over the last, really three years and that makes sense. Just given concessions are falling across the board. The other thing I'd point to is look at free rent as a percent of lease value that is consistently declining again. So I think overall this quarter's mix and a little bit of timing, it's not impacting our -- we're not trying to buy rent change if that's the question. Operator : And your next question comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore. Your line is open. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Hamid, I was just wondering if you could provide an update on sort of the big data initiatives and the procurement and sort of where you stand? And is that something we're likely to get a lot more detail on for 2020? Hamid Moghadam : On the big data we are, as I mentioned to tackling one very specific project which is yield management. And I would say that's going really well. We're piloting in four markets, and we'll be expanding that to the portfolio, and we are encouraged by the early results. I don't know, Chris may have more to say about that. Gary, you want to talk about the other initiatives. Gary Anderson : Yes. On the procurement initiatives, we stood at procurement organizations, we talked about in the past and things are going well there I'd say both in terms of procuring construction related items and CapEx and G&A. So that is often running. And with respect to the revenue side of the equation, I'd say that we're off to a good start. We're starting to build that business. We're probably getting into the tens of millions of dollars in terms of revenue. So it is becoming more meaningful and we're seeing roughly double-digit growth. Mike Curless : Yes. I would say that that business today if you isolate it would be pennies a share of incremental earnings. I think in two to three years, it will be dimes, and we're hoping that it's potential is more than $1. So, but that is going to take us a while to get to. So don't put in the dollar, don't put in the [indiscernible]. Put in a couple of pennies that we're talking about right now, we're doing better than that actually. But it's a slow ramp, nobody has done this before. So, we need to educate ourselves and our customers and a lot of other people to get this done. Hamid Moghadam : I think Steve you were the last person. So thank you all for your interest in the Company and I want to put in a big plug for our Analyst Day, which is coming up and that's why we saved all the good guidance for that date and encourage you to come. Take care. Operator : Thank you everyone. This will conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Also note that this conference is being recorded.  I'd now like to turn the call over to Tracy Ward. Tracy, you may begin. Tracy Ward : Thanks, Julianne, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2019 conference call. The supplemental document is available on our IR website on prologis.com. I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance, and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings.  Additionally, our fourth quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures. And in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. On October 27, we announced the merger between Prologis and Liberty Property Trust. Materials regarding the transaction are posted on the company's website and are available on the SEC's website. This includes the joint proxy statement containing detailed information about the transaction.  This call will focus on our fourth quarter and full year results as well as our 2020 outlook. The company will not provide comments related to this transaction beyond what is included in our prepared remarks. This morning, we'll hear from Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover guidance, results and the company's outlook. And also with us today for today's call are Hamid Moghadam, Gary Anderson, Chris Caton, Mike Curless, Colleen McKeown, Ed Nekritz and Gene Reilly.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom and we'll get started. Thomas Olinger : Thank you, Tracy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. The fourth quarter closed out another excellent year. Core FFO was $0.84 per share for the quarter, $3.31 per share for the year. The full year includes a record for net promotes of $0.18 per share. Core FFO, excluding promotes, grew 10% for the year and was more than 2% above our initial guidance. As we enter 2020, market conditions are very good and we've seen no meaningful impact on our business from trade or retailer bankruptcies. Supply chains are increasingly mission critical to our customers' businesses, which is generating demand as they undergo structural changes to deliver high service levels.  We see increased requirements across markets and product categories as more customers seek to strengthen their fulfillment capabilities. Our proprietary customer metrics reflect healthy activity, showing deal gestation and conversion rates are consistent with the third quarter. U.S. market fundamentals remain excellent. I'd like to share Prologis' assessment of supply and demand as data providers use a variety of methodologies, resulting in a range of estimates. Completions in 2019 were 275 million square feet, flat compared with 2018. Higher replacement costs, land scarcity, the elongated permitting remain governors to supply.  Net absorption was 240 million square feet, but limited by historic low market vacancy, which ended the year at 4.6%, up 10 basis points from last quarter and 20 basis points from last year. Market rents in our U.S. portfolio increased by 8% in 2019. We have no new additions to our watch list this quarter, but here is some color on two markets that remain on the list. In Houston, while demand is strong, vacancy is 6.7% and expected to remain elevated, which will constrain near-term rent growth. We have a low role in the IPT and LPT Houston portfolios in 2020.  Our near-term outlook for Pennsylvania is more positive, specifically core Lehigh Valley, where demand has accelerated, the supply pipeline has decreased and vacancy declined 140 basis points to 3.2% at year-end. In Europe, activity remains healthy. Rent growth on the continent in 2019 was more than 6%, the highest on record. Fundamentals in Japan continue to improve, with vacancy in Tokyo and Osaka at their lowest point in 5 years and rent growth is accelerating.  Turning to operations for the quarter. We leased nearly 38 million square feet with an average term of 73 months. Quarter-end occupancy was flat sequentially at 96.5%, while the U.S. ticked down 30 basis points as our team is focused on pushing rate and term. Rent change on rollover was just under 30% and led by the U.S. at 34%.  Our share of cash same-store NOI growth was 4.6% and was impacted by a 60 basis point reduction in average occupancy, again, consistent with our strategy to maximize long-term lease economics. Globally, our in-place to market rent spread increased once again and is now over 15.5% or more than $450 million in annual NOI.  Moving to Strategic Capital. 2019 was a record-breaking year. We raised $6.5 billion of equity from 75 new and existing investors and grew our third-party AUM to $38 billion. Our Strategic Capital business delivers a durable revenue stream with 90% of fees coming from long-term or perpetual vehicles, a critical differentiator that is often overlooked and undervalued. For deployment, we had a record year for development starts and stabilizations. We started $2.9 billion in new projects, 43% of which were build-to-suit. Stabilizations were $2.5 billion with an estimated margin of 37% and value creation of $911 million. Additionally, we realized $468 million in development gains in 2019.  We continue to have significant investment capacity to self-fund our run rate deployment for the foreseeable future, with over $11 billion of liquidity and potential fund sell-downs as well as an incremental $4.5 billion of third-party investment capacity in our ventures today. For 2020, given we just held our Investor Forum in November, our guidance remains consistent and includes the acquisitions of IPT, which closed on January 8; and Liberty, which we expect to close on February 4. Here the highlights on an our share basis, but for complete detail, refer to Page 5 of our supplemental. Our cash same-store NOI growth range is unchanged at 4.25% to 5.25%. And I'd like to highlight 2 points. First, we're increasing our 2020 global market rent forecast by 120 basis points to 4.8%. This increase will have a minimal impact on same-store this year, given our lease expirations, but importantly, will increase our mark-to-market and future NOI growth. And second, the first quarter of 2020 will be up against a tough comp from Q1 of 2019, which benefited from an 80 basis point occupancy uplift. As a result, we expect same-store NOI growth to be lower in the first quarter, but then accelerate in the back half of the year.  For Strategic Capital, I expect revenue, excluding promotes, of $350 million to $360 million and net promote income of $115 million. The IPT integration is largely complete and the Liberty closing preparations are on track. We are confident about hitting our Liberty synergy targets on day 1. For dispositions, we now expect a range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion, which includes approximately $1 billion of sales from the IPT and Liberty portfolios. When we announced the IPT and Liberty acquisitions, we identified approximately $3.8 billion of combined nonstrategic sale on an our share basis. Of this balance, $350 million has already closed or is under contract. And with the sale of an additional $1 billion in 2020, we will have approximately $2.4 billion of nonstrategic assets remaining at the end of the year, representing just 2% of our asset base. These are good assets. We will work through these portfolios in due time, and we don't see a need to hurry. Given our low leverage at 18%, we will dispose of the nonstrategic assets at a pace that allows us to match sales proceeds with deployment opportunities.  For SG&A, we're forecasting a range between $275 million and $285 million, which includes $6 million to $8 million of onetime transition and wind-down cost related to Liberty. Excluding these costs, annual G&A growth at the midpoint is 2.4%, while managing 15% more real estate. We expect 2020 core FFO to range between $3.67 and $3.75 per share, including $0.15 of net promote income. Year-over-year growth, excluding promotes, is approximately 14% at the midpoint. To wrap up, we expect 2020 to be another exceptional year of growth. We look forward to adding Liberty's high-quality assets to our portfolio and welcoming 35 of their employees to the Prologis team.  With that, I'll turn it back to Julianne for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Jeremy Metz, BMO. Robert Metz : Just in terms of the rent side of the house, you obviously continue to see very healthy spreads I think you had previously indicated some of the second half uplift was going to come from the higher percentage of coastal leases rolling here in the U.S. And so as you look at the U.S. here in 2020, is there anything notable in terms of geographic breakdown or just box size breakdown that's creating maybe an outsized opportunity from a rent side and from the increase to the global mark-to-market, the 120 basis points that you mentioned, Tom, how much of that is U.S. versus EU driven? Thomas Olinger : I'll take the second part of that, Jeremy. The increase -- the majority of the increase of the 120 basis points related to the U.S., Europe -- Continental Europe was about flat. And from a mix standpoint, nothing really stands out. I mean, things can move a little quarter-to-quarter. But given the size of our portfolio, we are very well distributed across space sizes and geographies. Christopher Caton : Yes, in terms of markets, I mean, you guys can see this reflected in brokerage stats. The vacancy rates will give you a pretty good idea where things are healthy and things aren't. I would say we saw a bit of a slowdown in big box activity during the year in '19, but that actually picked up in that segment later in the year. So if there's anything really new it's that the demand is strengthening a little bit in big box. Operator : Your next question comes from Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank. Derek Johnston : Just a follow-on. Do you feel this big box demand could be due to any delta that we've seen with the Phase 1 trade deal completed or Brexit visibility? And how is 2020 leasing velocity feeling to you guys and shaping up from your vantage due to these 2 events? Christopher Caton : Yes. I don't think that the pickup in big box has anything to do with the 2 geopolitical items you mentioned. And the year is starting off pretty good. We're early in the year, but I'd say we feel a little better than we did a quarter ago. So things that are starting off well. Operator : Your next question comes from Craig Mailman from KeyBanc. Craig Mailman : Just quickly on the clarification. Tom, it sounds like nothing in the underlying assumptions changed here broadly in guidance. But does the improved market rent growth assumption change at all the accretion estimates for IPT or LPT? And then just separately, I know you guys have been aggressively trying to kind of push rents over occupancy. But as you think about kind of revenue management here, is there a lower bound to how far you'd want occupancy to fall here, just given kind of the timing it takes to recoup the lost revenues from downtime? Thomas Olinger : Craig, I'll take the first part of that. On the accretion from higher rent growth, given the relatively low remaining role for IPT and the LPT portfolios post-acquisition, similar to the [indiscernible] portfolio, you won't see much -- it's pretty minimal impact for 2020. But again, as you point out, the important thing is that it's going to build our in-place to market and drive our same-store growth even more in the out years. And then I'll let Gene respond to revenue management. Eugene Reilly : Yes. I'd hesitate to put a lower bound on that, but I would say that in general, this is a good opportunity for us to introduce. We've been 97% range. And as you can see, particularly in the U.S., where we have the strongest market opportunities, we're ticking down and we're very comfortable with that in the sort of mid-96% range. Historically, 95% has sort of been a rule of thumb in this business. I think that may be changing. So rather than get specific, I would just say there's some room to go. We're comfortable pushing harder. Thomas Olinger : The markets that have higher demand as a percentage of base can tolerate a lower occupancy, because it represents fewer periods of lease up in markets that have lower percentage of growth compared to base need to be more full to have the same equivalent pricing power. Operator : Your next question comes from Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Nicholas Yulico : I just wanted to hear a little bit more about kind of what drove the increase in development guidance? And I know you gave the mix on some of the spec versus build-to-suit. But how are you thinking about increasing development right now? And particularly, which markets do you think it's really attractive? Eugene Reilly : Yes. So let me start with that. So if you look at the health in the markets, as defined by vacancy rates, as I said earlier, that's a good start. We want to focus on markets that are constrained more in the U.S., that's New Jersey, that's Southern California, that's the Bay Area. But it also includes some submarkets, places like Dallas or Chicago. In Continental Europe, there are several places we'd like to be doing more development. But there, you're seeing constraints on supply more significant than really anywhere else in the world. Thomas Olinger : The reason the number for starts went up is that we have more visibility into this year as we get closer to this year. We were a couple of months earlier. So some of the things that we weren't sure were going to happen happened in a positive way. So the numbers are up. But just like -- for many years, I've commented on acquisition volume being highly predictable. The spec portion of the development volume is -- also has some volatility associated with it. We are not compelled to start spec development, and those are really dependent on minute-by-minute market conditions and the supply-demand dynamics in those markets. The build-to-suits, we'll build, because we're pretty sure of the demand obviously there. But 60% of the spark -- starts is spec. And if the market is better, then we'll do more. And if the market is not as good, we'll do less. Operator : Your next question comes from Jamie Feldman from Bank of America Securities. James Feldman : I was hoping you could take kind of a big picture view or provide a big picture view. Maybe reading from the holiday season and just kind of the conversations you're having with tenants, where does it seem like people still need to get their supply chains right, where does it seem like there's still things that aren't going so well. Just as we've been at this for several years now, just how should people think about the runway ahead? Eugene Reilly : Well, retail sales and the online category grew at 18%. And in the bricks-and-mortar category, it's shrunk in real terms. So that tells you where kind of demand is on the margin, and that demand has gone up. I mean, Amazon is a big chunk of it, and they are probably more active every year. Certainly, going forward, we see them being more active than before. But they're 40-some percent of the market. The other people are catching up, and we are seeing a broadening of demand for e-commerce facilities as we move further into this category. So e-commerce is very strong. And I would say on the margin, the autos are probably a little weaker than they've been historically, and that's sort of a global thing. And probably housing is likely to be stronger than -- on the margin than we saw last year. Operator : Your next question comes from Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust. Ki Bin Kim : So 2019 was the first year where national supply of 1.6% growth outstripped demand of about 1.1%. And there's probably a good degree of nuance in those statistics. For example, in LA, it probably doesn't contribute much to the national demand growth numbers, because you can't absorb what's not available. So when you kind of dig into the numbers, what do you think PLD's exposure is to unfavorable markets where real supply is kind of eating away at the demand? Thomas Olinger : Well, I mean, if you take our U.S. markets that are in the soft side, I would say, Atlanta, Houston and Pennsylvania would be the 3 markets. Dallas has come off the list. Dallas has just had an incredible run in terms of demand, much better than we expected. And those markets -- those 3 markets represent -- the leasing that remains to be done in those markets this year is about 14% of our total leasing. And once you add IPT and LPT, interestingly, that number goes down to 12% of the remaining leasing that we have to do this year. And the global portfolio also is 12%. So there is no overconcentration, if you will, in the weaker markets. They're exactly in line with our overall markets and they're actually -- -- the percentage is coming down as a result of these two acquisitions. What did I -- I meant Central Valley -- Central PA, if I said something different. These guys are giving me handslick room, so. Anyway, so the weaker markets are proportional to all our other leasing, and we're basically not concerned about it. Operator : Your next question comes from Blaine Heck from Wells Fargo. Blaine Heck : Maybe I can go at the development starts guidance question from a different angle. 2019 starts came in at $2.9 billion at your share, which was over $1 billion more than you had guided to at the beginning of 2019. Yet for 2020 and despite the IPT and LPT acquisitions, you're looking at start guidance that's $2.2 billion at your share. So I guess, I'm just wondering how much conservatism is built into that start number? And what are the chances we could end up closer to $3 billion again this year? Thomas Olinger : That would be a good question for you to ask us next year, just like you pointed out this year. I don't know. I mean we don't feel compelled to do any development other than places where there's customer demand. And I think to try to predict something is actually irresponsible, because it then gets the organization to drive to a number, and we don't need to drive to a number. I mean that -- nobody gets paid for driving to a number or anything like that. We'd all get paid as the company does well, and we'll do whatever we can to make sure that the markets stay in balance and that our developments lease up appropriately and that we have good margins. So it's all dependent.  Remember, a year ago, when we were sitting right here, we had just seen the stock market decline significantly. We had ratcheted down our business plan. And the world just looked very different than the way it ended up playing out. And by the way, we weren't the only people who were conservative in our outlook. That was the responsible thing to do. But as the year unfolded and we saw demand being better, we obviously scaled up our activity. We have the land to do it. We have the talent to do it. But we don't feel compelled to do it unless there's demand. Christopher Caton : We'll always tell you exactly what we think at that moment in time. But particularly with spec development, we will ratchet that down or up as the market tells us. And remember, our development program, it's 200 -- roughly speaking 200 bets across 65 different markets. So it's big and it's going to be dynamic over time. Operator : Your next question comes from Tom Catherwood from BTIG. William Catherwood : Following up on Blaine's question on the developments, obviously, a huge start quarter in the fourth quarter. And back at the Investor Day, Hamid, you had mentioned how the development time line has extended from 9 to 12 months to kind of 18 months plus. Just given the complexity, due to that and the starts, does that mean you need to carry more land on your books to continue to feed the development pipeline? And if that's the case, kind of where are you looking from a complexity standpoint or a risk standpoint as far as kind of how far out you're willing to go to take risk on land right now? Hamid Moghadam : Yes. If that were -- Tom, if that were the only variable, that would be the right conclusion to draw. But remember, there are 2 other variables that are going on. One is that we're generally trying to reduced lands as a percentage of our total assets around the company. We're almost to our goal, not quite. And there are actually some markets where we're thin on land and other markets where we're balanced. So that's one headwind going the other way. And also, we're controlling a lot of land via auctions and other things that don't show up on the balance sheet. So that's how we're kind of dealing with the need for more land without taking on more balance sheet exposure. Mike, do you want to say anything about that -- any more about that? Michael Curless : Yes. In terms of our land exposure, I think we're in pretty good shape. We managed that very effectively last year. And I think we'll be picking land in our strategic spots going forward in the major markets where our customers are migrating to. And I think we're in good shape there. Hamid Moghadam : And by the way, the extension in the development -- I'm sorry, the expansion in the development cycle is mostly on the front end and on the entitlement side. I mean it's not taking us any longer to physically build buildings. And certainly, our lease-up assumptions to get them stabilized has not been extended. So really it's on the front end on the entitlement. Operator : Your next question comes from David Rodgers from Baird. David Rodgers : Tom, you did a good job at the beginning of the call, I think, laying out some of the supply-demand fundamentals that you guys track, and we all use different numbers. But I think one of the things that had been a little concerning was just kind of no matter what source you use, kind of net absorption before the impact of construction has been kind of trailing a little bit lower. I guess maybe throw a couple of questions at that one. Are you guys seeing that as well? And can you kind of denote where that's coming from, maybe outside of a global auto? And then, two, maybe, Hamid, on your comment about Amazon being 40% of the market, can you just clarify, was that 40% of e-commerce or the embedded base and just kind of what you're getting out of that comment? Eugene Reilly : Yes, they're actually 45% of e-commerce sales, I think, is the latest number. I might be a point or 2 off, but it's as a percentage of e-commerce. And I think e-commerce is like 12% of the overall market. So they're like 4.5% of overall retail sales. I think this came up earlier, but maybe I can emphasize it. The demand is not uniform around the country. And some of the markets where there is exceptional demand, the supply is just so tight that a lot of that demand just doesn't show up. I don't know what that number is, but I can tell you it's a positive number. And God, after 10 years of supply falling short of demand, we've all been predicting this year where supply exceeds demand for the last 5 years, and we've got it now. So -- but -- I mean, it's a big market, it's 15 billion square feet of base, and we've got 30 million feet of difference between supply and demand. And that doesn't even take into account all the real estate -- all the industrial real estate that's being scraped for higher and better uses and is becoming obsolete. So I'm not losing any sleep over that. Chris, do you have... Christopher Caton : Just on the specific numbers, we have net absorption of 240 million in 2019. The 4-year average is 250 million square feet. So pretty consistent with the 4-year average, and really at work there is the 4.6% vacancy rate that just made it more difficult to absorb stock. And you saw some of that growth more in price than in net absorption, so rents were up 7%, 8% in the U.S. last year. When we look at the demand trends late in the year, as Gene discussed, whether it's really good momentum in the fourth quarter or whether it's our proprietary indicators, like the IBI, which is at 61, makes us feel like growth will improve in 2020. Eugene Reilly : Yes, the picture going into 2019 was much more negative than -- I mean -- or less positive. I mean it was positive, but it was less positive than it is today. Market feels a lot better right now than it did on the call a year ago. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason Green from Evercore. Jason Green : Just a question on development yields. In total, you're developing assets now to 120 basis point spread per this supplemental. I guess at what point do spreads become too narrow to continue developing assets? Hamid Moghadam : When we stop developing. Chicken or the egg? No, I'm not -- I mean 120 basis points is a pretty healthy margin when cap rates are as low as they are. But we're really margin focused. And if we can't really get going in a pretty, say, 15% on spec and maybe low teens on build-to-suit, we just won't do it. I guess, we'll do a build-to-suit at around a 10% margin for a great tenant with a great credit that we can easily do and sell or something like that. But I mean, that's the range of it. The only problem is, in the last however many years, 10 years, we've had double or triple those margins. So someday, we'll have lower than those margins, for sure. The market goes through cycles. But there's definitely an arrow up on margins from where we pro forma these deals. And I would say, 9 out of 10 deals at least, maybe even more, maybe 19 out of 20 of them that we do a recap on, we do a recap on every deal that we do when it's stabilized and we look at what it costs, what the yields were and sort of grade our performance on that. I would say there are very few of them that have any reds on them. I mean all of them have big green numbers on them. So, so far so good, and I expect that to continue for at least the foreseeable future. Operator : Your next question comes from Eric Frankel from Green Street Advisors. Eric Frankel : I sincerely apologize for asking another development question. But can you -- this is based on your 4Q starts and a little bit higher development volume in '20. Can you talk about whether you think that overall supply is bound to increase more than it has in the last couple of years? And how does that reflect on market rent growth generally? And then second -- and it certainly seems like you guys are a lot more active in buying assets of different types in the New York City boroughs. But we also noted that Walmart.com -- Walmart is not going to be using that Bronx facility you guys acquired a couple of years ago and leased to them. So maybe you could just talk about your experiences there? Christopher Caton : Yes. I think the experience in the Bronx has nothing to do with the real estate, it has to do with, well, Walmart's decision not to pursue a strategy that they were going to pursue. We actually think the re-leasing market for that building is an upside from where that building is leased. So -- and obviously, we have Walmart credit on it. So we're not -- I don't think it means anything other than a change in strategy of the company. And with respect to the supply picture, I think we're feeling better about supply right now than we did a quarter or 2 ago. Gene, what do you think? Eugene Reilly : Yes. I think in -- for sure, a quarter ago, we felt a little bit worse about supply. And Eric, if you look at the last couple of years, what's happened is that the development engine in the U.S., the industry wasn't able to hit Chris' estimate for supply. So I expect that next year, it's the same thing. And it's -- the explanation is pretty simple. It is very difficult and more difficult every day to develop the space. So I would probably say there is a down arrow. Christopher Caton : Look, If you -- we're all looking for things to worry about. I would be more worried about a recession because of something like totally out of left field like this virus thing or something globally that can affect something more on the demand side than on the supply side. Supply may be 10 million, 20 million, 30 million feet one way or another. But that, at the end of the day, doesn't move the vacancy rate or the pricing power. But if demand falls off the clip because of some unknown thing or war or some bad thing like that, that is the thing that I worry more about. Supply, one way or another, it's going to be pretty close to what we think. Certainly, a year out, you have pretty good visibility into what supply is, because 2/3, maybe 3/4 of stuff that's going to be supply should be under construction right now. So we know kind of what that number is. So really the wiggle room is on the last 25%, 30% of supply. Operator : Your next question comes from John Guinee from Stifel. John Guinee : Great. Very, very impressive 14% year-over-year growth, but probably even more impressive is issuing 110 million shares that looks like about 25x forward multiple and a 3.6 implied cap. If you're at liberty to talk about it, can you talk about -- because of FAS 141 accounting, you're probably bringing both the IPT and the Liberty portfolio and at a much higher GAAP cap rate than a cash cap rate. Are you at liberty to talk about the GAAP cap rate that these assets are coming in and also your thoughts on FAD growth and dividend growth for 2020? Eugene Reilly : Yes. Can't talk about the first component, but you can guestimate it pretty well. I mean average lease is 6 years and an average built-in rent growth in these leases is, call it, 3%. So you can kind of do the math, 3 years of 3%, that's how much the gap is higher than the -- by the way, the reason I'm not going to get in trouble, because I don't actually know what the number is. But the math on it should be pretty damn close to my guestimate. Thomas Olinger : And John, I'll point you back to the presentation we gave when we announced the transaction. We had $25 million in fair value lease adjustments, but that also includes straight-line rent adjustments. And that's a net number, because you back out the straight-line rent that's embedded in the IPT and Liberty portfolios, but more to come on that.  To your point about FAD ultimately getting to the dividend, as we've said in the past, we -- our dividend levels are going to need to increase pretty consistently with what you see our FAD and AFFO growth, because we're -- we'll pay out as close as we can to the minimum threshold at which -- where we're staying. So that's a consistent theme you're seeing here. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Mueller from JP Morgan. Michael Mueller : You talked about, I think, a pickup in demand that you were seeing in Lehigh Valley. I was just wondering if you can give us a little more color on what you see driving that? Eugene Reilly : Yes. Your question was a little bit low, but I think your question is about recent activity in Lehigh Valley. And Lehigh Valley has, over the past year, experienced a little bit overbuilding, but news in the last 6 months is pretty good. So demand there is strong. I would say that is contrasted with Central Pennsylvania, where demand is still a little bit weak right now. Christopher Caton : Yes, Gene, I think driving that is a combination of both general supply chain modernization. So we see some customers who are feeding their store network and also a fair amount of e-commerce also wanting to serve the greater region and in particular New York. Hamid Moghadam : And probably record low vacancy in New Jersey. Eugene Reilly : Yes. Southern New Jersey, there's virtually no product. Christopher Caton : So a key message there would be the prioritization of proximity and the proximity of core Lehigh Valley to New Jersey and in particular New York. That's driving that demand. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Frankel from Green Street Advisors. Eric Frankel : I guess, I'd -- I guess I also have a few more thoughts from earnings this quarter. But one quick question, housekeeping item. Of the $1 billion of sales from IPT and Liberty, how much of that is office? And then second, I think Walmart, just speaking to them, they debut an automation product they're going to be using in their stores to distribute product just directly to consumers via pickup. Can you talk about automation and how that's impacting supply chains? Obviously, Amazon is always trying to reinvent how they're utilizing the fulfillment centers. And maybe you could touch upon how your other customers are thinking about it. Eugene Reilly : Well, I'm going to pitch this to Chris, because he spent a lot of time together with Will O'Donnell on the topic of automation and its impact generally on logistics demand. And one of these days, you may see a paper coming out on that, that's pretty extensive and detailed. But we don't think that it is a -- we think automation is a way of making employees more productive, because it's so hard to get employees to do this kind of work. I mean that's really the impetus for automation. And the downside of automation is that unless you have very standardized products, the state of the industry is not such that you can have special purpose automation or general purpose automation installed that can handle a lot of different goods, sizes, shapes, et cetera, et cetera. We're marching in that direction, but we're quite some time away.  And also what we're hearing from our customers -- the majority of our customers, particularly the three PLs is that the capital needs of automation are just way beyond their ability to be able to do that. So -- and in order to implement automation, they need to have longer-term contracts with their customers and be able to amortize those investments over a longer period of time. Chris? Christopher Caton : Yes, spot on. Underlying the variety of operations that are going in our customer space, and that translates to two things. One is an adoption rate of automation within logistics facility that is low and rising at a moderate pace; and two, the ROIs on some of these investments are still pretty low, given the complexity and the complex nature. Another point I'd make relates to productivity-enhancing equipment. That's what this really is. That's been around for a long time, whether you look back 40 years at forklifts. And so we've seen a constant effort to improve employee productivity within our facilities, and this is no different. As it relates to specific reference you make, kind of in-store automation as well, something we have seen in the marketplace are more requirements not just to serve e-com, but also to serve store fleets that are needing to handle this \"buy online and pick up in store\". There's more activity to also think about the existing supply chains to support that activity in store. Thomas Olinger : Eric, I'll respond to your first question relative to the split out of the $1 billion in sales for IPT and LPT. I would say this, it's going to be fluid, but the office component that remains is quite small. But as we said, we're going to match fund disposition proceeds with opportunities to redeploy them. And so I would say it would be fluid, but again, the office is a small piece that's left out of that. Eugene Reilly : Yes, the non-Comcast office, I would expect to -- we're through that. So really office comes down to Comcast. And that is, as you know, pretty liquid, pretty straightforward type of position. And it's only a matter of what's the ideal time to do that and the dynamics with the customer, which is a very important customer anyway, over time what happens. But that's kind of -- there's not a lot of wiggle room on the economics of that deal. We know it's 100% leased, and we know what the economics are. So office is gone. We're not in a big hurry on the industrial. We've just kind of match funded. As -- I mean we're 18% leased -- 18% levered. So why would we want to do more than match funds? We're not in a hurry. It's a good market. Operator : Your next question comes from Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Two quick ones. On Slide 15 of the slide deck, you gave the occupancy broken out by its size. Could you give us the rent spreads using that same breakout? Thomas Olinger : Yes, Vikram, this is Tom. The rent spreads were pretty consistent this quarter across all the different size categories. I think the small space under 100 probably picked up a little bit, a little higher than normal, but this quarter, very consistent across all 3 sizes. Eugene Reilly : I would say small space is recovered a bit -- small space was way ahead of big space, maybe a year, 1.5 years ago. Then it went the other way and softened, and now it's coming back a little bit. Most recently, the big space is recovering more in the last couple of quarters. So they're all even, but they're coming to even from different directions. Operator : Your next question comes from Manny Korchman from Citi. Michael Bilerman : It's Michael Bilerman here with Manny. Hamid, I had a question for you just sort of about the sort of acquisition market overall. And we clearly know there's an insatiable desire by private capital to put capital to work really on a global basis in industrial, right? It's a favorite asset class, has been that way for the last few years. And I wanted to get your sort of thoughts on Sleath's from SEGRO's comment that he made earlier this year that the market is paying full price even for assets with works on them and that their focus is on development and granted it was self-serving. But you made a comment about the acquisition market. And I sort of wanted to get your feel about what you see on a global basis about how investors are pricing assets and differentiating assets and how that may play into your disposition plans as well? Hamid Moghadam : Yes. I mean we've basically been saying the same thing, more or less, with a slightly different accent. I mean the acquisition market in Europe, which is, remember, that's what they're talking about, is pretty expensive. And if you have a good land bank and you are an active developer, like they are and we are, obviously the best use of capital is to put your land bank to work and the incremental returns on those investments are quite high. But there are still opportunities here and there that are priced below replacement cost. For example, short-term income in Europe is discounted. So if you have a building that has a two year lease on it or something, maybe a perfectly good building, but you could buy that below replacement cost, that kind of thing we'd be interested in. But you can buy $1 billion of it. I mean, I don't know where you would go to buy $1 billion of that kind of stuff in Europe. The rest of the world is a different story. I mean there are places where -- I mean like in Mexico, if an acquisition opportunity were to come up, cap rates, for the very best product, are around 7, but you can buy some things that are 8 or 9. And if you look at their treasuries, the goal on their treasuries, there's a big spread there in that market. So the global picture is a little different, but I would generally agree with their commentary for Europe. Gene? Eugene Reilly : Yes, I wouldn't add much to that. And Europe, while expensive on a relative basis, look at risk-free yields in Europe. I mean, you get negative rates and the best economies, there's got to be four countries in negative rates. So I'm not frankly sure that cap rate environment today in Europe is all that expensive. Hamid Moghadam : The other thing I would say about Europe, Europe has -- it will be interesting to do the math on this. We haven't, but this is a guess. There are a lot of institutional investors in Europe that are focused in Europe, and the size of the industrial asset class in Europe, it's still a relatively new industry and institutional quality products proportionately is a lot smaller than it is in the U.S. So you've got a lot of institutional private capital focused on a market with fewer opportunities. And I think that's pushing on yields in Europe pretty hard. So development is preferred to acquisitions in all these markets anyway.  I think that was the last question. Thank you for joining our call, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter, if not sooner. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Also note that this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tracy Ward. Tracy, you may begin. Tracy Ward : Thanks, Mariana, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates as well as management's beliefs and assumptions.  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance, and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings. Additionally, our first quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures. And in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. This morning, we'll hear from Gene Reilly, our Chief Investment Officer who will comment on real time market condition; and Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover results and guidance. Hamid Moghadam, Gary Anderson, Chris Caton, Mike Curless, Ed Nekritz, Colleen McKeown and Tim Arndt are also here with us today. With that, I'll turn the call over to Gene. And Gene, will you please begin? Eugene Reilly : Thanks, Tracy. We appreciate everyone joining us today and we hope you and yours are all well. We're glad to report that our teams are healthy and working productively on a remote basis. Our first quarter was very strong in all types of the business and Tom will cover these details. I'm going to focus on what we're seeing right now and our outlook for the year. While we are just 30 to 90 days into the COVID economy, we are seeing short-term effects play out very differently across our customer industry sectors. At this time, roughly 60% of our customers are growing and 40% are shrinking.  Next week Chris Caton will be issuing his fourth COVID white paper specifically on this topic of customer demand segmentation. At the extreme ends of the spectrum categories like food and beverage and consumer staples have sales up significantly; and conversely, cloth and sporting goods and home furnishings are all down sharply.  Our customers in contraction are going through a short-term shock, some will recover fairly quickly, others face a longer transition to normalcy, and unfortunately certain businesses will not survive. At the same time, the pandemic has led to significant growth for the industries I mentioned, serving the stay at home economy. And we continue to experience elevated e-commerce demand, a 40% share of new leasing versus 23% pre-crisis.  With the benefit of customer dialogue and applied research, we factored in tailwinds and headwinds to arrive at our revised 2020 earnings guidance. Our portfolio quality, customer composition and balance sheet strength are mitigating the headwinds and our disciplined efforts to dispose off $15 billion of non-strategic assets over the past several years, that is paying dividends today.  Turning to the long-term impacts, we believe some of the changes brought on by the pandemic will be durable. COVID is very likely to accelerate a share shift from brick and mortar to e-commerce retail. We also believe the growing importance of safety stock will lead to higher global inventory levels over time. These trends will increase demand for logistics real estate in the long-term, but will also have a positive effect on 2020 activity and we're already seeing this. Chris and his team have updated our forecast for logistics real estate market fundamentals and now expect the following for full year 2020.  In the U.S. supply will total 225 million square feet, an 18% year over year decline. U.S. net absorption will total a 100 million square feet, the lowest level since 2010 and a 55% year-over-year decline driving the vacancy rate up 90 basis points to 5.4%. Europe will have similar reductions in the supply and demand resulting in a 130 basis point vacancy rate increase to 5.2%. Japan's vacancy rate will increase from a record low of 1.4% to 2.8%. In summary, occupancies in all geographies will decline but also end the year at very healthy levels historically.  Our proprietary leasing data shows that the spike in leasing activities we witnessed in March, and talked you all about a couple of weeks ago, has settled down. We are now seeing volumes generally in line with historical trends. Forward-looking data continues to be encouraging.  During the last 30 days we signed 198 leases amounting to 17.5 million square feet, that's up 21% year-over-year and roughly flat adjusted for portfolio size. Our lease proposal generations are up 21% year-over-year. Lease negotiation gestation periods for new leases have declined by about 14 days year-over-year and retention was just over 80%, a couple hundred basis points higher than comparable historical periods.  After slicing the data in several different ways, we see three clear themes at this point. First, essential consumer product sectors are driving the demand. Second, e-commerce is driving demand across industry sectors. And third, our larger customers are fairing much better than smaller customers in this environment.  Now an update on rent relief requests, growth has slowed here. And to-date, we have received requests representing 4.3% of gross annual rent. Of these requests, 70% were not granted, 23% remain under review and 7% have been granted in the form of rent deferral loans representing 27 basis points of gross annual rent and an average of about 33 days of rent per customer.  As mentioned on our last call, this release is targeted at our smaller customers with legitimate need stemming from COVID and not through opportunistic requests. We believe the total rent deferral loans granted will eventually amount to about 90 basis points of gross annual rent with these loans scheduled for repayment over the remainder of 2020.  Turning to the strategic capital business, our investors remain very positive on the logistics real estate sector. As noted on our last call, the vast majority of redemptions to-date were in progress prior to COVID-19 and there appears to be good secondary market interest for some portion of the redemption activity, but to-date we have seen no trades on the secondary market. Next I would like to provide some context for the updated capital deployment guidance Tom detail in a moment. This guidance assumes virtually no incremental activity in acquisitions, dispositions, speculative development or contributions. Rather than to speculate on future market conditions, we are guiding to volumes that have largely been accomplished already. Most of the volume predicted between now and the year end is build-to-suit activity where the pipeline remains active with multiple leases signed post-COVID actually.  We continue to work closely with customers and municipalities on 30 ongoing projects in 14 markets. Construction continues on 22 of these projects with eight having been halted by local authorities. And to-date we have yet to stop a project at the request of a customer. While our current leasing data is holding up very well and we see extremely encouraging trends with e-commerce leasing, we\u2019re planning on a reduced demand environment through the end of 2020. We will have opportunities to serve our customer segments in expansion mode and we will need to support others not so fortunate.  We expect to serve as a reliable alternative for build-to-suit customers, take advantage of investment opportunities as they emerge and manage our strategic capital vehicles prudently and opportunistically in this environment.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Tom. Thomas Olinger : Thanks, Gene. First and foremost, I want to echo Gene\u2019s introductory comments and wish you and your families the best of health during these challenging times. I'll briefly discuss Q1 and then take you through our updated guidance. Starting with results, core FFO for the first quarter was $0.83 a share which was in line with our pre-COVID expectations. We did recognize an expense of $5 million in the quarter or a little less than $0.01 per share related to our donation to the Prologis Foundation for COVID-19 relief efforts.  During the quarter we completed the acquisition and integration for both the IPT and Liberty portfolios. We hit our synergy targets and both portfolios are performing well and in line with our expectations. We leased 34.7 million square feet in the quarter with ending occupancy of 95.5%, down a 100 basis points sequentially as expected. Rent change on rollover remains strong at 25% and was led by the U.S. at 31%. Our share of cash same-store NOI growth was 4.6% which was about 30 basis points above our forecast. Same-store average occupancy for the quarter was 85 basis points lower year-over-year, again, consistent our expectations. As of yesterday, we've collected 85% of April rent, which is in 1% of our normal pace. Rent due dates vary by country and about 5% of our rent isn't due until the back half of the month. As Gene noted, we've granted $18 million in rent deferrals, [$9 million] of which relates to April. All granted deferrals are structured to be repaid in 2020. For deployment, we started $300 million in new development projects which were 85% pre-leased. Stabilizations were $690 million with an estimated margin of 39% and value creation of $270 million. Additionally, we realized more than $280 million in development gains through early April.  Looking to the balance sheet, we enter this crisis in a position of strength with significant liquidity and borrowing capacity. Liquidity at quarter end was $4.6 billion and we have cleared out our debt maturities until 2022. The combined leverage capacity of Prologis and our open-ended vehicles at levels in line with current ratings is well over $10 billion.  Turning to guidance for 2020. Our approach is twofold; first, to exercise prudence; and second, use a broader range of outcomes given the uncertainty. While the full economic impact is difficult to quantify, our guidance assumes reduced demand into the third quarter with the operating environment beginning to recover towards the end of the year. Here are the key components of our guidance on our share basis. Our cash same store NOI, we\u2019re decreasing the midpoint by 225 basis points and now expect growth to range between 1.75% and 3.25%. The decrease in the midpoint assumes average occupancy will be down a 100 basis points in range between 94.5% and 95.5%.  We expect retention to increase about 500 basis points and be in the mid 70% range. We are estimating bad debt expense to range between 100 basis points and 150 basis points of gross revenues. The midpoint of 125 basis points compares to 20 basis points of bad debt expense embedded in our prior guide. It's important to note this bad debt midpoint is on an annual basis, which means we've reserved a much higher percentage based on the remaining 2020 revenue, particularly if our positive cash collection trends continue. As we discussed in our call earlier this month, our bad debt expense peaked at 56 basis points during the GFC. At the midpoint, our annual guidance for bad debt is more than double that historical high and almost 3 times that level at the upper end of the range, again, on an annualized basis.  As Gene mentioned, we believe rent deferrals granted will amount to about 90 basis points. While we expect these deferrals to be repaid, we have factored in the potential for credit loss for the deferrals as well as elsewhere in the portfolio. We have included the impact of downtime resulting from potential bad debt in our occupancy forecast. We're assuming no rent growth for the remainder of the year. Rents for leases signed since March 1st have been about 200 basis points ahead of our expectations, while rents for lease assigned in the first two months of this year were about a 100 basis points better.  We expect rent change to be in the mid 20% range and keep in mind our in place to market rent spread is currently approximately 15%. For strategic capital, we expect revenue excluding promotes the range between $345 million and $355 million, down $5 million due to lower forecasted deployment by our funds. We are maintaining our net promote income for the full year of $0.15 per share based on quarter end valuations. The vast majority of the 2020 promote revenue will be recognized in the second quarter.  For net G&A we're forecasting a range between $270 million and $280 million, down $5 million at the midpoint. Our G&A for the year is down about $10 million due primarily to lower T&E, offset by the $5 million contribution to the Foundation. From a foreign currency standpoint, we continue to be extremely well insulated from FX movements through the next three years and our U.S. dollar net equity is over 95%.  As Gene mentioned we stopped all new speculate development and have halted construction on many spec projects that had recently started. We now expect development starts for the year to the range between $500 million and $800 million with build-to-suits comprising more than 70% of this volume. The cost to complete our active development pipeline is currently $1.6 billion.  For acquisitions and dispositions and contributions guidance, while not our expectation, we are simply forecasting no incremental activity other than a few transactions currently under contract. For net deployment uses we're now projecting $200 million at the midpoint, down $450 million from our prior guidance. The net deployment changes had a minimal impact on earnings given the timing of that activity.  Taking these assumptions into account, we are lowering our 2020 core FFO guidance midpoint by $0.11. We now expect a range between $3.55 and $3.65 per share, which includes $0.15 of net promote income. We believe we've approached the forecast quite conservatively with no assumption reasonably made more severe given what we know today. We have limited roll, dramatically reduced deployment and reserve for bad debt and multiples of the GFC. And even with that year-over-year growth at the midpoint excluding promotes remained strong at over 10%, all while keeping leverage flat.  We continue to maintain significant dividend coverage at 1.5 times and our 2020 guidance implies a payout ratio in the mid 60% range. Longer term, we feel more positive about our business given the emergence of two new structural demand drivers. First, there will be a need for more inventory as supply chains emphasize resiliency over efficiency; and second, an acceleration of e-commerce adoption. In closing, 2020 will be a tough year for many. However, despite the uncertainty, Prologis is very well prepared. We enter this unprecedented time with the healthiest fundamentals on record, an extremely well positioned portfolio, a significant in place to market rent spread and a strong balance sheet.  And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Jeremy Metz with BMO. Your line is open. Jeremy Metz : Gene you gave some good high level color here at the start. I was just wondering if you could break it down a little further here in terms what you're seeing or if you foresee any outside impact from any particular region or city, big box or small box, infill or secondary markets, maybe just a little color what you're seeing across those channels, what your expectations are? And then as a follow-up question outside the same-store pool, are your occupancy and bad debt assumptions similar to the recent portfolios you closed, Liberty in particular? Thanks. Eugene Reilly : Okay. I\u2019ll -- Jeremy, I may have Tom comment on the last question. But in terms of the sort of the composition of what's happening on the demand front, I mean probably it's really more industry segment and size segment than any particular geography. Obviously our Houston operation is facing headwinds from both COVID and plummeting oil prices. So that's our toughest market right now. But otherwise, the industry segments I mentioned are strongest. And clearly in this environment, smaller customers are having a tougher time than larger. And with respect to the -- one of the market I'd probably throw in there is Atlanta, which, in Atlanta we actually have a fairly high percentage of our smaller customers as well. So Tom, I don\u2019t know if you want to take the... Thomas Olinger : Yes, Jeremy. From a bad death perspective, we looked at the portfolio across the entire stack. We looked by industry, the customer composition and we looked at it consistently across the entire portfolio. So we don't see anything unique about any of our recently acquired portfolios. Operator : Your next question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi. Your line is open. Manny Korchman : It might be too early to be asking about 2021. But just given the sort of slowdown in pace or trajectory in \u201820, how do we think about your 2021 growth? And how that's going to sort of either slow or maybe rebound quicker as we sit today? Eugene Reilly : I think our business is going to be somewhat slower before the vaccine and much higher after the vaccine. So you tell me when the vaccine is going to come through, which is a real permanent solution and I'll tell you how that makes us going to work for the year. Operator : Your next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Your line is open. Jamie Feldman : Thank you. I was hoping you could focus a little bit more on the smaller tenant discussion. I mean, what have you seen in terms of government stimulus being able to actually help out those tenants? Just maybe some more color in terms of, how bad is it really for small versus large and what are the factors you guys are watching to see if they can get help or they're not going to get help or just as much color as you can provide would be great? Eugene Reilly : So Jamie, let me first make a distinction. Smaller tenants don't necessarily mean smaller companies that occupy those spaces. So you got to distinguish between the mom and pops and smaller locations for creditworthy company. So not all small tenants are under pressure. Secondly, the -- if you're a contractor or a supplier to a residential construction or some kind of an auto related use, for sure your business is down and you're going to be struggling in this environment. Too soon to tell how the government support is going to help. But at least on the levels of support that we've talked about so far, I don't think it fully replaces the revenue and the margins that they've lost during this period. But I can tell you, a lot of the demand for their products is deferred demand.  And if they can make it through this crisis, I think they'll be the beneficiary of the spring back, on the other side of this. So, tough to tell. The stimulus has been in place for a little less than two weeks. But also the other thing I would say is that there is a ton of monetary stimulus, on top of the fiscal stimulus that's come in. So -- and the attitude that I see with the banking system this time around because the banks are -- and you guys by the way, would know better than I would because you work for a lot of banks, but the banks are oftentimes -- well, they're certainly better capitalized and people seem to be much more cooperative in terms of working with their customers by accommodating them. Because everybody realizes that this is not anybody's problem. It's something that happened differently. This is a definite change in attitude with the government, fiscal, monetary, and with the banking system that's distributing the funds. So I think they're going to work with their customers, including the smaller ones, but some of them unfortunately won't make it. Operator : Your next question comes from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Vikram Malhotra : Two quick ones really, just one on the bad debt that you've baked in. Can you just clarify, have you seen any bad debt in the first quarter and can you talk about the second quarter? And then just second question on market rent growth. You referenced baking in no rent growth. I just want to clarify, are you referring to market rent growth in 2020? And just give us a little bit more color maybe by major regions? Eugene Reilly : Let me pick up on the rent growth question and then I'll pitch it over to Tom for the first part of your question on credit loss. Let me give you the facts on rent growth. Rent growth in January and February were a 100 basis points higher than what we had projected for those specific spaces. Rent growth for March surprisingly was 200 basis points higher than what we had projected for those spaces. So, so far we haven't seen evidence of rental decline or deceleration in growth.  However, we've assumed that in the forecast that Tom shared with you, because absent perfect information, you got to be conservative with respect to rental growth forecast. So those are two specific data points. The third data point I'll give you is that we have projected certain grants for the two acquired portfolios, IPT and LPT. And in both cases the spaces that we've rolled over have been on the range of 4% to 5% higher rents than we had forecast for those portfolios late last year when we underwrote them.  Tom, you want to talk about the credit loss? Thomas Olinger : Ys. So on bad debt experienced in the first quarter, we saw write-offs of 25 basis points. And in April, we've seen nothing unusual, as I talked about our April collections are trending normally, as did March. And as I mentioned, we are conservative here by almost any measure you can look at on the bad debt and we're reserved appropriately to cover a really severe downside on the AR side. Operator : Our next question comes from Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Blaine Heck : So you guys mentioned that you guys are moving forward with the 30 build-to-suits under construction, are there other build-to-suits that might've been in the plan to start construction later this year. And if so, can you talk about the probability of those continuing as planned as well and whether there are any kind of renegotiations happening on those with respect to the rent side of the equation? Mike Curless : Hey, Blaine. It\u2019s Mike Curless. The 30 build-to-suits are well underway. We haven't heard anything from any customers to say differently. So that is a very good sign. And in terms of the prospect list, I would say it's a bit shorter in number, but the people on that list are as active as ever. E-commerce is a big driver of those. You've read a lot about Amazon's activity across the board. We've seen signed leases this year. In order of magnitude we signed 10 leases this year compared to seven this time last year. And three of those, as Gene mentioned, came in the last several weeks. So it\u2019s a bunch of good signs with respect to the underpinning of e-commerce relative to build-to- suit. There's -- I'm not seeing any renegotiations underway and we have really good opportunities for tailwind here, given the lack of spec that you're going to see in the marketplace. So I'd say the prospect list is naturally a bit shorter, but pretty robust. And we're optimistic about the build-to-suit activity this year. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason Green with Evercore. Your line is open. Jason Green : Good morning. Just a question on bad debt guidance, on the business update call you mentioned that bad debt could trend as high as 100 basis points and now guidance incorporates 125 basis points at the midpoint. I know these are similar figures, but just curious if you saw anything in the last few weeks that made that estimate trend higher? Thomas Olinger : No, just let me clarify. We did not actually guide on bad debt in any way and we were very careful to draw the distinction between operating performance and any kind of financial guidance. The number that we talked about 100 basis points on that call is the equivalent of the 90 basis points that Gene talked about. That is the forecast amount of total rent that is going to be subject to deferral. That is at related but not the same concept as the write off, because we fully expect obviously the ones that we have deferred to make good on that deferral. Now a portion of them will probably default. And a portion of the ones that didn't ask for a deferment could default. So the 90 basis points of deferral is very different than the 125 basis points on average of credit loss. The other thing I want to make sure you understand is that the 125 basis point is applied across the year. And certainly as you heard from Tom, the first quarter was 20 basis points and we know what that was. So we're carrying another 100 basis points of room from the first quarter into future quarters, and we've got 125 basis points to start with across the whole year. So the amount that we have reserved for anything that could default is significantly higher than what appears on the surface. Let me be even more specific. Not all tenants are going to default that are going to default are going to default on April 1st. If they default, they're likely to default during the course of the year. So on average, they're going to default in July. If you just ratably divide it, which means on that basis alone we\u2019re almost 3 times the actual number covered for default risk and default outcomes. And another way you can get at it is that in the global financial crisis, the total written off debt averaged 56 basis points annually and the midpoint this time around is 125 basis points for the remaining, more than 125 basis points for the remaining three quarters significantly higher. So we've got a scenario multiples of times of the global financial crisis factored in. Operator : Your next question comes from Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Craig Mailman : Just curious, any of the rent referral requests from tenants that paid April, but are worried about being able to pay May. And then just separately maybe for Chris, you kind of put out a hundred, or you put out your net absorption figures and construction figures this year. Just as we think about \u201921, I know you're giving guidance. But do you think the slowdown in deliveries in \u201821 and with the rebound in absorption, could result in better than expected snap backs in \u201921? Eugene Reilly : I do, I don't know what, Chris, thinks. But again, snapbacks is not going to happen until everybody's got the all clear signal on the health front. [Multiple Speakers] Everybody talks about the government, when are they going to put people back to work and open up the country for business and all these demonstrations that we see, that's got nothing to do with it. Even if they open up the place for business, a lot of people will have to go back to work and will, but the lot of people who don't have to go to work won\u2019t. So I don't think the government action is going to be the trigger for that. I think the all clear is going to have to come from the health front. Chris Caton : And I think, let me just finish up the answer here, which is to me he's already given me a view on the demand, but it's also important to remember a view on supply. Right now in the marketplace, we were seeing projects the way or not started and that's kind of a material impact on the outlook for delivery in 2021. Operator : Your next question comes from Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Your line is now open. Tom Catherwood : Tom, you mentioned that customers are focusing on resiliency over efficiency now. How do you see this playing out and how are you positioning your portfolio and investments or built to suit activity to assist either with the shift or what it take part in this shift? Thomas Olinger : So I think our portfolio is already positioned to capture that activity, number one, just given the proximity of portfolio to the consumption base and as we see the acceleration, further acceleration long-term of e-commerce trends, I think we are right there to capture that. And then on the resiliency versus efficiency comment, its clear customers will carry more inventories to protect themselves against future shocks. We'll see that and they're going to want that inventory close to the consumption base to meet consumer demands for delivery time. So I think our portfolio today is positioned and we're going to continue to build out our land bank and further solidify our portfolio. Operator : Your next question comes from John Peterson with Jefferies. Your line is open. John Peterson : I think about six weeks ago or so, you guys announced the share buyback program. Just curious given public perception around share buybacks and landlords for that matter. Do you think it makes sense to buyback even if the stock price does fall substantially? And if I could sneak in a second unrelated question, I'm just curious what social distancing might mean for some of the different industries in your space. Obviously, some users have very few people in the facilities at any one time, while maybe [Technical Difficulty]. Thomas Olinger : I think you cut off, but I get the gist of your question. On social distancing, I think there are certain categories of our customers that their businesses will continue to suffer like the people servicing the convention trade and hospitality, I think -- or airlines, I think those businesses will continue to suffer. If you mean what is it mean in terms of the actual occupants of our buildings, the people who work in our building. The most people intensive operations that we have are the e-commerce players and you have read the same things I have about Amazon and other e-commerce players, and some of the controversy that's been out there. But I think those companies have been very responsible actually in terms of not only providing a lot of employment during this difficult time, but also having a lot of controls in terms of checking people's temperatures. And now I understand they're going to go to some pretty regular testing, serology testing. So, I think they're doing the best they can to actually get people back to business. So you and I can actually get our groceries and other things. And I actually commend them for that. With respect to the share buyback program, you know we did buyback $35 million of stock when the stock got into the 60s. And we felt that that was a very, very significant discount to NAV and it was a compelling opportunity. And to be honest with you, after doing that I changed my mind and then thought the perception of that is not going to be great. So we took all the profits that we made there and our intention is to put all those profits back into the Prologis foundation, and it was a pretty substantial amount of profit. So I think actually we're going to do some good with it going forward. But we haven't, I haven't fully thought through the perception of it and -- but we made some money and we're going to spend it for a good cause. Operator : Your next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : This is [Sumit] for Nick. Just a quick question on short term leasing and lease terminationss actually. So lease terminations while too small have almost doubled as a percent of revenue this quarter versus Q1 last year and versus the last quarter that is Q4 of 2019. So just trying to understand besides the bad debt and all that, just trying to understand what you're seeing in terms of tenants from markets that are seeing elevated levels of terminations? Any color would be useful. Thomas Olinger : This is Tom, Sumit. On the lease terminations, there's nothing unique, they\u2019re episodic. And what we saw in Q1 was not particularly unusual. It was just related to a tenant\u2019s needs and we helped them out in another space as well. There were couples like that. So it\u2019s episodic. There's no trending that we see with termination fees being foreshadowing any other type of activity. I just don't see it. Eugene Reilly : So the only thing I would add to Tom's answer is that it's a billion square foot portfolio. And in our business unlike the office business, there's not a lot of lease termination fee anyway. So it's one of those things where a very small number could have increased by a large percentage and it's still a very small number, and those things moved around by very specific decision. Keep in mind we have 15% spread to market and that spread, if anything, is still there and maybe as we expanded a little bit. So sometimes the lease terminations are an opportunity for us to make some money on buying out a tenant and actually make some more money by re-leasing the space.  So lease terminations are not necessarily bad in our business and they're minuscule in the scale of the portfolio. And I apologize if we don't remember every single one of them. We have over 8,000 leases. Operator : Your next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is now open. Ki Bin Kim : So first question, can you just talk about your exposure to at risk tenancy or industry? And the second, just taking a step back, if I put your comments about rent spreads and market rent being flat, putting it all together. It kind of seems a little bit optimistic given what's going on the macro fund. So, what am I missing from your views? Is it really the tenant by tenant leasing that you're doing that gives you confidence in that or something else? Thomas Olinger : Well, first of all, I don't think I gave you a forecast for market rent. I was very careful to tell you, let me tell you actually what has happened. And I distinguish between the activity in January and February, which was up 1% compared to our expectations versus March that was up 2%. But our forecast don't incorporate rents going up, we basically pushed that out for the balance of this year. And as someone else pointed out, we haven't issued guidance for next year but we do think there's going to be a snap back next year that's going to result in rent growth. If you were going ask me right now, it's not a fully baked idea. So our official view on rent growth is that it's flat for the year and we're writing out some rent growth. So you can think of it as a slight decline or something, but we're not smart enough to be able to forecast those things with precision. The good news is that market rent growth has very little to do with our numbers in the near future. We have only 8% of the space that rolls over and we have 15% mark to market and a greater amount on the ones that roll over this year. So really what drives rent and operating results is the mark-to-market and the small percentage of rollover. So I don't think it's going to be a big deal. Operator : Your next question comes from Eric Frankel with Green Street Advisors. Your line is open. Eric Frankel : Just two quick questions. Do you have an economic forecast that underlies your operating guidance this year? And then just regarding kind of the safety stock and inventory resilience team, have you talked with any customers and specific industries that have brought this up, or is this kind of your assumptions just based on your experience or your internal data? Thank you. Thomas Olinger : Eric, honestly, I'm really surprised with your question. Have we talked to any customers? That just really blows me away. We are very customer centric. We have a Chief Customer Officer, who in addition, as part of the executive team, who spends all his time and a dedicated team talking to our major customers. And we have over 500 customer facing people in the field that are in constant dialog with our customers. So yes, we do speak to our customers quite a bit. As to economic forecast, I don't spend a lot of time looking at economic forecasts, because I've seen much smarter people than Prologis have forecasts that are down 5% a year and some that have down 40% this year. So I don't know what it is. I just look at customer behavior when we forecast our business. And yes, in the long term, our business is completely correlated with consumption, which is highly correlated with economic growth or decline. But in the short term, the dynamics of e-commerce, the stay at home economy and the need to carry more inventory overwhelm those kinds of longer term considerations. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Michael Carroll : I was hoping you could provide some more color on the rent deferments, the 33 days of average rent that is being deferred on those specific tenants. Is that enough for them to survive this type of market turmoil? I mean, I'm assuming you've done that type of analysis. And I think as the second part. What percentage of these smaller tenants qualify for the stimulus package? And does that give you more confidence that you're going to be able to collect these deferments by the end of the year? Mike Curless : Yes, there's a high percentage of our customers that we've been interacting with and that we think will qualify for the stimulus and we're seeing evidence of that already in the U. S. We've had several examples where customers initially contacted us only to call us two weeks later and say, hey, look, this stimulus kicked in. So you know, May will be a little bit of a wait and see but we expect high percentage of those customers receiving that, that activity. And then with respect to the 33 days, again as Hamid mentioned, we know our customers very well. We've had a very thorough process. We've looked at their financials, they filled out the questionnaires. And that's been our best estimate of what's going to be necessary to bridge them to the next opportunity for them. So that's where we are. Eugene Reilly : And just kind as to the last question, as you heard in our update call and I think you heard somewhere today about 20% to 25% of our customer base at some point has had a discussion with respect to some kind of rent deferral. And of course on those we've granted a very small portion of it. We expect to ultimately maybe grant 30% and today it\u2019s more like 5%. So that alone means we've had direct discussion with 25% of the customer base. Well, on a billion square foot portfolio that's 250 million square feet. So we've had conversations, multiple sizes of many, many big companies in the sector with our customers, just about that topic during this period of time. So yes, we're really talking to customers all the time. Operator : Your next question comes from John Guinee with Stifel. Your line is open. John Guinee : I might've missed this and if I did, just tell me. But I don't think you mentioned anything about near shoring or on shoring as effect on your business. And then second, Tom, it looks to me like back of the envelope midpoint of your guidance is a pretty strong ramp, $0.85, to $0.87 to $0.89. Could you talk a little bit about how GAAP accounting plays into your rent deferrals? Eugene Reilly : Yes, on the on shoring. So most of the stuff is going to get onshore from China and possibly from Mexico to the U. S. at least with respect to the U. S. and with respect to Europe, I don't think that much is going to change. It's probably going to be China shifting to European production. And as you know, our Chinese strategy, first of all, it's a very, very small part of our portfolio. It's about 1.5% of our income is in China. And secondly, it's totally focused towards domestic consumption. We learnt very quickly that the export business doesn't generate a lot of industrial demand, because containers are the warehouse. So to the extent that there's more on shoring in the consumption markets, the U. S. and Europe, I'm not counting on it but by definition, that's incremental demand on top of the consumption demand. So it should help on the margin. And the reason we haven't really factored in it is that those are likely to go to really lower cost locations and where real estate is cheap and labor is cheap, and we're really well positioned for the infill large urban market. So likely you're not going to put a plant to on shore in downtown San Francisco or any place like that, or LA, you're going to go to a cheaper environment. So I think it will be important positive for U. S. and European demand. But I'm not sure we, because of our geography, are going to be the biggest beneficiaries of that. I think people who are in more remote locations will probably benefit from that. Tom, you want to take the other part of the question? Thomas Olinger : Yes, your other question on the rent deferrals and the accounting analysis of that. So the way we're structuring our rent deferrals is extending the payment term. And as we mentioned, the payment term, the due dates are within 2020. We certainly expect them to be paid, but the whole analysis on the collectability when you book that revenue, you gain that revenue to be collectible and that's just assessment. So this is relating to April revenue that's being deferred and you make the assessment in April as to the collectability of that revenue and you either book that revenue or you book a reserve, or portion reserve against that based on your assessment of collectability. And then regarding the ramping or what is earnings look like from a quarterly perspective, clearly, Q2 will be heavily influenced by the promote, because that's when the bulk of that will land. And then it's really a function of what we see, quite frankly, from a bad debt experience. As we said, we've got a lot of bad debt reserve that's sitting there for the rest of the year. And I think our results are going to move relative to what happens there. Eugene Reilly : The only thing that I would add John to that is that prior to these adjustments, downward adjustments, our year-over-year growth was on the order of I think 13%, 14% FFO growth, 14% FFO growth, actually. And that's a big number. So it's come down 4%. So maybe another way of asking your question is how come your guidance previously was so high and still is high. And the reason for that is primarily that the volume of development starts in prior years that we're just having capitalized interest in them are now coming on, and there are a lot of built of suits in those and those are now fully income producing. So we had them in the denominator as capital expenditures where we weren\u2019t earning a whole lot on them. And as they stabilized and they're leased those extra earnings are coming online. So it has nothing to do with this changed environment. It was just high to start with because of that and remains pretty healthy. I mean, I think 10% growth year-over-year even in the strongest environments without increasing leverage. Operator : Your next question comes from Dave Rodgers with Baird. Your line is open. Dave Rodgers : Maybe for Tom and Hamid, just about asset values. I know Tom, you talked about the promote being consistent in the guidance and the reason why is the pricing at the end of the first quarter. I guess I just wanted to drill on that if I could and the idea that you guys have taken market rents to more of a neutral stance this year, you've taken market vacancy outlook higher. I guess maybe why wouldn't that impact the valuation of assets as you sit here in a very point in time and is there any risk to that promote? And then maybe just a follow up to that, Gene you\u2019d said something earlier that the number of leases that you were doing, I think was flat on a portfolio size adjusted basis. Did you give the square footage for those and are they smaller deals in the pipeline, or larger ones? Any color there would be helpful as well? Thank you. Thomas Olinger : On the appraisals, what we've seen in the first quarter appraisals is that generally the numbers are up very slightly but the appraiser is like 1% or 2% quarterly. And appraisers have basically stickered the appraisals as they normally do and markets with turmoil that talk about that there are no cons et cetera, et cetera. But the real answer on that is that because promotes are such a sensitive calculation to the terminal value, these are generally three year promotes. And if you move around the terminal value a little bit the promotes can move around we're generally very conservative and projecting and guiding promotes. And we feel like we've got sufficient room to absorb any kind of a downside there. The other thing I would say is that more than half of the projected promote is a hold back of promote from three years ago, and the amount of which was determined and calculated and is known and that number will not change. So a big portion of that number we know exactly what it is more than 50%. So to the extent there's variabilities on that last I would say 40% of it, 60% of it is backed. Eugene Reilly : Well, let me just answer the second part of the question, which is the experience in the last 30 days of leasing. We have seen more leasing in the bigger size segments so we'll happy to clarify that for you later on but definitely bigger customers. Operator : Your next question comes from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Derek Johnston : You've covered a lot, so let's do this. So PLDs grown rapidly and I will say accretively over the past few years and in 2019 had additional large acquisitions. Meanwhile, investor sentiment has so far remained positive on industrial rates. However, amid this serious pause and probable tenant shakeout, what is it about the larger portfolio and positioning, you know which makes you most optimistic in these uncertain times? Eugene Reilly : Well, we've had a half of experience on the two latest acquisitions. And Tom, last time we talked about this couple of days ago, we were up about 5% on our underwriting of those portfolios based on activity that's already taking place. So we feel really good about it. Oh, sure, Houston energy is worse than we thought and Liberty had a pretty significant presence in Houston, and we did too but again it is a billion square foot portfolio. And on the other hand, Pennsylvania has done a lot better than we thought previously, because a lot of the New York adjacent demand and the big boxes have, for some strange reason, taking up a lot of space in Pennsylvania. So that's looking better and that's actually a bigger portfolio. So net, net all the reasons for which we did those investments that we articulated before stand. And on top of that, they've just performed better than we expected, so that's a really good start. I don't know whether that will continue for the next 10 years, but it's better to be 5% ahead of the game than behind the game when you're getting off the block. Does that answer your question? Let's give him an opportunity to ask it again, because it was a complicated question. So if  we didn't answer it, ask it again. Operator : Your next question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi. Your line is open. Michael Bilerman : It's Michael Bilerman here with Manny. I was wondering if you can address a little bit on the capital deployment of what you've changed and you know, looking at the press release, you've brought down your acquisition volumes, both building as well as land by a billion and a quarter. And commensurately, you've got down your disposition volumes as well and you've obviously made a big cut to the development side in terms of starts, which obviously had capital commitments out in the future. And I want to know two things, one, why not take advantage of the marketplace and continue to sell and build liquidities and continue to reshape the portfolio, which you\u2019ve done in a number of years to improve its quality and location? So why not sell more? And then the second part is on the development side where you've taken a much more conservative approach and ramped down your development. What are you seeing from the industry at large in terms of development? So two separate sort of topics somewhat connected, if you can address that that would be great. Thomas Olinger : We are chickens and chickens live longer. I mean, when the world is going or falling off the cliff and everybody's talking about GDP going down 40% this quarter or whatever. We had some spec developments, we can try them anytime, they\u2019re entitled they're ready to go. And if we see the demand, we'll start them two months later. We're not saying that that's our forecast. We're saying every quarter we've got to get in front of you guys and give you some assessment of what we think is going to happen. And this is a very turbulent time. I think the fact that we've even put out a guidance and by the way, we don't have an advantage of looking at all the other people and figuring out what they're doing to sort of tailor our message accordingly. We're going back first and we got to stick our neck out. And we have and we've given a range. But we have taken a conservative approach, saying that we're not going to deploy any new capital on discretionary starts of speculative projects, and we're not going to buy anything at yesterday's prices. If prices become different, for sure we're going to use our resources. We have over $10 billion, $11 billion of capacity between the funds and the balance sheet, and we will certainly start those developments once there is leasing that we feel really comfortable about going forward. But we can't predict that, there is no cost to waiting, there's only upside in waiting. So we've covered the downside. We're still well positioned for the upside. And it's not intended to be a forecast. It's just a prudent thing to do. And I hope we're wrong about that and we'll do closer to what we have planned on doing before. But we're not going to get over our skis. Operator : Your next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Your line is open. Jamie Feldman : I get something along the same lines just a quick follow up and then a question. One is, if you could just talk about when you see occupancy bottoming in the portfolio? I know you guys said kind of towards year end things improved. But I'm curious more detailed how you see things through, what the trajectory is for occupancy? And then bigger picture as we think about potential cracks, obviously, there's a lot it cracks. But are you seeing distress among competitors or just versus prior downturns that you've seen? Where do you think, where's the most risk that maybe people aren't thinking about? Eugene Reilly : Yes, I think we will get a significant increase in occupancy the quarter or the quarter after the vaccine is likely available, maybe even when it's announced and it's definite that it's coming, based on the anticipation of it coming. So you tell me again the date and I'll tell you when that will be. From everything I hear, it's going to be more like next summer-ish, although, there's some really positive developments that I've been hearing about from the scientific community. I mean, we've got a couple of really big medical centers here and I'm in constant dialog with them. And on the therapeutic side, there's some really good stuff happening that we may even hear about in the August, September timeframe. So I think that's when the occupancies will turn around. In terms of the cracks, I would say as I guess Warren Buffett says we'll find out who's been swimming naked as the tide recedes. There are some people that have been, mostly on the private side, by the way, I'm pretty proud of my public brethren by enlarge they've really behaved well throughout the cycle. And I think everybody's kind of pretty disciplined in the sector. But there are a couple of private players, particularly in parts of Europe, Central and Eastern Europe being good example that have really gotten out there on their skis and we'll see what happens. Maybe they're really good skiers. But I would say of all the cycles I've seen, whether it's the \u201887 collapse or the SNL crisis or dot com or the GSV, I would say there is less of that around much, less of that around than any one of those cycles. I think we are over our time allotment, and we've taken way too much of your time this quarter with two calls. So let me thank you for your interest in the company and invite you to our next quarterly call. And hopefully, we'll all be much more optimistic than we are in this environment. And everyone stay healthy. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Also note, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tracy Ward. Tracy, you may begin. Tracy Ward : Thanks, Jason, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings. Additionally, our second quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures. And in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. This morning, we'll hear from Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover results, real-time market conditions and guidance. Hamid Moghadam, Gary Anderson, Chris Caton, Mike Curless, Ed Nekritz, Gene Reilly and Colleen McKeown are also with us today. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. And Tom, will you please begin? Thomas Olinger : Thanks, Tracy. And thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We hope you and yours are all well. The second quarter played out better than our expectations in terms of both our results for the period and outlook for 2020 and beyond. Leasing activity in our portfolio, market fundamentals, valuations and rent collections are all trending favorably. Starting with results, core FFO for the second quarter was $1.11 a share, which included $0.23 of net promote income. Core FFO, excluding promotes, came in above our forecast due to higher NOI and higher strategic capital revenues. The increase in NOI was driven by lower bad debt and higher occupancy. For comparison, the quarterly results were in line with our initial 2020 guidance that we provided back in January. Overall, rent collection trends are excellent. And as of yesterday, we've collected 98% and 92.1% of June [Technical Difficulty]. We've seen the pace of rent receipts accelerate each month since March, with collections ahead of 2019 levels for each month as well. As a result, our bad debt provision for the second quarter was 58 basis points of rental revenues versus our forecast of 160 basis points. Our share of cash same-store NOI growth was 2.9%, which included a 42 basis point negative impact from bad debt. Turning to leasing and customer activity, segments benefiting [Technical Difficulty] economy remain very strong and continue to represent about 60% of our customer base. Leasing in the quarter by industry was well diversified, including from non-essential industries. E-commerce normalized to 24% of new leases. You'll recall from the first quarter, that number was 40% in the early days of COVID. Negatively impacted segments include restaurants, hospitality, oil and gas and conventions. These segments represent just 1.7% of our annual rent. Over the last 30 days in our operating portfolio, we've signed leases amounting to [60.3] [ph] million square feet, up 24% year-over-year. Lease proposals have risen 21% year-over-year and lease gestation has declined by 14 days to 44 days. Market fundamentals were stronger than we expected in the quarter and we are now forecasting the following for the US in 2020. Completion to total 250 million square feet, a 4% year-over-year decline, net absorption to total 160 million square feet, a 60% increase from our April view but down 40% year-over-year and year-end vacancy of 5%. Our forecast for year-end vacancy rates in Europe and Japan have also improved now at 4.5% and 2%, respectively. Strong leasing activity in the quarter has moved the following markets off of our watchlist; Central PA, Phoenix bulk, Atlanta bulk and Guadalajara. Our watchlist includes Houston, West China, Spain and Poland, which moved back into the list this quarter due to extremely undisciplined spec development by one private developer in that country. For strategic capital, the promote for USLF came in above our guidance, as Q2 valuations were higher than our forecast. Investor demand for our private funds remains very strong. Year-to-date, we've raised more than $2.2 billion of equity, approximately 17% ahead of our pace in 2019, which was a record year. Our open-ended funds currently have equity cues totaling $1.8 billion, with an incremental $1.4 billion in due diligence. In Q2, a $448 million secondary trade in our health fund was made with nine investors at a slight premium to NAV, and $421 million will be redeemed in our USLF fund in July. Post these transactions, redemption cues for our open-ended funds will total just $10 million. Looking to the balance sheet, we continue to maintain exceptional financial strength with liquidity of $4.6 billion in combined leverage capacity between Prologis and our open-ended vehicles at levels in line with current ratings, totaling over $13 billion. Turning to guidance for 2020. Our outlook has improved from last quarter, given what we see in our proprietary data, our customer dialogue and the pace of rent collections. While there may be some headwinds in the back half of the year related to the timing and nature of economies reopening, we believe that our revised guidance range has taken those factors into account. Here are the key components of our guidance on an our share basis. We are raising the midpoint by 50 basis points and narrowing the range of our cash same-store guidance to between 2.5% and 3.5%. This assumes a reduction of bad debt by 50 basis points with a range between 60 basis points and 90 basis points of gross revenues. This means at the midpoint we're forecasting to reserve about 110 basis points of bad debt in the second half of the year. To date, we've granted rent deferrals of 48 basis points of annual rental revenues and continue to expect that grants for the full year will be less than 90 basis points. We are increasing our expected average occupancy midpoint by 25 basis points and narrowing the range to between 95% and 95.5%. Occupancy was slipped slightly in the second half, so not as much as we guided to in April and end the year at a very healthy level. Globally, net effective rents declined by 1.4% in the quarter as a result of higher concessions, essentially giving back the growth from the first quarter. Looking forward, we expect rents to be roughly flat for the back half of the year. Our in-place-to-market rent spread now stands at 13% and represents future growth potential of over $450 million of annual NOI. We expect rent change on rollovers to be more than 20% in the second half of the year. For strategic capital, we expect revenue, excluding promotes, to increase by $15 million relative to our prior guidance, and now range between $360 million and $370 million. We're increasing our net promote income for the full year to $0.20 per share and we do not expect to earn any material promote revenue in the back half of the year. As a reminder, there will be a timing mismatch in the second half of the year, as we will recognize promote expenses of about $0.03 per share. We are forecasting a G&A range of $265 million to $275 million, down $5 million from our prior forecast. Our outlook for capital deployment has improved significantly since April, and we now expect to start $100 million of new spec in the second half. Our revised starts range is $800 million to $1.2 billion for the full year, with build-to-suits comprising 65% of this volume. In addition to this range, we plan to resume construction on $150 million of projects that were previously suspended. We are currently negotiating leases on roughly 40% of the TEI of these suspended projects. At the midpoint, we're increasing acquisitions by $100 million, contributions by $150 million and dispositions by $400 million. We are now projecting net uses of capital to be $100 million at the midpoint. Taking these assumptions into account, we're increasing our 2020 core FFO midpoint by $0.125 and narrowing the range to $3.70 per share to $3.75 per share, including $0.20 of net promote income. This compares to our original guidance midpoint at the beginning of the year of $3.71 a share. Year-over-year growth at the midpoint, excluding promotes of sector-leading at over 12.5%, while keeping leverage flat. Our three-year CAGR has been 10.5%, outperforming the other logistics REITs by more than 500 basis points annually. We continue to maintain significant dividend coverage of 1.6 times, and our 2020 guidance implies a payout ratio in the mid-60% range and free cash flow after dividends of $1 billion. Looking forward, the long-term growth outlook of our business has strengthened. Our investments in data and technology provide us with the tools to identify pockets of risk and opportunity within our markets and portfolio, a significant competitive advantage. I want to repeat some comments at the beginning because I'm not sure my sound was coming through. So, I just want to repeat our results for the quarter. Core FFO for the second quarter was a $0.11 a share, which included $0.23 of promote income. Core FFO, excluding promotes, came in above our forecast due to higher NOI and higher strategic capital revenues. The increase in NOI was driven by lower bad debt and higher occupancy. For comparison, the quarter results were in line with our initial 2020 guidance that we provided back in January. Overall, rent collection trends are excellent and as of yesterday, we have collected 98% and 92.1% of our June and July rents, respectively. We have seen the pace of rent receipts accelerate each month since March, with collections ahead of 2019 levels for each month as well. As a result, our bad debt provision for the second quarter was 58 basis points of rental revenues versus our forecast of 150 -- 160 basis points. Our share of cash same-store NOI growth was 2.9%, which included a 42 basis point negative impact from bad debt. Turning to leasing and customer activity segments benefiting from COVID economy remain very strong and continue to represent about 60% of our customer base. Leasing in the quarter by industry was well diversified, including from non-essential industries. E-commerce normalized at 24% of new leases. You'll recall from the first quarter, that number was 40% in the early days of COVID. So with that, I'll turn it over to Jason for your questions Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Good morning, Tom. Thanks for repeating some of that. I just wanted to circle back on just kind of the leasing activity. I know in the supplemental, you guys provide leases commenced and not leases actually signed in the quarter. Is there any -- and you did provide a little bit about the leasing activity in the last 30 days. But could you maybe just help us the actual leasing activity in perspective in Q2? How much of that was impacted and how does that maybe change month to month to get to that [16] [ph] million square foot number for the last 30 days? And then could you just also comment on the drop in occupancy in Asia? Thanks. Thomas Olinger : Okay. I'll start with that. So from a leasing perspective, we certainly saw leasing activity picked up materially in June. June was a very high month. And as I mentioned in the last 30 days, we've certainly seen our leasing accelerate. As it relates to occupancy in Asia, it's related primarily to China and small spaces under 100,000 square feet. Operator : Your next question is -- my apologies. Go ahead. Thomas Olinger : Next question, please. Operator : Okay. Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Craig Mailman : Hey guys. Just a quick question on kind of what activity you're seeing big box or small box. I know there were some concern earlier post COVID. Just curious, I know you guys took Phoenix and Atlanta big bulk off. I mean, are you guys seeing better activity across the board or is it still kind of primarily in some of the bigger spaces? Eugene Reilly : Yeah, this is Gene. I'll take that one. We are certainly seeing better activity with bigger spaces and that is where the -- has led to taking those markets off the list. And conversely, small spaces have struggled. We see more softness in this category. And this is -- these are segments that we're focused on. But having said that, our property quality is excellent in those segments and we'll expect recovery. But right now, you certainly see better activity in the bulk spaces. Thomas Olinger : Okay. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust. Your line is open. Ki Bin Kim : So a couple of questions. The higher leasing proposals that you've seen over the past 30 days, I think you said 21% higher. I'm just trying to get a sense of, is that mostly renewal activity for expansionary space? And second question, when you mentioned all the positive leasing stats and you obviously increased your guidance for same-store NOI and build-to-suit activity. But if there are one or two things that you really looked at to give you confidence midway through the year to increase guidance, how much of it was based on customer feedback and the confidence your corporate customers are seeing versus hard metrics like leasing stats? Thomas Olinger : Yes. Let me -- let me start by answering that question. Obviously, we're having some difficulties here with our conference operator. Yeah, the activity accelerated obviously in the month of June and it's pretty broad based. And I think, for the best indication of that, you can look at our build-to-suit volume because it's up substantially in terms of percentage and absolute amount. And that tells you something about the scarcity of space out there because that's what people will have to turn to get their spacing needs met. So Mike, do you want to -- you want to elaborate on that somewhat? Mike Curless : Yeah. We're seeing broad-based activity, everybody. If you believed all the hype you saw there, you would think it's all Amazon. But Amazon clearly is ramping up their activity, but we're seeing definite broad-based activity across a lot of sectors. Home improvements picked up. Appliance business is strong and actually seen quite a bit of activity from the food crowd on our build-to-suit list. Then you got to remember is there's been plenty of structural rollouts that were announced and well underway pre-COVID. And so it's not just Amazon. They are a big part of it, but look, for a lot of broad-based demand and keep that build-to-suit list strong. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Your line is open. Sumit Sharma : Hi. This is Sumit here for Nick. Just a quick question actually, following up on the build-to-suit. So there was, I think 100% of the pipeline this quarter was build-to-suit with a 48% margin. What's so special about these development spec that they are so accretive to the margin and there is such a wide spread between the development cap rate and the stabilized sort of market cap rate that would one -- one would anticipate? And secondly, as a follow-up, just thinking about promotes. I know that fourth quarter has something coming up from Brazil, a core fund in Europe and the USLV. So, what's driving the lower expectations on promote income for those? Mike Curless : Sumit, it's Mike. I'll hit the first one on the higher than normal build-to-suit margins. You're looking at a small sample that said, there are a couple of deals there that were more of the parking lot, leased parking lot flavor. And those tend to be very well located, have relatively low incremental investments, paired up with strong rents. Therefore, you see really strong margins, but I would look for those margins to blend in well over the year and normalized to the overall build-to-suit body of work in the mid 20s. Tom, you want to deal with the other one? Thomas Olinger : Yeah. Sumit, on your second question on promotes in the second half, it's going to be lower, really small because the promotes are effectively just based on development. There is very little AUM in those funds. That is promote eligible in the second half. And remember, we've got $0.03 of promote expenses that will also will be incurring in the second half of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Derek Johnston : Hi, everybody. Thank you. Has COVID induced e-commerce acceleration pulled demand forward in your view? And secondly, where are we in the shifting secular landscape? Does it feel like we're mid to early late innings? Just would love your take. Thanks. Hamid Moghadam : Yeah, I think this is more like the Borg-McEnroe match back in the late '70s. We don't know how many innings are in this game. We keep going into overtime. And I think we're very early in the rollout of e-commerce. E-commerce started the year in the low teens in the US. The numbers vary in different places. And there is no telling how far it can go. If it goes to 20% to 25%, which is where it was at the beginning early stages of COVID or stabilizes higher than that, this could be very, very early in the e-commerce rollout. And initially, obviously, we've had a clear market leader, which is Amazon in excess of 40% of the total volume, but we are seeing breadth in terms of different e-tailers that are now growing their businesses and have founded their footing. So, I think we're in very early stages and as you know, e-commerce has a sort of a supercharged effect on logistics' demand. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman from Citigroup. Your line is open. Manny Korchman : Hi, everyone. There's been, I guess, a rebounding concern in supply coming up. So two questions related to that. One, what are you seeing in terms of our conversion of use, whether that be retail properties or maybe even office properties and some anecdotal stuff that we've seen? And secondly, are all developers being of this point of view and trying to keep their build-to-suit volumes high and their spec volumes lower? Are we running the risk that we're going to see a lot more spec not from Prologis, but from your competitors or peers? Eugene Reilly : Yeah. Let me take the second part of that first. The places that we see undisciplined development are few. Poland is clearly one and I would say Houston is seeing more buildings than they should. I mean there's more product coming online in Houston than the demand warrants. But generally, I would not say there is an older building problem or anywhere near it. And if you look at the numbers that I think Tom talked about at 250 million square feet, that's about the normal run rate for construction. And it's actually a little bit down from our forecast at the beginning of the year. So, I think this year demand will fall short of that level of construction, but it's not because the supply is excessive. It's because demand temporarily will take a dip. And in my view, we'll accelerate as we come out of this thing because of the growing percentage of e-commerce and also the need to carry more inventories. With respect to the first part of your question, could you ask that again because I'm kind of a little unclear about it, oh, conversions, conversions. Look, there is a lot of talk about it and I think in time, you will see conversion, particularly of retail. And -- but there are obstacles and we should talk about those obstacles. Number one, a box in the middle of the shopping center is subject to all kinds of reciprocal easement agreements, and it's not really easy to go back and just redevelop one box. Obviously, those boxes are in the right locations because they are in the middle of dense populations and high levels of income. So the locations are good, but there are internal dynamics that make it difficult to do that. So you have to respect the REAs and all the other arrangements. Also zoning is an issue because you need to convert from retail to industrial zoning and that takes longer than you can imagine because neighborhoods don't want trucks and traffic there. And finally, there is an economic issue where these retail boxes are in somebody's books for several hundred dollars of square foot, and you need a number much lower than that to make sense for logistics because you need to also spend money to convert them to logistics uses. It's not like that they're set up that way. So, I think in time, you'll see more and more of this kind of development, but it's not a surge. And I think we are involved in a number of them, but it's tougher and it takes longer than you can imagine. The stuff that you hear about hotel rooms or offices being temporarily used for logistics, we've seen that before during the holiday season when things get really crazy. But those are really for last touch distribution purposes. They're not really permanent space because economically, they're not viable for long-term logistics use. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks for taking the question. Just two questions. One, could you give a bit more color on kind of how market rent growth may have trended month over that -- over the last few months and particularly in the US versus global? And then second, if you can give us a little bit more color on kind of utilization of the cost of capital that you now have, which -- there may have been questions few months ago, but today it's pretty robust. So I'm just wondering, can you give us a little bit more color between utilizing that for development acquisitions and maybe even M&A? Hamid Moghadam : Yeah. Thank you, Vikram. So two questions. With respect to market rents in the US, I think the best way to think about them is that we are basically on the same track were before, but with a pause and interruption. In other words, I would say in this era of COVID, the growth hasn't continued. I believe they will flatten for the balance of this year just like our guidance suggests. And then we'll pick up on the path of growth. And the reason I believe that is because there has never been a cycle growing into it or going into it. We've had high occupancies, vacancy being under 5%, and also very high utilization rate in the mid 80s. And there is no sign that those numbers are in anyway deteriorating. So, I think the market continues to be strong and I think it will be back on a trajectory of rental growth, not too dissimilar with -- from what we were projecting at beginning of the year. With respect to use of capital, I continue to believe that there is relatively little differentiation between different companies. So M&A is usually pretty tough. I mean, we've done it successfully in a couple of instances, but increasingly the targets are less and less compatible with our portfolio in terms of quality. And also, there is a pretty -- the companies are trading right on top of each other in terms of multiples. Don't ask me to explain that because the growth rates, at least, historically been substantially different. But I don't make the market react to it. The place that is always the best use of capital for us is building out our land bank because we already have the land and the incremental returns on capital are the most attractive, particularly with the kind of margins that we were talking about earlier and Mike referred to now. That's a pretty disciplined business. You can't do an infinite amount of that kind of development, but that's the first place we would go to. On straight acquisition of assets, look, I'd just like to -- I said last quarter, I don't think pricing of logistics real estate is going to soften. In fact, I think cap rates are going to compress because there is a lot of capital that's placed to go into real estate and obviously, there are sectors that are not going to attract their fair share capital like they did before. So that capital is piling in the few sectors that are performing well. So, I think the best use of capital is building out our land bank. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. John Kim : Thank you. You talked about leasing volume being healthy, sounds like it's picking up. But you also discussed the dip in occupancy in the second half of the year. Is this an indication that you're looking to push rents over occupancy? Is it greater downtime from bad debt expense or this -- or are there other factors that contribute to this? Eugene Reilly : Yeah, John. It's Gene. I'll take that one. I wouldn't -- I wouldn't draw a conclusion from the next two quarters forecast on our optimism about the demand. Demand has been good. As we mentioned at the outset and have, about 60% of our portfolio, customers are expanding, but some are shrinking. So it's a balanced view for the rest of the year. And the reality is that until we come out of COVID and we see economies reopening, we won't have complete clarity. So, I would actually point to later in the year 2021, we're going to come out of this. And I think as Hamid said a few moments ago, I think you'll see a continuation of the rent growth. But until there is clarity on reopening, there has to be -- you have to have a balanced view. Hamid Moghadam : Yeah. And the only other thing I would add to that is at the beginning of the year, we're forecasting essentially 260 million feet of demand and supply, and now we're projecting 250 million feet of demand and -- sorry, supply, and 160 million square feet of demand, which is down from our original forecast. So if you forecast 90 million square feet of demand, obviously, you have to go along with a pause in rental growth. So that sort of outlook is consistent both between demand and the rental picture that goes along with it. But when we come out of this thing, I think for reasons we've described before, namely an increase in inventory generally 5% to 10% and also the stabilizing share of e-commerce of the higher level than before will actually lead to a surge in demand, which will make up, in my view, more than the 90 million feet we lost or we project to lose this year. But nobody knows, I mean, these are all our best guesses. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jon Petersen from Jefferies. Your line is open. Jon Petersen : Great. Thank you. Good quarter, guys. I was -- first of all, hoping you could update us on how IPT and LPT are doing versus underwriting. But then also was curious with both those transactions, it greatly increased your exposure to the US. How are you thinking right now considering international markets seem to be getting back on their feet quicker than the US on exposure to the US versus exposure to international markets? Hamid Moghadam : Yeah. International is a big spectrum. And on one side of it, you have places like Poland, which is suffering from overbuilding. You have Spain, which has weakened demand and then you have places on the other end of the spectrum that you would never get. Tokyo is under 1% vacancy. Osaka where the vacancy was in the teens is now in the 5% range, and we're leasing up pretty much everything we are building ahead of schedule. So obviously, there is a wide variety overseas. But if you sort of throw all of the overseas markets together, I would say generally, they are a tad slower than the US, but not materially so. And Gene may have more granular comments on that, but very consistent actually in terms of -- in terms of market strength. Eugene Reilly : Yeah. And you asked Jon about underwriting -- and we're actually a little bit ahead of underwriting on both of those portfolios, even through then what we've seen in the last few months. And we'll revisit that at the end of the year. But things are looking good. Obviously, for Liberty, the Houston exposure is going to be challenging for a bit. But on the other hand, Pennsylvania portfolio, which is the biggest piece of it, has actually done quite well, leading us, by the way, to bring Central Pennsylvania [indiscernible] a lot to us, so a little bit ahead of plan so far. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman from Bank of America. Your line is open. Jamie Feldman : Great. Thank you. I was hoping to get your thoughts on two points. Number one is, I know you mentioned what the -- this year's development pipeline looks like or deliveries look like. Can you give some color on what things look like heading into '21, given that there was this pullback in starts? And then also just given that you did increase guidance, just thinking about the lingering risks ahead, whether it's the election, PPP subsidies burning off, cases rising in other markets. Like what gave you comfort to get more positive here even though there are some things lingering out there? Hamid Moghadam : Customer behavior in short. Jamie, Gene is going to give you the real answer, but the short answer is customer behavior. We don't make the market. We just observe what happens on a real-time basis. But, Gene, go ahead and talk about the details. Eugene Reilly : Yeah. I mean, specifically, Jamie, we're adding sort of a net of $250 million of spec to the plan. We're still way below the January forecast, and those are like 15 projects in 15 different markets. So, there are bets that are being placed based on the customer demand in those markets. And I wouldn't be surprised if that number increases. You also asked about what happens going into 2021. I think we'll wait to see what happens before we talk about 2021, but we obviously have a much more confident view on building spec today than we did in April. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers from Baird. Your line is open. Dave Rodgers : Yeah. Good morning out there. And just -- was thinking about your portfolio as you've moved more infill with respect to maybe service-oriented customers versus distribution-oriented customers. Wanted to kind of think about how those conversations are going with those customers and are you guys still targeting rents from the end of the year and they're accepting that? Is there a big differential between what they're anticipating in rents and what you are? So that's the first question. The second is just for cap rate compression, do we need to get past the point of increasing vacancies? Do we need to see rents grow again before we see that materially happen? Or is the debt side of the equation enough to make that happen? Thank you. Hamid Moghadam : Dave, let me just start, and Gene will give you more details. On cap rate compression, we are already seeing it, particularly in Europe. And there is plenty of transaction evidence that those cap rates are holding and in some cases declining. And by the way that's in sync generally with our valuations that have been held flat and remember valuations are backwards looking. I mean if they were -- if they had the evidence of the last month of transactions, I think those values would be up. With respect to distribution of space, as we've said many times, Prologis operates in all four categories of space, whether it's last touch, all the way to gateway cities, the larger spaces in major markets. And that distribution is pretty balanced. And in fact, we have a paper out there that's not too out of date, that shows exactly what our portion is in each category. So, we haven't really materially changed our allocation to different markets. It's just that we get more questions about the last such markets these days than we did before. The old -- and this strategy was very much large markets than infill locations. So, that's where that portion of the portfolio in general is coming from, which is getting a lot of attention these days. Gene, do you want to elaborate on that? Eugene Reilly : Yeah. The only thing I'd add is, you asked specifically about rent growth in infill locations. And to date, we have certainly seen much more, much higher rent growth in these locations. And as you can imagine, there is a bit of market pricing discovery going on because these are submarkets that generally are immature for this kind of use and the product types basically span a huge range. But so far those -- the growth in rents has actually surprised us to the upside. Hamid Moghadam : One other thought that I will just join there, you've heard us talk about this many times, but logistics rents are only 2% to 5%, call it or give it a wide range of total logistic costs and the rest being made by labor and transportation. So really the ability to pay for the customer is not the issue because even if they paid 20% more rent on an item that's 4% of their total logistics costs, that's 80 basis points more in costs. So that's not what drives it. What drives really rental growth is how anxious is your best next competitor in terms of dropping out rents. That's what determines this, not the customers' ability to pay rent. And generally speaking, when you're operating at around 5% vacancy, which is where we are, there aren't that many competing spaces around. So, we continue to do -- we continue to have pricing power generally in most markets. Obviously, the Houston's of the worlds are different. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Blaine Heck : Great. Thanks. Good morning out there. So just a couple of questions here on rent collections and same-store. I think you gave rent collection figures for June that might be excluding deferred rents. If that's the case, can you give us the June and second quarter collection numbers based on the cash that's come in relative to kind of your pre-COVID billing expectations? And then secondly, you guys have reported strong rent collection results relative to a lot of REITs out there. But it just seems to me like the amount of uncollected cash rents, it's still a pretty tangible headwind then for you guys to still post 3% cash same-store in the face of that headwind is very impressive, frankly. So maybe you can reconcile how cash same-store can be 2.9% with even a few percentage points of uncollected cash rents. That would be really helpful. Thomas Olinger : Okay, Blaine. So on the rent collection, as I'll restate, so in June, we collected 98%. In July, we collected 92.1%. We deferred about 195 basis points of rent in June and about 70 basis points of rent in July. So that rents not due. So it's not in those numbers of those collections numbers. Now our collections, as I stated, are doing extremely well. We're ahead of last year since March. Every month, we're ahead of schedule. Now, we believe we are going to collect all the cash with the exception of what we think we've covered in a bad debt reserve. So, we've assessed. We've gone through -- we've assessed industries, we've assessed space sizes. We've looked at all the different metrics. We've looked at individual customers across our portfolio and we feel really good about that bad debt range of 60 basis points to 90 basis points. Now it's lower than we had projected in April, for sure, meaningfully lower, but it's because of the collections are so strong. And if -- I would anchor back also to the fact that our bad debt history on average is about 20 basis points. If you go back 14 years, 15 years, we've averaged 20 basis points of bad debt. Now, our high was 56 basis points in the GFC, and that's kind of what we saw here in Q2. So, I think we've got the second half bad debt adequately covered in the range probably and then some. And I feel good about getting the rest of this cash in the door. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll from RBC. Your line is open. Michael Carroll : Yeah. Thanks. Gene, I wanted to dig in a bit -- individual market trends that you highlighted. Can you provide some color on what drove the improvement in Central PA? Is it just better demand? And then also with the issues that you're seeing in Houston, is that simply just supply in a weak energy market? And are developers slowing down construction activities? So it's just going to take time to absorb that space or are these longer-term issues that we have to deal with? Eugene Reilly : Yeah. So in Pennsylvania, it's all leasing. So the improvement is related to leasing. In Houston, you have obviously two headwinds in demand. You've got energy pricing as well as COVID. And you have a huge amount of construction in progress at the beginning of this year. Now, some of that was suspended. But frankly, the vast majority was not. So, you're going to have an overhang of space in Houston easily going into next year some time, because there's just so much supply. In terms of developers being disciplined or not, I think, frankly, the jury is out on that. Right now, things appear to be disciplined. But I would have hoped frankly that we would have seen more projects stopped. We didn't see that. So I think we -- I think we need to monitor that aspect of it, but unfortunately in Houston, you have a supply issue as well as the demand issue. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel from Green Street Advisors. Your line is open. Eric Frankel : Thank you. Just to talk about e-commerce again. Obviously, Amazon has been quite active. And Mike, you commented on some of the longer, longstanding supply chain reconfiguration efforts by home improvement -- home improvement companies, appliance companies, food and beverage. Could you talk about how some of the big box retailers are adjusting to because they obviously had a huge surge in e-commerce sales. I'm just curious if they've adjusted there or they looking to adjust their warehouse footprints at all? Mike Curless : Yes, Eric. Thank you. We are seeing activity from those retailers, not at the pace we're seeing from the traditional e-commerce, but we certainly have on our prospect list some household names that you would consider in the retail business that are looking to shift from brick and mortar and to more warehouse to consumer shipments. So, we're definitely seeing an uptick in that segment. Hamid Moghadam : Yeah. Home improvement and grocery sectors are particularly strong. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tom Catherwood from BTIG. Your line is open. Tom Catherwood : Thank you and good morning. I just wanted to actually follow on Eric's question about retail and specifically from the bricks and mortar side. Since 2011, obviously, you've reduced your exposure to lower growth industries. But I assume no one is immune to the pain that's happening in brick and mortar retail. So first off, I know it's a small number, but can you remind us what your exposure is to brick and mortar retailers, especially on the apparel side? And then second, is there a risk that challengers could show up for some of your other tenants like 3PLs that have retail exposure of their own, almost like shadow retail exposure for Prologis? Chris Caton : Hey. This is Chris. Thanks for the question. So first, as it relates to apparel specifically, that is roughly 7% of our customer base and there is going to be both native e-commerce and traditional brick and mortar retailers in there. So, you're going to have a diversity. Our approach, our analysis looks through the organization. So whether it's a retailer, whether it's a 3PL, so we think through that exposure just like you described in. So the way we've been talking about it for the whole decade has been consistent with how you're thinking about risk. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Mike Mueller : Yeah. Hi. Are there any changes to the lease durations for the bumps that you've been getting in recent leasing activity? Hamid Moghadam : Not materially. Mike, not materially. Right before this thing, the lease durations had extended, probably the longest we've seen in about a decade. But -- and basically leases that are of term has stayed about the same level of duration. While we have higher month-to-month leases and that is pretty typical of what happens in this part of the cycle where normally somebody who's business was growing may be coming out of a smaller space going to the bigger space or going the other way frankly. But moving is expensive and committing to a new space is expensive. So, sometimes the best solution is just to basically pay overage rent and kick it out couple of months. So, we have a higher percentage of leases under one year. But the ones that go longer than a year are about the same profile as they were before. And with respect to escalation structures, pretty much consistent with before, slightly more free rent on the front end, which is how the effective rent comes down. I think Tom mentioned that the effective rents were down 1.7%. Face rents haven't changed all that much in most markets. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Your line is open. Sumit Sharma : Hi, guys. Sumit here again. Thank you for taking my question again. So Walmart is closed on Thanksgiving, and that goes to assume that they are expecting more online sales traffic. Layering in Prologis' US portfolio and thinking about it from a infill perspective, how does that manifest in terms of increased rent growth for those properties? What I'm thinking of is not your properties off of Tracy or Exit 8 New York City, but more kind of stuff that you have in, let's say, the Meadowlands in New York City or Bronx. When you're underwriting these properties, what's the sort of rent growth you're putting in today? And how does situations on the grounds like what we are hearing with Walmart and other retailers change your view? Hamid Moghadam : The thing I would say about Walmart specifically is that, obviously, we had them in one property in the Bronx. And as you probably have read in the headlines, they no longer needed that property because of what you described and we were able to re-lease it with no interruption to another major e-commerce player at actually very attractive economics. So that's the only direct impact that I can see from Walmart if your question is specific to Walmart. And they didn't have much of a presence in the New York area anyway too, for it to be a headwind. So, they were just really getting started. They had tried for many years to get into that market, but it had proven to be a difficult market to get into. And it appeared for a while that e-commerce was the way they were going to come into the market and apparently, they've changed their mind. I don't know if your question was broader than Walmart. But that's the story with Walmart. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman from Citigroup. Your line is open. Michael Bilerman : Hi. It's Michael Bilerman with Manny. Hamid, at the November Investor Day, one of the topics the team has spent a lot of time focused on was trying to have value beyond the real estate and really trying to find solutions to a lot of the supply chain costs that would essentially allow you to be able to garner more rent. So looking at transportation, digital data solutions, looking at labor costs and trying to find opportunities for your tenants to reduce those costs and ergo allow them to pay you more rent. And I think you talked a little bit earlier before about how rent is a smaller part of the overall cost structure. Therefore, if we're able to get benefits from all those other items, we should be allowed to charge more rent. Where do you sort of stand? And have you been able to advance any of these initiatives further, ultimately getting to that, I think it was like a $150 million of potential upside over time as you implemented these things? Hamid Moghadam : Sure, Michael. I'm glad you brought that up because that's a very important part of what we are spending time on. And I'll let Gary give you the real answer. But from my vantage point, our performance there has been mixed. So with respect to the things that are going very well, I would say our LED initiative, our procurement initiatives, our services and our product offerings that go with the use of warehouse are going pretty well and are generally on track. The more aspirational aspects of our product offerings, transportation, IoT, I would say those are too early to have a result. On the labor front, we're actually making really good progress as well. So it's a mixed picture. COVID has also obviously interrupted our ability to market some of those services to our customers. They are frankly focused on other problems right now. But we come up with new products to offer to them in this time, like deep-cleaning services and other things that we rolled out were specifically targeted towards COVID. And so I would say, our enthusiasm for that business is the same or stronger than it was before and I would say materially stronger than before. Our execution of it has been pretty good in some areas and has been interrupted by COVID in some other areas, but we haven't changed our objectives in the medium term on that. Gary, do you want to provide more color there? Gary Anderson : Yeah, just a little bit. Michael, if you remember, we had shown a bull's eye at our Investor Day. And the kind of the bull's eye is the area that we were currently focused. Those are the areas that Hamid was talking about. In that period that we've gotten some pretty good traction. So -- and growing revenues there, it's not huge. [Technical Difficulty] delayed for transportation and IoT and we believe that those are little bit longer term. In [indiscernible], I think we're more optimistic about essentials, then we would leave it at that point. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust. Your line is open. Ki Bin Kim : So if I remember correctly, when you guys bought Liberty and IPT, it was part of the original plan to sell off assets. And you've done a lot of it already, but I believe 2021 was supposed to be a kind of material year for dispositions. Any update to those plans? Hamid Moghadam : Yeah, Ki Bin, if you remember in the last call and actually the call before that, we pushed that back. We are very under deployed right now. Our leverage is under 20%. And so there is no rush whatsoever to sell those properties. If you do a little bit of poking around, you pretty quickly figure out that we've got a pretty significant portfolio from IPT -- from Liberty for sale in the UK. And that one, we are in the process of collecting letters of interest and offers. And I would tell you that demand for that product is triple or quadruple what we expected. And I think we're going to have a very strong execution on that. But on the rest of it, we're not -- we haven't even put out the packages because why do it? We don't need to do it right now and we can adjust a bit. That's very liquid real estate and we can do that anytime and our decision is to push that out until we have more deployment and meet the capital frankly more. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jon Petersen from Jefferies. Your line is open. Jon Petersen : Great. Just a quick one. I know we are top on the hour here. Any chance you guys could break out rent collection between Europe and the US? Asia is smaller, but maybe there too. I'm just curious if there is any material difference between those markets. Hamid Moghadam : Yeah. We actually look at that on a daily basis and, obviously, even more detail than what you just asked. We look at it by country, and we can have the ability to actually drill it down by market. So obviously, we're always focused on collections. But I would say we are a lot more focused on collections in the last four months or five months. And we have very good data on that. I would say there are two countries that stand out as collections being materially lower than elsewhere. And those are France and the UK. And part of it is that the government has gone out there and basically said, you don't have to pay your rents. And so a lot of people are -- and a lot of very healthy companies, I mean, household names are just choosing not to pay the rent for now. But their ultimate collection of those numbers, of those rents are not subject to those regulations. And we believe we'll collect the vast majority of them. But if you take those two markets out, Asia is on the other side, we have no deferrals or no late payments almost or no defaults to speak up in Asia. So if you throw it all in the blend there, the numbers are very comparable between the US. They are within a couple of 100 basis points between the US and the rest of the world. And with the two that I mentioned being the meaningful deviations. I think that was the last question. So, really want to thank you for your participation. Sorry about all the logistical glitches today, but that's the world we live in. And we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Take care. Operator : That concludes today's conference call.

At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Also note, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tracy Ward; Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Tracy, you may begin. Tracy Ward : Thanks Carol, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings. Additionally, our third quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures and in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. This morning, we'll hear from Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover results, real-time market conditions and guidance. Hamid Moghadam, Gary Anderson, Chris Caton, Mike Curless, Ed Nekritz, Gene Reilly and Colleen McKeown are also here with us today. And with that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Tom. Tom, will you please begin? Thomas Olinger : Thanks, Tracy. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call today. Our third quarter results were strong and the team on the ground executed extremely well in this COVID environment, demonstrated by our operating performance and robust capital deployment activity. Our results plus continued improvement in market conditions have upgraded our outlook. Starting with our view of the market, our proprietary data reveals that operating conditions are meaningully better than they were 90 days ago and as a results our earnings are now ahead of pre-COVID levels. The Prologis IBI activity index rebounded sharply to more than 59 in September above our long-term average and up from 50 in June. Space utilization, which is based solely on data source from our customers was 84% at quarter end and indicates that our properties are returning to near key capacity. On a size adjusted basis, signings were up 31% in the third quarter and up 4% year-to-date. Customers continue to make decisions faster than ever of lease gestation less than 50 days. Proposals remain at healthy level up 3% sequentially and up 12% on a year-to-date basis. This positive momentum have led us to raise our market forecast for 2020. In the US, we now estimate net absorption of 210 million square feet and completions of 295 million square feet, each up approximately 50 million square feet from our prior forecast. Net absorption in the quarter was robust at 65 million square feet, pointing a very healthy finish to the year. We've also upgraded our yearend vacancy forecast for Europe and Japan to 4.3% and 1.3% respectively. Notably vacancy in Tokyo reached an all-time low of 50 basis points and rent growing as a result. As we look to space size demand broaden across segments this quarter to include a 100,000 million square feet and above. Spaces under 100,000 square feet in several markets notably the San Francisco Bay Area have lagged the other segment sizes in both occupancy and market rent growth. For customer segments, demand is also broadening and diversifying in our portfolio. E-commerce continues to grow, representing 37% of the new leasing in the quarter, well above its historical average of 21%. The dramatic structural shift to online shopping is generating demand in three ways. First, a wide range of Omni channel and pure online retailers are growing and while Amazon is very active particularly with build-a-suit, they represented just 13% of our new leasing. Second, three 3PLs represented more than a third of new e-commerce leasing in the quarter, a record of customers raise to augment their fulfillment networks and third, many of the parcel carriers are also expanding their networks. Our other segments represented 63% of new leasing the quarter, the most active segment support essential industries including food and beverage, healthcare and consumer products. Another new emerging structural drivers that lead for resilient supply chains and higher inventory levels, the inventory for sales is follow-on to the world [ph] on record and many customers are operating with a razor thin inventories. We see time for restocking process has begun. [indiscernible] our results, we had a strong third-quarter with core FFO per share of $0.97. We outperformed our forecast due to higher NOI, strategic capital revenue and termination fees partially offset by slightly higher G&A. Rent change on rollovers continues to be strong at 25.9% and led by the US at 30.7%. Rent collections remain ahead of 2019 levels. As of this morning we collected over 99% of third quarter rents and over 94% of October. In addition, we received 95% of deferred rents due to date. Net debt is trending lower than forecast and was 43 basis points of rental revenues in the quarter. This was roughly half of what we had forecasted. Our share of cash same-store NOI growth was 2.2% despite the impact of lower debt, occupancy and bad debt. This peaks to the underlying strength of our rent change, the primary driver of same store growth in quarter and the long-term. Looking to the balance sheet, we continue to maintain exceptional financial strength with liquidity and combined leverage capacity between Prologis and our open-ended vehicle, totaling more than $13 billion. We also continue to refinance debt opportunistically setting records in the quarter for the lowest REIT and third lowest US investment grade 10 and third year coupons and history. For strategic capital, investor demand is unabated. Our team rights over $800 million of new equity this quarter and the cues in our open-ended vehicles currently stand at $2.6 billion. Turning to guidance for 2020, our outlook continues to improve given what we see in our proprietary data,, our customer dialogue and lower bad debt. While there may be headwinds until we put forward behind us our revised guidance range has taken that into account. Here are the key components of significant guidance changes on an odd share basis. We're narrowing our cash same-store NOI range between 2.75% and 3.25%. At the midpoint this assume a 25 basis point reduction of bad debt with a new range between 45 basis points and 55 basis points of gross revenues. Globally market rents grew in the quarter and we now expect growth of 2% for the year, approximately 250 basis point ahead of our prior forecast. After prioritizing occupancy for most of the year, we resumed pushing rent in a handful of leading markets including New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Southern California, Dallas and Northern Europe, as well as a few regional markets. On the other hand, we're still striving for occupancy in Houston, Denver, West China and Madrid. Our in-place market rent spread now stands at over 12% and represents future incremental organic NOI growth potential of approximately $450 million annually. For strategic capital, we expect revenue excluding from a range between $380 million to $385 million. The revenue growth of our business has been excellent with a five-year revenue CAGR excluding promotes of over 16%. The vast majority of this revenue is derived from occurring asset management fees from our perpetual or life vehicles. When we look at multiples being ascribed to this business, our view is that they're far too low. The comparison public asset managers are valued at a multiple of more than 20 X on par less 50 AUM with much higher promotes. For development, we expect to start $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter with the full year ranging between $1.6 billion and $2 billion up $800 million from our prior forecast. Build a suites will remain elevated and comprise about 45% of the annual volume. In addition by year-end, we expect to restart about $180 million or approximately half of the development projects we suspended in the first quarter. At the midpoint, we're increasing both contributions and dispositions by $350 million. Based on our third quarter valuation and current market activity, pricing for our properties is now pushing well beyond pre-COVID levels. Taking these assumptions into account, we're narrowing our range and increasing our 2020 core FFO midpoint by $0.045 to $3.76 to $3.78 per share. This includes $0.21 of net promote income which is up a penny from our prior guidance. Year-to-date growth at the midpoint excluding promotes is 13.7% while keeping leverage flat. Interestingly, while there's been a lot of noise over the past seven months since the beginning of the pandemic, [indiscernible] were ahead of our pre-COVID earnings expectations. In clothing our performance is a assessment to the foundation we've been building for more than a decade. Our three-year earnings phase 11% has outperformed the other logistics REITs by more than 500 basis points annually, despite a greater relative decline in leverage. The work that we've done indicates the best-in-class portfolio and balance sheet is clearly paying off. The business is proving to be incredibly resilient and is delivering exceptional growth, which we expect to continue. With that, I'll turn it back to the operator for your question. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Emanual Korchman from Citigroup. Manny Citigroup : Tom, just in terms of collections, they're obviously strong and they continue to be strong but there is a downward trend. Is there any [indiscernible] in those numbers that we should be mindful of or anything that you think might drive a quick recovery there than we're looking for? Thomas Olinger : Manny, collections have been excellent. Actually there's no downward trend. If anything, they're trending up. If you looked at our collections, we're up over 94% this morning and we had a call in Q2 July collections were at 92%. So we're 200 basis points ahead of where we were comparably. We're ahead of 2019 levels across the board and I think collections are actually accelerating a bit from the last quarter, so I am very, very pleased with where collections are. Operator : Our next question comes from Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Derek Johnston : So the lease spreads continue to be robust even as we progress through COVID '19. How do you view the pandemic's impact on the portfolio in terms of rent growth? So when you look at the overall portfolio, do you believe you could've pushed rents harder without the pandemic or has the pandemic perhaps propelled rent growth? And then lastly, do current rent trends have lagged in your opinion? Thank you. Hamid Moghadam : Hi Derek, it's a good question and one that we ask ourselves often, but there is no going back and playing that hand again because when you're looking at -- you're sitting there in March and looking at what could happen, you make certain decisions. I think generally we could have push rents harder have we known how this was going to play out, of course we didn't. I think that its gas in the tank for the next 12 months. So I am pretty optimistic about our ability to continue to grow rents and we turn over 15%, 16% a year. So if we were a quarter or two late on pushing rents by a little bit, by the time you worked through that 15% and a little bit of rent growth change, the numbers become minuscule in terms of what we may have missed, but whatever that was I think is fueled for our future growth. Operator : Our next question comes from John Kim from BMO. Please go ahead. John Kim : This quarter you had sequential occupancy declines of 200 basis points in both Chicago and Houston. I am assuming this is based on new supplies, but just wondering about the case and also other markets we're concerned from both supply sectors. Eugene Reilly : It's Gene. I'll take that and others may pile on. Houston for sure is going to face headwinds. There's a ton of supply in that market and you guys know the story there. Chicago, we feel a little bit better about. Actually that market is fairly strong and elsewhere in the US from a supply perspective, things actually look pretty good. We have seen in this quarter a significant increase in absorption and a corresponding increase in supply in supply during a very low vacancy rates across the board. So we actually feel pretty good and in the US, Houston would be the concern on supply at this point. Operator : Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Jamie Feldman : Thank you. Tom, you talked about $13 billion or so of liquidity. Can you help us understand just think through what if there is any opportunistic acquisitions out there where you might be able to put some of the capital to work over the midterm? Thomas Olinger : I think we're \u2013 the key for us is for opportunity for expand our growth potential and when those things occur, target determined, but we're always ready. We always maintain significant liquidity. So when the time is right, we're ready to go, but we're certainly not seeing large portfolios on the markets these days. The pricing for our product is well above where we were pre-COVID. So there's a lot of interest for product. Operator : Our next question comes from Blaine Heck from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Blaine Heck : Tom, you noted that you guys are assuming parts of a little bit more than $1 billion that your share in the fourth quarter. Can you guys still talk about how much of those are built-a-suite versus spec and whether this is just pent-up demand from clients that didn't want to pull the trigger earlier in the pandemic or what else is kind of driving your confidence to start that much in the fourth quarter? Thomas Olinger : I'll start with that question and I'll kick it over to Mike, but it's probably good to talk about spec development overall and with what our picture looks like. So it's more a reminder we suspended 16 projects in the spring in 18 markets and that was almost $400 million of activity and through last quarter and what we expect in the fourth quarter, we'll restart 10 of those projects and about half of that volume. So we're generally positive on speculative development. And if you look at the next quarter, we will start more spec projects somewhat less than we would've anticipated in January, but it's pretty close to those volumes. So we will be down slightly with respect to spec development during 2020 versus the January forecast. We're actually up significantly with respect to the build-a-suite value. So that's what coming. And Mike you provide some color on that. Mike Curless : Yeah Blane, let me add to that. We saw a really strong Q3 in terms of build-a-suit particular in Europe with six project starts there across a diverse set of customers and our overall prospect list, you heard us say this last time, there is probably a little bit shorter than it\u2019s been in the past, but the prospects on that list are as active and moving as quickly as we've seen in a long time, in fact never seen in a quite at the pace. Of course Amazon is a big part of that, but it's certainly not all of it and there is quite a bit of activity in the structural changes that we announced by the home improvements, the food customers, pre-COVID that they're now acting on at a quicker pace than even anticipated. So we're confident in the diversity of our build-a-suite pipeline and the strength of it. So we're optimistic for the fourth quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from mongooses from Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : This is Sumit [ph] for Nick. Thank you guys for putting together some great research on the retail conversion opportunity. I guess I'm interested if you could share your insights regarding why the free standing retail component that guys you estimated 40 million square feet of conversions or 50 Bps to 150 Bps of your market share. Why is it so little when these are located in more densely traffic routes as well as are more supportive are most supportive parcel sizes. Since you did, I think one of the developments in the Bronx is built over a 2 acre lot which is far less than the 5 acres to 6 acres that is typically required. So shouldn\u2019t this support more conversions across other areas and obviously putting full conversions aside, what drives the convictions that tenants could actually lease up these boxes or other nonperforming shopping centers for smaller delivery operations? Any color, any insights in attendance would be great. Chris Caton : Hey Sumit its Chris Caton. Thanks for the question. First for those who aren\u2019t familiar what you're talking about, moderately talking about Prologis Research published a paper on Prologis.com. We size the retail to logistics trend. We estimated it being 5 million to 10 million square feet per year over the next decade and this amounts to really a small part of our overall business, less than 5% of last touch, less than 1% of its existing logistics real estate facilities for a lot of reasons. So Sumit focused on the freestanding retail, that is in fact the largest category and so that is where we expect to see the most conversion opportunities. Well, if the challenges are many and varied in terms of conversion trends, whether it's physical and the ability simply view the site whether it's economic and land versus development cost and higher and better use opportunity, whether it's local politics or whether it's just the legal situation at the site. Hamid Moghadam : Yeah, the other thing I would add to that is that in freestanding retail by large is more western and southern phenomenon because by definition those cities are less spends and actually that's kind of not where you want to have freestanding and last touch retail you want to have it in dense metro areas and if somebody has got a retail box in that metro area, they're likely to be doing pretty well with retail on it anyway. So it's sort of a catch-22 that places where you can find these boxes are not the places that there is heavy duty last touch that demand. The trick is getting the availability and the demand picture in the same spot. Operator : Our next question comes from Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks for taking the question. Just to build off the question on moving spread, you alluded to the fact that you sort of extended the trajectory into next year. I'm just wondering can you give us your updated thoughts on actual market rent growth and from the key areas in the US, but also maybe in some of the global markets, just wondering if all the factors you laid out as potentially accelerated that trend as well into '21 in terms of actual market growth. Thanks. Hamid Moghadam : Hi Vikram, thanks for the question. So as Tom shared in his remarks, global rent growth is on pace for 2% this year of Prologis share basis, higher than that in the US, roughly flat in Europe and the US and better than that call it 1% in Japan, that's a good number for Japan. What that looks like in 2021, we don't disclose the numbers, but what I do think about other headwinds and tailwinds for our business and to an earlier question, these trends suggest an improving trajectory for rent growth. When I think about the positives for our business, I think about low vacancy in a lot of markets around the world, the structural drivers that Tom outlined in his script are really revealing themselves both e-commerce and inventory levels. We've seen positive momentum in the third quarter and solid proprietary data and there is this potential decline in COVID uncertainty COVID economic weakness. You got to say that against the lack of clarity on COVID and some of the challenges that are intended with the recession that will play out in 2021. Thomas Olinger : Yeah but in terms of implications of rent growth on earnings, I mean basically rent growth globally this year is a little over 2% and probably 2.5% in the US, unless something really strange happens, I expect that number to be pointed up. Now how much up in the last 106 years we've always underestimated rental growth. So I don't know, but the primary driver of earnings growth is going mark-to-market anyway whether on the margin rents growth 3% or 4% or 5%, that incremental amount at least for the next year or two is going to be determined of earnings growth. So I'm not duck to your question. I'm just given that the kind of small changes we're talking about here, I don't think the earnings implications are significant. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Steve Sakwa : Thanks, just a quick question here, Tom, I guess you pretty much raised all the metrics in the press release with the exception of same-store NOI growth, but you took your bad debt expenses down again this quarter. Is the headwind here just some short-term issues on occupancy number one and then I guess it's a late development need to the extent that the e-commerce trend does continue and it looks like it's going to continue to go up towards probably the mid-20s. How long and sustainable do you think the development pipeline can stay over $2 billion, given the -- it seems like the growing demand pipeline you got from not just e-commerce but other categories that Tom mentioned. Thomas Olinger : I'll take the first question. So with capital and cash same-store, it's lot at the midpoint at it's all timing because we have significantly high rates in both the second and third quarter and new leasing was significantly higher and as a result, what you're seeing is free rent from all of those lease commencement really hitting Q4. So that's a little bit of a danger of using cash same-store here is because of that free rent. It's just kind of hitting in Q4. You'll note that that same-store went up 25 basis points another bad debt. So it's really a timing issue from that initial drag on cash same-store. Hamid Moghadam : I think with respect to the legs of e-commerce and the effects on development going forward, I would still say we're in the very early innings of that in the long term and I think as long as we're in COVID, the growth rate in e-commerce is going to be very, very significant, but as we come off of COVID, I expect that could take a little bit of a pause. It still would be at a very elevated level compared to where it was below COVID and it will start growing off of that elevated level. But I think it will pause, because I think a lot of people will just want to get out just somewhat back to normal, but in effect had a reset in the demographics that really have evolving e-commerce because the whole generation of people that before did everything analogs are now using digital. With the exception of wanting to get out in the short term and do some things that they miss filling, but if we could go back and figure out where e-commerce was before COVID and it's likely to grow off of post COVID I would guess there is an 8% or 9% maybe 10% change between those two levels pre and post COVID. So we got one in five maybe seven years of e-commerce penetration that will be sustainable as a result of COVID. Operator : Our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Caitlin Burrows : Just maybe on the customer retention pricing side, customer retention was 73% in the third quarter which is a low expense I think the end of 2018. So could you just about some of the drivers of that, whether tenants impacted by general economic uncertainty, customers moving from our stated results and some pushing price or what are some of the factors of that retention metric were in the third quarter? Thomas Olinger : Let me take a stab at that Caitlin because that's are really interesting question. I think you\u2019ve heard many, many times from different people that this economic recovery is still occasional. There is the world of haves and the world of have-not and relatively literally in the middle compared to most other periods. While both of those things drive [ph] attention now, the companies that are doing really well and expanding their business need more space by definition against same space and lead to secure new space and the companies that are at the bottom of the K are going out of business or doing poorly, so they're going back of their space. So I think as long as you're divulging from the middle for some period in time, you'll see declining retention together with the fact that we're pushing rents more than we were in Q2, certainly Q2 now and that's likely to drive retention downwards, but having said all that as margins in our portfolio if of the billion square feet, once you go through how much of its quarterly turns, which is about 40 million feet one of the few retails can move that percentage around between 70% and 80% pretty significantly. So I don't get that excited quarter-to-quarter. I look at trailing fourth quarters as an indicator and if you look at that, our numbers have been forever, so anchored around 75% and little higher and little lower, but around that average. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Frankel from Green Street. Please go ahead. Eric Frankel : Thank you. Just first, can you comment on China's portfolio? Simply obviously it's more part of your portfolio, there is obviously quite the opposite, it's quite different from the rest of your portfolio? And then second, that values are higher than were in the pre-COVID days, can you comment on the routine valuation between your larger global markets and the regional markets or whether you think there's a big valuation different at this point. Thank you. Hamid Moghadam : Okay. Let me take a stab at both questions and Eugene may have more comments certainly on the second one. China occupancy is concentrated in Western China in Chengdu and [indiscernible] and then you know it shows the operating metrics in a big way but in terms of our share of that way pretty de minimis kind of number. Having said that, the way land allocations work in China is that it opens up they allocated by Thailand and the requirement value that you have to start construction in two years and that obviously does not allow development to be matched with demand fees because you have this sort of worst development starts that they impose on you for giving you that scarce plan. So that happened on a number of projects in Western China that we will had of course to start all at once and that one right into when China shut down and Western China is very auto centric. So the combination of all those things got a bunch of vacancy in Western China. It's about 70% of total spec vacancies in the whole company, but again the impact on our P&L has been relatively small given our interest, but we need to get a belief and we are going through a strategy of actually going for occupancy and be less rent sensitive because leases in China are very short in duration and we're going to get that back and we've seen exactly the same movie in years past in other regions in China. So we're pretty confident that it will not be an issue long-term. With respect to valuation differences, I can't think of a place in the world where valuation has not increased post-COVID. Now maybe there are individuals market-by-market differences, but in terms of US, Canada and Mexico, Brazil, China, Japan, Europe, Europe is probably the number one declining CapEx among the global locations and it has a direct relation to two things. One interest rates are at historic lows and everybody is pretty much concluded that they're going to be lower for longer and secondly the money that was otherwise being allocated to other sectors of real estate like retail and hospitality and office is actually not going there. So everybody has become a logistics aficionado, so a lot of that money. We're sort of seeing people show up that the number we saw before. So there are a lot more players on the device space and I think that's a pretty good thing if you own a billion square feet of this stuff. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Michael Carroll : Can you provide some color on the tenants in those sectors that are currently being negatively impacted by the pandemic? Has Prologis already worked through both of these issues or should we continue to expect higher churn, lower retention over the next how many quarters, several quarters? Hamid Moghadam : I think our retention is going to be between 70% and 80% likely it has been forever and there's always churn in the portfolio and the normal characters are probably concentrated in retailers and big box retailers are being dis-intermediated by e-commerce, but there are some retailers that are doing extremely well. Obviously there are home improvement sectors as Mike mentioned and the groceries and the like are doing pretty well and a lot of the ones that are doing sort of well but not super well are actually taking this opportunity to redo their networks and community lease space because they now realize that e-commerce is not a theoretical threat to them, but they better next time get going on this because what they expected to see happen over five or ten years has happened in the last six months. So I think, I'm not trying to duck your question, but you look at the list of the troubled retailers the Penny's and the [indiscernible] world and all that included the day portfolio, we have two of them that frankly been below my radar screen. They're still de minimis but our teams are very focused on moving and there are frankly many, cases those boxes are at least substantially below market. So we're happy to get them back and it's not an issue we usually look at. Operator : Our next question comes from Brent Thill from UBS. Please go ahead. Brent Thill : You talked a lot about accelerating e-commerce and inventory builds, but could you speak in a bit more detail as to how those trends are developing in each of the global regions where you operate? Hamid Moghadam : I'm not sure what you mean by detail. I think we were pretty early and adamant that its inventory rebuilt. We went out and quantified at 5% to 10% and we gave you a projection of what that would mean in terms of incremental demand and the evident that's come into that time is pointing more to the high end of that range that it puts to the line of that range, that is a general trend, so it's expected more of less to affect our all markets evenly. The general people are carrying more inventory. The cost of carrying inventory is much lower because of the interest rates and the cost of making sales is very high. So people are generally carrying more inventory. With respect to e-commerce, I think they've been pretty specific about the percentages of sales that are going to go through the e-commerce channel and what the implications of that are on demand based on the 3X factor. So I think it can us through facts and apply to historical demand pictures in every market and cost of demand, but I don't think it's would be good for me to try to go through the markets we're in with the prediction that are not going to be correct anyway. Operator : Our next question comes from Jon Petersen from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Jon Petersen : Hoping you guys can maybe talk a little bit about expectations around the election specific maybe just high level if there is anything you're looking for that could impact your portfolio, but more specifically, California is a big market for you guys and Prop 15 would increase property taxes on commercial properties. So curious how we should be thinking about the impacts of that if it does. And there has also been talk about Biden [ph] getting rid of 1031 exchanges and just curious if you have any thoughts on what that would do to evaluations and transaction volumes for the warehouse space? Eugene Reilly : Yeah it's Gene, I'll take the Prop 15 and probably take the other question Tom. So with respect to Prop 15 first of all, we've to see passes, the polling looks right now like it probably won't pass, but if it does, there are a few things to keep in mine. One it's going to take a couple of years for the individual county assessors to respond, mobilize and put it into action. The other thing is relative to Prologis, our average tax vintage is 2012. So we're in relatively better shape than for example local owners and of course this has passed through revenue to customers our real concern is taking care of our customers and we hope this doesn\u2019t pass. It's just another tax in California to these businesses. But bottom line is long-term not a big impact to us. Undeniably, there will be some effect on rent growth, but we got to see if this passes first. And on 1031, Tom will take that. Thomas Olinger : Yeah I'll take that. 1031s are very embedded in real estate transactions. As I think it's been around for almost a 100 years, but I think there is reason why we think clearly manage in fact change does happen, I don't know the probability of that change, but if it does happen, we can manage it extremely well. The first thing is from a sales perspective, we've always thought we're going to be extremely patient. We're very under-levered, but frankly under-deployed a bit. We're getting back to probably Jamie's initial question and so we can be very, very patient on sales. And then the second thing would be our dividend payout ratios in the low 60%, close to 60% this year and we're generating about $1.1 billion of excess cash flow. So what would happen at the 1031 exchange? If eliminated right, our taxable income could go up to the extent we sold assets and capital gaining component of our dividend would increase and that would upward pressure on our dividend, but you can read that significantly well payout ratio and we're generating $1.1 billion free cash flow. So while we utilize it, we can certainly manage around it. Hamid Moghadam : I think the bigger issue have been the two specific things you asked about is that California is becoming increasingly difficult place to do business in and it's not just these two things, but it's all the crazy propositions that are on the ballot this year and if you really want to be entertained you can read the ones that apply to San Francisco that are even funnier. But California better get it back together because otherwise they're going to kill the base and that is a concern for everybody. Having said that, it is the world's largest, the fifth largest economy and continues to be the center of innovation and a lot of adventure in the world. So we model through but sure the politicians they're making it very difficult for this economy to remain competitive. So that's much more concerning than our 1031 specifically at least to me. Operator : Our next question comes from David Rodgers from Baird. Please go ahead. Dave Rodgers : Tom, as we follow up on maybe those earlier comments that you made about the K shape recovery and that lower leg of the K that everyone's trying to figure out, is there a way you can give us straight-line rent right off that you've seen in the third quarter and year to date to kind of provide some color on that? And maybe just to follow-up on the deferral it think you said 95% have been paid to date. Can you give us a rundown just on the level of direction of the deferral that you think might maybe they were up a little bit in the third quarter versus second, but it may just be the way it's been quoted. So any color there would be helpful as well. Thank you. Eugene Reilly : Sure Dave, thanks. So on your first one just regarding straight-line rents, those are netted down again termination fees. So when you see a termination fee, those are net of those. Listen it's termination fees are probably about where it's $3 million in the quarter if you looked over a long period of time. I don\u2019t have a precise number, but it's a straight line of that component of $1 million net of it. So it's calculated, we certainly take into consideration and the fact that calculation as well. Regarding deferrals, I've been very happy with deferral collection. So we build deferrals. To date are about $40 million of the deferrals, it's 61 basis points of annual growth rent. We've build two $20 million of that or half of its due. We collected 95% of that already. Most of that's 5% to collect is really in October, but it's trending very normally with prior months. So I'd expect the vast majority of all that to come in. Of the $40 of deferrals, we'll build a total of 80% of that this year. So we'll knock that out of the way. We've got about half of it collected already and we'll get another 30% by the time of the end of the year. So I think this should be wrapped up by the time we get to the end of the end of year. We'll have some of that evolving to '21 but if they're get taken care of and due to our stock feel very good about collections and very good about deferrals. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Mueller from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mike Mueller : If you look at upcoming development starts into 2021, are there any significant seismic and graphical devices to the pipeline? Eugene Reilly : This is Gene. Let me start. Chris, you probably have something to add, it sounds like there really isn't Mike and in fact I think that's unique about the situation that we're in other than spaces under 100,000 square feet, which we generally don't develop much in that sector anyway, demand has been and it's becoming even more broad-based. So I really don't think there's any particular market. Our product I call out, obviously there's some very significant strength in the big-box sector and we're going to need to have demand, but I don't think the composition of the deals looks much different than for example they did last year. Chris? Chris Caton : I'd say in Europe, France and Poland are going to be low on that list. It's been some places where I expect less trend line development and I think Japan is going to be busier given the strength of those markets. Operator : Our next question comes from Tom Catherwood from BTIG. Please go ahead. Tom Catherwood : Thank you. Tom, going back to your opening comments, you talked about rent growth and occupancy lagging in spaces under 100,000 square feet and then Gene you just mentioned that that is kind of broad-based demand center for certain tenants, but is the lagging occupancy and rent growth have to deal with the K-shape recovery because these tend to be smaller tenants in these smaller spaces or is it that companies are finding they could accomplish e-commerce fulfillment out of larger facilities that are close to but not directly in population centers? Thomas Olinger : It's the former and frankly that smaller spaces have two kinds of tenants and they have big tenants in smaller spaces where they're more closer industry issues and those are just feeling fine and then there are smaller spaces, smaller businesses that are more vulnerable to this economic downturn and therefore there is more churn there. I expect that to and sort of the market getting better is because a lot of that churn took place in the early days and as the data that goes by, the survivors are surviving all the odds. So I expect that to decline. The problems in these small spaces and the small tenants the decline and at some point it will flip because during the aftermath of economic downturns, in the past business formations have really skyrocketed and I expect a lot of people that are either being laid off or moving their businesses will get back little bit. So that will come back but it may be a lag but things are relatively small spaces are just fine, no problem. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Mailman from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Craig Mailman : Maybe just going back e-commerce and as it relates to maybe the US specifically, can you guys throw out what Amazon was and what the PL's were. I'm just kind of curious, as you run the data and see what you think expected demand incrementally would be from kind of that pull forward of e-commerce demand versus what you've already kind of put in the books or with the pipeline looks like, do you have a sense of maybe describe as a way to win that wave crest from a quarter perspective and then kind of hit the peak of that demand and then kind of trails off and how that is impacting potential development starts as you look out, not just for you guys the market clearly you guys are turning spec back on, I am just kind of curious if others are turning spec on in anticipation of this and how that could potentially impact that rent growth as the expectations that past '21 development deliveries would kind of really moderate if that may just not happen given kind of other dynamics going on. Thomas Olinger : I think we're in the early stages of shipping earlier than mid stages of e-commerce to go up and I think what happened in the last several months is exactly five to seven years of growth. So I don't we're going to give any of that back. I think you going to plateau for a while as people go back to regular shopping and restaurants and uniting at home and all those things and then light backup at a more elevated level. So the big way to keep your eye on is that if the tsunami of e-commerce coming through. What happened to the ripples on top of that big wave frankly in which quarter, I have no idea honest and it varies market by market. But we don\u2019t run our business based on the ripples on top of the big wave. In terms of our dynamics in the marketplace that could make it difficult for the demand of that wave to be fulfilled, the answer is yes, the most desirable markets are the ones with the tightest land. The most difficult in finding large pieces of flat land that you can build these buildings that e-commerce player's demand etcetera, etcetera. So with every passing day, we're having more demand for that sector. Now it's elevated and it's stabilizing with a much higher level off of which it's going to continue to grow and it's showing up a lot of the land that there is short supply in the more desirable markets. So I think that's the positive trend. Operator : Our next question comes from Emanuel Korchman from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Manny Citigroup : I think I wanted to come to clearly your view on the asset management business, Tom had made a comment in the opening remarks about your business perpetual and preparing it relative to most of the asset managers in terms of how they're being valued versus how the business within Prologis is being valued? And I think you've shown tremendous amount of creativity in terms of structuring your enterprise leveraging a lot of different structures whether they're external managed entities, leasing funds and centralizing management with part of the compensation structure in that business. I guess are you thinking about taking one step further in somehow making this entity that are public or a private to highlight that value or do you view this just as within Prologis and we just hope the market would review the appropriate value. Hamid Moghadam : Excellent question and let me just pile on to your question. I think there are two businesses, one is the development business and one of the investment management business, that I guarantee if I took the numbers of our development business and part of use for each family business and by the way, we have those numbers going back to year 2000 okay and show that to your home analyst at Citi, I bet you truly will value at 2.5 times book, with book to development business and a multiple that's more in the team. And if I did the same thing, the investment management business actually showed them the numbers, the trends in those numbers the permanent capital nature of most of those funds well over 90% and the stickiness of those and the promote history of those funds, I am willing to bet you that they\u2019ll put a 25 multiple on the pre-promote number and will give us the present value of the promotes on top of that and net of it is I think both of those businesses are valued at about 30% to 40% of what they should be. Now that leads to really under my spend and we spend a lot of time trying to figure out what you can do with sections all that kind of stuff. The government issues that come along with that are very difficult and complicated and painful, where do you develop, how do you change where it's done and frankly it doesn\u2019t matter anymore. It's $140 billion enterprise and whether it's couple billion dollars here and there in terms of incremental value, eventually people will get it and will give us credit for it. So I guess to answer your question in a very straightforward way, the latter statement that we make, we're trying to give enough the complexities are not worth, the incremental value that we may get in the short term. I'm sure we'll better do long time because the evidence it's becoming so indisputable that it's kind of actually meaningful at this moment more than annoying. Operator : Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Jamie Feldman : You were talking about upping your outlook for in the direction to 210 square feet and completions 290 million square feet. Can you just talk more about what you're seeing from taking on REIT competitors in terms of their appetite to speculative development and then also we have this delay in construction, but what does this all look like heading into '21 and given early read on what your supply-demand forecast were quite there? Hamid Moghadam : The answer to your second question is yes. We have an idea whether it will, we will share with you on the next call when we provide guidance for 2021. With respect to non-REIT players, they continue to be by far but they just in aggregate sector of development have always been and will continue to be the better REITs as large as they may be. I don\u2019t know 20% of the business may be in the more relevant markets. So really the part of my case was vast majority of the 30s and I'd say yeah there is some undisciplined development in the private area, but I would say other than Poland, I can't really think of a crazy example of that. Maybe Houston, maybe Houston and Poland but by factor of five, it's Poland and maybe somewhere. And the reason for it is not that these private developers or public developers have forgotten how to build buildings or any less interest in building, and just really cost define the land being had on them to build the buildings of their size that the market demand to meet a lot of this virtually demand from the big day commerce.0 So I think it's just tough and so development levels are going to be muted because of the difficulties of navigating that. I mean advisory large pieces of land in the desirable markets and our belief that the West Coast and all that are initially three to four years on large pieces of land and you got to jump through all kinds of needs and complexities. So it becomes difficult to tie up with this piece of land to take it through their impediment process. We get a lot here a lot there and it's just difficult. So that's what I would say about it. Operator : Our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Caitlin Burrows : Hamid, I think before you mentioned that there is a lot more people showing up at it relates to the transaction market. For Prologis' 2020 guidance it would increase I think now it's $750 million estimate point from $600 million originally and lower than that last quarter. So could we just talk about the current transaction market and how those two pieces wind up? It seems Prologis is more confident on your ability put in that commentary that there are a lot more players? Hamid Moghadam : There are a lot more players and our acquisitions are not sort of the no brainer acquisition that are a race to who accepts the lowest IRR. Just to say that there are lesser business. We're not in that business. We show up that every one of those options to get people on that been going on but honestly that they're not buying a whole lot of clean perfect brochure quality. I think the pipeline market on some of those things that we've seen recently just beyond ridicule. I think most of our volume comes from more infill, more reposition plays, last touch plays, urban plays. So the stuff that the ratio of the cost of money to the level that we're compelling you towards level of effort and talent and customer relationships. So we know where our strengths are. If it's a race to who accepts the lowest IRR, that's not the business we're in. We leave it to the people who really like that business and there seem to be more and more of them every day. But we have great visibility and as you know you may remember that people always ask me about acquisition guidance and I say I'm $0 billion to $10 billion and we've exceeded the top end in the path and we've been zero at the time. We don\u2019t have a budget for acquisitions because it all depends on pricing and availability and quality of properties. You can make your acquisition guidance Q1 as we hear, but it would not be equivalent thing to do it. But when you get this close to the end of the year, you have visibility on really what's happening not only this year but through the middle of the fourth quarter next year and that's what's the recent confidence to increase those numbers. They're mostly high effort value-added types of things, not that passive and no brainer. Hamid Moghadam : Caitlin, I think that was the last comment. So I want to thank everyone for attending our call and we look forward to meeting with you in the new year and sharing our 2021 guidance. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does indeed concludes today's conference call. Thank you again for participating. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tracy Ward. Tracy, please begin. Tracy Ward : Thanks, Amy. And good morning everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings. Additionally, our fourth quarter result's press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA, that are non-GAAP measures and in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. This morning, we'll hear from Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover results and real-time market conditions as well as guidance. Hamid Moghadam, Gary Anderson, Chris Caton, Mike Curless, Dan Letter, Ed Nekritz, Gene Reilly and Colleen McEwan are also here with us today. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom, will you please begin. Thomas Olinger : Thank you, Tracy. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call today. I want to begin by acknowledging our team and their great work this past year. In an incredibly challenging year, our accomplishments were significant and possible because of the work we've done over the last 10 years building the best-in-class portfolio that is critical to today's supply chain and centered on our customers. During the year we closed on $17 billion of M&A, further fortified our balance sheet with lower rates in line of maturities generated over $1.1 billion of free cash flow after dividends and importantly, continue to deliver sector-leading earnings growth. Since the merger in 2011, our earnings CAGR of 9.5% without promotes has outperformed the other logistics REITs by more than 350 basis points annually. This is the result of the unique business model which has consistently outperformed year-after-year. Turning to our view of the operating environment. Our proprietary data shows that the strong demand we experienced in the third quarter has continued, globally leases signed in the fourth quarter were a record 65 million square feet or more than 1 million square feet per business day. This was driven by new leasing, which rose 22% year-over-year on a size-adjusted basis. Broad range of customers signed new leases in the fourth quarter led by consumer products, food and beverage, electronics and health care segments. E-commerce activity accounted for 19.8% of new leasing. The need for speed and flexibility is also reflected in elevated short-term leasing which was up 58% in the quarter as 3PL, retail and transportation customers raised to secure space ahead of the holidays. Lease proposals remain at healthy levels. In the U.S., fourth quarter net absorption was the highest under record at 100 million square feet and in excess of new supply of 90 million square feet. Rents in our markets grew by 3.2% with all the growth coming in the back half of 2020, we anticipate rents to grow by approximately 5% in 2021. Houston is the only U.S. market on our watch list. As a reminder, we moved to Atlanta and Central Pennsylvania from our list in the second quarter. In 2021, we expect supply to decline year-on-year balanced with demand at 280 million square feet each. Conditions are also healthy in our other markets across the globe. In Europe, rents begin to rise in the fourth quarter and we expect 2.5% of additional growth in 2021, led by Northern Europe and the U.K. The implications of Brexit have been largely positive for us as we anticipated 4 years ago and Brexit was first announced. Inventory disaggregation will eventually lead to higher inventory levels in both the U.K. and the continent. We're watching new supply in Poland and Spain, but for context, these two markets account for just 1.7% of our share of NOI. In Tokyo and Osaka, historic high levels to supply are being met with very strong demand. Over two-third of the development pipeline is already pre-leased and we expect market vacancies to remain below 2%. For China, suppliers moderating even as the market remains soft. In our portfolio, we leased a record 10 million square feet in the second half of the year, a credit to the great work of our new China leadership team. Turning to valuations. Our logistics portfolio posted the largest sequential increase in a decade, rising 5% in the U.S. and globally and are now nearly 6% above pre-pandemic levels. Applying this increase to our $142 billion owned and managed portfolio, we estimate the value of our real estate rose by $7 billion in the fourth quarter. We expect continued fundamental improvement in 2021 and beyond, based on three drivers, first, a powerful economic recovery including the highest GDP growth in the U.S. in more than two decades. The combination of corporate and personal savings as well as significant governmental stimulus, is a loaded spring which will translate to significant economic growth in the back half as the vaccines continue to roll out. Second, the pandemic accelerates the retail revolution. The e-commerce penetration rate jumped 480 basis points to 20% of goods sold in the U.S. in 2020. Based on early reports, e-commerce holiday sales grew by at least 30%. While we expect the share of goods purchased online to grow further, a pause later this year would not surprise us, as consumers expand spending on services and experiences over goods. Our customers continue to plan for a long-term, retooling supply chains for increased, they should generate a cumulative incremental demand of 200 million square feet or more over the next several years. Third we expect higher inventory levels. Inventory to sales ratios remain near all-time lows. We believe that's had an impact on our customer space utilization as it ticked down to 83% in the fourth quarter. We see early signs of inventory restocking as containerized import volumes in the U.S. rose 24% in November and are on pace to set a quarterly record. Longer term, the need for more resilient supply chains will lead to higher inventory levels. We estimate that a 5% increase in inventory levels will produce incremental demand of nearly 300 million square feet in the U.S. alone. These changes will take years to play out, driving strong long-term demand. Turning to results, the work we've done to create the best-in-class portfolio, scale, and lowest cost structure in the industry is delivering exceptional financial results. 2020 core FFO excluding promotes grew by 14% and came in at the high end of our range at $3.58 per share. We also recognized record net promote income of $0.22 per share. Net effective rent change on rollover in the fourth quarter was 28% led by the U.S. at 32.1%, both high watermarks for the year. Our in-place to market rent spread now stands at 12.8%, up about 60 basis points sequentially. Collections continue to outpace 2019 level and as of this morning, we collected over 99% of fourth quarter rents and over 95% of January. Bad debt was 42 basis points for the quarter and 43 basis points for the year, both below our expectation. Our share of cash same-store NOI growth was 3% and led by the U.S. at 3.5%. We made a meaningful progress on the sale of non-strategic assets acquired from Liberty. We set all disputes related to the construction of the Philadelphia Four Seasons Hotel and the Comcast Technology Center. We completed the disposition of our 20% ownership interest in the hotel and the previously announced portfolio in the U.K. To date, we have sold more than $600 million of former Liberty assets, exceeding our underwritten value by more than 80%. We now have a less than $400 million of former Liberty non-logistics assets remaining consisting primarily of our interest in the Comcast headquarters. For strategic capital, our team raised $3.1 billion in 2020 with 40% from new investors we have yet to meet in person. Market and property tours as well as due diligence activities were all conducted virtually as our team capitalize on our early investments in digital infrastructure. Our balance sheet remains the best in the industry with liquidity and combined leverage capacity between Prologis and our open-ended vehicle of more than $13 billion. Our capital markets activity in the quarter brought our total average interest rate down to 2%. We will look for additional opportunities to refinance at attractive rates. In fact, at current interest rates and our mix of currencies, we could issue 10-year debt at a blended all-in rate of 1%. Turning to our guidance for 2021, here are the key components on our share basis. We expect cash same-store NOI growth to range between 3.5% to 4.5%. We're estimating bad debt expense to range between 20 and 40 basis points of gross revenues and average occupancy for our operating portfolio to range between 95.5% and 96.5%. We expect a seasonal occupancy drop in the first quarter then trend higher as the year progresses. For strategic capital, we expect revenue excluding promotes to range between $435 million and $450 million. Promote revenue will be negligible in 2021. In fact we'll have net promote expenses of $0.02 per share for the year, which relates to the amortization of costs from prior period promotes. Our historic net promote income in average approximately 20 basis points for third-party AUM, which would be $0.06 to $0.07 of earnings per share based on current promotable AUM. Looking ahead, recent property appreciation leads us to expect net promote income per share in 2022 to be at or above this historic average. We expect to start between $2.3 billion and $2.7 billion in new development with 45% new leases and for stabilizations to range between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion. Dispositions will range between $1 billion and $1.4 billion with the majority expected to close in the first half of 2021. We are forecasting net deployment uses of $350 million at the midpoint and as a result, our leverage remains effectively flat in 2021. Putting this altogether, we expect core FFO, including the $0.02 of net promote expense to range between $3.88 to $3.98 per share. Core FFO excluding promotes will range between $3.90 and $4 per share with year-over-year growth at the midpoint of more than 10% delivering another year of exceptional growth. We entered 2021 with optimism and confidence, our ability to deliver value for our customers beyond real estate using our unmatched purchasing power and significant investments in technology, innovation and data are significant competitive advantages that will drive further our performance. With that, I'll turn it back to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Caitlin Burrows : Your guidance for 2021 on development services almost 20% higher in terms of last year. So could you just go through what the balance of build-to-suit in speculative development and how much kind of visibility do you have on that, could it be increased further there? Eugene Reilly : Yes, Caitlin. This is Gene. I'll take that question. And you are breaking up a little bit, but I think you're talking about the development activity in the coming year. So this year, about 85% of what we're guiding to are main transactions. So, we have very few placeholders. And as Tom mentioned, we're 45% build-to-suit in the forecast and it is really difficult to forecast how that's going to play out. But if there is a bias, it probably is to the upside. But at this point, we're comfortable with the forecast. Caitlin Burrows : And probably better but sorry if I'm still breaking out. And then if I could ask just second. Just, Tom, you mentioned that short-term leasing was up. So just wondering how did the short-term leases compared to regular leases in terms of points and rents and the thought process on competing those versus longer-term leases? Eugene Reilly : Thanks, Caitlin. You broke up a little bit there. But I think just how the - our bond process runs short-term we think. I think we're going to continue to see short-term leasing probably stay at elevated levels, just given the tightness of the market and the need for customers to act and move quickly as we get into 2021. I hope that addresses your question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks for taking the questions. So maybe just first one going to the core guidance, same-store NOI guidance. If we sort of look at your components with the occupancy, on average, slight uptick, escalators, which I'm assuming 2.5%, 3% bumps that you're going to get from expiration, rent expiring. Seems to me that if I put all that together, you should be kind of well, if not well above, but above 4%. So, I'm just wondering if you can walk us through maybe what the puts are there and what would get you to the bottom end of that range? Thomas Olinger : Yes. The simplest way to look at it for same-store in 2021 is it's all driven primarily by rent change on roll. So think about 25% roll and - I'm sorry, 15% lease roll, and from a GAAP perspective, think about 25%-ish rent change on roll. And as you mentioned, occupancy and bad debt are pretty consistent, don't move much year-over-year, so that drives the GAAP same-store. From a cash perspective, think about that same 15%, we'll call it 12-ish percent rent change on roll, you're going to see bumps from around 3.25% on the portfolio in place and then you'll see a little bit of normal free rent out of that. But those components should get you right near the midpoint of our guidance. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Jamie Feldman : Thank you. I was hoping to take a step back a little bit and just get your perspectives on the election and what do you think it might mean in terms of policy or tentative reaction or customer reaction to just kind of new leadership in terms of what you think might change for warehouse demand, whether certain markets look more interesting? Or any themes or trends you think we should be watching? And I guess, thinking about the Biden's Buy America plan, wondering what your thoughts are on that as well? Thank you. Thomas Olinger : Sure, Jamie. I'll take a stab at that. I think the most significant near-term thing is going to be the infrastructure spending and that will have a positive effect on demand for our product. With respect to Buy U.S. first and all, we had that in the previous administration but if you actually look at the numbers, they don't support the newspaper headlines. So, we don't think there's going to be a material change in that because we haven't had any of that in the last four years either in. That was pretty much the same, same promoted policy. But the big drivers of our business is not necessarily economic policy. It's just the mix of consumption between bricks and mortar and e-commerce and the underlying growth rate of the economy, which should be very strong bouncing from a down year basically, and recovering all of that in 2021. So, we think those are the two big drivers. And economic policy will be affected a little bit around the edges but not the main driver. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Steve Sakwa : I guess I wanted to take Tom's comment about the 65 million square feet of leasing in the quarter, which is exceptionally strong. And maybe just look at Page 4 of the supplemental where you have that chart that shows new lease proposals and then the space utilization. And I'm just trying to kind of square the proposals with kind of the strong leasing and then just curious why the utilization figure is trending downward and maybe not upward? Thomas Olinger : Actually I'm going to take that. It's pretty simple. People are running out of inventory because they haven't pre-positioned enough inventory in the system to support the level of activity. And remember, we need more inventory in the online channel than we do in the offline channel. And one of the big issues with inventories is that we can't get the containers back to China. And so, actually, we could support a much higher utilization and lower levels of stock-outs, but that's what's going on. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. John Kim : Thanks. Good morning. In the fourth quarter, your development starts ramped up with a lower expected development margin of 23% despite lower build-to-suit activity this quarter. Can you just comment on this dynamic and if we could run rate going forward on margins? Eugene Reilly : Yes. This is Eugene. I'll take that. So, you are going to see and have seen for the past several years that our forecasted margins are quite a bit lower than our margins historically because these are underwritten margins. Now, we have been beating these margins for a variety of reasons, rent growth, cap rate compression. So I would expect and I think we'll retain this for a long time that you will see over time margins will normalize. But that really depends on what the future cap rate environment looks like. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. Nick Yulico : Thank you. I was hoping you could just talk a little bit about expectations for rent growth in the different regions and this year? And maybe you can break that up, if you see a difference between gateway distribution markets versus multi-market distribution, city distribution and Last Touch? Chris Caton : Hi, Nick. It's Chris here. Yes, we expect U.S. rent growth to be 5% in 2020 and a little bit better than 4% globally. In terms of the different product types, look, we highlighted a couple of geographies that we expect to outperform, for example, the UK and Northern Europe. And in United States, we've had a combination of the major Last Touch city distribution markets as well as some gateway distribution markets outperforming. I'm thinking New York, New Jersey, I'm thinking Toronto and Southern California. And they outperformed in 2020 and we expect them to outperform in 2021. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Derek Johnston : I would like to hear more about the evolving demand and leasing dynamics in the European portfolio. And really specifically, when it comes to occupancy, which until last year was a bit of a headwind, it was slipping every quarter starting back in 4Q '18, now admittedly from a high point. But how do things feel on the ground in Europe? Have off-nets in fact stabilized and can we expect growth from here? I mean, I believe this is the first positive year-over-year comp in six quarters. Thanks. Thomas Olinger : Yes. That may be the case in terms of the math I've read. Europe is generally a more balanced market than the U.S. Demand and supply seem to move in sync together and generally vacancy rates are lower. The two exceptions are probably I would say, the big exception is Poland. And from time-to-time you get Spain sort of moving up to that volatile end of the market, but the rest of Europe is very well occupied. So it's really the volume of rollovers in Poland and Spain that drive that balance and occupancy on the margin. But throughout, our occupancies in Europe have been higher than the rest of our portfolio and in the U.S. anyway. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Emmanuel Korchman : Hamid, maybe this is one for you. Do you think that the Exeter ETT deal announced this morning provides any read through to your private capital business? Hamid Moghadam : Well, I think our private capital business continues to be undervalued by the street. All you got to do is look at the comps of publicly traded investment management firms and once you consider the fact that well over 90% of our assets are in infinite life vehicles and they generate significant promotes from time to time, and that our margins keep on increasing. I think that multiple should be in the low 20s. But I think most of the NAV models that I see are in the low teens or maybe even 10. So I think the street continues so undervalue that business. Would it be worth more if we crystallize that value in a trans - very specific transaction? Sure. But is it worth the headache on a company that has a $140 billion of assets to move around the value by $0.50 or bucket share? Probably not. So, we think there is upside to our NAV from our Investment Management business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Michael Carroll : Can you provide some color on tenant - the tenant demand you're seeing? I mean, I know in the beginning of the year, in the middle of the year, a lot of the demand - or Amazon specifically has been extremely active. And have you seen or do you expect to see that tenant interest to broaden out more meaningfully as we move into 2021? Hamid Moghadam : Yes, let me start it then and then Mike can give you more color. But we think demand is pretty broad, I mean, sure e-commerce gets a lot of the headlines, because on the margin that is the source of new demand, but there is plenty of demand from other sectors that continues and forms a strong base. And within the e-commerce sector, of course Amazon is the biggest player, so they get a lot of play. But remember, Amazon is more in change of our total ABR and there are lots of other tenants that are doing well. In fact, I would say everybody is pretty much doing well with the exception of the uses that support hospitality like convention, exhibition, people and things of that nature. The rest of the market is pretty, pretty strong. Mike, you want to provide more color on that? Michael Curless : Yes, let's look at it in traditional leasing and in build-to-suits. On the leasing front their fourth quarter performance sort of normalized compared to typical Amazon numbers with us after a robust Amazon activity in quarters two and three. But the message there is, there's plenty of other companies' broad base that are driving traditional e-com leasing and I think that speaks to the philosophy going forward. And then on the build-to-suit side, yes, Amazon was very active. We did six build-to-suits with them in the quarter and call it 10 for the year out of 28. However, there was a ton of restructuring well underway with the home improvement folks, food and beverage, healthcare, well underway with restructuring pre COVID. Perhaps they took a couple of months pause during COVID but man they're coming back with a vengeance and marching forward with those restructurings. And so while we'll see plenty of Amazon, I am really encouraged the other uses. We just signed a big lease with Kraft about a month ago, and working with a ton of brand names next year, we'll be happy to talk more about. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Craig Mailman : Maybe a follow-up to an earlier question, but I think last year we were talking about the cadence potentially of development stabilizations given kind of the build-up of starts in the resurgence there. And I'm just kind of curious, it looks, year-over-year like that pace of stabilizations is expected to slow. Is there something going on there that changed that outlook? Hamid Moghadam : Well, the only thing I can think of is that we deferred some starts immediately when COVID hit, because we didn't know what kind of environment we were in. But we've essentially restarted most if not all of those things and will be restarting them. So I think we just got that pushed out, but the volume that's behind it is very significant. So I would say the total level of stabilizations will be increased in the next couple of years beyond what it would have been and what our expectations would have been certainly at the beginning of COVID. But I would say even more than our expectations at the beginning of the year - beginning of last year prior to COVID. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Let's proceed with your question. Thomas Catherwood : I want to go back to something Chris had mentioned about above average rent growth for last touch assets, which makes a lot of sense. Obviously, we understand the supply-constrained nature of industrial markets in major cities, but it seems like nowadays every real estate developer is an industrial developer and especially in New York City. We're seeing a big jump in infill industrial projects. Could this jump in development activity create a supply-demand imbalance and potentially put the brakes on rent growth for some of your last touch assets? Hamid Moghadam : It could, but I think what's going on in New York and elsewhere is that there is a lot of price discovery, nobody really knows what the ability to pay is for some of these customers and in all of these locations, we underestimated the rental value. So at least for the time being, all the price discovery has been good and the other thing you should take into account is that in these infill locations, you've got to have a lot of developers, but you're not going to have a lot more land or buildings that can be rehabilitated. So I think you'll see it in terms of pressure on pricing of those assets, more than you would see on absolute supply because the supply is pretty inelastic aspects and will show up in price. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Blaine Heck : I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the investment sales market and your interest in acquisitions? There have been several large portfolios in the U.S. specifically that have traded either in the second half of last year or early on this year and I know you guys typically are looking at anything sizable that hits the market. So without getting into specifics, unless you want to, can you just talk about what kept you on the sidelines in these situations with the pricing and underwriting being stretched. Is it more of the geographic footprint that just doesn't overlap enough or maybe it's just your focus on - more on development at this point? Any color there would be helpful. Hamid Moghadam : So all of the above. Let me give you a quick answer and Gene will fill in the blanks. We are not good buyers of core real estate auction by a brokerage house where there are 55 people showing up at the margin, a lot of these people have to build up their industrial capability and everybody is trying to get into that business because the other property types don't offer very many opportunities. So, those kind of just looking it out on price, is not our business. So that means that building out our land bank, doing value-added acquisitions where we can bring our leasing and operational expertise to the table, deals that are Hairy, et cetera, et cetera, but general framework for looking at deals is returns, how we can differentiate and have a competitive advantage and also in the case of portfolio deals, what that fit is if we have to buy 100 buildings and sell 90 of them, that's probably not a very attractive transaction for us. So the other thing I would just mention is that you meant - you posed the question in a sense that we're only going after big deals. We do a lot of $5 million only deals too, they just don't show up. So we're there looking at pretty much everything that moves out there and we're there with offers on most if not all of the ones that meet our quality standards, but thankfully in a lot of those core situations, we lose. So we're good with that. We're on the selling side of the lot of those transactions as well. Eugene Reilly : Yes. I just had a couple of things. I mean last year we had 300 matters go through Investment Committee. So it means that we look at a range of deal sizes and we look at every single deal. Every single deal, we will underwrite it, look at it. We are bit picky on quality that's an explanation. And we were - we execute when it makes sense for us, but I wouldn't read into this that we're uninterested. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Dave Rodgers : Tom, I wanted to follow up on you said earlier a larger percentage of short-term leases I think in the fourth quarter, but we did see leave economics around just a little bit marginal, but we see it happen. I'm wondering if the economics were just a delay from COVID era or if you're going to be [indiscernible] are heading right amount of lease economics for the same lease have gone. [technical difficulty] 250,000 to 500,000 square feet boxes, really offset it with gain 1 to 255 range. Is this having an impact on the economics. I'm trying to figure really economics are going, and what's driving that is kind of economic occupancy trends. Thomas Olinger : Yes, Dave. I'll take both of those. On the first one, remember leases less than one year are excluded from our leasing metrics that's consistent of what we do across our - the agreement we have with our - the other logistics around metrics. So that is what's happening is if you're looking at turnover costs, it's the higher mix of new leasing versus renewals. We saw that in Q3, we saw in Q4 and that is what is driving turnover costs slightly higher this quarter and same story last quarter. And then regarding economics, I wouldn't look at - yeah, we did see space sizes under 100,000 square feet and it actually went up 100 basis points. But I wouldn't look at the other segments they are quite strong. I think that's just some activity that happened at quarter end and its noise and all segments are doing quite well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel with Green Street. Please proceed with your question. Eric Frankel : This might be related to blend or a question just about capital allocation. But you mentioned that you saw most of the non-industrial assets from Liberty portfolio, but looks like your held for sale portfolio is still somewhat elevated, so maybe you can talk about the pace of those sales going forward. And then secondly, we're on the operating portfolio looking at Bay Area occupancy went down about 300 basis points of sale quarter-over-quarter. So maybe just comment on how the local economic environment there is affecting industrial demand. Thank you. Hamid Moghadam : Yes, on the pace of sales, we mentioned with our need for capital - we're - depending on how you measure it 19%-20% levered. So we don't want to dilute ourselves and those assets are doing nothing other than appreciating. So we'll be - we'll take our time with respect to selling the industrial assets and we'll match them with our capital needs, self-funding model. With respect to the Bay Area, my general comment and Gene may want to say more about this is that the Bay Area is soft. There is no question that the Bay Area - after almost a decade of straight lineup has gotten pretty hit - pretty hard in this downturn. So I would say it is softer than LA in a big way and - but the good news is that there has been so much rental appreciation that even as these leases expire, we still in many cases are rolling them up to market, to market is just not as high as it would have been say a year ago. Eugene Reilly : Yes Eric. The only thing I'd add on, San Francisco, agree with everything Hamid said and one thing to keep in mind vacancy is 6%-6.5% in the San Francisco Bay area. So it isn't as if you have weak conditions on top of a very high vacancy rate. So we're watching it and obviously the performance is very much disconnected with the - with LA, but fundamentally vacancies are not dead right now. Hamid Moghadam : One other thing I would say about the Bay Area. I think the number is 10 million square feet, maybe 12 million square feet has been taken out of supply in the last five years or so, and that trend continues because we're competing land uses just gobble up industrial. So actually it's one of those markets where supply in the core Bay Area submarkets is actually going down. It's been converted to - life science has been converted to apartments, all kinds of other things. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Dilts with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Brent Dilts : Occupancy globally saw a nice improvement in 4Q, but could you talk about what drove the strong rebound in ending occupancy in Asia specifically. Hamid Moghadam : We got a new team in place in China that has been very aggressive in leasing space and the vast majority of our expect vacancy in China was our vacancy in the company in the spec basis was in China and we're addressing that. And the new team is doing a fabulous job. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jonathan Petersen with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Petersen : Yes Hamid, I was hoping maybe you pick up on what you were just talking about with the Bay Area and maybe just think more broadly I'm just looking at your top four markets in the U.S., Southern California, New York-New Jersey, Bay Area and Chicago, obviously places that through the pandemic have seen decent outflows of people into the Southeast so - I realize the supply is constrained in those markets. So I'm just thinking in terms of incremental investment going forward. I mean do we expect more investment in places like Dallas and Atlanta and Florida, places that are benefiting demographically or do you think you kind of expect things go back to how they were? Hamid Moghadam : Look I think all of the markets that you mentioned were running so far above trend for a decade and that had created so many imbalances that I actually think it's pretty good to take a breather for some of those markets. No, I don't really think California's falling into the ocean. There are a lot of people in the middle of the country cheering for that, but it's not going to happen. I mean just look at the last quarter, you've had - look at the market cap that's been created in this area, it's probably more than it's been created in the decade in some of those markets. So, no, I don't think - so the numbers are actually pretty interesting if you look at the overall California numbers. I don't have them specifically for the Bay Area, but this year - and the way they measure it's a June 30, year-end, but in the year ended June 30, you had 260,000 people move out of California that compares to the year before like a more normal year about 230,000 people. So there is always this churning that happened but all of that is that 0.5% of the total population of California and you still have internal growth. So, California is still growing, it's just not growing at the same pace as it was before. And I think some of the outflows have to do with temporary work from home kind of situations. We don't expect all of those things to last forever, so you'll have some people coming back to California. I think, housing prices have moderated, certainly on the rental side. So, yeah, I think California's softer than it's been, but it's been on such a tear that it would have had to come to some kind of a moderation and it has. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Trust. Your line is open. Ki Bin Kim : You've already touched on this, but maybe I can follow-up on it. Have your underwriting standards parameters have changed at all looking to 2021 and on the margin, where do you think it's definite versus the average industrial builder or buyer? Hamid Moghadam : I think our underwriting has moved down with the required returns have moved down in the same direction as the weighted average cost of capital has moved down, I mean capital market returns are lower. So real estate returns are lower as well. What we really look at is relative value and in a lot of the situations, the way that the money coming into the industrial sector has created the situation where good assets and bad assets or not so great assets. The yield is compressing between the two and people just want to pick that industrial box. So a lot of those people also tend to be leveraged buyer is in which they can take better advantage of those lower rates. So, but the way we underwrite the assets in terms of quality and the ability of those assets to compete in the marketplace that has never changed. That's the primary filter, but obviously because of higher rents and lower cap rates pricing has changed. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Mike Mueller : Looking at USLV and PELP U.S. ownership stakes is about 50% there. Do you see that gravitating down anytime soon? Hamid Moghadam : In USLV is our venture with Norges actually they're both our ventures with Norges and our deal with them was that we would have - be 50/50 partners. And we have certain rights that sell down to 20% in one of those ventures and but no, we like it, it's been a good investment and we continue to hold it and we've got plenty of capital coming from other places - mostly disposition. So we haven't tapped that source for capital. It's there if we need it, but I don't think we're going to need it for quite some time. We can sell fund out of the non-strategic dispositions and also our contributions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. Sumit Sharma : This is Sumit here in for Nick. So you've been recently doing a lot more analysis on labor shed debt as well as availability in some of new markets for example in Atlanta and some market seem to sell themselves like Inland Empire no one puts out flyer more than a page long. So I'm interested in understanding whether the labor shed or labor availability issue, is it back or is it in certain markets and if you could shed some light on what markets. Is it a problem in if it is? Hamid Moghadam : I think labor shortage of labor is, you weren't coming through perfectly, clearly, but I think your question was, is labor continuing to be a constraint. The answer is yes, pretty much everywhere. And so, I was really surprised frankly when I heard from our large customers, I think back in April and May in the early stages of COVID relatively early stages of COVID. That labor continues to be the number one, number two and number three problem. I thought it would have moderated given the downturn and the unemployment rate. And the key in that calculus is quality of labor. So we've taken a lot of steps as you know with our community workforce initiatives to try to address that for our customers. But no matter how hard we work or how large that initiative get. It's not going to even begin to make a dent in the problem that we have. Are there geographical differences from place-to-place for sure, but those geographical differences have already adjusted. Because people don't put their warehouses in places where there is no labor whatsoever. They put it in places where there is labor but there just not as much labor as they would like. So they're all competing with one another and the turnover rate in that kind of labor is very high, it's about 40% a year. So people move for relatively small changes in compensation than environment and customers are paying more attention to environment and all those amenities that can really be more attractive to labor in addition to paying more. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Jamie Feldman : Thanks for taking a follow-up. We've seen some news on Prologis buying some urban land lately. I'm just curious, how should we think about multi-storey as composition of your 2021 development starts. And similarly with the rotation from REIT to REIT - bricks and mortar to e-commerce any additional thoughts from the research you put out on retail conversions and maybe that becoming a larger part of your 2021 development starts? Hamid Moghadam : Well Jamie, I don't know what papers you're referring to. But we've been buying urban land in terms of covered land place for at least seven or eight years in a pretty steady basis. So we've been at this business for a long time and we're broadening it in certain markets, but now we've been after it for quite some time and it's not just in the U.S. also in Europe. We're buying those covered land place and those can be either leased as staging areas. You can get very good returns on those, while you wait for the market or rents or entitlements to convert them to industrial land. We don't have a multi-storey strategy specifically, we have an infill strategy and that infill strategy drives you to multi-storey in certain locations with certain land economics, but there is nothing in our business plan. That says thou shall build three multi-storey building this year. I mean and we were very opportunistic in that sense. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Emmanuel Korchman : Tom earlier, I think you discuss 200 million square feet of incremental demand over the next few years? How much of that do you think can get taken care of by just innovation with existing boxes rejiggering, automation, more racking et cetera versus true incremental demand is going to lead to leasing from your end or others? Hamid Moghadam : Actually, Chris is probably in a better position to answer that. We've done a lot of work around automation and modernizing space. So Chris why don't you talk to that? Chris Caton : Yes sure, so the stat that Manny's referring to e-commerce specifically, we expect it will generate 150 million square feet perhaps more in the U.S. 200 million square feet likely more globally. Manny no, I don't think it's about efficiency and the introduction of technologies. I think this is about needing to strengthen supply chains over time. As it relates to specific to automation, the research we've done is to take a look at the productivity of assets, both - through the brick-and-mortar supply chain as well as the e-commerce, supply chain. We don't see a lot of change there. Instead, when we look at that incremental 200 million square feet going forward, I think you're going to see that focus on - Last Touch locations and city distribution locations, particularly in the world's global markets, those 24-hour cities. And as - Mike was referring to earlier, it couldn't be a lot of diversity in that customer mix. A lot of customers are starting to reassess how they want to go to market with e-commerce in 2021 and beyond, and I think you're going to see a lot of diversity there. So it's much more about bringing in new real estate requirements rather than introducing technology. Hamid Moghadam : Yes, and if I can jump at the end of that. I didn't answer part of Jamie's question about retail conversions, once you have our latest thinking in that and Chris's paper. So I don't have a whole lot to add to that. I think you will see more headlines about that than actual space converted, but you will see some space converted. So, for a variety of reasons that you can read about in the paper. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. John Kim : Thank you. On the Liberty portfolio, originally you considered $3.5 billion of dispositions, now it looks like you're looking to sell about $1 billion, partially because you don't really need the proceeds. But can you just refresh with us how much of Liberty's original portfolio you considered non-core for the company going forward? Hamid Moghadam : Yes, that view hasn't changed it's about $3.5 billion still. Of that $3.5 billion, if I remember correctly, about $700 million of it is not logistics and - well put it this way, it's an office - it's a suburban office, we sold some of that. The only thing that really remains on that front is the downtown Philly assets leased to Comcast. So the rest of the assets that are available for sale are just straight up industrial. And these assets would be considered in the top, I don't know 25% of most portfolios out there. It's just that they don't quite meet our standards. But they're perfectly fine assets and they're appreciating and as you've heard. I think Tom mentioned that even on the non-industrial ones we picked up 18% more value than we underwrote. So on industrial I think we're even going to do better than that. It's just no sense of - we could sell that at a really high price right now, but if the capital is sitting around not doing anything, we'll give a bunch of it back in terms of dilution. So we're going to be patient with that. John, that was the last question so again, everyone thank you for being on our call and we look forward to talking to you during the course of the coming quarter. Take care. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect.",

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ron Hubbard. Please go ahead. Ronald Hubbard : Thank you, Don. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Jim Connor, Chairman and CEO; Mark Denien, Chief Financial Officer; Steve Schnur, Chief Operating Officer; and Nick Anthony, Chief Investment Officer. Before we make our prepared remarks, let me remind you that certain statements made during this conference call may be forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. These risks and other factors could adversely affect our business and future results. For more information about those risk factors, we would refer you to our 10-K or 10-Q that we have on file with the SEC and the company's other SEC filings. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, April 29, 2021, and we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures that we provide on this call is included in our earnings release. Our earnings release and supplemental package were distributed last night after the market closed. If you did not receive a copy, these documents are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at dukerealty.com. You can also find our earnings release, supplemental package, SEC reports and an audio webcast of this call in the Investor Relations section of our website as well. Now for our prepared statement, I'll turn it over to Jim Connor. James Connor : Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. I will open by saying as always, we hope you and your families are safe and healthy, and that you have the opportunity to be vaccinated. The fundamentals of our business continue to be as good as ever. We've now had 2 successive quarters of demand breaking all-time records. Our development platform had a record first quarter of starts, and our core portfolio continues to perform at the top of the class. Our liquidity position and sources of capital are very attractively priced to capture opportunities, including our execution of 2 green debt transactions. All of these drivers result in us raising key components of our 2021 guidance that roll up to double-digit growth in expected core FFO and AFFO with the midpoints. Now let me turn it over to Steve to cover our operations. Steven Schnur : Thanks, Jim. I'll first cover overall market fundamentals, then review our operational results. Industrial net absorption in the first quarter according to CBRE registered an impressive 100 million square feet, marking the first time that demand has exceeded 100 million square feet in consecutive quarters. This was more than enough to offset new supply as completions dipped to 57 million square feet from about 70 million square feet in the fourth quarter of 2020. This positive net absorption over deliveries for the quarter reduced vacancy down to 4.4%, which is back down near the record levels we saw throughout most of 2019. The strong mix and fundamentals increased asking rents by over 7% compared to the previous year. CBRE now projects demand for the full year to surpass 300 million square feet, perhaps even breaking the 2016 record of 327 million square feet. They project deliveries to be about 300 million square feet as well. The overall sector continues to remain very much in balance, which will produce another year of growth in asking rents of high single digits nationally. On the macroeconomic front, the increasing pace of vaccinations, the stimulus being pumped into the U.S. economy and the arrival of spring weather has generated some significant recent data points indicative of a very strong year in our business. The recent March consumer confidence rating is back near the range of 2018 and 2019, and the GDP growth is projected to be in the 6% to 7% range. This bodes very well for demand in logistics real estate. And in addition, we have the secular drivers in our business that remain firmly intact and stronger than prepandemic. To that point, the growth in retail sales and e-commerce sales across the 2-month February and March period were up 12% and 28%, respectively. And perhaps more notably, when measured against the 2019 pre - nonpandemic time frame, the recent February and March figures were up 15% and 43%, respectively. In addition, the experience of the supply chain bottlenecks and response for greater business inventory redundancy is expected to push the retail inventory to sales ratio to above historic levels, yet it now sits near record low levels. Demand by occupier type remains broad-based and very active, with pure e-commerce, omnichannel retailers, 3PLs, health care supply firms and food and beverage companies leading the way. Now I'll turn to our own portfolio. We executed a very solid first quarter by signing 7.4 million square feet of new leases. On first-generation leasing, we signed 3 transactions to stabilize assets that were previously in the unstabilized in-service and spec development pools, including 146,000-square-foot lease on a spec development in Southern California, Mid-Counties submarket for 100% of the space. The lease activity for the quarter, combined with strong fundamentals I mentioned, led to continued growth in rents in our portfolio as we reported 11.4% cash, 26.2% on a GAAP basis. The mark-to-market on our portfolio leases is at 17% below market rental rates, which is supportive of continued strong rent growth. We also had an exceptional quarter of development starts. As initially reflected in our press release last month, on top of the $373 million of starts we reported in the press release, at quarter end, we signed another $39 million project in the Tampa's market, which is build-to-suit for an e-commerce retailer. In total, we started 11 projects during the quarter, totaling 3.8 million square feet and $412 million in cost. These projects were 60% preleased with value creation estimated near 40%. We're very - we're also very proud that 3 of the 4 build-to-suits we signed during the quarter was repeat customers. Our development pipeline at quarter end totaled $1.4 billion with 68% allocated to our coastal Tier 1 markets. The pipeline - this pipeline was 65% preleased as of March 31. Looking forward and consistent with the strong fundamentals I discussed and our best-in-class local operating teams, our outlook for new development starts is as strong as it's ever been, as reflected by our revised guidance of over 30% from our original midpoint. I'll also note, we do expect our pipeline preleasing percentage to potentially drop a bit in future quarters as we put fully leased assets in service and start more speculative development projects in high-barrier Tier 1 submarkets where fundamentals are very strong. I'll now turn it over to Nick Anthony to cover acquisitions and disposition. Nicholas Anthony : Thanks, Steve. For the quarter, we sold $94 million of assets comprised of 2 facilities in Houston as well as 2 facilities in Indianapolis owned in a 50-50 joint venture. In turn, we used part of these proceeds to acquire 3 buildings totaling 680,000 square feet for $51 million, including 1 asset in Southern California's IE West submarket and 1 in Northern New Jersey's Meadowlands submarket. The third facility acquired was in the Indianapolis Airport submarket and was part of a joint venture liquidation and asset swap. These buildings were all 100% leased within markets where we expect strong market rent growth that will contribute to long-term IRRs well in excess of the assets we sold. From a strategic positioning standpoint, the net effect of our development, disposition and acquisition activity this quarter moves our coastal Tier 1 exposure to over 42% of GAV. We've begun marketing a few Midwestern assets leased to Amazon for outright sale, while certain assets leased to Amazon in other noncoastal Tier 1 markets may either be sold outright or contributed to a joint venture. In addition, the more recent news on disposition in last night's press release, that we are now marketing for sale our entire 5.2 million-square-foot St. Louis portfolio. The rationale on the sale is threefold. One, we are taking advantage of increased investor demand for logistics assets; two, the portfolio accelerates our strategic objective to increase our exposure to coastal Tier 1 markets; and three, it will provide a source of funds for our increasing development pipeline. As a result, we have raised the midpoint of our full year expected dispositions by $400 million. Altogether, we expect our planned 2021 disposition activity to be weighted toward the middle of the year. I will now turn our call over to Mark to discuss our financial results and guidance update. Mark Denien : Thanks, Nick. Good afternoon, everyone. Core FFO for the quarter was $0.39 per share, which represents 18% growth over the first quarter of 2020. We've been saying for the last few quarters that we expected our core FFO growth rates to accelerate and begin to approach our already strong AFFO growth rates. The results from the current quarter and our revised guidance certainly reflect this. AFFO totaled $140 million for the quarter. Our best-in-class low level of capital expenditures, along with the strong NOI growth, continues to generate significant AFFO growth to reinvest into our business. Our best-in-sector rent collections continued in the first quarter of 2021 with more than 99.9% of rents collected. We have also collected more than 99.9% of April rents. And we now only have $52,000 under deferral arrangements remaining to be collected and had effectively no bad debt expense in the first quarter. Same-property NOI growth on a cash basis for the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020 was 6.3%. The growth in same-property NOI was due to increased occupancy and rent growth as well as the burn-off of free rent compared to the first quarter of 2020. We do expect this growth to moderate for the remainder of the year based on tougher occupancy comps and less free rent burn-off, but to remain strong nonetheless. We finished the quarter with no outstanding borrowings on our own secured line of credit, which we renewed in March and extended through March of 2026, including our extension options. We reduced our borrowing rate by 10 basis points compared to the previous facility. As part of our commitment to corporate responsibility, the credit facility also includes an incremental reduction in borrowing costs as certain sustainability-linked metrics are achieved each year. Our future debt maturities are well sequenced with less than 3% of our total outstanding debt being scheduled to mature prior to the end of 2023. As a result of our strong start to 2021, we announced revised core FFO guidance for 2021 to a range of $1.65 to $1.71 per share compared to the previous range of $1.62 to $1.68 per share. The $1.68 per share midpoint of our revised core FFO guidance represents an over 10% increase over 2020 results. We also announced revised guidance for growth in AFFO on a share adjusted basis to range between 8.0% and 12.3%, with a midpoint of 10.1% compared to the previous range of 5.8% to 10.1%. This increased earnings growth expectation is impressive when considering we are increasing current-year disposition expectations by $400 million to fund development projects that will not contribute to earnings until 2022 and beyond. For same-property NOI growth on a cash basis, we've increased our guidance to a range of 4.1% to 4.9% from the previous range of 3.6% to 4.4%. We continue to outperform our underwriting assumptions for speculative developments, both in the timing of lease-up and in rental rates achieved, and continue to maintain a solid list of build-to-suit projects. Based on this, our revised guidance for development starts is between $950 million and $1.1 billion compared to the previous range of $700 million to $900 million. This increase in development starts will provide a key source of growth in 2022 and beyond. As Nick mentioned, we intend to take advantage of the investment sales market pricing to prefund a significant portion of our development pipeline with an increase in dispositions. Our guidance for dispositions has been revised to between $900 million and $1.1 billion compared to the initial range of $500 million to $700 million. We've updated a couple of other components of our guidance based on our more optimistic outlook as detailed in our range of estimates exhibit, including our supplemental information on our website. I'll now turn it back to Jim for a few closing remarks. James Connor : Thank you, Mark. In closing, a strong economic recovery is unfolding, and numerous secular drivers are continuing to create unparalleled opportunities for our platform to capture growth from rising rental rates, high-margin development opportunities and from raising capital at a very low cost. We're very pleased with our team's execution in the first quarter and now with our expected double-digit growth in core FFO and AFFO. As long as these multiple tailwinds can sustain and as long as the economy continues to recover, we're optimistic we can achieve similar levels of growth for the foreseeable future, that are hopeful it should lead to corresponding increases in our annual quarterly dividend. Thank you for your interest and your support, and we will now open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Don, you can open up the lines, and we'll now take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. First, we go on to the line of Blaine Heck. Blaine Heck : I'll start with Nick. As you mentioned, you guys raised disposition guidance pretty significantly this quarter. Outside of St. Louis, are you guys selling any other portfolios? Or will the rest be more kind of one-off and the sale of the Amazon facilities? And then can you give us any sense of how much pricing has actually changed this year, especially in those kind of secondary markets where I'm assuming most of the dispositions will be? Nicholas Anthony : Yes, Blaine. So most of the other assets are sort of one-offs, a couple of Class B, but mostly long-term credit deals, a lot of them leased to Amazon. So that makes up the rest of it. There's really no portfolios in that guidance number outside of the St. Louis portfolio. As far as pricing goes, we continue to see cap rate compression. It's - the secondary markets have compressed more recently than the coastal markets. But especially some of these Amazon assets, we've been very pleased with the pricing that we're seeing on those transactions as well. So I'd say, over the last 90 days, there's probably been another 25 bps on compression. Blaine Heck : Great. That's really helpful. And then maybe for Jim. Several of your competitors have talked about the rising cost of construction now, not just from increasing land cost, but also the raw materials. Can you just talk about how you guys are dealing with that increase in cost and whether you think rents are rising fast enough to keep yields steady? Or maybe should we expect a temporary dip in yields as the material costs are temporarily elevated? James Connor : Yes. Thanks, Blaine. I'll start and then Steve can give you a little color. We've been dealing with land prices escalating for a number of years now. So that's not anything out of the ordinary. Steel is the latest one, and a lot of people are talking about that. One of the advantages of being a national developer is, a, the number of relationships that we have, the leverage that we have and our team's ability to go out and accelerate some of the design and procurement. So sitting here today, we can comfortably tell you that we have the steel we need to finish everything that's in the development pipeline for the balance of the year. And I think Steve can give a little more color on what some of the local teams are doing. Steven Schnur : Sure, Blaine. I would just tell you, steel is gaining a lot of headlines, lumber is another one. Land has - obviously, as Jim indicated, has been up significantly for a number of years. Rents are certainly keeping pace. Cap rates are helping. I think the bigger concern, I guess, or cautious thing that we pay attention to is the time frames. Steel is pushed from 10 to 12 weeks to probably 24 to 26 weeks. So more upfront cooperation with architects and tenants to get projects started to make sure you can deliver on time. Operator : And next, we go on to the line of John Kim. John Kim : On your spec developments, are you sensing that there's also increasing spec in your markets from public and private developers? And are there any markets where you're concerned that the spec development is escalating quickly? James Connor : Sure. John Kim, I'll tell you, I think we're - there's competition everywhere. I do think the private players, particularly the larger private players, have been active on the merchant development front. Our focus and where we've got our landholdings in the high-barrier markets, I think we indicated in our release that 88% of our land is now in the coastal Tier 1 markets. The competition there, the vacancy rates there many times are less than 2%. So I think we're comfortable with that. I would tell you, in terms of markets we're concerned about our monitoring supply, there's always going to be a handful of submarkets scattered around. But Houston is the one that we - we have no intentions of starting any projects in Houston, but that market needs to shore itself up a bit. John Kim : I know you gave your excuses on why you're exiting St. Louis, but why not go the joint venture routes in that market since that seems to be the strategy with some of the other markets? Nicholas Anthony : This is Nick. The question was, why not JV the St. Louis assets? Generally, we have kept them work. We tried to keep our model more simplistic. And we don't think, strategically, a joint venture there would make as much sense and maybe in some other instances where you could grow it. I just don't know how you - what you would do with it going forward. Operator : And next, we go on to the line of Manny Korchman. Emmanuel Korchman : Maybe this one for Mark. Just thinking about using dispositions for capital funding for the developments versus issuing common stock here. What's sort of more attractive about selling the assets and exiting those markets than just growing through an equity raise? Mark Denien : Well, I guess we're using a little bit of everything, Manny. I mean, we did issue a little bit on our ATM in the first quarter. I guess what I would say, and Nick can follow up on this, the St. Louis exit has sort of been on a list for a while. It's really more of an acceleration, something we were probably going to do down the road anyway. And as our development pipeline opportunities ramped up, we just kind of pulled forward some things that we're going to do anyway. But we'll continue to use a little bit of everything as long as our capital is attractively priced. Nicholas Anthony : Yes. What I would add is this was an opportunity to basically improve our geography going forward and also improve our growth profile going forward just to make - to help improve performance in the future. Emmanuel Korchman : And Nick, I don't know if we've talked about this in a little while, but just can you talk about the pricing differential between single assets or larger single assets and portfolios? Is there a pricing difference? And if so, are you looking at one more than the other? Nicholas Anthony : Well, they're certainly - it's sort of a mixed bag. It's not as black and white as you might think. Obviously, the long-term credit deals are garnering very low cap rates. A lot of them are brand-new, new development. A lot of the portfolio deals that you see out there are a blend of Class A and Class B assets, and a lot of it depends on where the rents are in relation to market. So they generally trade at higher cap rates. And the buyer pool is not necessarily as deep on those because they're a little harder to underwrite and get your hands around. But it is sort of comparing apples and oranges there on those 2 different types. Emmanuel Korchman : So - and then the second part of the question, are you more interested right now in buying some single assets in varied markets versus picking up a portfolio? Nicholas Anthony : We - yes. Typically, on the acquisition side, we focused on 1 to 3 assets at a time because we want to focus on buying what we want, where we want it. So it complements our strategy. Typically, when we've done larger portfolios, we got lucky with the Bridge transaction several years ago because it's all where we wanted it. But typically, what happens on some of these portfolios is you get a lot of assets and locations that you wouldn't normally want to be in, and it creates a lot of friction and noise trying to reposition those portfolios after you get them. Operator : And next, we're going to the line of Jamie Feldman. James Feldman : Great. I think you had mentioned in your earlier comments about sales into a JV, if I heard that right. Can you talk more about the plans there? And is this something that you would keep as kind of a perpetual structure and continue to sell, kind of grow it? Or is this more one-off? Nicholas Anthony : Yes. I mean, we're looking at all the different levers as far as monetizing assets. One of the things that we've talked about is managing our - being prudent about managing our Amazon exposure going forward because we continue to do a significant amount of business with them. And I think their exposure at the end of this quarter is right around 9%. And we'd probably rather be in the 4% to 7% range going forward on that. So there are some assets that maybe we don't want to sell outright because of where they are or what type of asset they are. And we may take advantage of a JV structure in that case. And then that might be something that we can use to monetize future assets similar to that going forward. James Feldman : Okay. Any thoughts on like structure in terms of your stake versus a partner's stake and potential magnitude? Nicholas Anthony : No. I think we're evaluating all that stuff. Obviously, we need to do something - a decent amount of monetization to make sense to manage the Amazon exposure. But we don't have any hard numbers in mind. James Feldman : Okay. Have you started talking to partners? Nicholas Anthony : Yes. We have - we had discussions, but we've always had discussions with partners over the time. We talked to a lot of our existing partners about this whole concept on a regular basis. James Feldman : Okay. Will you consider more of like a fund structure? Or this is... Nicholas Anthony : No. I mean - no. I think historically, we've used more of the JV structure. Could it be a JV with multiple partners? Maybe. But not necessarily a fund structure. James Feldman : Okay. And then just as - here we are at kind of a unique time in the economy where things are picking up. Any anecdotes about kind of new types of tenants leasing space? Anything that kind of stands out from the quarter that might be different than what you've talked about in the past? Steven Schnur : No, Jamie, this is Steve. I don't think so. I think 3PLs continue to be very, very active. And I think that's centered around e-commerce. It's also centered around the theme you've been hearing about for a while with inventory redundancy. So that's probably the most active. 3PLs have always been active, but I think right now is they've sort of taken over the lead by a wide margin over anyone else. Operator : And next, we go on to the line of Nick Yulico. Nicholas Yulico : Just a question on kind of your pricing strategy right now. Because it looks like your tenant retention has picked up this year versus last year. It's obviously a good thing for occupancy, raise that guidance. But I guess I'm just wondering how you're kind of approaching pricing discussions with renewals, whether you're willing to deal with a little bit more frictional vacancy there to push pricing in your portfolio. Steven Schnur : Sure, Nick. This is Steve. Yes. We're - it's a case-by-case basis, but we are certainly pushing the envelope. I think this quarter, we did not have very much role on the coasts. So our results, which we were happy with on the rent growth side, I think there's some upward trajectory to what we'll do the rest of the year. We're continuing to push rents. We're having some difficult conversations. They aren't easy conversations, but we're willing to take some space back if we need to. Nicholas Yulico : Okay. Just second question is on the development land, where I know you have - give a book basis, but 88% of that is your listing here as being in coastal Tier 1 markets. Maybe you could just give us some sort of perspective on how much - I know we keep hearing land prices are going up substantially. You have a very big Southern California land bank. Maybe just a little bit of perspective on where you think the land is really worth on a market basis for all of your land held for development. Steven Schnur : Yes. We just looked at that. It's in the low 40s mark-to-market. So we have quite a bit of upside in our landholdings. Nicholas Yulico : You said, sorry, it's about 40% higher than the book value? Steven Schnur : The market value is, yes, over our book value. Correct. Operator : And next, we go on to the line of Caitlin Burrows. Caitlin Burrows : So you're obviously very active in development now. You started $800 million in 2020, and 2021 guidance is for over $1 billion at the midpoint. So I was just wondering, do you believe there is runway for the '21 volumes to continue and that's from both a demand perspective and also your ability to get land and complete projects in the target markets? James Connor : Yes, Caitlin, I would tell you, as I kind of tried to reference in my closing remarks, if the economy continues to recover, as it certainly is indicating it has, and we're able to achieve the kind of GDP growth in the second half of the year that most of the leading banks are projecting, yes, we think next year is going to be a very, very good year. And we should have ample opportunity to do a comparable level of volume. Caitlin Burrows : Okay. Great. And then I think just following up on one of the recent questions on the key assumptions that you guys have at the end of the supplement. It does mention that you're willing to push rents at the expense of some occupancy, which I think makes sense given high occupancy. But we haven't yet seen that play out in the leasing spread. So obviously, they're high, but versus last quarter or even a year ago, not as high. So just wondering, do you think we should expect to see the leasing spreads rise in the near future? Or would that take a little bit longer to play out? Mark Denien : Let me start that, Caitlin. This is Mark. One thing we've been talking a lot about where the leases we have that are rolling where they're located, over 40% of our NOI now are in the coastal markets. This quarter, it just so happened that only about 10% of our roll was in the coastal markets. So I think that we're still very happy with 12% plus or minus cash and almost 30 gap when 90% of that roll were in noncoastal markets. You won't see us get to the 40% roll that our portfolio looks like for a few years down the road. But I think you will see us pushing closer to 20% to 25% of our roll. For the next year, 1.5 years, we'll start to be more in those coastal markets. So that does give us the opportunity to get those rates up even higher than what they were this quarter. I don't know if Steve wants to add anything to that. But just a little point on where the - I think it's important to know where the roll was. And when 90% of our noncoastal markets we still achieve those numbers, we're pretty happy with that. Operator : And next, we're going to the line of Vince Tibone. Vince Tibone : Could you discuss how your market rent growth expectations this year differ between coastal market, Tier 1, noncoastal markets and the remainder of your portfolio? James Connor : Sure. Vince, I'll take a stab. I'll tell you, I think there's - clearly, the numbers that get published are on a macro basis. You really need to dig into the individual submarkets. I think some of the high-barrier infill coastal markets are pushing high single-digit rent growth, if not double digit. I think in the center part of the country, where you have less barriers to supply, you're probably in the lower single digits. That probably averages out to that 6% to 7% rent growth that we've been seeing from CBRE. So I don't know if that - hopefully, that answers your question. There is obviously discrepancy by availability of supply. Vince Tibone : That's really helpful. And just any difference between some of the coastal markets like New Jersey versus SoCal, anyone standing out? Or are they kind of similar in this high single-digit range? James Connor : I think the two markets you indicated are extremely active, very low vacancy rates, very little new supply being added that's not being absorbed quickly. And so those two markets are doing really well. I think Seattle continues to perform well. There was - I'd say Northern California had a bit of a slowdown. I think it was more affected, COVID-related, but seems to be coming back pretty strong with what we have there. Vince Tibone : Got it. I think that's really helpful. If I could squeeze one more in. Can you just provide a little color on the pricing and marketing process on the Houston dispositions? Just curious, given some of the challenges in that market, how does that differ from some of the other dispositions you're marketing? Nicholas Anthony : Vic, this is Nick. You said Houston dispositions? Vince Tibone : Yes. Just curious if that - we've seen weaker demand there, weaker pricing compared to some of the other regions. Nicholas Anthony : Fortunately for us, they were long-term leases with Amazon, so it was a great experience. The buyer pools were very deep, and the pricing was very good, like we're seeing across the country. So that was obviously the reason why those went well for us. Vince Tibone : Got it. And is Houston a long-term hold for you? Or is that something you could potentially consider exiting as well similar to St. Louis? Nicholas Anthony : No. I think we're cognizant of our exposure there, but we have no plans to exit Houston in the future. So we just keep an eye on it and manage it. Operator : And next, we go on to the line of Mike Mueller. Michael Mueller : Two quick ones here. First, what's the difference between the Amazon assets that you're looking to sell outright versus what you would consider to put in the JV? And then second, when you're thinking about your in-process development pipeline, is there a max level or some sort of cap that you want to stay under? Nicholas Anthony : Mike, this is Nick. I'll take the first part, and I'm sure Steve will take the second part. In terms of what we're looking to sell outright versus joint venture, it's primarily location-driven for the most part. Generally, it's the growth profile of the asset. So if it's an asset that has a good embedded rent growth and a market that has good prospective rent growth going forward, we're probably more likely to put it in the JV versus sell it outright. So that's generally how we've looked at it. And then the second part of your question... Steven Schnur : Yes. The second part of your question on the development opportunities, obviously, developing at the margins we are, the more we can do, the better. I think we pay attention to what our exposure is relative to the overall size of our company, and we're at roughly 9% now. I think we'd start to get nervous if we were 12%, 13%, something like that. Operator : And next, we go on to the line of Dave Rodgers. David Rodgers : Steve, maybe a question on lease rate growth. You talked about it by geography, but maybe just some color on the size and what you're seeing in terms of the rate growth across core portfolio in the last quarter or so. Steven Schnur : Yes, Dave, this is Steve. You're a little broken up, but I think you asked about lease rates by size and maybe location. I would tell you, for us, again, the portfolio that we operate, our best-performing size segment this past quarter was 100 million to 250 million. I think historically, going back the last, call it, 6 or 8 quarters, it'd be - I would tell you, it's tended to be better on larger size. So I would expect that to be the case this year based on the demand we're seeing. It's hard with 1 quarter into the year to read much into that. But for us, the large-size segment continues to be the most active. David Rodgers : Great. And then I think coming into - and sorry, I do have a bad connection, but I think coming into the year, you guys have talked about losing some tenants early on that would roll out. Obviously, you had a little bit of that. But did that all hit in the first quarter? Do we expect to see any of that moving into the second quarter? Or were you guys just successful at kind of stepping in and backfilling a lot of those leases fairly quickly to start the year? Mark Denien : Yes, Dave, this is Mark. Yes, at the end of last year on the January call, I guess, we talked about 4 or 5 tenants. And I guess, first off, I'd say these were not significant tenants, but there were 4 or 5, we were basically in the process of trying to get evicted and re-tenant that space. So the good news is all of that space has been backfilled. In fact, a couple of those tenants actually got current on their rent and went through some M&A transactions themselves. Got current, they're going to stay in the space after all. Another couple of them, the other half, I would say, we've now got out of the space. We've got leases signed to backfill it. There probably will be some downtime in rent here in the second quarter, but the leases are all signed, and we should be back up full running with better rents and better credit obviously come Q3. Operator : And next, we go on to the line of Rich Anderson. Richard Anderson : So I wanted to ask about the Amazon commentary, obviously, selling to get your percentage down. What is - what's scary about 12% Amazon? I mean, I could think of a lot worse tenants to be - have a 12% exposure, too. I mean, is that coming - kind of who's driving that decision? Is it just intuitive about your part or participants in Duke Realty outside of you that want to - whether the rating agencies, I don't know who it could be, are sort of driving a decision to lose some of that concentration? Or is it just a natural observation on your part? James Connor : Well, Rich, it's Jim. I'll start out and give you my perspective. Nick can chime in. I sleep very well at night with the amount of Amazon exposure we have, given their credit profile and their growth. But part of it is input from the rating agencies and managing that. Part of it is, as Steve alluded to earlier, we have a very active development and leasing pipeline with Amazon. So left unfettered, that number is just going to continue to grow at a very, very rapid pace. And what Nick's guys are able to do, as he detailed to one of the earlier questions, is pull out the assets that have probably the lowest escalations, are in the markets where we have the least amount of upside, so to speak, and select those for outright sales and some for the joint venture. And some are in the infill markets that we work really, really hard to get a hold of. And those are incredibly valuable assets, and we want to hold those for the long term. So Nick, you can add [indiscernible]. Nicholas Anthony : Yes, I think that's right. And we're just - we're trying to be prudent in our diversification of our overall portfolio in terms of assets, geography and tenant exposure. So we're just trying to maintain a good balance. Richard Anderson : Yes, I understand. I'm just being [indiscernible]. Nicholas Anthony : Yes. We're not afraid of it. Richard Anderson : Yes. Okay. And then second question is perhaps a little somber one with the events in Indianapolis at the FedEx facility. I just wonder if there was any response from the community of industrial real estate owners about enhanced security or anything. I don't know what you could have really done, but I'm just curious if there was any necessary reaction on the part of not just you, but your peers. James Connor : Yes, Rich, I'll make a couple of high-level comments. I will tell you that the amount of interaction that our local operating teams have had with our tenants, starting well over a year ago in helping them manage COVID protocols and enhancing the environment for the safety of their associates. Second, the work that we've done with our own people in the development of our buildings because the number of people that we have on site when we're building a building. So those increased protocols and safety in general. So I won't say that any of it is in reaction to horrible events like what we saw at the FedEx facility. But I will tell you, the amount of interaction on all of those subjects with our tenants is probably double today from what it was 18 months ago. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Next, we go on to the line of Brent Dilts. Brent Dilts : Great. In the prepared remarks, you made some comments on inventory to sales levels. So could you talk about how large a safety stock buffer might ultimately get built in? 5% to 10% is frequently thrown about. So I'm just curious what you guys think. Steven Schnur : Yes. I think - well, I would tell you, we read the same research reports that you guys do, and I think 5% to 10% seems to be what everyone talks about, which translates somewhere in the neighborhood of 0.5 billion square feet of demand. We see cases of it every day now, where we're talking to - whether it's retailers, e-commerce groups, a lot of the 3PL activity. Transportation costs are going to rise significantly with the new administration and a lot of things going on. And I think you're going to see more distribution to offset transportation costs, more distribution points around the country to offset transportation costs. We're seeing some of the production start to move back to North America and Central America, which I think will lead to more suppliers needing space here. So as Jim indicated, a lot of tailwinds in our back right now. James Connor : Yes, Brent, I would just add just one other point. Even the impact of the incident at the Suez Canal, and while that doesn't necessarily impact logistics and shipping to the U.S., it just reinforces the need for these major companies to have additional safety stock because of the vulnerability we all have, given incidents that can happen anywhere in the globe. So this is not a passing trend. This is something that we're going to deal with, obviously, very positive for our sector, but for the next 2 to 3 years. Brent Dilts : Yes. Okay. And then just one other one on dispositions. I know you already talked about pricing, but could you talk about buyer types in the market? Are you seeing anything interesting as far as like a shift in domestic versus international or investment firms versus peers, things like that? Nicholas Anthony : Yes. This is Nick. We have seen a change there. Obviously, a lot of the normal usual suspects we see in the bidder pools. But we've also seen a lot of new names pop up. Some of them are high net worth family offices. Some of them are sovereign-based, Spanish, Latin America, what have you. Some of them are rotating - or a lot of these are rotating out of other asset classes into our asset class. So there is an increased investor base that's looking for these assets in these bidder pools, for sure. Operator : And next, we go on to the line of Jason Idoine. Jason Idoine : Just touching on one of the points that you just brought up. So you talked about some of the repatriation that could happen with manufacturing and production and people bringing some of that back to the United States, I guess. Is that activity picking up significantly? Or how has that been trending more recently? Steven Schnur : Yes. Jason, this is Steve. There's - I think we're starting to see some of that. Obviously, that takes a long time when you're talking about changing production from China to other locations. But you're starting to see some headlines. I know Walmart had a recent announcement about some of the production they're trying to bring back. And it may not be manufacture of goods, but the way goods are assembled, the way they're packaged, coming back, reshoring. So I know Northern Mexico, we don't operate there. But obviously, our Texas folks and California folks deal with goods coming in from there. That activity has been pretty significant. You talked to some of the folks in those markets, and that activity is starting to hit in Northern Mexico right now. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And there are no more questions in queue. James Connor : Thanks, Don. I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today. We look forward to engaging with many of you throughout the rest of the year. Don, you may disconnect the line. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Conferencing Service. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, we will have a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] It\u2019s now my pleasure to hand the conference over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Tracy Ward. Tracy, I hand it to you. Tracy Ward : Thanks, Holly, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. I would like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under Federal Securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates, as well as management\u2019s beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings.  Additionally, our second quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures, and in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. This morning, we will hear from Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover results, real-time market conditions and guidance. Hamid Moghadam, Gary Anderson, Chris Caton, Mike Curless, Dan Letter, Ed Nekritz, Gene Reilly and Colleen McEwan are also here with us today. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom. Tom, will you please begin? Tom Olinger : Thank you, Tracy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. The second quarter exceeded our expectations both in terms of our results and outlook for 2021 and beyond. With our exceptional portfolio and teams, we set high watermarks across several measures this quarter. Demand for space is robust and diverse and market conditions remained the healthiest in our 38-year history.  In the second quarter, lease signings were 64 million square feet and lease proposals were 84 million square feet, both remain above average and were driven by new and development leasing. Likewise, the Prologis IBI Customer Activity Index reached a new high in the second quarter, an early indicator of strong future demand. Our leasing mix is broad. Currently, the greatest demand is for spaces above 100,000 square feet. For smaller spaces, activity is picking up. We signed 518 leases totaling 18 million square feet in the quarter, the highest volume in this segment in three years.  For customer segments, e-commerce continues to lead the way, representing 30% of new lease signings in the second quarter. While Amazon remains steady at 6% of total new leasing, we have seen many more e-commerce players come to the table. For example, we signed 168 new e-commerce leases in the first half of 2021 versus 53 in the first half of last year. Supply chains are raising, beginning to restock. And as they view, we\u2019ll create more demand going forward. Containerized imports are up 33% through May versus pre-pandemic levels, as retailers replenished their supply chains. While inventories have risen 3% from their trough, they have struggled to grow this year as retain sales are up 19% from pre-pandemic levels. We see the current low level of inventories on our space utilization, which at 84.3% is below the long-term average of 85%. This is yet another sign that our customers are operating with suboptimal levels of inventory.  Putting together the recent outperformance and ongoing momentum, we are raising our 2021 U.S. forecast for net absorption by 20% to 360 million square feet and deliveries by 8% to 325 million square feet. Looking forward, we foresee continued supply balanced by demand with historic low vacancy of 4.5% carrying into 2022. With balanced demand and supply, acute scarcity in our markets is driving record rents and value growth, while operating portfolio lease percentage rose by 80 basis points to 97.2% at quarter-end.  Customers continue to compete for space and are making decisions faster with lease gestation in the quarter of just 44 days. When we look at the factors impacting supply, significant barriers exists in our markets and include a lack of buyable land, increasingly difficult and expensive permitting and entitlement processes and rapidly escalating replacement cost. Our research team released an excellent paper on this last month, which you can find on our website. Our supply watch list remains quite small. We reviewed Houston in the quarter leaving just Spain and Poland. Accelerating demand in the quarter, combined with ultra low vacancies, translated to a very strong rent growth of 4.1% in our U.S. markets exceeding our expectations. As a result, we are raising our 2021 rent forecast an all-time high of 10.3% for the U.S., up approximately 40 basis points from our prior estimate and 8% globally, which is up 300 basis points. Our in-place to market rent spread is now the widest in our history at 16.9%, up 330 basis points sequentially. This represents future gas in the tank of nearly $700 million in NOI, or $0.90 per share.  Turning to valuations. Our assets have strongest quarterly uplift in our history, rising 8% in the second quarter alone, with the U.S. up more than 10% and Europe up 5.6%. On the topic of valuation, I want to point out that we enhanced the NAV disclosure in our supplemental related to property management fees.  Given the size and scale of our portfolio, we created substantial value through our operational advantages. As a result, we know that real estate is worth more in our hands. Accordingly, we are now including net property management fee income as the bone in the adjusted NOI in our NAV disclosure. Switching gears to results for the quarter, our team and portfolio continued to deliver excellent financial results. Core FFO was $1.01 per share, with net promote earnings effectively zero, rent change on rollover was 32%. Occupancy at quarter-end was 96.8%, up 110 basis points sequentially.  Cash same-store NOI growth accelerated to 5.8%, 290 basis points year-over-year. We tapped into favorable market conditions and disposed of $880 million of non-strategic assets across our portfolio.  In addition, just last week, we completed the sale of a $920 million owned and managed portfolio, including all of the non-strategic IPT assets. It\u2019s worth noting that to date, we have sold $2 billion of non-strategic assets from our IPT and LPT acquisitions at pricing more than 23% above underwriting. Turning to strategic capital. Our team raised almost $600 million in the second quarter. Equity cues from our open-ended vehicles were $3.3 billion at quarter end, hitting another all-time high. Robust investor interest has prompted private equity limited partners to shift away from diversify to more sector-specific funds, particularly for the logistics sector. In light of recent asset management transactions and public cost, the value being ascribed to our strategic capital business is uniquely understated. For the balance sheet, we continue to maintain excellent financial strength with liquidity and combined leverage capacity between Prologis and our open-ended vehicles totaling $14 billion. Moving to guidance for 2021. Our outlook has further improved given higher rent growth, higher valuations and robust demand. Here are the key updates on an our share basis. We are increasing our cash same-store NOI growth midpoint by 75 basis points to now range between 5.25% and 5.75%. We expect bad debt expense to be approximately 10 basis points of gross revenues, down from our prior guidance midpoint of 20 basis points and well below our historical average. We are increasing the midpoint for strategic capital revenue, excluding promotes, to $470 million, up $15 million from prior guidance. This upward revision is due to increased asset management fees resulting from higher property values. Faster development lease-up and higher asset values are also leading to an increase in promotes. We now expect net promote income of $0.02 for this year, an increase of $0.04 from our prior guidance. We are also increasing development starts by $300 million and now expect a midpoint of $3.2 billion. Build-to-suits will comprise more than 40% of development volume. Our owned and managed land portfolio, which is composed of land, options, and covered land place supports $18 billion of future development over the next several years. We are also increasing the midpoint for dispositions and contributions by $650 million in total. This increase will have roughly a $0.02 drag on earnings this year, given the timing to redeploy incremental proceeds.  We now expect to generate net deployment sources of $200 million at the midpoint, with leverage remaining effectively flat in 2021. Taking these assumptions into account, we are increasing our core FFO midpoint by $0.07 and narrowing the range to $4.04 to $4.08 per share. Core FFO, excluding promotes, will range between $4.02 and $4.06 per share, representing year-over-year growth at the midpoint of almost 13%. We continue to maintain exceptional dividend coverage and our 2021 guidance implies a payout ratio in the low 60% range and free cash flow after dividends of $1.3 billion. In closing, the first half of the year has been extraordinary and our outlook is equally promising. Visibility into our strong future organic earnings potential is very clear. We have a significant embedded in-place to market rent spread, the development-ready land portfolio, substantial balance sheet capacity and ability to create value for our customers beyond the real estate. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Holly for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question is going to come from the line of Steve Sakwa, Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Good morning out there. Maybe Tom or Hamid, I was just wondering if you could spend a little more time just talking about some of the demand drivers across some of the various subsectors and maybe regionally, I know Europe, maybe grew a little bit faster, but maybe just provide a little more context around which businesses and which regions you are seeing the most demand in? Chris Caton : Hey, Steve, it\u2019s Chris Caton. I am going to jump in with a few highlights and then, I think, Gene will share some color. I think there are three or four demand trends that represent themselves. The first is broadly the diversification of e-commerce. So, internationalization of the major players or small and mid-size players stepping up.  The second is the growth leaders of last year are leasing safe. Think about food companies, pharmaceuticals, and durable goods companies. The third trend would be supply chain resilience. For example, we see the core markets are among the strongest they\u2019ve ever been. So, you have several clear themes playing through demand. Gene Reilly : Yes. So, Steve, the only thing I would add to that is, if you want to get some geographic color is, coastal markets are definitely doing better. You look at the U.S., Southern California and New Jersey by far I think have the strongest demand dynamics. But I\u2019d also say that it\u2019s very difficult to find a weak market globally, no matter where they are, in the Latin America, Europe, the U.S. There is strength in demand really everywhere. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is going to come from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citi. Emmanuel Korchman : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Chris, maybe just another one for you. But you spoke about broad-based demand. But is the specific demand from, especially e-commerce customers changing at all? Are they kind of willing to get whatever they can or are they being more specific as to what they want? Are they pinpointing markets? Is it a wider sort of tapers of demand? Can you help us figure out what they are actually asking for when they come to you? Chris Caton : Yes. So, the message on e-commerce is actually, it\u2019s very diverse. And I think if you look across the maturity of different organizations, they all want something slightly different. So, if you have a large international player, I do think they are getting much more pinpointed. We\u2019ve seen a lot of growth, for example, in the last such sub-markets.  There is a lot of focus on shortening those delivery times. But more mid-size organizations might be in an adjacent location or in a regional location to still build out the basic infrastructure for executing online. Operator : And our next question is going to come from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Caitlin Burrows : Hi. Good morning, team. I was just wondering if you could talk maybe about development of Prologis is obviously an active developer. You increase your guidance for development starts and stabilizations and also the contributions. So, could you give some detail on how you think about your development businesses, valuation? How the developing gains are related to that and how it might be different than peers\u2019 activity? I know that\u2019s a lot. Tom Olinger : Hey, Caitlin, thanks for your questions. This is Tom. I\u2019ll take a first shot at that. I think there are several aspects of our development business that are quite unique. The first I would just think looking at the size of that portfolio $18 billion of build out, almost 20% of our market cap. And that portfolio was very focused in our high barrier markets at which we operate. So we\u2019ve got a land bank that we can build out.  A very, very high quality portfolio that\u2019s in high demand. It\u2019s very diversified across 19 different countries and it\u2019s a huge opportunity set that our development platform has to build out and just having the menu to seek the best returns and to solve customers\u2019 problems across all of those different markets is a huge advantage. And I think that leads to just the durability of those development gains. So if you look at our track record, we\u2019ve got a track record of 20 years, developing $37 billion of assets, 20% unlevered IRR and we did those results verified externally by Duff & Phelps, by the way, but -so anincredibletrack record of durability. So, when you look at the $18 billion of build out, our history of being able to continue to develop at very, very attractive rates, there is a very, very long runway of opportunity that\u2019s just presented in front of us. And then, to your point on realized gains, I think it\u2019s another point that makes sense quite unique that given our capital structure and how it works, how we want to structure the vast majority of our assets outside the U.S. are held in funds, but we are developing the vast majority of those assets on balance sheet Europe, in Japan, Mexico. And those assets, with very few exceptions, are contributing into our funds. So there is a real crystallization of those gains. So, when you think about the 20% unlevered IRRs all that development, the vast majority of those gains were realized in cash and that\u2019s a real cash flow. That \u2013 it\u2019s part of your AFFO and should be embedded in your valuation. I think when we look at valuation in particular for development, I think, it is a very scattershot approach because there is a couple of different things you have to do. Obviously, you\u2019ve got the CIP that\u2019s in front of you. You got to face that and value that. You got your land bank, in our case, $18 billion that you have to value.  And there is also residual for this platform, right? This platform has a history of $37 billion and 20% unlevered IRRs. There is a value here. So, I think you can put those all together. There is different ways to do it, obviously. But I would just encourage you to take a look at the cash flows that this thing generates historically. And I think you are going to find the valuation for our development capabilities are, I would say, significantly undervalued. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Craig Mailman : Hey, everyone. I appreciate the update there and where you think market rent growth is and clearly your net absorption stats as well. Just looks like we are still at equilibrium. But I am just curious, did you guys talk to tenants and kind of continue to push through rents or maybe even accelerate that? How does the conversation changed now with labor shortages continuing and maybe even getting a little bit worse places and just gas prices continue to rise and impacted the transportation side? I mean, are rents even how high up on the list are they at this point? Maybe update us on how many deals you are losing as a result of rent versus other factors? Those are few questions. Gene Reilly : Yes. This is, Gene. So, I\u2019ll take that. So I think you are \u2013 if you look at the conversations we are having with customers and what their pain points are relative \u2013 excuse me. Hamid Moghadam : Gene is having a little bit of issue with the access to it. So, let me cover while he \u2013 there is a sort of. So the conversations are mostly around labor. That is absolutely a pain point. But there is an ability to push through our pricing today, because when you have retail sales jump 20% from pre-pandemic levels and God knows what percent from pandemic levels. And the supply chain is dry and there is very little probability of losing that piece of business, because people are flushed with cash and out there spending money. I think this is going to continue for a while. So, basically, everybody\u2019s hair is on fire trying to keep up with demand. And Mike, any additional color on that? Mike Curless : Yes. I think one way you can really represent this is the fact that we\u2019ve had more customers competing over space than we\u2019ve seen ever before and that creates some difficult situations. So we always start with transparency with both parties. But I got to tell you the rent becomes a very minor discussion just the availability and accessibility of that space becomes the priority. So I think that\u2019s a good description of what we are seeing out there in terms of the customers\u2019 priorities. Tom Olinger : Craig, I wish we were losing more deals because of rent, because we actually look at that on a quarterly basis by geography and the number is under 5%, which to me it means we may not be pushing rents enough. So, in a way, the fact that we are not losing those deals to rents may not be such a great bank. Gene Reilly : There is - Let me jump in here and continue with my point. But with respect to gas prices, that pretty much makes location on the more important. So I think that\u2019s probably a tailwind with respect to rents. Operator : And our next question is going to come from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just maybe wanted to build upon comments around the strategic capital business. You referenced several times the power of the business and potentially being undervalued. I am assuming that\u2019s on the equity side. As I talk to my colleagues who cover the asset managers, there is clearly different multiples that you use to value some of these larger or asset management platforms.  So maybe you can unpack this for us a little bit in terms of the power of the business; the more focused customer base you are seeing that are focused on logistics-only platforms and then just the valuation, that\u2019d be really helpful? Tom Olinger : Yes, Vikram, it\u2019s Tom. I will take that first. So, I think let\u2019s start with that business and how that business has grown. If you look over the last five years, any land and revenues of that business has grown 18%, some 18% CAGR. More importantly, the EBITDA or cash flow that that business is generating has grown by 26% CAGR, so incredible growth.  As we look forward, just given what we are seeing, I think the opportunities are there for very strong continued EBITDA growth. So I think that\u2019s a baseline I would think about there. A highly, highly scalable business for what we do. And relative to valuation, there have been I think clarity around valuation in this business. It has never been better because there has been several transactions that have cleared the market lately and you can certainly look at public comps. I think for us, you need to look at the alternative asset managers as the right place to start. And while there are a lot of different ways, I think analysts and investors are looking at multiple, but when you work through it all for the alternative of those and the comps we are seeing, you are going to see multiples in the mid-20s on earnings and those include promotes. So when you strip out promotes, you are seeing for the best alternative asset managers a multiple of 30 or higher, and they are getting an x on promotes. So, yes, that would tell you our business is - I would say, very undervalued, because as you are thinking about how we compare to them, I think you need to think about the stickiness of our AUM. 90% plus of our AUM is in long life or perpetual vehicles.  We talked about the growth profile that we have and then clearly, there is incredible investor demand for our product, which is also lining up to support growth. Our equity queue at quarter end was $3.3 billion, an all-time high. So, happy to get into more discussions with you all on this going forward. But lot of good visibility out there on valuation. Chris Caton : Yes. I would add two things, which we sort of assume that are important. First the business\u2019 scale. It\u2019s a $60 billion plus business. I mean, that puts us among the top real estate asset managers anywhere by any measure and we are focused on one property type. So that\u2019s a pretty significant market share in the most desirable market. So that\u2019s place to the premium. And also, I would say, we have the longest history of actually producing these returns that goes back to AMD\u2019s early days in the mid-80s. So, both in terms of longevity, the quality of the income stream, these are not a bunch of closed-end funds that expire. These are, as Tom pointed out, very sticky and long-lived cash flow streams.  I would argue that they have more leverage on the upside than the real estate cash flows that support that business because of the fee and promote structure. So, for the life of me, I don\u2019t really understand why they are being valued the way they are, but we are going to do a better job of explaining that to people who follow this business, because we are honestly getting a lot of receptivity from those investors that really understand this sector. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Jamie Feldman : Thank you. Following up to the last question, $14 billion of investment capacity, we\u2019ve seen a good amount of large portfolios trade the last few years, but clearly pricing is getting more and more dear. How should we think about your ability to do large-scale transactions to keep growing that business through acquisition? Tom Olinger : We do not care one iota about external growth and through M&A. It is \u2013 that is no skill of the management team. Just multiple conversion and dismiss that fair that our size prevents us from growing fast.  I would just invite people to look at the numbers and you can strip out the M&A from that. So M&A is opportunistic. It\u2019s never part of our business plan and if we never had another dollar of M&A, outplay our growth rate against anybody else\u2019s in any center frankly over time. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Thank you. Given the increase you\u2019ve had in valuations this quarter, I was wondering if you could provide an updated view on exit cap rates and that spread between exit and going in yields when you and your partners are looking at investments? Hamid Moghadam : Well, historically we pencil in a 50 basis point \u2013 used to pencil in a 50 basis point increase in the residual calculation based on our rents projections and alike. But I think 50 basis points when cap rates were 9% was quite a bit and when the cap rates are in the mid-3s, that\u2019s even a great deal more on a relative basis. So, we are mostly using about a 25% increase in residual calculations ten years out. But again, we are an infinite life vehicle. When you invest in our REIT, you don\u2019t \u2013 we just sell non-strategic assets. We don\u2019t sell our other assets that we like. You look at the dividends or the cash flow that comes off those assets and the growth rate of those assets that translates into a very nice overall IRR, which is really the fundamental driver of value in our business. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Jon Petersen with Jefferies. Jonathon Petersen : Great. Thanks. You guys in your press release mentioned that cash same-store NOI growth in the international portfolio was higher than U.S., which I think is kind of a flip from what we\u2019ve seen in recent years. But I look at occupancy the occupancy is still growing faster in the U.S. So, maybe you could just talk about what\u2019s driving that higher international growth? Gene Reilly : Yes. Tom, I\u2019ll take that. I think part of it is driven by strong results in other Americas and Europe was also strong. I think it\u2019s more of a reflection of a easier comp in Q2 of 2020 than everything else. But listen, I think longer term, I mean, by and large, particularly in Europe, the cap rates have dropped further in Europe over the last several years. That\u2019s been more of a headwind on rent growth and I would expect, going forward, we are going to see whether it\u2019s next year, the year after that, but we are going to see growth in our international markets to be on par if not better than our U.S. markets. Tom Olinger : Yes, I would also say that land is very difficult in the U.S. but it\u2019s even more difficult in Europe because the government is a much bigger actor in allocating land out and they really tie it to employment and they are not wild about logistics. So land supply is just that much more difficult. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Blaine Heck : Great. Thanks. So we noticed turnover costs on leases ticked up this quarter and those costs as a percentage of lease value have been trending up over the last four quarters as has free rents. Just given the context of you guys having the highest demand you\u2019ve ever seen, those increase, that increase seems somewhat counter-intuitive. So, can you just give some color on what might be driving that increase? And how we should think about those concessions going forward? Tom Olinger : Blaine, this is Tom. That\u2019s a good observation. What is driving that over the last four quarters and particularly in the second quarter is higher levels of new leasing. So new leasing in Q2 versus Q1 increased 40% sequentially. And new leases generally come with slightly higher concessions, slightly higher turnover costs as a result, but the key is we are looking at long-term economics. So, yes, there is a little bit of short-term pain with that but we are getting in what we believe to be a better cash flow and higher rents. So, I think that\u2019s the key. We are looking at the long-term economics here and we are getting at.  I do think, in clearly, over the last four quarters, we\u2019ve seen much higher levels of new leasing than in the past, I think that\u2019s going to moderate a bit going forward. But we are looking at the long-term end game here and it\u2019s clearly the right economic decision to make. Gene Reilly : Yes. The other issue you should keep in mind is that we are pushing rents a lot harder than we were before. So, likely to replace existing customers with the most efficient customers that have the highest value chain and the ability to pay. So, that reshuffle has been accelerated in the last 12, 24 months. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll : Yes. I wanted to touch back on the earlier comments regarding the broadening out of tenant interest, specifically from e-commerce players, I guess. When you say you are seeing more demand from the smaller players, are these companies that are looking to insource their logistics needs versus outsourcing it to 3PLs or did they already have an insource network and they are just looking to expand it right now or is a little bit of both? Mike Curless : Hey. This is Mike. It\u2019s certainly a little bit of both. I think the bigger story here is, we get asked a lot of questions about is it all about Amazon? And while they\u2019ve been very steady and robust in terms of their activity with us this year with actually plenty of back-end activity coming up in the next couple of quarters.  The bigger takeaway is what Tom said in the earnings front-end here were the other customers. Last year, we leased about 50 non-Amazon \u2013 50 leases to non-Amazon e-com players. This time fast forward, the number is three times as high and it\u2019s a wide variety of smaller and larger customers. There is some big brand names in there like walmart.com or MercadoLibre in Latin America, JD.com. But the bigger story is, there is over 150 of these smaller, more diversified players using a combination of insourcing and outsourcing. We really like that diversification there and again, the story is just not all about Amazon. Tom Olinger : I think there is a frenzy on playing catch-up that that is creating a lot of activity. I mean, I think people - if anything the pandemic sort of suggested that they can take business as usual in a very incremental approach with respect to their e-commerce strategy and now they are realizing how important it is and they are just pedal to the metal and that\u2019s showing up in our 3PL leasing statistics as well. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Mike Mueller with J.P. Morgan. Mike Mueller : Yes. Hi. Can you talk a little bit about your development margins on spec versus build-to-suit? And do you think we could see the mix, which I think you said is about 40% this year drift down further? Gene Reilly : Yes. Mike, this is Gene. I think the \u2013 I think that\u2019s going to hold. In fact, I think we might see ultimately a higher build-to-suit percentage. And I\u2019d be careful looking at the comparison of margins between build-to-suit and spec, because the mix has an awful lot to do with it. How long the transaction has taken to negotiate has something to do with it.  But I think in both cases, you can expect margins to creep up. We have cost increasing on us on the construction side. But we have return compression and rent growth that\u2019s ahead of our underwriting expectations and that overwhelms the cost increases. So I think, generally going to see margins expand. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Dave Rodgers with Baird. Dave Rodgers : Hi, there. Maybe to start with Mike or Gene. Wanted to ask on the inventory and the sales topics that you guys mentioned earlier. Obviously, the big increase in sales and inventory is not keeping up. I guess, when you talk to the customers, what are they trying to solve for from an inventory to sales perspective maybe how does that vary between industries, if at all?  And I guess, how do they take into consideration may be interest cost with interest going down? Does that change kind of their willingness to carry even more inventory in the near-term? Those kind of - type of conversations and any color would be helpful. Chris Caton : Hey, Dave, it\u2019s Chris Caton. I\u2019ll kick it off. So first off, as has been shared a few times, right now it\u2019s fulfillment by any means necessary. Trying to get goods into the country. Look, inventories are down 10% from pre-pandemic levels. And so, it\u2019s really just a race to get levels in. As it relates to resilience, I do think we are starting to see this, but I think the specific numbers of people are looking at.  They are not yet at the strategic planning phase they are much more tactically focused on fixing their supply chains this year. Refresh up in our supply chain conference four days ago, 75% of people we spoke with, they had a poll survey said increasing inventories do have resilience related issues with top of mind and we are starting to see that play out. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street. Vince Tibone : Hi. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on significant increase in your U.S. market rent growth forecast. I just wanted to get a little more color on which markets you are seeing the greatest improvement in fundamentals and reviews last quarter? And also just hear how high you are forecasting growth in Southern California, New Jersey and alike? Chris Caton : Hey, Vince. It\u2019s Chris Caton. So indeed, we did make a material increase and look, I think the facts of the situation are really impressive. Rents in the U.S. are up nearly 7% just in the first half of the year, that\u2019s a record. And look, it\u2019s not just the U.S. rents are rising, in Europe they are up 2% so far this year. When I think about different categories, let\u2019s start with the coastal, the major markets on the coast and we\u2019ve had Toronto in there.  Typically, these markets on an annual basis will outperform by 250 to 400 basis points. Last year that compressed as there was less differentiation. That differentiation has returned. And so, we are going to see these coastal markets in Toronto hit mid-teens, I think this year. And I \u2014 based on some of the trends we discussed earlier, I\u2019d say we should expect to see this relative outperformance widen in the coming years. Hope that helps you. Tom Olinger : Vince, this is Tom. I would just tack on the impact of \u2013 and on our earnings, right? I mean, we are rolling around 16%, 17% of our portfolio for a year now. So all of this good news on rent growth is not coming to the P&L right away. So you need to look at the in-place to market which significantly gapped out this quarter now at almost 17%.  And as I said in my prepared remarks, it\u2019s almost $700 million of incremental NOI and want to see where rent growth continues to go. But I would continue to think that in-place market is going to March a little higher. Chris Caton : Yes and one other thing I would add, as strong as rents have been in some of these best markets, with today\u2019s rents, today\u2019s construction cost, and today\u2019s land cost, development doesn\u2019t pencil. So, when people are developing, that means they are thinking, they may be wrong, that rents have to grow quite a bit from here or cap rates are going to compress significantly from here. I don\u2019t know which and they may be wrong. But I can tell you that with today\u2019s marginal land cost and building cost, no way you come close to that clearing your margin in development. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Rob Simone with Hedgeye Risk Management. Rob Simone : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Kind of a two-part question for me, get back to your earlier comments on strategic capital. We took a shot at that valuation and I think, Tom, your comments were really helpful. I think in many ways, they are probably too conservative. But, on the growth rate side, so one of the things that\u2019s a little bit tougher to handicap from the outside is, kind of the sustainable growth rate and your capital raising.  The deployments from contribution is a little more obvious from the numbers, at least historically. So, I was hoping you guys could comment on how you see the fundraising environment kind of proceeding over the coming years?  And then, also, maybe secondarily to that, it\u2019s really interesting. This is the first year that the net income excluding promotes kind of subsumed your corporate G&A. So from a valuation perspective, how do you think about addressing that? It\u2019s obviously a huge benefit but a big change versus prior year. Tom Olinger : Hey, Rob. Let me take a shot at this. Today\u2019s \u2013 our third-party AUM is mid $60 billion. At the time of the merger exactly 10 years ago, the merger closed on June 30 of 2011, exactly ten years ago, it was $14 billion. So, you do the math as to what the growth rate has been.  But I think ten years got to be a pretty representative period, because we had some early not so great years in industrial and past couple of years have been really good. But I haven\u2019t done the CAGR, but if you do the CAGR between $14 billion and whatever, $60 billion plus, it\u2019s got to be pretty impressive. The guys are trying to do the math.  But, anyway, you can do the math. It\u2019s certainly higher than what any valuation model will suggest and I bet you, it\u2019s higher than a lot of public company asset managers. It\u2019s 16% annual growth rate in third-party funds under management. So \u2013 and the limiter on that growth is not our ability raise capital. We can go out there and raise \u2013 more capital than we have right now.  It\u2019s just that we don\u2019t want to raise the capital if we think we don\u2019t have good deployment opportunities for us. So, we don\u2019t want our queues getting too long and investors to get frustrated and we certainly don\u2019t want to have a big queue that forces deal making like we see in a lot of other places. Chris Caton : We\u2019ve raised somewhere between $2 billion and $6 billion of good capital over the course of last three years depending on the need. This year you will be interested to know that 15% of the new capital that\u2019s raised is from new investors, new to Prologis. So that really underscores the broadening of interest in the logistics sector.  The other thing that I think you are going to find interesting is that 50% of the investors are now diligencing ESG as an imperative. So, that really plays to our strength. We\u2019ve been an ESG leader for more than two decades. So, I think that\u2019s a differentiator for PLD. Gene Reilly : Hey, Rob. I\u2019d just also point out from a key focus on equity raising. But these are open-ended funds are extremely low levered. They are A minus rated entities. They have significant financing capacity. So we\u2019ve got a lot of runway just by using their balance sheets, much less ours. And then thanks for pointing out your point about G&A and scale.  I mean, that just tells you the power of the scale of these businesses. We talked about the AUM growth, that\u2019s 16 over the last ten years or 18 over the last five years. But it\u2019s all about cash flow and EBITDA. That\u2019s grown 26% CAGR in the last five years. And as we grow, the vast majority of that money is going to drop to the bottom-line. Operator : And our next question is going to come from the line of Tom Catherwood, BTIG. Tom Catherwood : Excellent. Thank you, guys. Hamid, just wanted to follow-up on your comment on industrial development not penciling out. Last quarter, I think you had mentioned that replacement cost could increase by mid and as much as 25% and that Prologis had gotten ahead of that by pre-ordering a lot of material including steel.  As we sit today, what are your current thoughts as far as input costs and how they could continue to trend? And is there a timeframe in which you might kind of fully utilize the material you pre-ordered and we could see maybe more margin compression on the development side is yet to take kind of market rates for those? What are your thoughts on that? Hamid Moghadam : Yes. In terms of our pre-purchasing steel, I didn\u2019t want to create the false impression that we\u2019ve got our entire development program hedged on steel costs. And we are pretty much working through the steel that\u2019s been hedged. So, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a big factor in forecasting margins going forward. My personal view is that some of these supply chain-related issues that have impacted material costs are going to subside and there was a period out there a year or two years out where maybe the steel price escalation could reverse and get back on a sort of normal inflationary trend, once all the plants are back up and producing.  But the most important thing affecting margins is what Gene mentioned a little while ago, which is that, cap rates are compressing and rents are growing faster than land cost and replacement costs are going up. So the margins, if anything are going to expand unless something material changes that I can\u2019t think of right now, particularly given the outlook for demand. And when someone asks Chris about the different sectors and all that, notably absent in his sectors was housing. Housing is still not anywhere near its potential and it\u2019s a big consumer of warehouse space that hasn\u2019t even kicked in. And you know how low the housing inventory is and how much prices are going up in the housing sector. So I expect actually that to be an additional engine of growth for demand. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Ki Bin Kim : Yes. Good morning. Just wanted to go back to the land topic. You guys bought more land year-to-date than you did in 2020. Just curious - so just a couple of broad questions. You already have a pretty sizable land base. I am just curious about what the thinking is behind that? Is it \u2013 shouldn\u2019t been feel good that you had to kind secure market value land to put it to work relatively soon? Or is there a longer term element to it that you think the demand is long lasting and so good that you wanted to replenish the land inventory?  And also, how should we think about the $18 billion of build out in your land bank today? Should we expect that to start to get smaller as we do more development? Or is this a level that you plan you can maintain just to keep things humming along? Tom Olinger : Yes, couple of things, Ki Bin. First of all, land comes in couple of different flavors. One is raw unentitled land, of which we buy some but not a lot. Second comes in the form of options that we actually don\u2019t buy. It doesn\u2019t show up in the period when we made the deal. It shows up in the period that we actually closed the land option.  So, I don\u2019t know the specifics for this quarter that you are looking at. But we can find that out. But it could be closing in options that we negotiated many, many moons ago. And finally, the infrastructure cost of improving land shows up as land and it may not be actually new land, it may be just additional infrastructure on existing land. For example, in our Tracy Park, we are doing million square foot deals like they are going out of style and along with that, we need to put the infrastructure in and with that land we bought in 2012. But that infrastructure it shows up as a little land. Finally, an increasing percentage of our land is covered land place and they have an income stream and they pencil as investments even if we weren\u2019t going to scrape them and redevelop them down the road. So, these are land purchases deals that are actually pretty attractive in their own right. But they also have an embedded upside in terms of developing new product on it. Gene, anything? Gene Reilly : Yes. So, Ki Bin, if you look at that $18 billion of build out, about 44% of it is either covered land place or option land. And if you look at how we are replenishing the land bank over time, we are sticking pretty much to those ratios. So, nearly 50% of it comes in those two categories and with respect to the size of the land bank, it\u2019s got to grow. Our development program is growing and you are going to see the land bank grow along with it. Tom Olinger : A good example would be this Hilltop transaction that got all this attention that all of a sudden are we going to the retail business? No, we are not going to the retail business. That\u2019s just another way of buying land with the yield on it. So, but it\u2019s chunky. It\u2019s $100 million. So that shows up as that can move the numbers around in a given quarter by quite a bit. But it\u2019s covered land place at the end of the day. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question is a follow-up from Jamie Feldman, Bank of America. Jamie Feldman : Thanks. I just wanted \u2013 I have two quick follow-up questions. One is going back to the supply chain shortages, pleasantly surprised to see you raised your starts guidance and your stabilizations guidance. Would you say that we\u2019ll see that across the board in this sector? Or there is something specific about the PLD platform that let you continue on with your development plans?  And then, secondly, you mentioned housing is not yet at its full potential for demand. Any thoughts - latest thoughts on re-shoring and what that could mean to demand and then anything coming out of Congress with the infrastructure bill that could also be a driver of growth? Thank you. Tom Olinger : Yes. On the infrastructure side, a lot of it isn\u2019t infrastructure, this is I can tell. So I don\u2019t think those things are necessarily going to add a lot of business. But the real infrastructure for part, this is less than $1 billion should be really great for the business.  Onshoring is - I only see onshoring in newspaper articles. I haven\u2019t really actually seen them and if you look at the import numbers, we set month-after-month of records. And now I do think there will be onshoring of medical supplies and PPE. And some of the things that are strategic to use an over-used word. But generally speaking, we just don\u2019t have the resources, the infrastructure, the labor, the knowhow to manufacture a lot of the things that come into our containers. Gene, anything? Gene Reilly : Yes. I mean, I think you will see in the Mexico, they are seeing it. But I don\u2019t think you see re-shoring here. What was the first part of your question? Chris Caton : What we see others. Gene Reilly : Right. Right. Tom Olinger : Well, I have no idea. Gene Reilly : Yes, we need to. Tom Olinger : Yes, I mean we\u2019ll find out in a couple of weeks. But the \u2013 I can tell you that \u2013 and you\u2019ve heard us talk about this for years now. We\u2019ve really taken the customer and put it in the middle of our business, and that is paying dividends. So this customer-centric model allows us to do a lot of business. By the way that playbook will get like copied like everything else.  So, I assume, other people will do the same thing. But so far, we are doing great with major customer business. Thanks to the good work that the teams are doing.  With that, Jamie, you were the last. So, thank you again for your attention and we look forward to talking to you before next quarter for sure. Take care. Operator : Once again, we\u2019d like to thank you for participating in today\u2019s Prologis conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Tracy Ward, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Tracy Ward : Thanks, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. I\u2019d like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates, as well as management\u2019s beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings. Additionally, our third quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures and in accordance with Reg G we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. This morning, we will hear from Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover results, real-time market conditions and guidance. And also here with me today are Hamid Moghadam; Gary Anderson; Chris Caton; Tim Arndt; Mike Curless; Dan Letter; Ed Nekritz; Gene Reilly; and Karsten Kallevig. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom. And Tom, will you please begin? Tom Olinger : Thanks, Tracy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. Third quarter results exceeded expectations and were underpinned by record increases in market rents and valuations. Operating conditions are being shaped by structural forces that continued to drive demand. At the same time, vacancies are at unprecedented lows, space in our markets is effectively sold out. In the last 90 days, supply chain dislocations have become even more pronounced, with customers acting with a sense of urgency to secure the space they need. As demand surges, having the right logistics real estate in the right locations has never been more mission critical to our customers. During the third quarter, we signed 56 million square feet of leases and issued proposals on 84 million square feet. Spaces above 100,000 square feet are effectively fully leased. Our Last Touch segment continued to gain momentum, with new lease signings growing by 44%. E-commerce requirements continued to broaden across a range of industries, with this segment representing one quarter of new lease signings. The activity was down sequentially as anticipated, although remains above trend. Given the sharp ramp up in demand, we are raising our 2021 U.S. forecasts for net absorption by 14% to a record 375 million square feet against deliveries of 285 million square feet, resulting in year-end vacancy reaching a new low of 4%. I want to point out that we revised our data set here this quarter to reflect only Prologis markets. As strong demand is being met with historic low vacancy, preleasing in the U.S. delivery pipeline has reached 70%, its highest level ever as customers continued to compete for space. Acute scarcity in our global markets is driving record rent and value growth. In the third quarter alone, rents grew 7.1% in our U.S. markets far exceeding our expectations. We are increasing our 2021 market rent forecast significantly to an all-time high of 19% in the U.S. and 17% globally, both up approximately 700 basis points. Our in-place to market rent spreads jumped 500 basis points in the quarter and is now approximately 22% with an upward bias. This current rent spread represents embedded organic NOI growth of more than $925 million, or $1.25 per share. Record rent growth is translating to record valuation increases. Our logistics portfolio posted the largest quarterly increase in our history, rising 9.5% globally, bringing the year-to-date increase to an impressive 4% -- an impressive 24%, sorry about that. We expect that the ongoing network reconfiguration and expansion required to meet consumer needs and minimize disruptions will fuel demand tailwinds over the next decade. Switching gears to results for the quarter, core FFO was $1.04 per share with net promote earnings of $0.01. Rent change on rollover was strong at 27.9%, slightly lower sequentially due to mix. Average occupancy was 96.6%, up 60 basis points sequentially and we reached 98% leased at quarter-end. Cash same-store NOI growth accelerated to 6.7%, up 90 basis points sequentially. We had a very productive quarter on the deployment front. Margins on development stabilizations remain elevated coming in at 47%. Our development starts were $1.4 billion consisting of 31 projects across 21 markets, with estimated value creation of more than $520 million. Turning to strategic capital, our team raised almost $500 million in the third quarter and $2.5 billion year-to-date. Equity queues for open ended vehicles were $3.4 billion at quarter-end, another all-time high. Moving to guidance for 2021. Our outlook has further improved and here are the key updates on our share basis. We\u2019re tightening and increasing our cash same-store NOI growth to now range between 5.75% and 6%. We\u2019re increasing the midpoint for strategic capital revenue, excluding promotes by $12.5 million and now ranged between $480 million and $485 million. We expect net promote income of $0.05 per share for the year, an increase of $0.03 from our prior guidance. In response to strong demand, we are increasing development starts by $450 million to a new midpoint of $3.7 billion. Our owned and managed land portfolio now supports 180 million square feet and more than $21 billion of future build out potential, providing a clear runway for significant value creation over the next several years. We\u2019re also increasing the mid-point for acquisitions by $500 million. The increased pace of acquisitions relates to our focus on covered land plays and urban Last Touch opportunities. We now expect net deployment uses of $650 million at the midpoint. Taking these assumptions into account, we are increasing our core FFO midpoint by $0.06 and narrowing the range to $4.11 per share to $4.13 per share. Core FFO, excluding promotes, will range between $4.06 per share and $4.08 per share, representing year-over-year growth at the midpoint of almost 14%, while deleveraging by more than 300 basis points. We expect to generate $1.4 billion in free cash flow after dividends with a very conservative payout ratio below 60% range. While our year-to-date results have been extraordinary, most of the benefits from the current environment will accrue to the future. Our 22% in-place to market rent spread, the valuation impact on promotes, our leverage capacity, the $21 billion of development build out, and most importantly, the vast opportunity set that our global footprint provides, all paved the way for both significant and durable long-term growth. As I mentioned at the outset of my remarks, the disruptions within the supply chain won\u2019t be solved overnight. Prologis plays a unique role in the industry and we\u2019re committed to helping find long-term solutions. That\u2019s why we\u2019re working closely with our customers, policymakers and community partners to help address the problems, which will range from warehouse space to transport infrastructure to labor scarcity. In closing, I want to highlight two important upcoming Prologis events. First, this Monday, we will be hosting a webinar that we will dive into our development and strategic capital businesses. And second, on October 27th, we\u2019re bringing together supply chain and community thought leaders to focus on some of the most pressing issues in logistics today, including workforce, energy and transportation. Please visit our website for more information and the registration links for both events. And with that, I will turn it back to Sarah for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Caitlin Burrows : Hi, everyone. Good morning. Maybe just the earnings release mentioned that your investment capacity is around $15 billion. Do you think Prologis will actually be able to deploy capital and use that opportunity, and if so, how or do you think that spread could actually increase as cash flow increases? Gene Reilly : Caitlin, it\u2019s Gene. We really never provide guidance at least voluntarily on deployment, because as I\u2019ve said many times, it can range between zero and a lot, last year it was $21 billion. So I don\u2019t know honestly. It just depends on the returns that are available. And the only reason we talk about capacity is that you sort of have a feel for what we can do with the right opportunities came about. But there is no urgency around investing in a particular timeframe. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman from Citi. Your line is open. Emmanuel Korchman : Hey, everyone. Good morning. Tom, I kind of wanted to reconcile a point you made earlier in your script, which was that, customers are keenly focused on getting more space and we\u2019re reading a lot of headlines on shortages of inventory, of labor, of other things. I guess help me reconcile the two points with customers looking for space that maybe they can\u2019t fill right away or are they just expecting their supply pipeline to rebound quickly, or are they moving stuff from other warehouses or sort of, I guess, it\u2019s a little bit counterintuitive for somebody be taking more space when product is sort of an issue right now? Sorry for long question. Thank you. Tom Olinger : Yeah. Manny, let me try to answer that question. The supply chain is very long and it\u2019s gotten longer in the last 10 years. So basically, what happened is, think of it as a big long hose and somebody turned off the water and the hose ran dry and as the economies came back, that hose got opened and production started and is now flowing through the supply chain. So it is not flowing smoothly and the old models for predicting demand and carrying inventory are basically thrown out the window. So inventory particularly, mid-product inventory, not finished product inventory sort of ends up piling up in different places, because if there\u2019s one part missing into something, it\u2019s going to hold up the inventory. The other 99 parts have to be stored somewhere. So it\u2019s creating a pretty significant extra demand just to balance out the system given that the buffers are not predictable anymore. So the natural follow-up question from that, I would guess, would be, well, do you guys think about this being a one-time event or a sustainable event? And I would say, this particular factor is likely to be a temporary. Although, probably two-year or three-year type of process before everything straightens out. But right behind that are the two big structural drivers that on top of normal absorption. They include increased share of e-commerce and inventory levels being higher than prior to the pandemic and those two things people aren\u2019t even thinking about right now, because they\u2019re struggling to keep their heads above water. So I think the short-term thing is really interesting. It\u2019s great for headlines and all that. But I think the much more interesting factor in terms of assessing the quality of our business is their long-term driver -- are the two long-term drivers of demand on top of the normal drivers of demand. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tom Catherwood from BTIG. Your line is open. Tom Catherwood : Great. Excellent. Thank you so much, guys. Quick question on cap rates. We\u2019ve seen incredible compression this year, and unlike prior years, it\u2019s really seemed to be across the Board. Does that create any risk in certain markets or regions where fundamentals of demand may not meet kind of the lofty valuation expectations we now have? Tom Olinger : Boy, that\u2019s a tough question to answer. I will give you mine and Gene, I am sure will have ideas about this. First of all, we\u2019re notoriously bad at predicting cap rates. We\u2019ve been saying for about five years that they\u2019re too low, only to watch them go lower. But remember, cap rates are a function of two things. One is general returns available in other capital markets, namely interest rates or risk-free rates. And more recently, this rent growth and the growth growing power of that initial yield is orders of magnitude higher than it\u2019s ever been. So I am not smart enough to parse why cap rates are compressing. I suspect it has more to do with the embedded growth rate in the last six months than it does with interest rates picture. In fact, the interest rate picture if anything has increased, but the tremendous growth in rents, I think, has way exceeded the drag from slightly higher interest rates. Gene, what do you think? Gene Reilly : Yeah. I think you may be getting to the spread between primary and secondary markets and that actually hasn\u2019t tightened up that much. It has tightened up a little bit. But spot cap rates in primary markets are extremely low. So I think there\u2019s always risk as cap rates in secondary or even tertiary markets are dragged down by the overall strength of the market, because you\u2019re going to see more supply in those markets going forward against probably less demand. But we will see how it plays out. But I don\u2019t really think, of course, you may have a different point of view that those spreads have actually tightened that much further. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Jamie Feldman : Thank you. We get asked a lot about just the potential supply coming online with so much capital flowing into this sector. Can you talk a little bit about whether it\u2019s a competitive mode or just kind of how Prologis will be able to kind of protect itself as supply grows or maybe that\u2019s the wrong way to think about it, just how should we think about the supply risks overall and it\u2019s not so easy to build? Tom Olinger : Yeah. Hamid Moghadam : I think you should think of supply risk as very market-specific. And you can have all the desire to bring down supply in LA or San Francisco or Seattle or even Inland Empire in -- certainly Inland Empire West or New Jersey. I take all your good markets. If, I mean, how are you going to do it? There is no land and their entitlement picture is getting to be harder and harder every day. Even markets like Dallas that we historically would have discussed as or referred to as non-constraint in terms of land, believe it or not are getting more constrained. I still encounter [ph] constraint, but there are more constraints certainly in the good location. So I think that the big driver is that it\u2019s just hard to come up with the land to build buildings on. I mean, supply is responding to demand. But I will -- my gut feel, and of course, you can\u2019t prove this one way or another is that demand would be higher, supply were higher. I think people are just based on the number of people competing for the same goods spaces and all the inbound calls we get from all our good customers wanting to gain an advantage over another good customer. It is -- people are kind of in a panic mode almost when it comes to buying or committing to real estate, so demand is just crazy. Tom Olinger : So, Jamie, I will also add that it\u2019s market-specific, it\u2019s actually submarket-specific. And in terms of how do we protect ourselves, we do this all the time, whether it\u2019s a strong market or a weak market, we\u2019re always monitoring where is that supply going to come from. So I don\u2019t think we really change our protocols in that sense. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Derek Johnston : Thank you. Hi, everyone. In January, on 4Q \u201820\u2019s earning call, you\u2019re in-place to market rent registered at 12.8% and with that in-place to market now at 22% just nine months, 10 months later. What are the key drivers for this change and really how sustainable is this mark-to-market across the portfolio? Tom Olinger : Yeah. I will take that. So I will anchor you back. Well, first of all, the increase is all driven to high market rent growth. And I think, as I mentioned in my remarks, we\u2019re almost 22% today and there is an arrow up, just given a very minimal role in the fourth quarter and given our market rent growth expectations. So I would expect that 22% is going to go higher when we\u2019re on this call in January. One thing I would anchor you back to is, at our Investor Day back in November of 2019 that in-place to market was 15.5% and that was underpinning, what we said, our GAAP same-store growth at that time was a 3.5% to 4.5%. Now here we are today at 22% and when you think about that increase that really takes a 3.5% to 4.5% to almost 4.5% to 5.5%. So that\u2019s the impact we\u2019ve really extended. Here we are almost two years later and it\u2019s up dramatically and our runway has arguably gotten even longer. So the underpinning of the organic growth potential that we have is sitting right there for you to see. Hamid Moghadam : Yeah. The only thing I would add to Tom\u2019s comment is actually land prices in most markets are going up faster than rents and construction costs are going up faster than rents. So actually the rent required for that marginal square foot of supply is ahead of that 22%. So that\u2019s why the arrow is up. It\u2019s just -- we\u2019re running but sort of standing still or going a little backwards with respect to keeping pace with replacement costs. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from Truist. Your line is open. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks and good morning out there. So I want to talk about your development pipeline. It\u2019s obviously grown very nicely to a $5 billion. Can you remind us for the hard costs, like how much of the costs are hedged or at least the material security options? And as those expire and the favorable vintage of those hedges expire, what kind of impacts that has to your future development in terms of margins or yields? Tom Olinger : So, Ki Bin, we think we\u2019ve contained about 25% of the cost increases we\u2019ve seen to-date. So in the -- in our pipeline in terms of the starts going forward, there\u2019s probably 4% sitting there that\u2019s beyond the underwriting of those projects. Most of that is going to be picked up on contingency. But as we look forward, we don\u2019t really see risk. I am not going to get into the details of what we\u2019ve done with pre-buying steel and other components and on the -- on these projects. But I think we\u2019ve mitigated quite a bit so far. We do see these markets kind of stabilizing at this point in time. And the other thing that we\u2019ve done, which is really critical is, we\u2019ve maintained our schedules and I think today, I think, we\u2019ve picked up 30 days of schedule versus the market. And frankly, we built these buildings faster than the market anyway, but that\u2019s an incremental 30 days. So the supply chain disruptions aren\u2019t just cost, they\u2019re their schedule. So I think you\u2019re -- I mean, ultimately, you\u2019re getting to how much have we sort of mitigated. I\u2019ve told you what we\u2019ve done so far. We\u2019re probably out, probably, six months ahead of the curve, but you can\u2019t really get much further than that. So I feel really good about what we\u2019ve done this year and I feel like we\u2019re prepared really well going forward. So we feel good about the outlook, and obviously, we\u2019re raising guidance and our volumes. Hamid Moghadam : Yeah. I think more importantly than hedging construction costs is a fact that rents are going up faster than some of these costs and if you take an overall average and certainly in the best markets. So that\u2019s why margins are expanding with cap rates being also compressing. So far so good. Will it continue forever? Probably not. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ronald Kamdem : Hey. Congrats on the quarter. Just a quick one on just retention shooting up 650 basis points year-over-year, any color what drove that kind of specific geographic, just curious there? Thanks. Tom Olinger : Nothing unusual about mix or geography, but as we said, customers don\u2019t have options, really a lot of places to go and I think there\u2019s a race to secure really good well-located real estate and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. Hamid Moghadam : That number can be very volatile quarter-to-quarter. Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t pay too much attention to it quarter-to-quarter [ph]. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. John Kim : Good morning. I was wondering if you can comment on how you see occupancy trending with your leased now at 90%, but you\u2019re also pushing rents harder and also if you can comment on the big sequential increase in occupancy in Asia during the quarter? Hamid Moghadam : Our occupancies have to go higher. I mean if your demand is 300 and whatever 85 and supply is 285 million, there is 100 million feet that\u2019s going to come out of somewhere and add to that the obsolescence, the significant amount of product that it\u2019s taken out of circulation, because people have built something else on it like apartments. I think for sure our vacancy rates at least in the markets we care about are going to be going down in the foreseeable future. In the long-term, we need to see. I don\u2019t expect 385 million square feet of demand being the new norm forever, because some of it is just people being desperate for putting their stuff somewhere. But I think it will stabilize at the higher level than historical, because of those two unique drivers that we\u2019re seeing in this cycle that we didn\u2019t have in other cycles. Tom Olinger : John, your question on Asia that\u2019s being driven by China, just we\u2019ve seen some good -- very good lease of activity in China. Japan has remains extremely high occupied. Hamid Moghadam : Yeah. The new team in China has done a really great job in leasing space. Tom Olinger : Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Craig Mailman : Hey, guys. Just curious on the rent growth piece of things you guys have talked a lot about today. But is there a chance in your negotiations, do you guys trying to push escalators higher as a way to combat potential inflation here in the near-term and just maybe smooth out some of the rent increases some of these times they have, the big sticker shock at the end of the lease? Hamid Moghadam : Right. Well, there is a variety of rationale for that, but the escalators are moving up, we\u2019re pushing them everywhere as you can imagine. But as importantly, the markets are accepting this and the competitive landscape is doing it, perhaps, partially for the reasons that you mentioned to smooth that effect with the customer. But of course, a lot of our customers get straight line at anyway. But I think it\u2019s just the -- it\u2019s our impression with overall net effective rent growth. So we feel pretty good about that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Steve Sakwa : Yeah. Thanks. Most of my questions have been asked. But I just on the development increase. I am just wondering if you could maybe talk about regions, kind of where you\u2019re seeing the most demand and if you kind of thought about spec versus build-to-suits. I mean, given your commentary about customers, how do you sort of see that trending moving forward? Tom Olinger : Yeah. So, Steve, I will take the first part of it. So we got about 100 projects we\u2019re starting this year, so it\u2019s really broad based and I wouldn\u2019t say that the increases are targeted to certain areas, because frankly, we have so much demand in all the markets. We\u2019re pulling forward project -- projects that we can number one, and number two, a lot of this increases build-to-suit activity. And maybe, Mike, can you comment on that? Mike Curless : Yeah. Steve, so in the sub, 60% of our activity was build-to-suit. That will normalize end of the year in the mid-40%s. But I\u2019d remind you, that\u2019s going to be at a much larger base, which is representative of two basic things, there\u2019s fewer spec opportunities for people to move into and that\u2019s paired up with major structural rollouts that are well underway with a whole lot of companies over and above Amazon. So we see a bunch of diverse activity there and no surprise margins are as solid as they\u2019ve ever been reflective of how important entitle land sites are. And again, and the dearth of available space out there has put us in a really good spot on overseas. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Dilts from UBS. Your line is open. Brent Dilts : Hey, guys. So with the shortages of certain items in the supply chain, how is that impacting your procurement programs for tenants for things like forklifts, lightings, rack, et cetera? And also how are your tenants managing labor challenges against the backdrop for record demand? Tom Olinger : Yeah. Certainly, there\u2019s delays in some of our essential projects as well, forklifts, racking, those sorts of things. So OEM manufacturers in those businesses are also struggling, so lead times are longer. But we\u2019re using again our leverage and our scale, just as we do on the construction side of the business to procure them quicker than they otherwise would be able to. On the labor front, I don\u2019t know if you guys want to chat on that? Hamid Moghadam : Yeah. Clearly, labor is on the minds of lots of our customers and we\u2019re seeing them getting creative on how they\u2019re attracting labor and you see the commercials for a lot -- lots of companies on TV and what they\u2019re doing there. It\u2019s also having them focus on more on automation and we\u2019re seeing plenty of discussions about automation and automation these days is not the old version of it where it\u2019s fixed, bespoke. We\u2019re seeing lots of flexibility out there in terms of robotic forklifts and autonomous forklifts and those types of things, which we think our buildings are very well-suited because the primary criteria for that is a good floor and we spent over 30 years making sure our floors are in really good shape. So we think we\u2019re in real good shape to address automation, which I think will be a function of this labor issue going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Mike Mueller : Yeah. Hi. Tom, you previously talked about base case annual promote levels. How does that change for where cap rates have moved to today? Tom Olinger : Yeah. As a reminder, we talked about, call it, seven sense of annual promotes if you, the net promote income, if you go back and you look at our historic performance. Clearly given where valuations have gone, I would expect 2022 promotes to be substantially above our historic run rate. Now clearly we will talk more about it in January, but directionally that\u2019s what you should expect. Hamid Moghadam : Yeah. Promotes are pretty levered on the upside, because once you pass the pref return that incremental unit of return produces promote, whereas getting up to your pref rate you\u2019re not getting any promote. So for sure it will expand non-linearly. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell from Barclays. Your line is open. Anthony Powell : Hi. Good morning. A question about the building acquisition guidance that, the increase there talked about covered land space Last Touch, how competitive is the environment for acquisitions there and how are cap rates trending for those types of deals? Tom Olinger : It\u2019s very competitive for the Last Touch. There\u2019s no question. And cap rates are tough to talk about, because you have in-place rents, you\u2019re capping income that\u2019s literally all over the place. So I am not sure it\u2019s that constructive to talk about the cap rates, but it is competitive. I think we have a strategic advantage in the markets we want to be in, because we\u2019ve been doing this now for three years or four years. So I think we have scoped out the sub and sort of micro markets pretty effectively. But it is competitive and there\u2019s a ton of demand there and that\u2019s not going to change. Hamid Moghadam : The yield on our covered land place, the entire portfolio cover land place, which is about a quarter of our total land base is about 5%, which means that we\u2019re actually getting better yields on some of these covered land place and that some of it is historic and rents have gone up a lot. But 5% is pretty good. You\u2019re getting paid to wait and that\u2019s the way to carry land. I mean the way to carry land is cover the land place and options, and really the own land that\u2019s just sitting around there that\u2019s the most expensive way of carrying land. So we\u2019ve been on to this strategy for a long time and we have a good base of covered land place that are now sort of cycling through development. So a lot of our development in the next 12 months to 24 months is going to be building out on the covered land place. But the good news is we\u2019re replenishing that inventory and then some as we chew through it. Tom Olinger : Yeah. Just to add onto what Hamid said. So we have about 180 million feet of FAR build out on our land bank, option land and covered land place combined. So with the income flowing to the covered land place, we have about a 2% stabilized yield for the entire land bank, including all three components of it and after you pay taxes, you\u2019re still on the plus. So we\u2019re kind of carrying this for free. And frankly, some of the -- some of those income profiles on the early covered land places are -- have a serious up arrow to them. So, another way to think about land exposure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Michael Carroll : Yeah. Thanks. So could we see leasing activity or demand improved as the supply chain disruptions dissipate and inventory levels improve or are customers just looking through these problems right now and really trying to build their logistics network that they need over the next three years to five years? Tom Olinger : I think they\u2019re doing both, but I think most people are focused on just dealing with Christmas. I mean, literally they should be start thinking about the long-term and people are some of the larger and more sophisticated players are and those would be the targets of the world, home depots of the world, people like that. But there are lots of people just trying to survive the next three months or four months. So I think that crazy crunch will diminish over the next two years to three years, for sure. But I think then they will turn to the longer-term strategies and I think that one has legs for a long time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers from Baird. Your line is open. Dave Rodgers : Yeah. Most of my questions have been answered, but I did want to just follow up on the labor point. Obviously, labor a big concern today, 400 million square feet of additional demand. It\u2019s kind of in the last four quarters alone. Are you seeing customers just making different decisions on locations, campus settings, whatever it might be related to kind of longer term labor concerns, notwithstanding kind of the technology, are you just seeing kind of imminent decisions that are changing due to labor? Tom Olinger : People have to figure out where their customers are and their networks are based on where the customers are. And real estate and real estate costs are 3% to 5% of the total cost and by the way, that number hasn\u2019t gone on -- gone up, because of rents going up, because the other components labor, transportation and energy are also going up. So they\u2019re not going to optimize around real estate costs. They\u2019re going to optimize around where their consumers are and where -- how long it takes to get them there, what they want and it\u2019s mostly time not tasks. So they\u2019re going to have to operate in the big markets. I mean you\u2019re not going to go in the middle of the square state in the middle of the country, because real estate rents are cheaper to service the desirable markets where a lot of the growth is started costing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Your line is open. Nick Yulico : Thanks. I just wanted to follow up on the leasing market and in particularly the 3PL market, which has been incredibly active year-to-date. Could you just talk a little bit more about the trends you\u2019re seeing there? I imagine we\u2019ve heard anecdotes of like increasingly maybe Amazon using that market, because it\u2019s easier to get space on a real time basis, any perspective would be very helpful? Thanks. Mike Curless : Yeah. This is Mike. And 3PL activity was up 500 bps last quarter and we\u2019ve seen this really play out over the last several years where 3PLs might have viewed space as a bit of a commodity many years ago. Today our view in is as an offensive weapon to help accommodate their customers and we\u2019re seeing this play out in the form of them leasing more space and they have underlying customers lined up, because they need that space to attract the customers and we are seeing them go for a longer term leases, both of which are good signs of the health of this business and a whole lot of that is driven by the E-commerce segment, which continues to be very diversified way over and above just Amazon. Tom Olinger : They are definitely committing space ahead of having customers, but they\u2019re definitely filling up those spaces. This is not 1999 or 2000.com where people are going in hoping that their business will triple. They can\u2019t keep up. I mean literally that\u2019s the takeaway for all you guys. Can ask about in 15 different ways. But the market cannot keep up with -- the supply market cannot keep up with the demand that\u2019s out there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Blaine Heck : Great. Thanks. I wanted to touch on acquisitions in general, not just specifically on the covered land plays as you touched on those earlier. You guys were able to do just under $400 million of your share during the quarter at a 5% cap rate and you increased guidance pretty significantly. Can you just talk about what caused that cap rate on deals during the quarter to be higher than we\u2019ve seen in a while, is that just a mix issue or are you guys finding more opportunities to maybe acquire off-market? And then related to that, what\u2019s giving you the confidence to increase acquisition guidance when there\u2019s so much capital out there chasing deals? Tom Olinger : Yeah. So the 5% is definitely a mix issue. But our acquisition activities were generally not out there to buy core portfolios at the highest -- hit that highest bid. So we\u2019re constantly sourcing deals off market. And yes, those two do come with better returns, 5% is a mix issue. With respect to the confidence in the future, I mean, frankly, as Hamid said earlier on, we\u2019re -- we had a $330 million quarter. We might have a $2 billion quarter. We might have -- we may have a zero. It really depends on what\u2019s out there, what\u2019s available to us and we have confidence in - in the next quarter, because we have a lot of irons already in the fire. But confidence long-term, who knows? I mean, if these returns begin to completely blow out over a replacement cost. You\u2019re not going to see us as active. Yet, if there\u2019s a strategic opportunity, we may have a quarter that\u2019s 10 times the quarter we have this. So it\u2019s tough. Acquisitions are hard to forecast. They should be hard to forecast, frankly. Hamid Moghadam : Yeah. If somebody gives you a precise forecast for acquisitions you should run for the hills. But there\u2019s also another two I think important differences between us and others. First of all, our playing and is the globe. And that\u2019s lots of different ways to deploy capital than just in the U.S. Now I am not saying by the way Europe is any easier, but I am just saying we have really multiple ways of deploying capital. And secondly, a lot of the incremental capital that\u2019s come into the business is from allocators. It\u2019s from people that basically go and buy existing products. And we can buy substandard product that\u2019s well located and fixed it and that, even though there\u2019s competition in that too, but the number of players in that fixed market hasn\u2019t grown as much as the number of players in the, I buy office buildings and malls today and now I am going to buy warehouse, because it\u2019s cool. So that\u2019s the difference. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jon Petersen from Jefferies. Your line is open. Jon Petersen : Great. Thanks. I am just curious for your thoughts on, maybe some of the structural headwinds that a lot of kind of the coastal gateway markets are facing, particularly New York and San Francisco. Obviously, people are being called back to the office, but a lot more kind of flexibility and kind of expectations of migration more towards lower cost markets, lower tax markets? And I am just kind of curious how that impacts the industrial sector and your, I guess, willingness and underwriting around developing and expanding in those markets. Hamid Moghadam : I think if, I\u2019ve honestly heard this wishful thinking by the part of people who are in other regions of the country now for probably 20 years and every time you\u2019ve invested on the basis of that thesis, you\u2019ve left money on the table. So I don\u2019t see it. Yes, are they high -- is Elon Musk moving from California to Texas? Yes. Does he get a lot of headlines? Yes. But he doesn\u2019t consume any more than somebody who makes $60,000 a year. So the big consumption bases are in these markets and the land is covered with buildings. Those are the differences. The fact that they\u2019re sitting next to a beach that\u2019s not so important. It\u2019s just that those populations are still growing. They took a pause last year. But they\u2019re still growing and there\u2019s a lot of -- the vast majority of the movements are in the same region from maybe the urban core to the suburbs or something like that. I mean, there\u2019s a lot of data on this. And maybe, Chris, you want to elaborate on this. So in terms of the distribution business, we don\u2019t have buildings that are in different places for servicing the urban core versus the suburbs. They\u2019re all sort of within the same driving area. Chris Caton : Yeah. I just had a couple of data points for you. First, the business has never been stronger, when we look at California and New Jersey, business is excellent, both from a demand perspective and a pricing perspective. As you look at real-time migration data and I am specifically talking about the USPS data, you\u2019ve seen migratory trends dissipate that is slow down. So, it is not continuing, it is not accelerating. And if you look at other real time data, for example, the housing, you also see the same trends. So just a couple of data points to reinforce the points Hamid is making. Hamid Moghadam : By the way, it doesn\u2019t... Operator : Again\u2026 Hamid Moghadam : \u2026let -- let me just say this. It\u2019s not like California doesn\u2019t have problems or New York doesn\u2019t have problems. They do have problems. And they need to solve those problems and they need to become more business friendly and they need to improve the quality of life and homelessness is a real issue and all of those things are real issues. But at the end of the day, people go where the job growth is and that\u2019s where the job growth is. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We have a follow up question from Emmanuel Korchman from Citi. Your line is open. Emmanuel Korchman : Thanks, everyone. Chris, one for you, in the past, you\u2019ve talked about how much logistics is as a percentage of sort of overall whether the product cost or distribution cost. Has that just essentially stayed consistent now and the rise in rents is consistent with the rise in other costs, and at some point, does that relationship get messed up either with rents becoming a bigger piece or the other costs becoming a bigger piece? Thanks. Chris Caton : Hey, Manny. Yeah. It\u2019s our assessment that right now that ratio has not changed and so for those who are not familiar with the data by rent is roughly 5% of supply chain costs and supply chain costs roughly 5% of revenue. So rent is about 25 basis points of throughput distribution. With the growth that we\u2019ve seen in transportation costs, growth we\u2019ve seen in labor, that has in fact been excess of the market rent growth and so that ratio has not meaningfully changed. If anything, it\u2019s gone down a bit. Operator : We have a follow up question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim of Truist. Your line is open. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. Just a broad question for you, your market cap is now over $100 billion, obviously grown a lot over the past several years and when you think about the rental math that you do in terms of the economics you get from contributing developed assets into the fund, when you\u2019re a smaller company, I mean, obviously that math works out very favorably. As you get bigger, I wonder, when do we hit that point where you would want to keep more of your development on balance sheet versus contributing to the funds at the same pace? Hamid Moghadam : Yeah. We don\u2019t -- I actually don\u2019t think that math necessarily ever reaches that point, Ki Bin. I think if we think about it, the reasons for being in the private capital business are beyond scale. I mean, they\u2019re mitigating currency exposure. It\u2019s leveraging the return on our capital, et cetera, et cetera. And we\u2019ve got a good history and a good brand in that business. It\u2019s a very important business to us and we will continue to do that in a meaningful way. But the key to our growth is not external growth. Now we\u2019ve done more external growth than anybody on the planet, but our key is not external growth. The key is internal growth. That comes from portfolio construction and that comes from 20 years, 30 years, 40 years, almost of meticulous steady work to build up these positions and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to really in the long-term drive earnings in this company and create value. The deployment is great. It\u2019s interesting. It enables us to get scale that drives down G&A ratios and creates value that way. It increases our liquidity, which reduces the cost of capital. It does all kinds of things. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s those location selections, like look at all our four or five M&A deals. Some of them, probably, between the five of them we\u2019ve sold, probably 30%, maybe 35% of the assets, because we just don\u2019t believe in those markets, we\u2019ve kept the ones that we want. We could have -- by the way, it\u2019s probably the right short-term decision with a bend to keep those assets, because cap rates have compressed. We knowing what I know now, we should be more levered and have owned those assets. But frankly, that doesn\u2019t set us up as well for the long-term. We will make that up and then some in the long term by having the portfolio in the right place. So, organic growth and the external growth is icing on the cake. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman, Bank of America. Your line is open. Jamie Feldman : Thank you. It looks like you\u2019re going to see some meaningful rent growth in Europe. Can you talk about how your ability to push rents there compares to what you\u2019re seeing in the U.S. and if there\u2019s certain markets that are doing better than others? Hamid Moghadam : U.K. is like the best markets in the U.K. and the continent is like the average markets in the U.S. minus 50 basis points. That\u2019s the way I think about it. I mean that may not be price, but in terms of rental growth, I think, the average of the continent is probably lower than the average of the U.S. today. But the cost capital is lower in the U.K. -- in Europe also compared to the U.S. interest rates are lower. So I think they all make sense in the context of the cost of capital. But U.K. is more coastal U.S. like and the continent is more like the rest of the U.S. Hamid Moghadam : Okay. Jamie, I think, you\u2019re the wrap. So I really appreciate everybody being on the call. I think we had about 780 of you on the call today, which is got to be a huge record. So I really appreciate the interest in the company and look forward to talking to you in the next couple of months. Take care. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Prologis Q4 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] After the speakers' remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn today's call over to Jill Sawyer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jill Sawyer : Thanks Brent, and good morning, everyone. I am standing in for Tracy today. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates, as well as management\u2019s beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings. Additionally, our fourth quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures and in accordance with Reg G we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. This morning, we will hear from Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover results, real-time market conditions and guidance. Hamid Moghadam; Gary Anderson; Chris Caton; Mike Curless Dan Letter; Ed Nekritz; Gene Reilly; and Colleen Mckeown are also with us today.  With that, I will turn the call over to Tom. Tom, will you please begin? Thomas Olinger : Thanks, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. The fourth quarter closed at a year of record setting activity across our business. Core FFO was $1.12 per share, with net promote earnings of $0.05. For the full year, core FFO was $4.15 per share, with net promote earnings of $0.06. Excluding promotes, core FFO grew 14% year-over-year. Net effective rent change on rollover accelerated to 33%, up 510 basis points sequentially and was led by the U.S. at over 37%. Average occupancy was 97.4%, up 80 basis points sequentially. Cash same-store NOI growth remained strong at 7.5% for the quarter and 6.1% for the full year. I want to point out that we're modifying our in place to market rent disclosure to standardize this metric among what logistics REITs. This collaboration is an extension of the work we've done to harmonize other property operating metrics. We have a collectively defined net effective lease mark-to-market of our operating portfolio as the growth rate from in-place rents to market rents. This now aligns with how rent change on rollover is expressed. Using this new definition consistently applied our net effective lease mark-to-market at year-end jumped almost 800 basis points sequentially to 36%. This current rent spread represents embedded organic NOI of more than $1.2 billion or $1.55 per share that we will capture without any further market rank growth. Turning to Strategic Capital. This business continues to drive tremendous growth and value. In Q4, we completed the early windup of our highly successful UKLV venture. UKLV's $1.7 billion of operating assets were contributed to our PELP and PELP ventures. We earned net promote income of $0.05 in connection with the closeout of this venture and our percentage of infinite life vehicles has consequently grown to 95% of our $66 billion of third-party assets under management. For the year, our team raised $4.4 billion of third-party equity. After drawing down $1.9 billion in our open ended funds for acquisitions during the year equity queues stood at a record $4 billion at year-end. On the deployment front, we had a very productive and profitable year. Development starts totaled $3.6 billion, with margins of 32%. We continue to maintain a long development runway with a land portfolio able to support $26 billion of future starts. Stabilizations totaled to $2.5 billion with estimated value creation of $1.3 billion and average margin of 53%, both all time highs. Realized development gains were $817 million for the year, also an all time high. These results are the product of our highly disciplined team and an incredibly strong operating environment. For our customers, the importance of the health of their supply chain and the real estate that underpins it has never been so critical. We believe the current global supply chain challenges will continue well beyond this year. Fortunately, the scale of our 1 billion square foot portfolio puts us in a unique position to help our customers address these current supply chain challenges. This includes shortening construction delivery times by navigating raw material shortages and leveraging our Essentials platform to procure warehouse equipment and services, so our customers can focus on their core operations. We're also investing in technology and talent to support our industry leading sustainability objectives, including our efforts around renewable energy. Market dynamics today are highly favorable and demand has never been stronger. During the quarter, we signed 62 million square feet of leases and issued proposals on 90 million square feet. Demand is diverse across a range of industry end customers. E-commerce made up 19% of our new leasing this quarter, with further broadening of customer diversity. We signed 357 new leases with 265 unique e-commerce customers in 2021, both of which are high watermarks. Demand is fueled by three forces. First, overall consumption and demographic growth require our customers to expand. Second, customer supply chains are still repositioning to address the massive shift to e-commerce, as well as preparing for higher growth and service expectations. And third, they need to create more resiliency in supply chains. The inventory to sales ratios are more than 10% below pre-pandemic levels. Our customers not only need to restock at this 10% shortfall, but build additional safety stock of 10% or greater. This combination has the potential to produce 800 million square feet or more of future demand in the U.S. alone. Collectively these forces have placed a premium on speed to market and flexibility driving demand for years to come. From a supply perspective, construction underway in the U.S. is approximately 70% preleased, which is well above the historical average. We believe demand will balance out with supply in 2022 and vacancy rates will remain at record lows in both our U.S. and international markets. Competition for limited availabilities produced yet another quarter of record rent and value growth. In the fourth quarter, rents in our portfolio grew 5.7% globally, and 6.5% in the U.S. bringing full year growth to records 18% and 20% respectively, far exceeding our initial forecast. This growth paired with continued compression and cap rates is translating to record valuation increases. Our portfolio posted its highest quarterly value increase rising more than 12.5% globally, bringing the full year increase to a remarkable 39%. Now moving to guidance for 2022. Here are the components are on an our share basis. We expect cash same-store NOI growth to range between 6% and 7%, and average occupancy to range between 96.5% to 97.5%. We are forecasting rent growth in our markets to be 11% in the U.S. and 10% globally. For Strategic Capital, we expect revenue excluding promotes to range between $540 million and $560 million. We expect net promote income of $0.55 per share for the year, almost all of which will occur in the third quarter and is driven by our PELP venture. While a record, given the significant increase in rents and valuations, we would expect to see similar or higher promote levels in 2023. In response to continued strong demand, we are forecasting development starts of $4.5 billion to $5 billion with approximately 35% build-to-suits. Dispositions will range between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion, two-thirds of which we expect to close this quarter. We're forecasting net deployment uses of $2.3 billion at the midpoint, which we plan to fund with $1.6 billion of free cash flow after dividends and a modest increase in leverage. We project core FFO, including the $0.55 of net promote income, to range between $5 and $5.10 share, representing 22% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Core FFO, excluding promotes, will range between $4.45 and $4.55 per share or year- over-year growth of 10% at the midpoint. Since our investor forum in 2019, our three-year earnings CAGR has been 13% excluding promotes, well ahead of the 8% to 9% CAGR forecast we originally provided. Before closing out, I want to spend a minute on the quality of our earnings drivers and differentiator, which set Prologis apart from other real estate companies. We continue to drive strong organic growth and aren't reliant upon external growth to achieve sector leading results. In fact, approximately 75% of the increase to our core FFO for 2022, excluding promotes is derived from organic growth, principally same-store NOI and Strategic Capital fee related earnings. It's important to point out that in 2022, our Strategic Capital revenue including promotes will be over $1 billion, a new milestone. This high margin business generates very durable fee stream with asset management fees marked to fair values each quarter all while requiring minimal capital. In addition, we see growing earnings from our Essentials business, which allows us to expand our services and solutions beyond rent. When we introduce this business back in 2018, we set a target of $300 million from procurement savings and Essentials revenue. We will hit that target this year with more than $225 million from procurement and $75 million from Essentials. In light of our success with procurement and the fact that we have embedded this initiative into our platform, we will not provide specific procurement reporting going forward, instead focusing on Essentials. We also have a long development runway of $26 billion, much of which comes from our international opportunity set, positioning us for continued strong value creation well into the future. Lastly, these differentiators are all underpinned by the lowest cost of capital among REITs and unmatched scale that minimizes operating costs. In closing, while 2021 was a year of many records, the bulk of the benefit from the current environment will be realized in the future, providing a clear, tangible runway for sector leading growth for many years to come. We are confident our best years are still ahead of us. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. John Kim : Thank you. I wanted to ask if you could provide some color on the yields on development starts, which compressed 50 basis points sequential this quarter. I'm pretty sure this does not include the uplifting market rental growth of 10% you're expecting this year, but I just wanted to double check that the case. But also was wondering how you view development yields and cap rates trending this year in the rising rate environment. Thomas Olinger : Yeah. So, the answer to your question is yes. We have not included the forecasted rent. So, we underwrite based on what we see currently. So, we're -- in this environment we're seeing returns compress. You should expect to see some compression in the development yield. Now mix also has a lot to do that -- with that. And that's something we can check out and maybe get back to you guys in the call down. In terms of cap of trends, I don't think you want to pay any attention to our forecast since we've been consistently wrong for the last five years. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citi. Your line is open. Emmanuel Korchman : Hey, good morning. In terms of your ramping start guidance and commentary from lots of other competitors in the logistic space, when should people start worrying about the amount of supply coming? And maybe an easy way to answer that is how much of your starts are preleased, or do you expect to get preleased over the next couple months and sort of a switch that supply issue? Thomas Olinger : Well, I'll start then Chris will have some data for you too, Manny. I think every year we've all forecasted the supply exceeding demand and we yet have to see that happen after the global financial crisis. It will happen in some year. I just don't know whether it's this coming year or some other year, but I've never seen 70% preleasing in 40 years of doing this in the development portfolio. And also, the interest in built-to-suits, I think is a pretty good indication that the product just isn't there. And I'm willing to bet this is a counterfactual, but I'm willing to bet if there were more supply, there would be more absorption of more demand. People simply cannot get the space that they need. But I think it will be several years. And the other thing you need to pay attention to is that overall supply numbers are interesting, but our portfolio is very differentiated in terms of the markets -- high barrier markets that our portfolio lives in. And let's not forget about overseas, because the dynamic overseas in terms of supply are very different than they are in the U.S. So, I think it's a complicated soup. I'm not trying to avoid your answer, but that's not on the first page of my worry list. It will be at some point, but it's not this year and I don't think it's going to be next year, Chris? Chris Caton : Yeah. Sure, Manny. So, the numbers for this year look very strong market environment, 375 to 400 million square feet of both delivery and net absorption in our 30 markets. That'll leave the market vacancy rate at an ultra low all-time record 3.4%, 3.5% vacancy. So, very low. Now this is especially true in our U.S. global markets where we have an overweight strategy. In those markets the under construction pipeline is just 3% of stock and is 70% preleased. 2021 net absorption, so demand was 14% higher than that under construction pipeline. Now by comparison, our regional markets have 4.8% of their markets under construction. So, our global markets are 180 basis points better. 2021 demand that net absorption was 12% below this under construction pipeline in the regional markets. So, our global markets are 25% better. Operator : Your next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Your line is open. Jamie Feldman : Great. Thanks for that color. Just -- as you think about when supply chain -- well, first -- the first question, where are we, or how much longer before you think supply chains, do you start to smooth out, but I guess even more importantly, because that's probably impossible to take a date. What is warehouse demand look like when supply chains too smooth out? So, of the type of demand that Tom outlined, the different categories of demand, when supply chains smooth out how much of that goes away? Hamid Moghadam : Okay. I think Tom answered your second question, but let me take another stab at it. We know this is a fact, it's not opinion that supply -- that inventory levels -- in terms of inventory to sales ratios are 10 points below what they were prior to the pandemic. And the reason for that is that people are sitting at home and the goods economy has been on fire and people are buying a lot of stuff and not spending as much money on experience, et cetera. So that dynamic will change. But regardless, that 10% will have to snap back to a normal level. And that's a source for demand. In addition to that, as we outlined in a paper that we put at almost the year and a half ago now, we believe there is -- at that time, we thought 5% to 10%; today, we would say 10% to 15% more demand. In other words, higher inventory to sales ratio than normal or pre-pandemic, because of the need for resilience. And where -- where's that number come from, it come from all the customers that we talk to every day. So, between where we are now and where we think we're going to end up being, there is a 20% to 25% swing in inventories. That is huge. And it is not driven by the fact that there's a bunch of inventories sitting around, certainly not in the U.S. and maybe sitting around in some plant somewhere, but in the U.S., there's no inventory around for it to go away. That's the problem. And that's what's creating the supply chain problem. Now there were a lot of people smarter than me who predicted that the supply chain problems will be -- would've been over by Christmas or after Christmas. That is not the case. All they're doing is they're parking the ships further into the Pacific so that the visual is not as concerning, if you will, as it would've been, too many 60 minute stories on that, that concern the politicians, but that's not the only indication of a supply chain problem. I mean, you could have a product that has 50 different parts going into it. And until the last part gets there, you can't ship that product. So that's a supply chain problem. The fact that you can't get trackers to pick up the goods from ports or transport them from point A to point B, that's a supply chain problem. I think all of those things are going to take multiple years to result themselves. So, I think we're going to be in this mode for a while. Operator : Your next question comes from Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Craig Mailman : Hey, everyone. Tom, I kind of want to go back to your commentary. You guys traditionally had said 8% to 9% FFO growth, X promotes. The CAGR since the Investor Day has been 13%. And I believe you guys are already kind of at 10% with initial guidance here. I mean, in this part of the cycle where market rent growth continues to be underestimated, your mark-to-market grows, you're unleashing a little bit of the balance sheet with higher leverage here in that $2.5 million of uses here, kind of how should we think about maybe this point in the cycle trend till we get an inflection and how long could that last? Thomas Olinger : Hey, Craig. So, I think you're asking what's 8% to 9% -- if it was 8% to 9% back in 2019, has that changed today? And yes, it's changed. And I think for several reasons. And it gets back to the differentiators I talked about in my script, but I'll start with same-store. My memory is that the same-store embedded in that Investor Day was 3.5% to 4.5%. And that had \u2026 Hamid Moghadam : It was actually 3% growth on top of 3% growth in market rent, up at the mark-to-market that existed there. And I don't remember what that was. It was in the teen certain. Thomas Olinger : Yeah. Under the -- our new methodology, I think that we were about 18%, give or take. Today we're at 36%, so almost double. Right? So, you can think about that ratchet -- that in-place to market alone is going to ratchet up our same-store growth by more than 100 basis points, up to 150 basis points. So, you can think about that level of same-store for several years, because that 36% in-place to market growth is an average. So think about what it's going to be over the next year or two, should be higher, right? Because you're going to be rolling leases higher. And that 36% is not stopping. If you look at our guidance, right, for rent growth for the year and rent change, I would expect to see that in-place to market build by the time we get to 2020 -- and then 2022, it's going to -- I think it's going to cross the 40% mark. So that same-store is going to continue to grow and it's going -- it's not a one or two-year story. It's two, three, four, five-year story. And again, that's what market rents not growing the 36%, that's number one. Second would be think about our Strategic Capital business, how we are scaling in that business, how our fees are growing without promotes, right? We saw asset values increase 39% overall for the year. Well guess what? That increases asset values in our funds and our asset management fees increase as well. So, that business is continuing to scale and contribute. And then when you look at our Essentials business, we expect -- we talked that Investor Day about that business, adding 50 basis points of growth, kind of $0.02. I think we're going to be well ahead of that. So, I could go on with differentiators, but, that 8% to 9%, the new normal is I think what you're staring down with our core results this year. Hamid Moghadam : Craig, let me add two things to what Tom said, all of which I agree with. Number one, you actually got our same-store right, better than most people including us. So, congratulations on that -- on that for the past. But going forward, look, the market is really good and all kinds of different portfolios, regardless of their strategies will do well in an environment where rents are going up and cap rates are compressing. But we are thinking way beyond that. I mean, Tom mentioned Essentials, we have significant expectations for that business. Look at our labor, CWI business, that is becoming -- we did it as a service to customers, but it's quickly turning into a potential profit center. We have now put together a group to invest in the EV charging. And we have actually committed to our first project in Southern California for EV charging on trucks. The ROIs on that business are off the charts. So, we're not -- and by the way, I could go on for another 20 minutes talking about the stuff that's in the pipeline. So, we're not sitting and just praying for the real estate aspects of our business. The most valuable aspect of our business is the billion square feet of customers that we serve that are in need of lots of other things. So, we're really excited about the long-term prospects. We didn't have that in 2019. Those things were glimmer in our eye. Now they're real businesses producing real bottom line. So, that's why I'm pretty optimistic about the future going forward.  And remember all of that is being done with sub 20% leverage. And external growth, yeah, we have more external growth than anybody, but in relation to the size of our portfolio, external growth is almost an afterthought. We don't need to depend on that. I'd say in my opinion, lower quality source of growth because you're just arbitraging external capital to the internal cost capital. Ours is organic. So, really, really not only feel good about the level of growth on forward, but also the quality of that growth. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ron Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ron Kamdem, your line is open. Ronald Kamdem : Yeah. Thanks so much for the time. Congrats on the quarter. Just thinking about the same-store NOI guidance for 2022, any more color on maybe the U.S. versus Europe? And maybe can you compare and contrast, how you expect sort of growth for next year in the two regions? Thanks. Thomas Olinger : Yeah. I'll throw in some thoughts on rent growth. Rent growth in Europe is catching up to the U.S. And we've seen this play out in the past. And frankly it's catching up slower than we expected, because vacancy rates across Europe haven't been lower than the U.S., but that's taking place now. And I think we and Chris ought to pile in here. This year we'll see European rent growth that I think will exceed that U.S. Chris Caton : Indeed, the vacancy rates are lower and the rent growth is accelerating. So, it's an interesting point in time in the European markets. Operator : Your next question is from Jon Petersen with Jeffries. Your line is open. Jonathon Petersen : Thank you. Just wanted to ask an accounting question. On the promote income, is that considered reincome or is that in the taxable REIT subsidiary? And if it is reincome, is that going to necessitate a large for a potentially a special dividend this year, just given the size of the promotes? Thomas Olinger : The vast majority of it does come into the REIT itself versus the taxable REIT subsidiary. When you think just about dividends, as we've talked about in the past, we are -- we have extremely low payout ratio, 60%-ish is what we've been averaging and similar to what I would expect for 2022. And we're paying out the minimum required. So, you should think about our dividend having to grow in line with our underlying earnings. So, when you see earnings growing at 22%, those promotes our landing in the op in our REIT and needs to be reflected in our dividend accordingly. Operator : Your next question is from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Your line is open. Nick Yulico : Thanks. In terms of the guidance for this year on Strategic Capital and the promotes, Tom, can you just give us to feel for what level of asset value appreciation is assumed for the funds this year? Thomas Olinger : Sure, Nick. So, what -- I'll preface it by, there are several factors that go into the promote, not just real estate valuation, there's FX considerations because it's a euro denominated fund, but that fund also has functional currencies, not in euro, British pound, for example, right? So, there's FX activity going on functional and transactional -- transitional. Second would be there's depth mark-to-market in there. So, longwinded way of saying that there are a lot of factors that, that impact it. From a evaluation standpoint, we think there's some modest, mid single digit valuation increase embedded in there. We're taking our best shot at where it's going to land. A lot of variables can impact it. And we're going to update you accordingly as those move around, particularly given how this -- how -- once you -- once the promote exceeds that top hurdle, you can have a lot of variability in either direction, just depending on how things go. So, funds -- based on third-party appraisals, they're going to be what they're going to be. Interest rates are going to be what they're going to be. FX rates are going to be what they're going to be. We've taken their best shot at estimating those impacts. And we'll keep you posted. Hamid Moghadam : Yeah. The other thing I would add to that is that we're not assuming cap rate compression. And based on today's values I would say there's appraisal lag built into some of these valuations because the appraisers have a hard time keeping up with comps. Even today the market's been so fast moving. So, I think there are a couple of layers of protection built in that. And obviously, as Tom explained, once you pass the waterfall, all of the additional values promotable. So, there's a lot of leverage on the upside and also on the downside. But if I were betting person, I would take the upside on that, not the downside. Operator : Your next question is from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Your line is open. Anthony Powell : Hi, good morning. I guess a follow-up on the remote question. Thanks for the color on 2020 repromotes. How should we look at this stream of income over the next few years? And should we be valuing promotes at a higher multiple historical given kind of the recurring -- increasing recurring nature and the growth of the valuation of the portfolio. Hamid Moghadam : Let me take a stab at this. The issue with our promotes is this, we have two huge open-ended funds that are promotable and those are on three years promote cycle. So, 2022 and 2023, our big promote year is just like 2020 and -- sorry -- 2019 and 2020 were, except more so. So, the third year we have some small funds in that year. This year, for example, is that third year, which is relatively thin. We had -- this past year, we had UKLV in there. So, we have some smaller funds in there. Those funds over time will grow. So, this promote picture will become more even.  We've also gone through a modernization of our funds terms and given the investors the option of, uh, basically extending the promotable period to the lean years and also new capital coming in is going to have its promote tied to the year that the capital came in as opposed to a set year. So, over time, you're going to see these promotes smooth out. It will take some years for them to be perfectly smooth. So, the way I would think about it is, look at the promotes over a three-year cycle and average them. And I think the guidance that Tom talked about for this year 2022 is actually not a bad number as sort of thinking about roughly that average over a three-year period. And as to the valuation of that, look, you guys are -- you guys can do that better than us, but we're not getting anything for that. And we should get something. So, because the history is there, you can go back and look at it for 10 years under the new Prologis 11 years and assume something as a percentage of AUM. Historically, I've always used 25 basis points kind of in my head of promotable AUM with 60% of that going to the bottom line, because of our participation programs. So that's the way I think about it in a normalized year, but I think it's going to be much higher than that in this cycle. Thomas Olinger : And you certainly seen our AUM grow and continue to grow. So, the underlying base at this point is growing rapidly as well. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Blaine Heck : Great. Thanks. Wanted to touch on acquisitions quickly. It looks like you guys came in like this quarter relative to guidance, and I know acquisitions are certainly tougher to forecast than what you're going to be able to do on the development side, or even on the disposition side. But wanted to get your thoughts on the acquisition market in general, whether the shortfall this quarter was driven by pricing or anything else specifically? And then any broader commentary regarding your level of interest, especially in large acquisitions in 2022, would be very helpful. Thanks. Thomas Olinger : Yeah. There was nothing in the quarterly results as indicative of more or less interest. And as you see quarter-to-quarter, these numbers move around quite a bit. We are always in the market. We look at all the deals, big small portfolios, et cetera. And prices have been moving up. Obviously, there are competitive situations, but I think we're disciplined like we always have been with acquisitions. But we got great teams and we're on every deal. Operator : Your next question is from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Michael Carroll : Yeah. Thanks. Can you provide some color on your underwritten development margins? It looks like the margins in the 4Q 2021 and 2021 starts is below in-place pipeline and the recent lease stabilize the assets. There's something there that's driving those lower, or is it just conservative estimates? Hamid Moghadam : Well, our margins on start have historically always been projected to be lower than our actual margins with completion. Because we don't count on things like super rent growth. And as we talked about earlier or cap rate compression or all those other things that have happened and obviously over time, we're using up the cheapest land and buying more and more of our land at margin. So -- and the kind of margins we've had in the last couple of years have been just an unprecedented. So, over time you should expect those kinds of margins to glide to a more normalized level as the cap rate compression slows down and rental growth eventually will slow down, can't keep going at 20% a year. So that is not at all unusual. There's nothing specific going on that other than mix where in some years we're developing more here and there and there are different, and our land bank has different ages in different jurisdictions. So, mix has a lot -- has a little bit to do with it, but the general trend has been much higher than cross cycle kind of margin that we would expect to see. Operator : Your next question is from Dave Rodgers with Baird. Your line is open. David Rodgers : Yeah. Hi, everyone. Wanted to ask about just kind of labor in general, obviously from a broader economic standpoint, big issue for everyone. What are you hearing from your customers in terms of the rebuild of inventory may be related to labor, how long that might take and whether labor's getting better or worse for them and how that might be impacting any real estate decisions if at all? Hamid Moghadam : Labor is getting worse. Labor has been getting worse actually for 10 years, and the pandemic only just made it worse faster. I think that is forcing our customers into deploying more automation, because they have to get their work done. That requires a lot of capital that many of our customers don't have. So that's a business opportunity for Prologis is to invest in innovation and robotics and all kinds of other automation issues that help with the labor problem. Also CWI is a major step that we've taken in that regard. But I will tell you this, that more of that technology is deployed in our buildings, the stickier the tenants become, and probably they -- the term of the lease will increase and turnover costs will go down. So, I think it's good for us long-term, but I don't think this labor problem is going to get solved. And it's particularly acute in the U.S. It exists in other parts of the world, but it's particularly acute in the U.S. And there lots of theories as the reasons for it, but I'm not smart enough to know which ones make sense and which ones don't. Operator : Your next question is from Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Your line is open. Tom Catherwood : Thank you and good morning, everybody. Tom, going back to something you mentioned your opening remark. You were talking about the $26 billion build out potential in your land bank. And you mentioned that it's underpinned by an international opportunity. Set developments obviously jumped in 2021, but they seem to be weighted more towards the U.S. than they were in 2019 and 2020. Is the expectation that Europe could account for a larger percent of the 2022 starts, or is the opportunity set you were talking about kind of in other geographies? Thomas Olinger : Yeah. So, if you look at the composition of the land bank, our option land and covered land place, so this is almost 200 million square feet of build out opportunity. It's about two-thirds in the Americas and a third outside of the Americas. So that's the balance. And the pace at which the cadence at which we take it down, it'll be opportunity driven. Hamid Moghadam : The other thing I would say is that if you look at our 20-year track record of development profits, actually two-thirds have come from overseas and a third from the U.S. And again, that's a differentiator for Prologis where we just have a bigger plank bill and to make money. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street. Your line is open. Vince Tibone : Hi, good morning. I want to follow-up on the lease mark-to-market. Could you share the estimated mark-to-market on a cash basis and also share the typical annual escalators you are getting on leases today? Hamid Moghadam : Yeah. On the cash in-place to mark today is right around 30%. And from an escalator standpoint, I think what we're seeing today with escalators would clearly be in the threes, and in certain markets it's in the fours and potentially even higher. So, I would tell you there, when we think about all this escalators are certainly important. But at the end of the day, our teams are trying to drive the highest cash flows at the Canada lease. Bumps are a part of that. Starting rents a part of that. TIs are a part of that, right? It all goes into the mix. And so, while it's important to look at bumps, it's not necessarily the sole determinate of the economics. You're driving out of leases. Thomas Olinger : We are NPV investors on leasing. And the profile of it is -- usually our flexibility to deal with the tenants preferences actually allows us to extract the higher NPV. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Mike Mueller with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Michael Mueller : Yeah. Hi. What are -- is there a big difference today in terms of the margins you're expecting on build-to-suits versus spec developments? Thomas Olinger : Mike, I'd say there's no greater difference than there always have been. And you underwrite these at 15 to 20 on spec and roughly 10% on build-to-suit and those numbers are move around a little bit based on risk. But if you're asking about the differentiation between the two, things really haven't changed. Obviously, the outcomes have changed, because the margins are much, much higher. Operator : Your next question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Steve Sakwa : Yeah. Thanks. I had just a question on development costs. What sort of inflation trends are you seeing kind of starting this year? How did that compare to 2021 and what sort of bottlenecks or issues are you seeing kind of in your own supply chain getting all the stuff you need to build everything you want to build this year? Thomas Olinger : Yeah, Steve. So in the U.S. in 2021, there were total shell construction cost increases of about 31% and that's on a market wide basis. We were able to mitigate about 7% of that increase or seven percentage points of the increase. So, our net increase that we absorbed last year was 24%. So, we feel like most of that is a competitive advantage against our competitors. And there's a lot behind this in terms of what do we see for this year? Tough to see say how that plays out, but our teams are considering a 10% to 12% additional shell construction increase for 2022. Hamid Moghadam : By the way, then let me tie that to some of the earlier questions. When you getting this kind of escalation on replacement costs, and by the way, I would say land prices have gone up even at a higher rate that, it's nice to own already a billion square feet of this kind of real estate. So, particularly all -- the other people trying to get into the same business driving down cap rates at the same time that replacement cost rents are going up is a nice place to be. That is not brilliance. That's just dumb luck. Operator : Your next question is from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Caitlin Burrows : Hi, there. I guess just considering your expectations for 2022 and the guidance you've laid out, can you give any details on what portion is already known? Like for example, lease has signed in 2021 that will commence in 2022, you already know that timing and rate, but for the parts that you don't already know, like lease commencements in the second half or pace of development stabilization, what sort of assumptions are you making? Is it that the strength of 2021 stays the same, improves further or slows and kind of what's driving that? Thomas Olinger : I would say Caitlin, there are very few things that haven't happened already in that will affect 2022 one way or another, because even if we get it wrong on rental change on one side or together, we put away so many of our rollovers already in for 2022, that there isn't that much opportunity on the margin to put of effect that in a big way. So, there's 6% leasing basically remaining to be done. And that's going to happen on average in the middle of the year. So that's really 3% of our 97%. It's just not going to move the numbers around that much. And obviously development stabilizations and all that are more a future year type of thing again, they occur during the year. So, I would say our, our volatility in the short term, meaning this year is going to be relatively modest. And you can take that answer to the bank pretty much any year at this time. Hamid Moghadam : And then I'd go back just to the in-place to market that $1.2 billion of NOI that's we will capture with no market rent growth, that gives you a high level of certainty regarding the same-store growth going forward. So, the things you need to think about is, if rent growth outperforms in 2022, that's going to take that $1.2 billion rep. I mentioned, I think that 36% in-place to market today is going to cross 40% by the time we get to the end of the year, it's that sort of predictability I believe that underpins our confidence why our growth will be -- continue to be sector leading for many years to come. Operator : Your next question is from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Derek Johnston : Hi, everyone. Thank you. Are rising rents and revenue growth still handling outpacing the supply chain and efficiencies, inflation, and really overall expense growth? How do you view rents versus expenses, linked expenses playing out in 2022? Thomas Olinger : I'm not sure I understand the question completely. Expenses are obviously going up as well, but they're going up more sort of in line with general inflation and real estate rent inflation in logistics has been certainly higher in that if you want to describe it as inflation. The other thing is that in terms of overall logistic costs, rents even with their recent escalation are 3%, 4% of the total picture. So, cost of drivers, cost of fuel, cost of transportation, all of those things are much bigger factors in terms of our customer's cost structure. So, there is not as much sensitivity to the real estate cost. If there's a commensurate increase in productivity that comes along with that, I think that's what you asked, but we'll give you an opportunity to clarify here if that's not what you asked. Derek Johnston : Thank you. Thomas Olinger : Okay. All right. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citi. Your line is open. Michael Bilerman : Hey, good morning. This is Michael Bilerman. Hamid, I want to come back to -- you gave an answer where you said you're not going to predict cap rate trends, because you've been consistently wrong for the last five years. And I want to sort of dive into sort of the components that made you wrong over the last five years. I get rents of not dramatically and NOI is so important as numerator , but denominator the cap rate really does impact your capital allocation decisions, what to buy, what to sell, what to develop, how you raise capital on the balance sheet and all those sort of inputs. So, I guess, how are you thinking about it going forward? You must have a view. And so I'm just trying to understand maybe some of the components that made you wrong over the last five years and how that informs your decision going forward. Hamid Moghadam : Look, we've taken our best shot and we do have a view on these things. After all we'll give you guidance and we've done that for 25 years. So, we do have a view. And our views always been -- not always, but in the last 10 years, as far as I remember, is that most of us in this room sort of grew up in the 80s and 90s and caps rates were 9% and 10% for logistics in those days. So as the cap rates have marched down in the last 20 years to where they are today, I don't know, 3% to 4%, we are anchored in the past. So it always feels like it's a little expensive and all that. But there are a couple things that have changed. Logistics have -- first of all, generally interest rates and all that have driven capital market returns down for everything, stocks, bonds, everything, including real estate. But I think there has been a better appreciation of logistics, real estate as an asset class that has caused logistic cap rates to compress further than maybe some other property tax that have compressed less or in more recent years gone the other way. I don't see anything stopping that part of it. So your gets as good as mine and with respect to long-term interest rates and their direction. But I can tell you the weight of the money is accelerating. It's not slowing down. The other thing is that I think if you are uncertain about the inflation outlook, which is what a lot of the discussion is, is it inflation? Is it supply chain? Is it short-term? Is it long-term? Not a bad thing to own modestly leveraged real estate in an asset class that's in equilibrium -- actually better than equilibrium, couple hundred basis points to either than equilibrium, when you have replacement costs that give you that buffer. So, we have the buffer of the mark-to-market in the 30% range that Tom talked about, but we also have the buffer of replacement costs going up, which Gene talked about. That's just the future buffer that we started talking about yet. So, I think rental score -- I have been consistently in our company low on rental projections, but higher than all my colleagues, low compared to what actually happened, but higher than all my colleagues. And I expect that to continue you for some time, but I think it's imprudent in a year where you've had this kind of spectacular rental growth to go out there and project 10 more years of that. I mean -- and so we run our business assuming more modest, sort of more closer to trend-line type of dynamics. And if it works out better than that, we report it to you every quarter. So we try to get it as close to the pin and as the pin moves, we'll move. So, I don't know if that's an answer to your question or not. One other thing I would tell you and I think you were the -- is this the last question? Yeah, you were the last question. So, maybe this is a wrap up. Look, as you think about our company, it's really important to get cap rates, right? Really important at least in the long term to get rental growth and all those things, right? And we will out compete on those basis all day long, but this company is increasingly become -- becoming a multiple product line cash flow generating type of business. Tom mentioned a billion dollars coming out of our private capital franchise with essentially no capital because our capital is our co-investment, which is in the rent business. So, the Essentials business, we sort of gloss over it, but it's a $75 million year business. Now it can be $1 billion business, the EV business can be $1 billion business. I'm not saying that it is, or whether it's going to happen in two years, but increasingly we're building these cash flows on top of the base real estate business because eventually the real estate business will slow down, but the ability to do business with those customers that use our real estate, I think is a runway for us for multiple decades. So, that's what's really exciting about where we are today. Hamid Moghadam : Thank you for your interest in our company. And we look forward to talking to you soon.

Now for our prepared statement, I will turn it over to Jim Connor. Jim Connor : Thanks, Ron. Good afternoon, everyone. The fundamentals of our business continue to be at all-time record levels. We achieved record high occupancy levels in both our stabilized in-service and total in-service portfolio, record rent growth on a cash and GAAP basis, our development platform had nearly $340 million of development starts, our Coastal Tier 1 exposure is approaching 50%, our portfolio mark-to-market increased to 48%. All of these factors contributed to raising key components of our 2022 guidance, including over 10% growth in FFO, 11% growth in AFFO at the midpoint. Now let me turn it over to Steve to cover some of the market fundamentals and our operations. Steve Schnur : Thanks, Jim. On the fundamental side, first quarter demand was 95 million square feet, making it 5 of the last 6 quarters of demand in the 100 million square foot or greater range. First quarter deliveries were about 85 million square feet with the vacancy rate at quarter end remaining near record lows all-time at 3.1%. Taking the record low vacancy rate of near 3%, coupled with an expected positive demand supply gap again this year, we have revised our 2022 rent growth forecast for our markets from the 10% to 15% range to the high teens to low 20% range. On the long-term demand side, CBRE recently affirmed its outlook for 1.4 billion square feet of demand through 2026 with no periods of negative net absorption through 2032. Although we are paying close attention to headline data such as inflation, fuel and labor costs and a resurgence in bottlenecks occurring in some Asian ports, we have yet to see an impact to demand in our portfolio. Based on recent dialogues with our customers, RFPs to lease space and the most recent logistics manager index at record levels, the near-term outlook is as strong as it has been in this cycle. Long term, we believe the secular themes for greater inventory resiliency, and e-commerce are still very much intact and should continue to drive short-term and long-term demand. Turning to our own portfolio. We continue to see these positive indicators, evidenced by 62 leases executed during the quarter totaling over 7.7 million square feet. Demand was broad-based across categories with a number of leases between 250,000 and 850,000 square feet with customers such as FedEx, Samsung, Walgreens, Cardinal Health, International Paper, Sealy Mattress, some major 3PLs and a global e-commerce customer. Of note, we had only 2 spaces greater than 100,000 square feet in our in-service portfolio available at the end of the first quarter. And I'm happy and pleased to report that both are now leased. Our lease activity for the quarter, combined with the strong fundamentals I discussed, led to continued growth in rents on second-generation leases of 29% cash and 49% GAAP, both records. I'd also point out that only 18% of this lease activity was in coastal markets. Across our entire in-service portfolio, the portfolio leased mark-to-market is now 48% on a GAAP basis. We believe this presents strong visibility for significant rent growth for the foreseeable future. We finished the quarter with the total in-service portfolio 99.1% leased and the stabilized portfolio 99.4% leased, again, both all-time records. On the development front, we had a tremendous first quarter starts, breaking ground on 8 speculative projects totaling $339 million in cost. All of these projects are in well-located submarkets. Our confidence in leasing speculative space continues to be very strong, as evidence of the 5.6 million square feet of speculative developments placed in service over the past year. Those projects were originally 3% leased at the start and are now 100% leased. Our development pipeline at quarter end totaled $1.64 billion with 63% allocated to Coastal Tier 1 markets and 85% allocated to overall Tier 1 markets. This pipeline is 52% preleased, and we expect to generate value creation margins over 70%. Looking forward, our pipeline for future development starts is very strong. Our land balance at quarter end totaled $582 million with an additional $235 million uncovered land. 93% of this land bank is located in Coastal Tier 1 markets. Coupled with the land options we have, another land in our operating portfolio, we can support our current level of annual starts for the next 3 years. It is also important to note for modeling NAV that the market value of the land we own is about 2x our book basis and, on average, we've only owned this land for about 1 year. With the fundamentals I outlined and our best-in-class local operating teams, our outlook for new development starts as strong. This is reflected by our revised guidance, up about 20% from our original midpoint. I'll now turn it over to Nick Anthony to cover acquisitions and dispositions. Nick Anthony : Thanks, Steve. I'll start with dispositions. As noted on the last call, earlier this quarter, we contributed to the third tranche of Amazon access to our joint venture with CBRE Investment Management, for which our share of the proceeds was $269 million. Coupled with the outright sale of another Amazon facility in Tampa, dispositions totaled $325 million for the quarter. As a result, our Amazon exposure was 5.7% at the end of the quarter. Given the strong prices for logistics real estate and particularly for a few of our strategically located assets, we are seeing an increase in reverse inquiries for some of our assets at prices we previously did not expect, did not have in our original plan to sell in 2022. As a result, we have increased our guidance for dispositions to a range of $900 million to $1.1 billion. This will provide attractively priced capital to fund our increased development expectations. On the acquisition side, we purchased 1 facility totaling 75,000 square feet in the Southern California Mid-County submarket. The building was vacant, and given current leasing prospects, we expect it to stay at a 4.6% yield. I will now turn it over to Mark to discuss our financial results and guidance update. Mark Denien : Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Core FFO for the quarter was $0.44 per share, which represents 12.8% growth over the first quarter of 2021. The increased core FFO per diluted share was primarily driven by rental rate growth, increased occupancy and portfolio growth in highly leased developments. AFFO totaled $156 million for the quarter. Our best in class low level of capital expenditures, along with strong NOI growth continues to generate significant AFFO growth on a share-adjusted basis even in excess of our FFO growth. Same-property NOI growth on a cash basis for the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021 was 7.3%. The growth in same-property NOI was due to increased occupancy and rent growth as well as the burn-off of some free rent compared to the first quarter of 2021. We do expect this growth to moderate a bit for the remainder of the year based mainly on less free rent burn-off. Same property NOI growth on a net effective basis was 5.2% for the quarter. As a result of our strong start to 2022, we announced revised core FFO guidance for 2022 to a range of $1.88 to $1.94 per share compared to the previous range of $1.87 to $1.93 per share. The $1.91 midpoint of our revised core FFO guidance represents an over 10.4% increase of 2021 results. We also announced revised guidance for growth in AFFO on a share adjusted basis between 9.1% and 13% with a midpoint of 11% compared to the previous range of 8.4% to 12.3%. For same-property NOI growth on a cash basis, we have increased our guidance to a range of 5.8% to 6.6% from the previous range of 5.4% to 6.2%. This increase is mainly a result of expectations of continued strong rental rate growth and occupancy for the remainder of the year, similar to levels that we experienced in the first quarter. On the development guidance. The market fundamentals are submerged and continue to be very supportive of specular developments, and coupled with our lease-up track record, we are revising guidance development starts to be between $1.45 billion and $1.65 billion compared to the previous range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. This increase in development starts provide a key source of growth in 2023 and beyond. We've updated a couple of other components of our guidance based on our more optimistic outlook as detailed in our range of estimates excluded -- included in our supplemental information on website. I'll now turn it back to Jim for a few closing remarks. Jim Connor : Thanks, Mark. In closing, even with some rising macro headwinds on inflation, interest rate and geopolitical side of things, we believe the multiple secular tailwinds driving our business and overall positive GDP and consumer spending set-up will continue to provide opportunities for strong leasing and development. This, combined with the substantial amount of embedded rent growth in our existing portfolio gives us great confidence in our ability to generate double-digit growth in FFO and AFFO for our shareholders not just in 2022, but in the foreseeable future, which should generate a commensurate level of growth in our annual dividend. I want to thank you all for your continued support in Duke Realty. We will now open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions] And with that, operator, we'll open the lines and take our first question. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman. Jamie Feldman : I guess just thinking about the guidance, there's a lot -- several areas where clearly the outlook is better fundamentally, more development starts. Can you just talk about maybe some of the things that might have been a bigger drag than maybe some that we\u2019re thinking about, as you kind of weigh the positives and the negatives, if there was anything? Mark Denien : Jamie, I'll start. This is Mark. There were no really big drags. I guess maybe the only thing you could kind of point to is this change negatively on this year's FFO number will be your increase in dispositions guidance. Most of that increase in dispositions guidance will go to fund the development pipeline. So that's modestly dilutive this year. But it will be certainly accretive in the long run as we trade a low cap rate on disposition sales for higher-yielding development assets. But that was probably a little bit of a drag from where we were last quarter. But I think we're pretty optimistic to start the year, and it's only better now. Jamie Feldman : And then if you think about -- let's say, we do end up -- head into some sort of recession. Can you just talk about portfolio credit quality today and just how you think the -- whether it's earnings growth or occupancy or even leasing spreads would hold up if you did -- we did see a pullback in the economy versus prior cycles? Jim Connor : Yes. Sure, Jamie. It's Jim. I would make a couple of observations. I think we can all point back to roughly 2 years ago at the start of pandemic, which was a great stress test for our portfolio and the quality of our credit tenants. And reminding everybody, 18 to 24 months ago, we were collecting 99.99% of our rents. So not that anybody wants to see that kind of thing again, but that's the kind of stress test that gives us confidence that in any sort of a downturn out there in the future, our portfolio will continue to perform.  And then as Steve pointed out earlier, even if the market softens to the point where there's no rent growth in the markets, we still have 48% embedded rent growth in our portfolio. So I would point to those 2 things as giving us a great deal of confidence in our ability to perform even if things were soft somewhat. Jamie Feldman : Okay. I guess just to be fair, though, I mean, there was a lot of government stimulus that kept tenants healthier, I guess, thinking about even earlier downturns, if we look back at that, it's really declined. Jim Connor : No, I don't -- if you look at the number of tenants in our portfolio that got any sort of government assistance, it's less than 10%. And if you go back and look at some of the tenants that we did rent offset agreements, half of them prepaid those early. So I think that speaks to the quality and the resiliency of the portfolio and the tenants we\u2019ve got. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman. Emmanuel Korchman : If we think about just the long-term drivers of the growth in this business, at this point in the cycle, how much of that should be coming from sort of the internal growth, especially with the mark-to-market as high as it is? I guess the deeper questions there is how much of that we get each year and the next few upcoming years here, how much of that is going to come from external growth? So if we take your, call it, around about 10% growth, is that half from development and half from this rent mark-to-market? Or is it a different proportion than that? Mark Denien : You're close, Jamie -- or Jamie, sorry, Manny. Emmanuel Korchman : This question is mine, Mark. Mark Denien : Yes. We have a slide in our investor deck that lays that out, and it really hasn't changed much. And you're pretty much right on. If you look at our external growth, I think we quoted a development return of like 10% to 12% to FFO, the impact on FFO, net of financing cost of [4 to 6], so that goes together in your 5% to 6%, give or take, of external growth. And then our -- what I call, our internal growth for GAAP FFO same property is about 5%. So it's about 50-50. You're right on. And I think the simple math way to think about it, our mark-to-market our portfolio, like Jim said, is 48%. If you will, plus or minus 10% a year that we've been doing at 48%, there's 5% growth. So that's simple math, but you're pretty close. Emmanuel Korchman : Great. And then on the development starts, is there a -- either a cost or a mix component there? So if we were to look at the number of starts that you're going to have this year versus -- in the new guidance versus the old guidance, has that changed? Is it new projects? Or is it more expensive projects or a couple of bigger projects versus some smaller ones before? Steve Schnur : Yes, Manny, this is Steve. I mean, there's always some ins and outs. I would tell you, it's a couple more projects. There's something significantly large that skew in that one way or the other, so somewhere along -- I mean, we go into this -- we've got most of next year mapped out as well. Again, there's always a few that we find along the way. But we've been pretty diligent about building our land bank and having visibility for the next couple of years in our development guidance. Emmanuel Korchman : So Steve, what would be the potential for that to start guidance to go up again this year at all? Or is that kind of fixed for '22 at this point? Steve Schnur : For development guidance to go up again, on starts? Emmanuel Korchman : Yes. Steve Schnur : Yes, if we found another project that we're able to start near term, but those are harder and harder to come by with entitlements. So could it go up modestly, perhaps. But most of what we have is, we're already in some level of process on. Jim Connor : Yes. I think the only significant filter in that would be some big build-to-suits. And they're out there, but they take a lot of time. We've got a number of those built into the pipeline. But you add 1 or 2 or more of those, and I think you could see an appreciable increase. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Kim. John Kim : On your development land bank, you're saying now we could accommodate 3 years of development starts at your current run rate because the run rate has gone up. What's your ability to source more land in your Tier 1 markets and have development yields kind of remain attractive to you? Steve Schnur : Yes. I would say I think that's the strength of our team. We've been able to do that the last 3 years, looking back to 2019 -- 2019, 2020, 2021, we\u2019ve ran at a lower land bank number, and this development -- our development starts have been in the same range. So we've got -- as we've said in our opening remarks, we've got a land bank that can support this level of starts for the next 3 years. There's always a number of sites that are under contract, under option, some level of due diligence. But our teams are -- this is where our team shine. And I think we've done a really nice job with doing it. Jim Connor : Yes. For perspective, John, we had almost double the land now that we had a year ago. And to Steve's point, we've been doing this level of development all along. Now a lot of that land is covered land. It's generating income, which is even better. But we've been buying about the same amount we've been monetizing every year. We've been doing it through this whole cycle. John Kim : Right. But development starts are going up. So it's just the visibility on developments, it doesn't seem as strong as it did before. So I was wondering, on the second part of the question, multi-store development in Tier 1 markets or non-Tier 1 markets doing developments there, when do these become more attractive? Jim Connor : The spread between the Coastal Tier 1 and the Tier 1 of the other markets, John? John Kim : Right. Just given the difference in land cost. Does it become more attractive to do, developments outside of your Coastal Tier 1 cities? Jim Connor : Yes. I would tell you, I think the land that we have either on the books or that we control, we believe is in the right submarkets in all of our various markets. So the margins are consistently -- have been consistently, let's just say, north of 50% in our development pipeline. So I would tell you, the value creation opportunity in the whole portfolio is really good. And it's not a situation of where we're differentiating between markets or shifting our strategy. I think we've got ample opportunity across the board. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows. Caitlin Burrows : I had another follow-up question on development. I guess initial '22 development start guidance was low versus '21, but you did revise it higher. And some of your peers have discussed issues with labor and materials impacting developments potential. So just wondering if you could comment to what extent you've been impacted by current labor or material headwinds impacting your development potential? Steve Schnur : Yes, Caitlin, I'd tell you, we're closely monitoring what's going on with materials. I'd tell you, our processes have changed a bit in terms of when we're starting design, how quickly or how far out in front we're procuring materials. I would tell you, all of our 2022 starts are locked in, in terms of our start dates and design and our permitting as well as our early long-lead material items. Labor hasn't been as big of an issue, but materials have been. But again, I think this is where we're able to use our size and our balance sheet and our 50 years of experience to stay out in front of us. Jim Connor : Yes, Caitlin, I would add to Steve's comment. I think what's helping us drive our guidance on the development side isn't related to labor or material costs, it's the land that we have in the portfolio when those sites are entitled and ready to go and it's the leasing of our spec portfolio. And we've come out of the first quarter and most of the way through April much stronger than I think even we anticipated. So I think that's given us the confidence to go ahead and increase development guidance once again. Caitlin Burrows : Yes. And actually, my second question was going to be on that speculative side. I was just wondering, it does seem like speculative development at this point definitely makes sense. But wondering what metrics you look at to gauge what speculative development is warranted and you're open to it versus something that might be considered more risky. Jim Connor : Well, I don't know what we can do, this is more risky than speculative development. I'm open to ideas, I suppose. So what we look at is a number of metrics. What's the percentage leased in the development pipeline. And even with the increase in the amount of speculative development we're doing versus build-to-suits, that number is still at roughly 50%, which is a number we're very comfortable with. We look at leasing volume. As Steve cited earlier, this is the, I think, eighth consecutive quarter that we're above 7 million square feet. And we look at the overall occupancy of the portfolio, the in-service and the total portfolio, both of which are above 99%. So I think the combination of all 3 of those metrics would tell you that we need to be doing more speculative development and bring more space into the portfolio. Caitlin Burrows : Got it. Yes, no, I was saying that in certain market conditions, speculative development might be considered more risky, but based on those metrics you're talking about, it seems that's not necessarily the case. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico. Nick Yulico : I was hoping to get, Mark, in terms of the rent spreads that you're assuming in guidance for the rest of the year on a GAAP and cash basis. Mark Denien : Yes. Nick, I think they'll be very similar to what we posted in Q1. The mark-to-market on our portfolio sort of was going at 48%, is really close to the 49% we posted in the first quarter. Steve mentioned only 18% of that role was in coastal markets. That's pretty similar to what we expect for the last 9 months of the year. We still don't have a lot of coastal roll coming out of the last 9 months. So I think you'll see -- it may vary quarter-to-quarter, maybe a little higher or lower. But by and large, for the rest of the year, I think you'll see rent growth that we post on deals very similar to the first quarter. As we look out to next year, we're not going to give guidance yet. But I would tell you that the coastal role we have next year is a little bit over 30% compared to 18% this year. So as we sit here today, I would expect it to get only better next year. Nick Yulico : Okay. Great. That's helpful. Just second question is on development. If you could talk a little bit more about the yield for the deliveries in the first quarter higher than it's been. You had a 67% expected cash yield there, kind of what's driving that. And then also, I guess going back to the yield that you quote on the development pipeline underway, 5.8%, how we should think about ultimately that yield once you deliver since you did raise your market rent forecast. And so I don't think you're trending rents in your development yields. So maybe you can just give us a feel for how that could play out. Mark Denien : Well, I'll start the first question and maybe try to kind of turn it over to else. Our yields have popped for really 2 reasons. We are leasing our spec projects literally as they go in service. We've been talking about -- as Steve mentioned, we started the spec projects we delivered over the last 12 months. We started at 3%. There are now 100%. They are virtually 100% when they went in service. So we've been leasing these up at 2 months or less. We always underwrite 1 year. So when you look at our initial yields, we've got a year of carry costs buried in the cost. So it brings our yield down a little bit. So to the extent we can lease those up 10 or 12 months earlier, that helps yields. So that's part of it. And then the second part was just rent growth. You mentioned it, we don't trend rents when we do our underwriting. We underwrite current rents when we start to deal and then we only adjust that for signed deals. So the deals we're signing based on the market rent of what we are experiencing are substantially and accessible underwrote. So those 2 factors is what's creating that big pop in yields from initial underwriting to delivery. And I would tell you, as we look forward, to the extent that dynamic continues, you'll see that result continue. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith. Michael Goldsmith : You talked a bit about the drivers that have greater inventory resiliency and e-commerce growth. But I wanted to dig into a little bit about reshoring. Do the shutdowns in China escalate this conversation again? And this driver kind of takes a little bit maybe longer than some of the others to kind of realize in demand. So when can we really start to see this as a major contributor to demand going forward? Steve Schnur : Yes. I think it's -- people are determining now, future proofing their supply chains. Whether you're talking about resiliency or future proofing, I think it's a trend we're going to see, I think, New Mexico and Central America relative to manufacturing, we're seeing some of it in spots and in certain industries in the U.S. But the bigger impact near term to us is just more product on our shores. So yes, I think it's definitely top of mind for all of our customers. Jim Connor : Yes, Michael, I would add, I think Steve is exactly right. The near-term impact is the safety stock that our customers are out trying to put in their logistics and supply chain. I think the impact of onshoring and nearshoring will be a little slower but steady or steadier over the course of the next likely 5 to 7 years. Because rebuilding or reengineering, manufacturing, processing, assembly operations takes a little bit more time than just moving the logistics side of the business. So I think that's a better long -- midterm and long-term driver for our space. Michael Goldsmith : Got it. And as a follow-up, last year, you had a number -- you had more renewals than maybe expected as people look to renew early. What are you seeing on that this year? And how do those lease negotiations differ from kind of traditional expirations? And what sort of escalators are you currently getting in sort of your renewals? Steve Schnur : Yes. I would tell you -- it's Steve. I would say that, do we have customers trying to -- given the environment out there, trying to lock up space earlier? Certainly. I think it's -- a good brokerage firm representing them would tell them to do if it's a critical piece to their supply chain. We're -- we'll listen to customers. We'll talk with them. But obviously, it's a landlords market right now. So we don't tend to negotiate rents too far in advance in today's market. In terms of escalators, it's been a big point of emphasis for us. You saw us move our escalators up in the latter part of '21 up north of 3% in what we were signing then. In the first quarter of '22, that number has moved to 3.6%. I would tell you, I would expect that trend to continue the rest of the year. Certainly, we've -- there's inflation numbers out there that would suggest that they could go higher for us in our annual escalators within our leases. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem. Ronald Kamdem : Just a quick one on inventory. And I know it's announced a lot of different ways, but when you're speaking to tenants, can you just give us a sense of what they're saying about their inventory levels? And are they happy? How much more do they need? Just any color or commentary would be really helpful because we keep hearing about inventory comment, and I'm wondering what you guys are seeing in your portfolio. Steve Schnur : Sure. I would tell you, our -- we do a space utilization exercise twice a year with our tenants. Tenants are utilizing space at sort of near record levels for as long as we've been doing it, just around 90%. The resiliency side of this or the build back of stock that they have, we still think, we pay a lot of attention in the inventory to sales ratio. There's been a lot of debate by a number of people on this call as to breaking that down by category. And we've done that. I would tell you, we still think that there's a 5% to 10% build back to get to pre-pandemic levels for inventories for our customers. And that would tell you there's 300 million to 400 million square feet of incremental demand that needs to get absorbed back into warehouses. Ronald Kamdem : Got it. That makes sense. And then just another one on -- a big picture one on recession, which I know it's being debated in the market. Clearly, you're not seeing it, putting more capital to work here. But maybe can you give us a sense of what -- when would you see it, right? What are some of the signs that you would have to see in your businesses, it could be build-to-suits, it could be tenant commitments to capital. Like, how do you guys think about what the leading indicators in your businesses are for when things start to slow, if they start to slow? Jim Connor : So Ron, I think we would -- it would first manifest itself with us in, I think, our leasing volumes, in our renewal discussions and things like that. Next, if you kind of peel back the onion, if we look at the deals that we're doing, and the capital that our customers are spending, if they start to pull back on capital investments inside the building, I think that's a pretty good leading economic indicator. So that's, I guess, one of the reasons we follow that so closely in terms of our renewal percentage, our leasing volume, where the development pipeline is, so that we can keep a pretty good handle on that in a sense of the kind of demand we're seeing. And then the other thing which we've talked about before is the build-to-suits. So the build-to-suits are the best leading economic indicator for us in our conversations with our clients for the next 18 to 24 months. Because you're talking about designing and entitling and building buildings that aren't going to be delivered until 2024, in some cases, 2025. And customers are -- if they're seeing problems out there in their logistics and supply chain, they're not going to be willing to make those commitments. And sitting here today, we've got lots of those opportunities. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone. Vince Tibone : Could you provide your lease mark-to-market on a cash basis and also share how that differs between some of your top markets? Mark Denien : Yes. Vince, it's Mark. We're leasing at 48% on a GAAP basis and 35% on cash. And then as far as the markets, I would tell you, it's pretty well spread. It's pretty even across all the markets with the 2 main outliers being Southern California and New Jersey. Obviously, our coastal markets are a little bit better overall. But if you pull back in on the coastal markets, Southern Cal and New Jersey are the biggest. And you got to keep in mind, those are the 2 newest markets for us as well, and that's why we're only rolling 18% this year versus the 45% plus exposure that we have on those coasts. And that's why we're still bullish on our future outlook of this mark-to-market continuing only get better. But pretty well spread out other than those 2 markets, are clearly at the top of the class. Vince Tibone : No, that makes sense. Is there anything you can just quantify that a little bit? Just like how much higher is Southern California and New Jersey compared to the likes of Dallas, Chicago, Atlanta? Like what order of magnitude roughly? Mark Denien : Double. Literally double, yes. Now I like to say, keep in mind, some of the Dallas and Chicago, places like that, we've got -- I'm trying to explain, we've got newer fresher leases buried in that number. So just hypothetically if Dallas is 45% and Southern Cal is doubled that, 90%, you've got numbers out, part of that is because Southern Cal, believe it or not, has to hold our leases in our portfolio because we haven't got them to roll yet, and Dallas has been rolled all along. So we don't have as much churn left to go in Dallas, if that makes sense. You got to look at the maturity at all, too, but yes. Vince Tibone : No, that's really helpful color. One more for me, switching gears. Like, had your asset mix in terms of what's targeted for disposition this year changed at all given the higher rates? And do you think pricing has moved for properties that are longer lease, lower growth profile? Nick Anthony : We haven't seen it yet. What we have seen is that we've seen the buyer pool shrink a bit on the assets. We've only had a few assets out in the market. One of them is under agreement at a pricing that we expected to transact at, sub-4 in a non-Tier 1 market. So we're keeping a very close eye on it. There's a lot of chatter out there about it. But I don't think anybody has really seen it yet. So we'll be back -- we'll be opportunistic on the disposition side and evaluate each one as we go about it. And if we think the price is right, we'll transact. If not, we won't. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim. Ki Bin Kim : Just going back to your land bank commentary. You mentioned about 3 years of runway. I'm assuming you included the options that you have available. But if you look at the land, I mean, half of that if you include options, is actually in Columbus, Ohio, which I'm sure you can develop there. But I was just curious, from a practical standpoint, is it really 3 years? Because I can't imagine you guys doing a bunch of Ohio developments all of a sudden. Or should we expect you guys to continuously reload that land bank at a pretty strong pace? Mark Denien : Ki Bin, why do you take it on Columbus, Ohio for, man? No, to your point, just to clarify, I think this is detailed in the supplemental. The only place we have a long-term land option agreement is at Rickenbacker Airport in Colombus, Ohio. So everything else supporting the numbers that Steve put out is land that we have either under contract, under agreement, covered land plays or already owned it on the books. So the Columbus option land is a very small piece. It does not represent the lion's share of our development pipeline for the next 3 years. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Thanks for that clarification. And just going back to the topic of demand. I think one of your competitors have talked about e-commerce not being able to sort of spear anymore for demand and other segments stepping up. And I know it doesn't work its way because of with the economy growth and population growth, but there's always kind of continuous demand. But in a simplistic sense, if -- or how far along are all these corporate users in terms of really just getting into the space they need and have locked it up and maybe the next round of demand just looks a little bit weaker? Jim Connor : Well, I'll make a couple of comments, and then I think Steve can add some color as well. I think people have talked or speculated about Amazon pulling back, and we saw them pull back in terms of their deal signed last year. And yet we had record demand across the country. So I think while we may see their demand moderate because of the -- how far along they are in terms of the build-out of their supply chain, I think the vast majority of our other clients are still playing catch up. So I think we continue -- expect to see more continued demand on the e-commerce from everybody other than Amazon.  And I think a lot of companies are still playing catch up in terms of the capital investment in their e-commerce facilities. Material handling systems and the robotics are still in their early stages of development. We just saw a headline where Amazon is investing $1 billion in robotics. So I think we got a long runway to go in terms of e-commerce and its adaptation in the U.S. and its supply chain. And I think that bodes really good for us. Steve Schnur : Yes, Ki Bin, I would just add, for us, 3PLs continue to be the most active user in the market. We saw that in the first quarter. We saw that last year. Retail e-commerce for us has probably fallen to about the third category in terms of overall demand. So as Jim said, it's -- I think most of our customers are early on in their venture towards building out their own e-commerce platforms. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell. Anthony Powell : You've talked about how some of your noncoastal markets are showing increasing strength here. Can you maybe go into some more detail there? Which markets do you want to highlight? And how has the supply environment involved in some of those noncoastal markets? Steve Schnur : Yes. Look, it's hard to find a soft spot in today's world, right? I would tell you, for us, Houston, as \u2013 we\u2019ve talked about it before, Houston is probably in the one market that's been a little soft for us. But markets this past quarter, markets like Minneapolis, Raleigh, Chicago, Dallas, Atlanta were all great markets for us in terms of rent growth and overall activity. Nashville has been a good market for us as of late. So it's -- again, it's hard to pick a market that's not doing well right now. Anthony Powell : Got it. Maybe one more. I guess in terms of lease mark-to-market, how should we think about that during a possible recession? How sticky do you think current rents are, looking back at prior recessions? Maybe not COVID, but other recessions, how did lease mark-to-market or overall rents trend? And how should we think about that risk over the next few years? Mark Denien : Well, I'll start. I mean, I think -- forget the recession, 48%, we expect it to get better because we don't expect rents to pull back anytime soon. But I think the easiest way we think about it is, if they go flat, which is a dramatic decrease from what we've experienced the last several years, we still have that 48% baked into our numbers. So I think we're very comfortable that even if we have some period of dislocation here and rent growth stops, that it can stay in the range it's at right now and we'll still have 48% upside. So how low can it go? I don't know. I mean, it can go lower, anything can happen. But I think we're very comfortable that the 48% will get better. And sort of a downside scenario, maybe not a worst case, but the downside is it stays at 48%. Anthony Powell : How did rents trend in 2008 and 2001? Just curious as someone newer to the space. Mark Denien : Well, I think you got to factor in the different starting point, first of all. 2008, we were at a 3% vacancy heading into 2008. We're in a -- I mean, I just don't know that you can always look at history in the environment we're in now and draw logical conclusions from it. That would be my starting point. I don't know, Jim, if you have anything to add to that. Jim Connor : Yes. I don't know, off the top of my head, I have that -- I think to your point, even if market rents fell and went truly negative, even if they fell 15% or 20%, we've still got a 48% mark to market. So I can't imagine a scenario even in 2008 through 2010, rents didn't fall 50%. Nick Anthony : The other thing I'd point out is in 2008 -- today, we have 44% of our NOI coming from Coastal Tier 1 markets that have 1% vacancy and don't have any land available. Back in 2008, that was less than 1%. So there's a big difference there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson. Rich Anderson : Just a couple of quick follow-ups. A lot of my questions have been answered. But there was a -- you mentioned, just to answer to a previous question just a little bit ago, e-commerce is the third largest, what was that, in terms of activity, leasing activity in the first quarter? And maybe you can give me the breakdown of the industries. I might have missed that. Steve Schnur : Yes. Our top 1 was 3PLs. That made up -- for us that made up a little under half of our overall activity. Consumer product goods would be, I guess, the next category I would throw out there in terms of activity. Retail e-commerce would be the third. And then sort of what we call manufacturers assembled goods would be the fourth category. Rich Anderson : And how has that changed over the past couple of years? Steve Schnur : I would say with e-commerce and 3PLs have probably shifted. Consumer products goods have always been in that -- usually in the top 4 for our portfolio. Amazon's activity the past 3, 4, 5 years has always put e-commerce up near the top. Jim Connor : Rich, I would say you got to take that with a little bit of grain of salt. I'm not trying to make excuses, but the consumer products companies, how much of what they're doing is to support their e-commerce and how much is to support their more traditional supply chain, that's kind of the gray area that moves back and forth. It's pretty easy to track Amazon and Wayfair.com because that's purely an e-conference platform. So there's a little gray area in there. But I think to Steve's point, been pretty consistent all along. Rich Anderson : Same could be said for 3PLs, too, obviously, right? It's very much a gray area, perhaps more. So I wanted to -- I had sort of an idea about leading indicator and what's driving you to expand spec development at this point with a war going on and inflation and so on. And you mentioned build-to-suits being the best leading indicator because those companies aren't going to make those types of commitments if they don't really see what they think they're seeing.  But at the end of the day, they're ingrained in this business, and you used the term catching up to Amazon, so they might be willing to take on a little bit of a risk to play that catch-up trade and not entirely an objective leading indicator, if you were to ask me. The real objective leading indicators might be declining consumer sentiment in the face of inflation. GDP growth, just released this morning, down 1.4% in the first quarter. And yet you're still hanging on to the speculative development process.  I don't know if I have a question in here. But I'm just wondering, beyond the build-to-suit observation as you're guiding like speculative development, what else is getting you there in the light -- in the face of all these other, what I would call, risks to the system? Jim Connor : Rich, those are all valid points, occupancy, demand, leasing volume, nationwide vacancy, all of those things. If the roles were reversed, you could build more spec space. I mean, if you just think about it, at 99-plus percent in our in-service portfolio, we don't have enough space to handle just the organic growth of our existing customer base. Rich Anderson : Yes. But 99% is a coincident indicator and could go down as much as it could go up depending on demand of tenants and vacancies and all that sort of stuff. I don't mean to litigate this on this call. I just feel like to expand speculative development at this point seems like a brave step, and you're not the only one doing it, but I guess I'll just leave it at that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller. Mike Mueller : Two quick ones here. First, who are you typically buying land from today? And what portion of your spec activity is in existing parks? Steve Schnur : We typically buy, I would say, 2 different -- today, there's either private sellers, people who have owned land for a long time, whether that was a business or owned by a family or a private company. Two is, I would say, companies that are -- that we're redeveloping a site, something they've owned for a long time. And in terms of -- your other question was our development in the existing business parks, that might be -- Mike Mueller : Yes, what -- Steve Schnur : One of our projects, looking at the list here, I think one of our projects is in an existing business park. Everything else was a site that we've been working on and had it in some version of our land bank that was asked on this call a number of times over the past year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck. Blaine Heck : Obviously, you guys put up some really sizable rents for this quarter, especially on a net effective basis at 49% and especially given that only 18% are in those Tier 1 markets. So I was wondering to what extent the term of the leases rolling off is affecting those strong rent spreads. So are those leases kind of 7 or more years old and that's what's driving that high mark to market? Or are they closer to 3 to 5 years old, and those rent spreads are really indicative of very strong rent growth that you've seen even in those lower-tier markets over that short period of time? Mark Denien : Yes, Blaine, it's a little bit of both. They're not, what I would call, extremely long leases rolling. It's a little bit longer than the 3- to 4-year terms that you mentioned. I think the average term was enrolled was about 5 or 6, which is about what our overall portfolio is as we sit here today. So it's just a combination. We've seen great rent growth across all the markets, whether you pick a market like Chicago or Indi or Atlanta, places we've been a long time, rent growth has been great, not as good as Southern California and New Jersey but certainly been a lot better than the built-in escalators within the lease. So it's not like it's a lot of 15-year deals rolling or anything like that, it was like 6 \u2013 5 to 6-year deals rolling, just pretty good solid growth across all the markets. Blaine Heck : All right. Great. That's helpful, Mark. And then I noticed that about half of the year starts during the quarter on a square footage basis were in Indianapolis. Obviously, it's your hometown and we probably expect you guys to keep a footprint there. But can you talk about your longer-term plans for that market and if we should continue to expect growth there? And maybe Steve can talk about the fundamentals that you're seeing there relative to some of the trends in the Tier 1 market. Steve Schnur : Sure. I wouldn't read a lot into the fact that we started 3 buildings this quarter. It's just a timing thing with lots of land we had. We like the markets we're in. Obviously, we've got a long history in this market. We've got a very deep customer base. And we're in the right submarket. Indi's probably got some headlines recently about some overbuilding. I would tell you that's occurring on -- for those of you unfamiliar with Indianapolis, on the East side or the far South side, it's not where these buildings are located. Again, we've got great history here. I think we know this market better than anyone. And I expect those projects to be successful. Longer term, we haven't been super active on the development front in Indi. It's a good market for us. And when we see opportunities, we'll take advantage of them. Operator : Thank you. There are no questions in the queue. Please continue. Jim Connor : I would like to thank everyone for joining the call today. We look forward to engaging with many of you throughout the year. Operator, you may disconnect the line. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T conferencing service. You may now disconnect.",

The question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to Jill R. Sawyer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Sawyer, you may now begin. Jill Sawyer : Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates, as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance, and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or other SEC filings. Additionally, our second quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures. And in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. On July 13, we announced the merger between Prologis and Duke Realty. This call will focus on our second quarter results. The company will not provide comments related to this transaction beyond what is included in our prepared remarks. I'd like to welcome Tim Arndt, our CFO, who will cover results, real-time market conditions and guidance. Hamid Moghadam, our CEO, and our entire executive team are also with us today. With that, I'll hand the call over to Tim. Tim Arndt : Thanks, Jill. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call. This morning, we reported our second quarter results, which were strong and ahead of our expectations with occupancy, leasing and rent change all at record highs. Duke also released their operating results this morning, which tell a similarly strong story. That said, the macroeconomic environment is making it difficult for investors to fully assess the state of our industry. There's frankly a stark difference between what one reads in headlines versus what is actually happening in our business. Accordingly, we find ourselves focusing more on our own proprietary metrics and real-time feedback from our customers to build a forward-looking view of our markets and demand. Before going through that view, let me first step through our results. Core FFO, with and without promotes, was $1.11 per share, slightly ahead of our forecast. Rent change on rollover was 46%, led by the US at 54%. Retention in the quarter was 79%, driving occupancy higher by 30 basis points over the quarter to 97.7%. All of this led to net effective same-store NOI growth of 7.6% and cash same-store of 8.2%. We started $1.7 billion in new development projects, bringing our year-to-date starts to $2.7 billion. On the balance sheet, we closed on a refinancing of our lines of credit, expanding the total commitment to $5.4 billion, ending the quarter with $5.2 billion of liquidity. We are very pleased to have not only increased our line capacity, but also to have done so while maintaining our spread and staggering maturities. In strategic capital, our net equity queue, which combines the committed queue less outstanding redemptions and deployment, it was $2.8 billion at the end of the quarter. While performance in the second quarter was strong, we recognize that with the current backdrop, markets do have the potential to soften. Instead of repeating macroeconomic statistics from media headlines, which you all know well, I'll instead share observations from our unique data and insights. At quarter end, we had proposals on 52% of our remaining availabilities versus an average of 38% prior to COVID, reflective of the very active dialogue we've had and the fact that little space remains available to lease in our portfolio, 71% of leases expiring in the next 12 months are either preleased or in negotiations, ahead of the pre-COVID average of 56%.  Lease negotiation periods have lengthened by a few days to an average of 60, while up from the more rapid pace of 50 days across 2021, it has essentially returned to the normalized levels we saw pre-COVID. And as it relates to pricing, our Sphere data which measures normalized effective rents against forecast, reflects that, markets remain strong and rent growth stays ahead of our expectations. Our field teams report market activity, which is totally consistent with all of this data. While the number of customers competing for available space has decreased from unprecedented levels tempering urgency, our teams report still healthy demand and limited downtime. This is also reflected in our monthly customer survey data, which report high historical utilization at 86% and an IBI index that reflects growth in activity.  In the end, we believe we're seeing a normalization in the volume and pace of demand which we expected as the world reopened from COVID and consumers seek more in-person experiences. But given exceptionally tight markets and availability, the fundamentals remain excellent. E-commerce represented 14% of new leasing, down from approximately 25% in 2021, a shift we've long telegraphed.  As noted, overall occupancy and leasing have continued to grow with take-up coming from a broad set of users, most notably transportation, healthcare and auto. E-commerce remains a positive long-term trend for our business. Clearly, COVID accelerated its adoption from a 15% share, retail sales pre-pandemic and running at 23% during, at 21% today, it is roughly 150 basis points ahead of our pre-COVID expectations.  We are also seeing the emergence of supply chain resiliency as a secular and incremental demand driver for our business. We hear it from our customers both in daily dialogue, as well as our advisory boards, including three events held this quarter. We expect that this need for safety stock will lift demand for years to come, although economic uncertainty could cause some delay this year.  In light of very low vacancy and healthy demand, we are increasing our overall market rent growth forecast for the year to 23% on a global basis and 25% in the US. This is due to a very strong first half where we see rents having increased 14% globally and 16% in the US. We continue to see increases in construction costs which provide a pricing umbrella for continued rent growth given the need to uphold expected yields before new spec development can be started. The increase in rents over the second quarter has expanded our lease mark-to-market to nearly 56%, translating to over $2 billion of embedded annual NOI as these leases roll. Applying this mark-to-market to our lease expiration schedule will show that net effective same-store NOI growth through 2025 should exceed 8% without any further increases in market rent, an incredible amount of built-in organic growth and resiliency in our earnings.  Before turning to guidance, we expect to imminently file the S-4 related to our acquisition of Duke Realty, which will guide the timing of our shareholder votes and the close date of the transaction. The [filing] (ph) guidance excludes the deal's expected accretion. Beginning with operating guidance, we expect average occupancy to range between 97.25% to 97.75%, an increase of nearly 40 basis points from our prior guidance. We are increasing our net effective same-store guidance to a range of 7.25% to 7.75% and cash same-store to a range of 8.25% to 8.75%, each an increase of roughly 90 basis points. Rent change on rollover is expected to grow from our first half levels, increasing spreads to over 50% in each the third and fourth quarters. Given our view of market rent growth, we expect our portfolio's lease mark-to-market will expand to over 60% by the end of the year. We are holding our guidance for net promotes at $0.60 for the year. Our current appraised values would generate net promote income above this level, but given market uncertainty, we're holding our prior guidance. Our overall deployment guidance is unchanged from last quarter with the exception of acquisitions, which we have increased to $1.2 billion to $1.7 billion at our share based on our belief that opportunities are likely to emerge in the back half, which will be well-positioned to pursue. I'm also pleased to note that despite extraordinary moves in both interest rates and FX, our forecast remains unimpacted due to our proactive approach to managing both risks through limited maturities and robust FX hedging program. In total, we are increasing our full year earnings guidance to $5.14 to $5.18 per share, including promotes and $4.54 to $4.58 per share excluding promotes, representing 11.5% growth from 2021. Before closing, I'd like to spend just a few minutes highlighting one of the more important announcements we've made in recent years. Last month, we announced a new commitment to achieving net zero emissions by 2040, a full decade ahead of the targets established in the Paris Climate Agreement. Our plan includes key milestones along the way, such as a dramatic increase in our solar energy production and storage goal to 1 gigawatt by 2025, more than doubling our previous goal. We will also conduct carbon-neutral operations and construction by 2025. Ultimately, we plan to get to net zero without reliance on carbon offsets and our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 and net zero in our entire value chain by 2040. It's noteworthy that we are one of very few REITs to commit to science-based targets for our Net Zero goal. Prologis has long been a leader in ESG, both inside and outside of our industry. We're extremely pleased to have once again raised the bar and hold ourselves accountable to real, measurable, and reportable progress for our investors, our customers, and our planet. We truly feel great about our business and how we've positioned our teams, our portfolio and our balance sheet to thrive across the cycle even in uncertain times as we see today. With that, I'll now turn the call over to our operator to take your questions. As a reminder, we won't be addressing questions related to the Duke transaction on this morning's call. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question will be coming from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi. Craig Mailman : HI. It's actually Craig Mailman here with Michael. I just want to hit on the market rent growth and mark-to-market piece. You guys had 79% retention, 25-odd percent cash mark-to-market just peak average occupancy levels. And so I guess maybe a two-parter here. Just what breaks the camel's back here in the near-term from an occupancy or market rent growth perspective? And then two, maybe, Tim, could you just address as you head into the back half of the year and into 2023, kind of remind us what that mark-to-market on a standalone basis means for FFO per share? Tim Arndt : Yes, I can take the second part. We actually really don't break the number down in that way. We have full year same-store guidance. As noted, with a midpoint of -- it's at 7.5% to -- yes, sorry, 7.5%. And the growth in the back half is probably adding $0.01 to $0.02 of the run rate that you'll see in Q3 and Q4. Hamid Moghadam : Yes. And we didn't really hear -- I didn't really hear the first half of the question. Can you repeat that, please? Craig Mailman : Sorry, I was just saying kind of given the strength of the operating metrics, what breaks the camel's back from the sense of risk to occupancy market rent growth is a mark-to-market here? I know you guys talked a lot about kind of the headline risk versus the reality of what you're seeing on the ground. But just to maybe put out there from your perspective, what the real risks are given what you're seeing on the ground? Hamid Moghadam : Yes. So there is the much talked about risk to supply exceeding demand. And there's a fair amount of confusion between the supply and demand balance in the overall US industrial market and the markets that we are involved in. And I'll turn it over to Chris to actually walk you through that because that's a pretty important distinction, and I really don't think there is a risk to supply, particularly given the low vacancy rates from which we are operating today. But let's bookmark that, and Chris will talk about that. On the demand side, the way I think about it is that I've been doing this for 40 years. And I would say, prior to last quarter and the quarter before, let's call the peak in terms of strength of market on the demand side as a 10 on a one to 10 scale. I think the last quarter and the quarter before were like on 12 or 13. They were just crazy good. And I think this quarter, there may be 9.5 to 10. I mean by historical standards, this would be exceptionally good. I mean in the 5 percentile good for the last 40 years. It just -- it can never be as good as it was in the last quarter and the quarter before because, frankly, everybody reads the same papers. And if you're a CEO of a company and you're looking to expand your operations, you're going to just take your time a little bit more, just to be sure that you're not making a stupid mistake. So the difference between sort of grabbing every piece of the space that you can see, which may push demand 10%, 20% above what is really needed, probably in an environment like this could haven't been conservative by 10% to 20%. And that swing is basically coming out of the froth that we saw in the last two quarters. So that's the way I think about it. But Chris can give you the supply/demand numbers because there's a lot of misunderstanding on those factors. Chris Caton : Yeah. Let's be clear. And indeed, we publish our data quarterly to try and help bring clarity to the marketplace. And what does that data reveal? Well, we forecast 375 million square feet of net absorption and completions this year, calendar year 2022, and see vacancy rate falling to 3.2%. Now our statistics focus on our 30 US markets and is based on the leading source in each market. Now we could look out to 2023. It's a little early, but we foresee a gap, say, 50 million to 100 million square feet in differential between supply and demand. That would lead to a moderate rise in market vacancies, but they would remain below 4%, which is well below the pre-pandemic and historical averages. Now what we're seeing when we look at market commentary is that sources -- some sources are using unconventional methodologies and also include additional non-Prologis markets. So, for example, the next 20 US markets, places like Memphis, St. Louis, Detroit, have a market vacancy rate that's roughly one percentage point higher in our markets and do have a supply/demand imbalance with 126 million square feet under construction versus trailing 12-month net absorption of 88 million square feet. Hamid Moghadam : Yeah. The other thing that's going on, and we're probably over-killing this response, but I think it's probably the single biggest area where we get questions on. Construction has not only become expensive, but also construction periods have been really stretched out because of limited availability of certain components. And by the way, we've been really good about ordering that stuff ahead of time. I'm talking about the market, not our situation in particular. So an extended construction period will make the pipeline of supply sound bigger. So if you're having a third longer construction period, which is what we're estimating, with the same amount of supply, the numbers will just be one-third bigger. That's just math. So again, a lot of confusion about this issue. And I think it's a single biggest disconnect between investor perceptions and the reality on the ground. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Appreciate the comments, Hamid, on supply and demand. Could you maybe just talk a little bit about region and what you're seeing both in the US and Europe, just given some of the bigger challenges that we're seeing in Europe right now? Hamid Moghadam : Well, let me give you the general commentary on Europe. Europe is as good as I remember Europe being because actually, the war and the excess population that's come out of Ukraine and in Central -- in the neighboring countries have actually increased demand and led to actually better market dynamics for unfortunate and tragic reasons, but it simply has. I would say the UK has slowed down a bit given what's going on with the politics. But Europe is generally a more muted market than the US, both on the supply and on the demand side. And that's why we're showing lower rental growth rate for Europe compared to the US. So that's not that unusual in terms of its historical relationship. Chris, do you have anything to add to that? Chris Caton : Yeah. I would add, look, the US has been a market leader, especially on the coast with rent growth meaningfully outperform lower barrier markets. We're talking about 10 to 15 percentage annual rent growth, its better on the coast. And outside the US, whether it's Europe, whether it's the UK, whether it's Toronto, whether it's Mexico, vacancy rates are below 2.5%, and we're seeing some of the best market rent growth we've ever seen. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Please proceed with your question. Tom Catherwood : Excellent. Thank you and good morning, everyone. Tim, I appreciate your comment about proposals on remaining availability of 52%. I think that was the number versus 38% pre-COVID. How does that 52% compared to the last few quarters? And then maybe more broadly on your kind of leading indicators. How much of a lag have you experienced during prior cycles between a falloff in demand and fundamentals and warning signals coming from your proprietary metrics? Tim Arndt : Yes. Thanks, Tom. Basically, the 52% we measured this last quarter is the strongest it's been. It has accelerated from that pre-COVID number that we quoted of 38%, lifted up into the 40s through COVID and has now hit what I think is an all-time high. And Chris, maybe you can pick up the past cycles? Chris Caton : Yes. So, I'd start by saying some of these insights are based on our investments in data that are unavailable elsewhere in real estate and uniquely available in this cycle. One metric that we invented in the last cycle was the IBI by way of a preview or by way of retrospective, I suppose. That metric is great at predicting next 12 months of net absorption and remains at a healthy level today. Hamid Moghadam : Yes. And the absolute vacancy rates today are just crazy low. I mean, like half of what they were in prior cycles at the peak of the market. So whether -- so we're talking about just so that we've got our cycles clear. Probably some of you on the call weren't even born then. But I'm talking about the early '80s oil crisis, the late '80s, early '90s, the SNL crisis, real estate crisis, the dot-com collapse in the early 2000s, the global financial crisis. Compared to all of those, first of all, I don't think we're looking at the same site of situation. And, certainly, we're not starting off a vacancy rate that starts with a 3. So I think it's crazy that we're even thinking about those situations. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Jamie Feldman : Great. Thank you. Maybe shifting gears a little bit and thinking about asset values. It looks like you're going to ramp up your acquisitions in the back half of the year. I assume that means you're finding some interesting opportunities. Can you talk about how much you think cap rates have moved and how much do you think asset values have moved? And maybe what looks interesting to you that you're ramping up your outlook? Hamid Moghadam : Yes. Good question. The fact of the matter is, we're not seeing that much, because just like any other market cycle when people see an inflection point, basically, transaction volume goes down. And buyers basically go and on deals that are in progress, try to get a price reduction. And oftentimes, they don't get it, and it just doesn't transact. So there is not a whole lot of visibility as to what values would -- are likely to be. I can also tell you that based on our appraisal, external appraisers have actually written up our values by 4% this past quarter.  Now are we going to believe that? No, because appraisals are backwards looking. So certainly, I think valuations are somewhat more muted, particularly because of the fraud is not there because of the typical leverage buyer having a harder time being the marginal buyer. Having said that, I think cap rates are likely to remain pretty strong. If you were going to sort of, give me a truth serum and say, where do you expect this to settle? I would say 10 to 25 basis points higher than where we saw it prior to the downturn. And that's on top of the 4% that people have written up. In other words, not from that level. If it's 100, I would say, going down 10 to 25 basis points in terms of value as opposed to going up by 4% on value. So Dan do you have anything to add to that? Dan Letter : Yes. The only thing I would add to that, Jamie, six weeks ago at NAREIT, we talked about we were entering a period of price discovery. And I think at the time, we thought it would be 60 to 90 days before we started seeing some of those comps shake out and we're just not quite seeing it yet. Volumes are way down -- deal volumes are way down, and we're hearing of a number of renegotiations happening for deals that were tied up before, the headlines started to get ugly. So at this point, we'll see how it plays out, but this is in-sync with what we were thinking six weeks ago. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Please proceed with your question. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. Good morning, Hamid. So just putting together some of the commentary around normalized customer behavior or at least proposals, how does that translate into your willingness to deploy capital on developments? So, on a combined basis, you and Duke are probably reaching close to $6 billion. Is that a sustainable level, given some of the things that you're seeing or how should we think about that changing? Hamid Moghadam : Yes. Our development activity is always bottoms up deal by deal, leasing opportunity by leasing opportunity and remember, we're not developing in new markets. We're developing in place we -- where we have, I don't know, 20, 30, 40 in the case of Southern California, over 100 million square feet of activity that we're seeing on a day-to-day basis. So, there are bottoms up, they are not like we're building to a goal. It's not that at all.  But we are likely not going to be deploying the same amount of capital in development across the cycle. I think we're on the good side of the cycle. Where that will moderate? I don't know. But construction costs today are probably up 50%, land values are up significantly. So, the rents you need to get acceptable margins. And I mean land values at market, not land values at our cost because with our costs, we have significant margins.  Really make it tough to make some of the numbers work, particularly for a lot of our competitors that buy land just -- as just-in-time type of acquisition. So, I think that's a real limiter and governor on profitable development and we'll just see. But across a 10-year cycle, we're towards the high end of deployment levels today, for sure. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. John Kim : Thank you. Similar line of questioning, The yields you have on development starts increased to 6.1% this quarter, which is a pretty wide spread to your acquisition cap rates. But it was the cap rates -- or sorry, it was the acquisition guidance that you increased that to about -- starts. I was just wondering how easy it is to pull-forward some of the development opportunities earlier just given the increase in margins and development yields? Tim Arndt : One thing I'll just highlight and maybe throw it over to Dan is just that the development yields you are looking at there while conservative would incorporate our view of rents at the time that the assets are stabilized and as the leasing is occurring, whereas acquisition cap rates are going to be reflecting current and in-place NOI. So, that's a pretty big gap in there to appreciate. Dan Letter : And as it relates -- this is Dan. As it relates to how quickly we can pull-forward starts, we've got this land bank as a differentiator right now, right? We've got $2.5 billion worth of land on the balance sheet worth nearly double. So, this is land that's largely entitled and ready to go. So, that's really the beauty of our development business is that we can start and stop as we see the demand. Hamid Moghadam : Yes. The only thing I have to add is that implied in your question is that we think it's really important to pull-forward development. Again, it is not. We're not building to a particular budget or anything like that. So, if we see the market again bottoms up deal by deal, not being as strong as we wanted, we're just happy to sit and not develop in that market. Not to mention that the big portion of our developments are build-to-suit and lease. So, we know the economics going in. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Michael Goldsmith : Hi, good afternoon. Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. My question is on the near-term expected strength and how that evolves. Your same-store NOI guidance implies it remains at about 8.5% in the back half. Last year growth in the back half was about 200 basis points higher than the first half. So, can you talk about the contributing factors that allow you to achieve stable results despite the more difficult comparison, so accelerating results on the two-year stack and not asking for guidance here, but can you help marry that with when the impact from the expectation that conditions normalize? Like when can that start to weigh on some of the fundamental numbers that you report? Thank you. Tim Arndt : Yes, it's Tim. I would say two things. One, the back half, and I think this we discussed last quarter is -- does not have the occupancy gains that we see in Q1 and Q2 that this year, same-store is enjoying in the back half, the occupancy gains driving same-store more muted and it's pretty much rent changed from there. I think to shift your question more to the long-term, I refer back to my comments for the script where you can look at our expiration schedule, you can use the lease mark-to-market. We've highlighted establish a market rent and look at the rents expiring in the remainder of this year, next year, 2024, et cetera. That's the point I made about computing easily 8% same-store growth enduring for many years to come. So, that's how I would use the data and then look at that resiliency. Hamid Moghadam : By the way other than this cycle in the entire history of the company, the highest same-store number ever was 6.5% for the forward one year. So we -- I mean to have sort of 8% rental growth for multiple years, like five years, is just crazy good because the mark-to-markets are so high. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ronald Kamdem : Hey, just a quick one on Amazon. They talked about putting space back on the market. Maybe can you give us what's the update in terms of what you've seen in your portfolio and in the market in terms of space being put back and what you're hearing? Thanks. Mike Curless : Hey, Ronald, this is Mike Curless. We've heard the same rumors out on the Street, the 10 million to 30 million square feet. None of it has been substantiated by Amazon. And what matters is what we're seeing on the ground and we're not seeing much at all. We had our national broker calls last week, literally heard about one space that's out there for sublease in the markets that we focus on. But more importantly, let's go to our portfolio of 132 spaces -- And early on, we had an inquiry on two out of 132, let me reemphasize just two. And early on, those got taken off the table. So we have zero in play. And I think if you're very familiar with our portfolio like we are, it should not be a surprise. Those are mission-critical facilities located in Europe. population centers. And to put a finer point on that, in the last 18 months, our retention rate in that set of spaces, Amazon has been 95%, 20 points higher than our company average at the same time And just take it at one step further. As we look to the future, we're 99% leased in the 36 markets, we're doing business with them. We have 54% in place to market, very favorable there. So I think we are very well positioned for anything that might come our way. Hamid Moghadam : Yes. The only thing I would add is that I didn't listen to the Amazon earnings call, but I got more questions about that one comment than comments from the entire industrial real estate industry, which is pretty consistent. So I guess if you have a market cap of over $1 trillion, people listen to you a lot more. But I think the single biggest miss for investors is that they read too much into that commentary. And the facts on the ground just don't support it. So that's all I have to say. And I'm prepared to be on the record for that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Todd Thomas : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Within the context and conversation about the lease negotiation period and decrease or, I guess, normalization and competition for space. Are you expecting some of the leading indicators you track to continue normalizing or softening a bit further as you look out over the next several quarters, or do you think that you might see conditions and underlying fundamentals stabilize at current levels, just a bit off the extreme peaks you discussed that you realized over the last few quarters? Hamid Moghadam : I think if I were going to bet, of course, nobody knows is that I think that will normalize at a higher level than normal. But right now, I would say it's prudent to assume that will be slightly down, but better than most market cycles. So that's the way we're running our business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Anthony Powell : Hi, good morning. You mentioned that you saw transportation, healthcare and auto pickup in terms of mix of leasing. What's driving those sectors really pick up their activity? And would you expect them to continue to lead the mix over the next several quarters? Hamid Moghadam : Yeah. Here's what I would say generally. We have -- we lease about one million square feet a day, actually more than one million square feet a day. But as big as we are, once you start dividing the numbers into the markets we operate in and the economic sectors that we lease to, the one million square foot lease can move the numbers around radically in a quarter. And by the way, if you look at the same data from other companies, 100,000 square foot lease can really move their numbers around. So I wouldn't look at those statistics on a quarter-by-quarter basis. I think they're totally meaningless because of the law of smaller numbers. So the answer is, I don't know. But I don't think -- I wouldn't look to that for any kind of long-term assumptions on how to run our business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed with your question. Vince Tibone : Hi, good morning. Have your expectations for supply completions in 2023 changed in recent months? Are you seeing any other players taking a pause from new that development starts due to macro concerns? Chris Caton : Hi Vince, it's Chris Caton. Yes, our expectations have evolved a couple of ways. One is, first, for this calendar year, we have reduced it, not increased it based on the challenge of delivering product as Hamid described earlier and products basically getting stuck in the supply pipeline. We have also reduced our view for next year just as you surmise based on fluidity and the landscape and the rise in financial return of\u2026 Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Michael Carroll : Yeah. I just have a real quick question. I know the GAAP mark-to-market is about 56% today. Can you provide some color on what the cash mark-to-market is? I believe a few quarters ago, you highlighted was near 30%. Can you kind of highlight where that has trended? Tim Arndt : Yeah, it's moving by the same delta roughly at the end of the quarter, it was 48%. You probably heard me say that's not a number I find very useful. I would focus on the net effective because that stat is heavily influenced by where you are with remaining lease terms. So it creates all kinds of problems interpreting it. And the net effective number that we gave you of about 56%. I think it's a better representative of what's going on in the economics and the leases and also better representative of what will go on in our earnings. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of with Nikita Bely with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Nikita Bely : Hi, guys. Can you talk a little bit about the institutional capital in your funds business? A, conversations you've had with them? And is there any change in the amount of capital that these folks are willing to put into your funds? And any color you could provide around that subject? Hamid Moghadam : Sure. I would say similar to the fundamentals of our business, in the past couple of years, we've had more demand for our funds than we've chosen to take money for. In other words, we've turned down people who wanted to invest money in our funds because we had these really long queues, And it was irresponsible to take -- keep taking money when we have hard time deploying that volume of money. I would say that has shifted a bit. So demand for new products has shifted down. And on the margin, there is a little bit more of redemption requests. Well, a little bit more before it was zero, and now we have some redemption requests. All of this is reflective of what I call the denominator effect is that, their stock and bond portfolios are getting hammered, their private equity and venture portfolios are getting write-down. So basically, real estate generally is getting to be a larger percentage, and they have to rebalance. So -- and industrial is probably the best sector to rebalance out of, because that's where the liquidity and the market strength and the embedded gains have been in the last market cycle. So not at all surprising, but we still have plenty of private capital to run our business for a long, long time. And I think we have a great franchise in that area and one that has been really well tested in -- through three or four market cycles. And by the way, that's the same reason we've kept our leverage in that business so low, because when everybody is kind of levering up, the thing to do is to run your business unlevered. And if we see some great opportunities coming out of that cycle, our remaining powder is not just what we have in the queues that we talked about, but also the opportunity of levering up to the more normalized levels that those funds were designed to do. So I don't think capital is a constraint for us on the private side. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Crow with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Bill Crow : Good morning. Thanks. Within the context of the market rent growth that we're talking about and the Street expecting kind of four or five years' worth, are you seeing any markets where either sequentially or on a year-over-year basis market rents are starting to come down from their peaks? Hamid Moghadam : Go ahead, Chris. Chris Caton : Hi. It's Chris Caton. I ran through the regional differences and the pace of growth this year is, in fact, higher than last year. So all the US and those differentials, Europe as well is faster, not slower. So we are -- we have quite a bit of momentum. In terms of individual markets, we track our risk -- our supply risk markets. And that list has not appreciably changed over the past year. We are watchful of supply in a handful of markets, Dallas, Indianapolis and Phoenix. But we would not rate that supply as too much to damage rent growth, but it's -- those are a couple of markets we are watching. Bill Crow : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Derek Johnston : Hi, everybody. Many companies like retail, they're reporting higher inventory levels and inventory-to-sales ratios are creeping up. So how is the inventory build demand driver that you guys discussed impacted last quarter's leasing? And are you seeing any delays now for this year or really in the opening, just to clarify, was that cautionary, given the macro? So any more insight as you were working to get our head around this emerging driver? Thanks a lot. Chris Caton : Thanks, Derek. It's Chris Caton. Yes, indeed, Tim summarized our view, and we do think it's -- in his script, and we think it's appropriate to be prudent in macro. In fact, we're getting a lot of questions on this, just as you're asking. So, we're going to publish a paper this week on this very topic. Look, summary is the buildup of real inventories for resilience is really only half done and it\u2019s progressing -- it's progressing with our view. Now notwithstanding some of that excess inventory for some retailers for some products, which you just described, the broader landscape has continued to focus on raising inventory levels, reducing stock outs and reintroducing product variety. As it relates to leasing, we are seeing it in the marketplace now for resilience. I'll just give you the basic numbers, trend demand growth in our 30 markets is roughly 200 million to 225 million square feet per year, and we are running at a pace of 300 million square feet per year.  So, we have indeed seen quite a bit of growth in excess of -- excuse me, it's 400 million, so 300 million realized over the last 18 months. So, we've begun to realize some of these structural drivers, but more is in front of us than has been realized. Hamid Moghadam : Yes. I would say this is the second worst understood point about our business. I think I would put Amazon first and I would put a level of inventory second, that's why we've chosen to put out this paper, and I just invite you to get into the nuances. These kinds of numbers, particularly ratio type numbers, can be very misleading, if you don't parse them out. For example, whether you include autos or non-autos or general merchandise or non-general merchandise, you'll see those conclusions to be radically different. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. Nick Yulico : Thanks. I just had a couple of questions here on page four, where you give the leading indicators. I guess on lease proposals, I just want to see what you would attribute to that number having coming down? Is that just now finally realizing the Amazon effect removing them from the market? I mean lease proposals look like they're down 10%, 15% versus your year average. And then on the IBI activity index, I just want to also make sure in terms of the -- what you're serving people about, is that really looking forward on space demand, or is it more of a \u2013 I mean the chart looks like it's almost more of a coincidental indicator rather than much of a leading indicator if you look at the last sort of two recessions and how it played out? Hamid Moghadam : All I can tell you is that, it's hard to increase lease proposals when you have less space to rent. We only have 2% vacancy. So, the metric that you should think about is the one that we mentioned in the script, which is that, we are 52% on our vacancy at this point in the cycle, which is by far higher than the normal point in the cycle in terms of pre-leasing or re-leasing of our vacancies. These are proposals by the way. Chris Caton : Yes. And as it relates to the IBI, which you asked, we find it to be more closely correlated with next 12-month absorption than any other economic indicator. Operator : Thanks. The next question comes from the line of Dave Rogers with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Dave Rogers : Yes, thanks. Given the comments you made earlier, just about the price discovery in the market. Curious about your thoughts around asset sales dispositions, you didn't update guidance, but should we anticipate that, that pushes later into the year? And then maybe more broadly, as you bring Duke on board, not a question about them, but about you, that effective transaction as a deleveraging event, it seems for you guys. So, do you run leverage back up as a company? Are you comfortable you are? Do you run lower kind of in the future and trying to think about asset sales and recycling going forward? Hamid Moghadam : Yes, pretty hard to run leverage any lower than where we are, But we're not conscious with thinking of leveraging up. And the fact that the combination will actually improve or reduce our leverage is totally coincidental. We're not doing the deal to reduce our leverage. Our leverage is pretty low. So, I would say our leverage is probably much lower than it's likely to be across the cycle. But again, that's opportunity driven, not sort of top-down driven. Tim, anything else? Tim Arndt : No, I fully agree on how we view that transaction. And then with regard to dispo timing, nothing has really changed in our forecast. The holding of our guidance reflects our original view. There's always puts and takes on which quarter, some things will land in and what the right mix of assets are going to be, but we're good with our guidance. Hamid Moghadam : Yes. Let me just give you an example of dispo guidance. We had a portfolio that we had on the market, nothing to -- obviously, with Duke. And the buyer came back for a price discount. And we basically told them, they can take a hike. The same thing happened in the week that the world shutdown because of COVID. A buyer came in, they were way down the road on the acquisition, and they came back, this is two years ago, for a price discount, okay? And we told them to go away. They came back a year and a half later, and they paid 15% more than they had the deal tied up on. So, 20% more than where they were trying to drive the price that. I'm not saying the same thing will happen, but I'm just saying, look, at the end of the day, no level of disposition or acquisition or development is going to affect the company that's of this scale and diversity. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Michael Bilerman : Hey. I mean, just staying with sort of the investment market, I just wanted to get some of your views, thinking about it more so from an IRR perspective than a cap rate, just given how large the mark-to-market today in various assets, talking about a spot cap rate sometimes leads to different conclusions? And so I'd be curious of your view how you're approaching it from an IRR basis, either on a five or seven-year basis and how you're thinking about the required return, but also how you're seeing the usual investor change perhaps their view overall on underwriting? Hamid Moghadam : Third, at least well understood point. And you make a great point. What does the spot cap rate mean if your mark-to-market is 50 basis points. If you're investing in apartments, you're there is no mark-to-market. So, the cap rate is the cap rate. But the fact that you have that built-in mark-to-market, just as your question suggests, that alone would drive cap rates way down. So, I think the IRR is a much better measure of return requirements. And I would say, a quarter ago, we were seeing transactions go down in the low five unleveraged IRRs, which is the way we like to look at it. By the way, we're investing at those kinds of returns. But they were literally low five IRRs with an average, I would say, rent growth forecast a market rent growth forecast of probably 3%, okay? Today, I would say the discount rates that people are likely to look at are going to have a six in front of them, low 6s. But the rental growth forecast, even with the same 3% market rent forecast is going to be substantially higher than before because the mark-to-markets have expanded. So the lease mark-to-market of 3% is on top of the mark-to-market. So the total lease growth rate is increasing. So I'm not sure the cap rates are going to move around that much because of the mark-to-market issue. I think what's going to happen is most people don't get that. So they're going to pause a bit on volume of deployment. But any time anybody wants to bring a good deal in one of our markets at -- with 50% mark-to-market at the kind of cap rates that we saw maybe three quarters ago, our number is one 800 Prologis. We'd like to buy as much of that stuff as we can because I think to invest in that with that mark-to-market, -- and that level of discount to replacement costs is our dream come true, and our leveraged friends can't do that. So it's a great environment. Operator : Thank you. Our final question is from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Jamie Feldman : Great. Thank you. I mean I don't know if you can quantify this or not, but when you think about your leasing pipeline, the proposals you've mentioned, 52% of remaining vacancies. Can you break that out by how much you think that is \u2013 how much of that do you think is recession-sensitive versus not? So I guess I'm asking, when you think about if they're really trying to get supply chain resilience and all the secular trends we're talking about, how much of the leasing pipeline would just power through that versus take a pause if we do, in fact, have a mild recession as a later calling for? Hamid Moghadam : Jamie, it would be pure speculation. I have no idea is a personal answer. First of all, I'm not sure we're going to have a recession. Secondly, I have no idea if we have a recession, how deep or extended it will be? I'm not sure even what the definition of the recession is anymore because when got not just committee deciding whether we're in a recession or not, and they usually declare it a couple of quarters after it happens. So the answer is, I have no clue. That's the honest answer. Okay. That was the last question. Really appreciate your interest and look forward in our continued dialogue. Take care. Operator : Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and logoff your computers. Thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jill Sawyer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may now begin. Jill Sawyer : Thanks, Darryl and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates, as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance, and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or other SEC filings. Additionally, our third quarter results, press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures. And in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation for those measures. On October 3rd, we closed on the acquisition of Duke Realty. As a reminder, Duke\u2019s results are not contained in our third quarter earnings release. However, within our supplemental, we included a summary of the portfolio integrated as of quarter end. Please refer to our website for details on the transaction.  I'd like to welcome Tim Arndt, our CFO, who will cover results, real-time market conditions and guidance. Hamid Moghadam, our CEO, and our entire executive team are also with us today. With that, I'll hand the call over to Tim. Tim Arndt : Thanks, Jill. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call. We are clearly in a volatile macro environment where ongoing inflation, steeply rising interest rates and the war and energy crisis in Europe are pressuring the global economy. And while we're closely monitoring each element, the fundamentals in our business are very strong, and our read of supply and demand in our markets remains out of sync with the headlines. This morning, we reported excellent third quarter results, which generated many new records in the quarter. Yet, we will spend less time on these results and more time describing our view of the market and how we're navigating the environment. Before doing so, I'd like to thank our teams across the entire organization who did an exceptional job keeping focus on the business, especially while working through the Duke acquisition, which closed on October 3. We fully integrated the portfolio, achieved our day 1 synergies and look forward to the next phase, which is to build AFFO accretion through incremental property cash flows and Essentials income. We move forward with a better portfolio, a larger and stronger balance sheet, talented new employees and new customers to whom we can introduce to our Essentials business. Turning to results. Core FFO was $1.73 per share, including $0.57 of net promote income earned principally from our PELP venture in Europe. Our annual guidance for promotes was $0.60, with most of the revenue to be earned in the third quarter. The amount came in below expectations due to a nearly 5% write-down of European asset values in the quarter, partially offset by an increase in NAV from debt mark-to-market. In the end, the promote was a record high, while the fund enjoyed a high teens annualized IRR across the 3-year performance period despite the recent markdown. I'll note a few operating stats from the quarter, all of which were records for the company. Ending occupancy increased 10 basis points over the quarter to 97.8%. Same-store growth was 8.3% on a net effective basis and 9.3% on a cash basis. Both were driven primarily by rent change, which was 60% on a net effective basis. Separately, the Duke portfolio ended the quarter with 99% occupancy and net effective rent change of 54%. While these markets are outstanding, they are also backward looking. So we've kept focus on more contemporaneous data, namely rent change on signings, which was 84% during the quarter, and our lease mark-to-market, which now stands at nearly 62%. Finally, we had a very active quarter on the balance sheet, raising over $3 billion of debt in a variety of markets and currencies given our broad access, including a $650 million green bond issued in late September. We ended the quarter with debt-to-EBITDA of 4.3x, excluding gains, providing us significant investment capacity. Turning to our observations of current conditions. We continue to see scarcity of available space across our markets. Vacancy rates are at historic lows, and our own occupancy sits at a record high. Market rent growth in the third quarter remained robust in response to this scarcity and continued strong demand. Color across the markets remains generally upbeat in terms of customer inquiries, and our proprietary metrics also reveal healthy activity even if they've softened from the peak demand generated during COVID to levels still above long-term averages. Transaction gestation was stable during the third quarter at 62 days, proposals via available units slowed during the third quarter to levels more in line with the pace of 2019 and indicative of less urgency to renew space far ahead of exploration. Inside our properties are metrics point of activity that is increasing with our IBI index at 63.8%, the 80th percentile and utilization up to 86.6%, the 95th percentile. Our certain customers have publicly announced a pause in CapEx spending, particularly those with more mature supply chains. But active dialogue with the majority of our customers confirms an overarching need to increase space as supply chain resiliency remains a top concern. Shifting to supply. We're seeing initial signs of a deceleration in development activity across our markets as construction and capital costs continue to increase. We believe we could see a gap in deliveries emerge in late '23 or early '24. As for today, our true months of supply metrics sits at a healthy 22 months, up from 18 months last quarter. We've previously explained that we expect to see this metric climb into a low 30 months range, still at a level reflecting a strong operating environment. It's important to acknowledge where supply is being delivered as our submarket location strategies minimize our exposure to new supply. For example, in our coastal U.S. markets where we generate over 50% of our global NOI, vacancies are just 1.7%. Geographically, we have an increased level of focus on Europe given the ongoing war and growing energy crisis. While we're reporting record results, including occupancy at 98.6% in a market with 2.4% vacancy, we are closely monitoring conditions. Customers are exercising caution in response to rising energy costs, which may create headwinds to near-term demand. That said, we also believe that new supply will now decline around 15% in 2023, which should support occupancy. The U.S. remains strong, where we now generate 87% of our NOI with the addition of Duke. Our teams continue to see solid activity, although acknowledging a reduced number of prospects for space compared to what we saw during the frenzy of COVID. Rent change on signings during the quarter was 93%, demonstrating a continuation of favorable pricing dynamics. In Latin America, both Mexico and Brazil are performing well, with very high occupancy over 98% and rent change across the region of 24%. And in Asia, construction costs in Japan are rising most acutely from the weakness in the yen, as well as from competition for key materials to complete construction. Market vacancies have increased, but this constraint on new supply, particularly out to '23 and '24, should provide an offset. The combined picture was positive to third quarter market rent growth, exceeding our expectations and driving a 300 basis point increase of our '22 global forecast to 26%, with the U.S. at 28%, significantly up from the 10% and 11%, respectively, in our initial guidance. It's difficult to fully know the impact of this market rent growth on values given the limited transaction volume in the market. But our view is that the increase in return requirements is more than offsetting rent growth and indeed pressuring values. Based on prior cycles, we can safely assume it will take few quarters for full price discovery to be made as markets stabilize and transaction volumes build. With all this in mind, we're carefully managing the business and approaching our markets with a sense of caution much as we did at the onset of the pandemic. In leasing, despite the very strong spot environment, we are carefully watching for softening demand and will assume that there will be further macro deterioration. In some markets, this will have us managing more for occupancy than rent growth, but in many others, we believe pricing will remain favorable given very low availability. This is an environment where our revenue management capabilities will be the most useful and allow us to manage such decisions lease-by-lease. With deployment, we are reducing our starts guidance to a range of $4.2 billion to $4.6 billion, and we expect our fourth quarter starts will be 60% build-to-suit, reflecting a more cautious approach to deployment in the coming months, aiming to be very selective in new projects. And in terms of strategic capital, we previously mentioned that we expect to see an increase in redemption activity. While we did have inflows from numerous investors, redemptions grew by $1.3 billion, which, for context, is just 3% of our open-end third-party AUM. Our funds have sufficient equity queues to address this activity. In combination with equity called during the quarter, we now sit at net neutral queues. The open-ended funds have ample investment capacity based on overall low leverage, and we are optimistic about the long-term growth of the business. In the near term, we will be prudent as we evaluate further capital deployment, including a pause on contributions in the short term. Turning to guidance, which includes Duke portfolio for the fourth quarter. We are maintaining our guidance for average occupancy, while increasing our net effective same-store guidance to 7.5% to 7.75%, and our cash same-store guidance to 8.5% to 8.75%. We expect to see our lease mark-to-market around 65% at the end of the year. We now expect acquisitions to range between $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion, which increased due to our acquisition activity in Europe during the quarter, and contributions and dispositions to range between $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. Finally, we are increasing core FFO, excluding Promotes, to $4.60 to $4.62 per share, which includes approximately $0.05 of accretion related to the acquisition of Duke. We are guiding core FFO with Promotes to be $5.12 to $5.14 per share, which incorporates a lower Promote guidance of $0.52, reflective of the higher share count resulting from the Duke transaction. I'd like to point out that our earnings have been unimpacted by FX over this extremely volatile year due to our capital strategy and approach to hedging. The same is true for our equity base, which has very minimal exposure outside of the U.S. dollar despite our global footprint. We will continue to protect both proactively and programmatically. To close, we're proud of how we've positioned the business and are optimistic about the organic growth ahead. We own hard assets with contractual revenues, significant embedded mark-to-market and have meaningful secular drivers that continue to play out. As an organization, we have long had an entrepreneurial and growth mindset. Today, adding new business lines and cash flow streams that are synergistic with our already unique model. We have built the company to thrive across cycles, including uncertain environments like today, where we can seize opportunities and continue to set our business and portfolio apart. We'll now turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : I don't know, Tim or Hamid, I guess what I'm trying to sort of circle up here is that, I understand why development starts would come down in light of what's going on globally, but yet stabilizations are up but the contributions are down. And I guess what I'm trying to really square up is if the funds still have capacity and they're still interested in deploying money, I'm trying to just really circle up why contributions into funds would be down, which is also impacting development gains?  So is it a pricing issue? Is it a lack of leasing on the assets? I guess, I'm just trying to get a little more color on why that contributions number is down. And I guess I can understand why dispositions would be down in this uncertain capital markets environment, but I'm just trying to get a little bit better handle on the contribution side. Hamid Moghadam : Yes, Steve, good question. It's actually none of those reasons. The reason the contributions are down is that I made a decision that we are going to contributions until we have much better clarity on valuations, because one of the lessons that we and the former Prologis learned in the last cycle is that it's really, really important not to force any issues when there is the least bit of hesitancy around values. And as much as we have ideas about what values are and where they're going, we don't have absolute certainty about that. So it was completely a voluntary decision. Our leasing of our development business is actually ahead of what -- the way we underwrote the properties, and there is no external constraint on us, including capacity, of which the funds continue to have some. They're getting some redemptions, but they have plenty of leverage capacity, and we continue to raise money even in the same environment, not as much as we did before, but we continue to do that. Tim Arndt : I would just add, Steve, in relation to your comment on gains in next year, I would just point out that the value creation is occurring regardless of that monetization event. If we hold the development assets on our balance sheet, it's still there at a very attractive yield. And we believe many of those assets will still find their way to the fund. It's just a time, a pause right now. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with Citi. Craig Mailman : I just want to go back, Tim, to your commentary, there was, I think, an overarching message that fundamentals are still very strong. And the way it looks to me, you could still have accelerating core growth into next year. But at the same time, you clearly mentioned that some markets you guys would have to be kind of revenue manager here. I just kind of would like a little bit of color on maybe the percentage of those markets or how we should think about what's really at risk from a fundamental perspective? And then also, just as it relates to Duke, clearly, debt rates have moved against you a little bit. And so relative to your initial accretion, there's probably a little bit of a headwind there. And I'm just curious, too, as you guys kind of start to bid and kind of coming down a bit this year, where is your updated accretion number for Duke for the first 12 months? Hamid Moghadam : That was a couple of questions and 1 big question. So let me take parts of it, and I'm sure Tim and Dan will have a follow-up on this. In terms of fundamentals, what we're saying is that if a normal range of market outcomes is kind of 0 to 10, we were operating in an environment that was maybe at 12 for the last 18 months, and that's coming down to sort of a 9, 9.5 today. And that's why we\u2019ve shared with you the percentiles of utilization and occupancy and business activity that are part of our proprietary data that we survey customers around. So by any measure, other than the last 18 months, I would say, we're in very strong market conditions. And during those periods of sort of 9, 9.5, there are always a couple of markets that are weaker than others. The key markets are exceptionally strong. I mean, L.A., basically L.A. and Inland Empire, there's no vacancy in New Jersey, there's no vacancy and so on and so forth. But there are markets where vacancy rates are in the 5%, 6% range. That, by historical standards, is a very low level of vacancy. So I would say -- I would characterize the fundamentals as being very, very strong. They're just not off the charts given what's happened in the last 18 months. With respect to the Duke portfolio and margins and the like, Dan can elaborate on this, but we've never underwritten the exit cap rates to what the peak has been in the last 12 to 18 months. We've always taken -- added the premium for the forward risk and just the fact that, basically, these were unprecedented times. And a lot of the margins that you saw in prior quarters from us reflected that level of conservatism. And rents are still going up. I mean, we started 2022 thinking rents are going to be up 11%. They're up 28%. So yes, cap rates have gone up, but the rents that are being capped are significantly higher. So bottom line, margins, if you really stress test everything, okay, and you say rental growth stops, cap rates go up, et cetera, et cetera, construction costs go up, our development pipeline goes from mid-40s margins to high 20s margin type of thing. So still double what we underwrite to, which we usually underwrite to mid-teens. So extremely strong operating environment, and we are just being cautious on the capital market environment as we have to be. It would be imprudent if we weren't. Tim Arndt : And Craig, I'll just pick up your question on the debt in Duke. You're right. Since we announced the transaction in June, depending where you're on the curve, we're 100 to 200 basis points higher in interest rates. So that does hit the debt mark-to-market piece of things. I think if we were redoing the entire accretion on the year, we'd be still in the range, but at the lower end of that original $0.20 to $0.25 today. Hamid Moghadam : Yes. But I would also say on the fundamentals of the real estate, we're ahead of where we underwrote. So I think that far outweighs a mark-to-market on the debt. I mean, both Duke and us were very low levels of leverage. So the mark-to-market is just not a big deal in our calculus. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Derek Johnston : Just touching on European occupancy. You certainly had a positive bump to 98.6% and clearly pushed NOI. But can you expand on which geographies led really the sustainability of EU demand, what you guys are seeing on the ground and any additional leasing comments? Hamid Moghadam : Some of the weaker markets in Europe have strengthened, like Spain would come to mind or France would come to mind. The perennial strong markets in Europe were the U.K. and Germany, historically, Northern Europe. And they remain strong, but we wouldn't be surprised if Germany weakened a bit and the U.K. weakened a bit. In terms of weak markets in Europe, I would say, if you really force me to name one, I would say it's Hungary, which is a very, very small part of our overall business. Poland is actually, too much to our surprise, pretty strong. It must be because of the in-migration of a lot of Ukrainians into Poland and the additional consumption that they drive. But markets in Europe are tighter than they are in the U.S. in aggregate, and that's why vacancy rates are lower. But there's no question that Europe will have lower growth or more if we go into a recession, a bigger recession than the U.S., but by no means is it weak. Quite to the contrary, pretty strong. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. NichYulico: I just wanted to touch on sort of thinking about as we are heading into a weaker economic environment, most people think there's a global recession coming. If you could give us some context of how to think about potential occupancy impact to the portfolio. I mean, I think most of the third-party brokerage firms are citing something like 100 basis points of U.S. vacancy increase next year because of slowing absorption, some supply picking up. I guess, I'm curious what you thought about that. And then also from a credit loss standpoint, how we should think about the portfolio in sort of a historical context, kind of framing out where you have sort of a credit watch list today and potential occupancy impact on top of just an overall market occupancy impact from a credit loss standpoint in the portfolio if we are heading into a recession. Hamid Moghadam : Sure. On credit loss, the average over 10, 15 years has been about 15 basis points. We underwrite a lot higher than that, but that's where we've averaged during the most acute times of COVID in the first quarter or 2 when nobody -- when there was all that loss of jobs and everybody was scared. That went up to 55 basis points. But we collected on all that credit reserve that we had set up because eventually everybody paid. So I don't know where we ended up with, but we essentially ended up at 0, or maybe in line with the 15 basis points of historical numbers. I don't think we're going to see it anywhere near that. I think there is a fair amount of demand today that is not being satisfied in the market because of lack of supply. Our vacancy rate, just to pick a round number of 4%, even if they were to go up 100 basis points, which I don't believe they will, it would be at 5% which we would all do cartwheels for at any time in the 42 years that we've been in this business.  So I'm -- I mean, just do the math on the numbers, assuming that the development pipeline has a 0 more leasing. I don't mean for Prologis, I mean for the marketplace. And demand falls off significantly. That's how you get to the 100 basis points. And I just don't think it's going to be that acute given what we're seeing in terms of customer interest in our spaces on a real-time basis. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Michael Goldsmith : My question is on the Promotes. I think heading into the year, we talked about 2020 to 2023 Promote being similar or higher than where it was going to be in 2022 just given where valuations have changed and the different dynamics at play. How should we be thinking about the dynamics at play for next year on the Promote side? Hamid Moghadam : Promote levels are very sensitive to exit cap rates that you assumed. So that's a pretty tough question to answer. But if we stress test our numbers from the last time we spoke, the Promote for USLF next year is going to be on par with what it is this year for PELF. But that number can move in either direction by a significant amount, depending to what happens to exit cap rates. And by the way, both of those years, '22 and '23, will be record Promotes by a factor of 2 or 3. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Ki Bin Kim : I just want to go back to the question about contributions and your fund business. Can you remind us what the pricing mechanism is for your funds for you to contribute assets? If I remember correctly, that was a broker pref, but obviously, you don't want to force anything into your fund investors. So I'm just curious, what is causing the pause or temporary pause in contributions? Is it just an agreement or agreed upon price that you can't come to or is it something different? And second question, Hamid, if I think about the business bigger picture, if we didn't have this market volatility, I would have expected your company to contribute an increasing level of assets to your fund business because you have to kind of keep up with the development pipeline. But given that that's probably not going to happen, how should we think about the company taking on more assets on the balance sheet, better for our earnings but also higher leverage? I'm just trying to better understand that dynamic going forward. Hamid Moghadam : Yes. On the fund contribution question, we would be happy to continue to contribute the deals, if there were not for our care in managing the long-term value of the franchise in our private capital business. We haven't even tried, and we will not even try to contribute these assets that are being completed because we just don't think it's the right thing to do. It's got nothing to do with the appraised values or capacity or any of that stuff, as I explained before. We just think until there is real clarity, that will take some time and there have to be some comps and some transactions. Then when there is clarity, we'll start contributions again. As you know, unlike the last cycle, the contributions today are not must put, must take. They are totally voluntary by us to offer those properties to the investors or not to offer those properties to the investors. We're just not going to force that issue. It's not like they've turned us down or we think the values are too low. The values are great. We would still have significant 40% margins if we contributed. It's purely voluntary. And I think it's the right decision for the company in the long term. In terms of its impact on leverage, obviously, if we decide to hold more assets, our leverage is going to go up. But the reason we built this balance sheet is exactly for situations like this, is to be able to, A, be able to hold more of our assets that we're -- at some point in the future will contribute. And we're happy to hold those. And the other purpose for the balance sheet is to take advantage of investment opportunities as they emerge. It's still too early because I think the valuations will settle out somewhere lower than where the appraisers probably think today. But I don't know that for sure. And we -- by the way, we've been -- don't listen to a word I'm saying with respect to valuations, because for 5 years, we've been saying the cap rates are going to go back up, and they finally did, I guess. But we've been really wrong and, frankly, too high in cap rates for all this time. One other thing that's important, I should have mentioned this. We had never written up our portfolios to so the peak cap rates or underwritten any of our developments to the peak cap rates that we were seeing in the marketplace. We were always assuming exit cap rates that had a premium built into them. I think I mentioned that before, but that premium was anywhere between 5,000 to 7,500 basis points. So a lot of what you're seeing and are yet likely to see in values is already reflected in the way we looked at our margins, and we further stress test those numbers. And I think I shared the results of that with you earlier. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Tom Catherwood : Hamid, you mentioned tenants with more mature supply chains have slowed their CapEx spending. Obviously, we've seen that in the headlines as well. Are you seeing, though, any givebacks or nonrenewals from those tenants, whether it's FedEx or Amazon or others? And specifically, what are the tenants or industries that are backfilling this gap in demand? Hamid Moghadam : I'm going to let Mike give you a broader view of demand other than the customers you asked about. But let me hit those 2. We have 0 givebacks on Amazon. Zero. We thought we were going to have 2 out of like 160, we have 0. And they continue to take new space from us. So I don't know what all this excitement is all about, but we haven't seen it in the marketplace. They were on a tear in 2020 and '21, and they probably overcommitted to space, and they just reeled that back a bit. But they talked about 30 million feet coming online. We don't think it's even going to be 10 million feet and none of it is in the spaces that we have. So that's Amazon. FedEx is consolidating some of its ground operations with airport operations. We're going to be a beneficiary of that. And we're not going to lose any FedEx business as a result of that. And we're in regular conversation with these people. So those 2 customers specifically, no issue, and we have vetted this about as best as anybody can.  With respect to the broader customer picture, Mike? Mike Curless : Yes, I would just add a finer point to that. We're going to see other headlines coming down the pike. I'd encourage you to really look through the headlines and understand the numerator versus the denominator in play here. And we're talking, just to pile on Hamid's comments, FedEx mentioned order of magnitude of 100 projects they're pausing in the future. That's set against 15,000 spaces they already have. Amazon, to put a finer point on that, even if there -- they have 550 million square foot portfolio. So we're talking 1% churn kind of numbers here, which is a very normal churn we see for our larger customers that have thousands of spaces. I think it's important when you see the next headline to look beyond along those headlines. In terms of where the other activity is, and Chris can pile on as well here, too, but e-commerce clearly is the big driver. And we're seeing e-commerce levels in our own portfolio just ahead of where we were pre-COVID. The big difference is Amazon is not a part of that this quarter. They're temporarily pausing, and we're seeing 122 other customers, not named Amazon, driving e-commerce leasing at levels we saw pre-pandemic. I think that's the big driver, the big takeaway for the segments that are supporting this backfill. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street. Vince Tibone : You increased your market rent growth forecast in the U.S. to 28% this year. How much of that growth has already been achieved through the end of the third quarter? I'd like to hear just how much you think market rents can continue to grow in the current environment. Tim Arndt : Vince, yes, the increase is exclusively based on the outperformance in the third quarter. We thought in the present landscape, it would not be appropriate to make an increase. But as we look into next year, I think it's appropriate to expect mid- to high single digits. As Hamid mentioned, we opened this year with a similar level of caution and have seen subsequent increases. We monitor this on a real-time basis let alone reporting out on a quarterly basis. And some of the things that go into that is the ongoing significant momentum, right? So rents were up 6% in the quarter against ultra-low vacancies, healthy demand, healthy leading indicators but set against the macro uncertainty that we've described. Hamid Moghadam : So 75% to 80% of the 28% has already occurred, and we expect the balance to occur in the balance of the year. And by the way, we're only a couple of weeks into the quarter. But again, every time we make a deal, we know what the effective rent is compared to the way we underwrote it. And we call it spear, I won't get into the details of it here. But those indications are up, both in terms of comparison to underwriting or the way we had pro forma those spaces. And also in terms of duration of leases, they're slightly longer than we thought. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Thomas : I wanted to follow up on Duke. Tim, thanks for the update around the $0.20 to $0.25 of year 1 core FFO accretion. But I'm curious, Hamid, your comments suggest that Duke is running ahead of your initial underwriting. So I'm curious if there's been any change to your underwriting such that the year AFFO impacts changed at all relative to your initial expectations. And then just secondly, regarding the core FFO guidance, excluding net promote income, can you just help us bridge that 1.1% increase at the midpoint from the prior guidance now that Duke's closed and just discuss the drivers of that increase a little bit? It sounded like the quarter came in ahead of budget or plan, which I suspect contributed, but the increase of $0.05 at the midpoint, I think you attributed solely to Duke. Was there anything else that was an offset in the quarter to the stronger growth? Hamid Moghadam : Yes. Just -- I remember, Duke's leases were longer than ours. So the average turnover based on the average duration of the Duke leases is like 10%, 12% a year. I don't remember what it is exactly in the next 12 months, that\u2019s your question was on. And we think we're a couple of points ahead. But a couple of points ahead affecting 10% to 12% of the portfolio for an average of 6 months is what we're talking about in terms of its impact on the next year. So it will be a small impact. I think the bigger impact will be what we can do once we get our hands on the rest of the portfolio rolling over through revenue management. And we think overall, maybe that could be 2% or 3% above underwriting. I also think there will be a couple of hundred basis points pickup in terms of folding essential sales on top of that. But it will take a little while for us to sort of build those relationships with those customers in those locations and all that. On the second part of your question, Tim will address that. Tim Arndt : Yes, you're right that the quarter was strong. We're probably $0.01 ahead there, and that would be reflected really in the same-store guidance overall that we took up. We would see an uptick on the year from that uplift as well as we would get a little bit out of this slowdown in contributions in the short term. Offsetting each of those, putting the group to about 0 would be a little bit higher interest expense. We've got short-term rates that have really picked up. And then the write-down of asset values in the funds does hit asset management fees. So that would be another take. So that's all coming up to about 0, leaving really the entirety of the accretion to the Duke transaction. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Blaine Heck : Hamid, can you expand on your thoughts on the broader economy? I think your remarks in the earnings release indicated that you're preparing for an economic slowdown. Does that include a U.S. and/or a global recession? And how should we think about your development starts in 2023 given that you've now added capacity through the Duke transaction but seem to be more cautious here today given macro concerns? Hamid Moghadam : Yes. My view of the economy is that the Fed was behind the 8 ball, and they are now really running hard to catch up and they're going to overshoot in their reaction. And everybody expects these things to have an immediate effect. Look, I'm not as smart as the guys running the Fed, but these things typically have a 2-year lag. So I think we're going to whipsaw this economy. And there is no reason this economy should be in a recession other than just wanting to wring out this inflation. And this is a personal editorial. This is not a company position, but I believe more -- based on what I'm seeing, more of the inflation is actually affected by not that systemic wage price push that we saw in other times of high inflation. By the way, I was there. When I started my career, the 10-year bond was 14% and prime rate was 22%. But that was a psychology that was built into the marketplace. I think -- and it took bulker in October of '79 to wring that out. But the market had gone 6 or 7 years with that becoming the norm. This is very different. We were just talking about 2% inflation a year ago, and it just spiked up. So a lot of that, I think, is going to dissipate as things normalize and trade flows and the like normalize, but that's a personal point of view. So I am concerned about inflation. I think the Fed is all going to overdo it. Whether we have a recession or not, I don't know why people are so focused on this recession question. To me, a 0.25% growth rate in the GDP when the potential is 2%, 2.5% for the U.S. and 1.5% for Europe is a bad thing. Now whether technically a bunch of smoke will come out of the pipe, that says we officially have a recession, that's less important, but we are definitely under kind of underperform the capacity of this industry. The consumer is in great shape. The consumer balance sheets are in great shape. So I see a lot of reasons for optimism. I mean, look at all these calls that we were all having a quarter ago. I think the psychology has changed dramatically because of all this aggressive Fed action. So I've done a good job of not answering the question. If you had to ask me last quarter what's the probability of a recession in the next year, I would have told you 90-10. Today, I would go 60-40 or maybe 50-50. I think we're much closer in the U.S. I think in Europe, we will go into a very slight shallow recession. With respect to its impact on development starts, I think the market is undersupplied with space. But we don't have to make that decision today. We don't. Every start decision is made deal-by-deal, and we will have the benefit of up-to-minute information and actually some information about the future because we're talking to prospects. So if we think the prospects are there to lease it up, we'll build the building. And if not, I don't really care about guidance. We try to give you the best guidance we can, but we don't run our business according to guidance. We could be lower or we could be higher. I think we're going to surprise people on the upside. But let's wait and see. We don't have to make that decision today. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Ronald Kamdem : Just going back to the lease signing of 84% during the quarter. It sort of suggests that the commenced leases should be accelerating as well. But how do I marry that with the full year same-store NOI guidance where you're guiding for $8.625 for the year, but year-to-date, it's 8.7. sso suggesting a little bit of deceleration? Just trying to understand what could be driving that? Is it occupancy of the comp versus the lease signing that's accelerating? Tim Arndt : Yes, Ron. Look, this is a good opportunity actually to distinguish the 2 metrics. So the commencements were 62%, and that's why we're actually calling out the 84% on signings because of the lag that sits between the two. The lease signings on what started this quarter, generating the 62% were probably done in the first quarter. So all that means that the 84% we're signing today, we're really not going to see those commence until '23 outside of the same-store period in our guidance. So that's why we're actually focusing on signings. You'll probably hear a bit more of that going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Camille Bonnel with Bank of America. Camille Bonnel : We've seen the spread between market rent growth and lease escalations widen over the past 2 years. Can you talk to what percent of your leases have a fixed structure? What are the escalators you're achieving on new leases? And how sustainable these are throughout the duration of the lease? Hamid Moghadam : Virtually all leases have escalators. I would guess the average is 3.5-ish, maybe approaching 4. And yes, 4, I'm getting a lot of 4s, thumbs up here. And what was -- Tim Arndt : I would just clarify that the installed base is probably the 3.5% you mentioned and then more recently 4%. Hamid Moghadam : Yes. And I think that was it. Did you have a third part to your question? Camille Bonnel : Just wondering how sustainable these increases are throughout the duration of the lease. Hamid Moghadam : Well, they're contractually obligated to increase. So it's not -- and they're contractual. They're not CPI-driven or anything like that. So I guess unless the tenant goes broke, there is no risk to that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : I realize that the markets are very fluid, but I did want to ask about the 4.1% cap rate that you have stabilized on your development starts. I guess, industrial would be the 1 asset class that you could argue the most for negative leverage given the strong mark-to-market that you have, but new developments are signed basically at market. So it doesn't have its same mark-to-market potential. So can you make the argument or couldn't you make the argument that new development should be at a higher cap rate, which I know was counterintuitive to how it's been recently, but it's reflective of that market today? Hamid Moghadam : Yes. By the way, I don't think there is any negative leverage even today. Let's just go to basic principles. The reason interest rates are going up is because we have inflation. Real up is because we have situation, so there's pressure on real rents going up. If we continue in an inflationary environment where rates are up, we're going to get more rental growth, not rental growth because vacancy rates are very low. So really, in terms of IRR, we have positive inflation -- positive leverage. And that's the way it has been for 30 years of my 42-year career. Positive leverage on IRR, not necessarily positive on the going in cap rate or cash yield compared to interest rates. That's the way the business works. It's total return dependent. And total return in a high interest rate, high inflation environment is going to have a big growth component to it. Unless the market is 10%, 15% vacant, in which case, inflation doesn't matter, you don't have pricing power. But we expect to have pricing power for the foreseeable future even in a really, really conservative absorption scenario. And I went through that before. I can't imagine a scenario anytime soon where vacancy rates would reach 5%. So I think we'll have pricing power, and I think we have positive leverage on an IRR basis. And by the way, short-term rates have moved up a lot more than the long-term rates. And really, real estate is an infinite life asset. So you got to compare its returns to 10-year or more longer debt. Tim? Tim Arndt : I just want to clarify, John, maybe you see this, but I want to be sure you note that we have in the supplemental, both the exit cap and estimate on it and the development yield, and I think you're quoting the exit cap. The development yields are 6%, 6.5% in the portfolio. So I want to be sure you understand that distinction. Hamid Moghadam : Hence, the huge margins. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jon Petersen with Jefferies. JonPetersen: I was looking at the sort of the Promote opportunity next year for the targeted U.S. logistics fund. I realize it's volatile and there's a ton of assumptions that go into this. So maybe you could help us and remind us what the hurdle rates are that you have to hit each year to be eligible for a Promote? Just kind of how that structure works, once you hit the hurdle, like what percent of the NOI you get, so we can all be dangerous and make our own assumptions. And then another question I have is on the land portfolio. I think you have it on the books at $2.7 billion. Any estimate on how we should think about the market value of that land portfolio today? Hamid Moghadam : Yes. I think market value of land was double our book value. And my guess is, before this is all over, and not a single piece of land has not really traded in any scale so that I can give you an actual estimate but I would guess land values before it's all over will decline by 30% which would put them still significantly above our book value. So that's where we are. I think the Promote hurdles are 7, and it's a 20% part -- yes. And we have 2 hurdle promotes, actually 7 and 10 and 15 and 20 is the upside participation in those, and those are leveraged hurdle rates. So 15 over 7, 20 over a 10. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays. Anthony Powell : A question on acquisitions. Can you talk more about the Crossbay deal, what brought you to that transaction? I think you talked before about maybe more portfolio deals happening in Europe. Are there more news out there? And what's your, I guess, willingness to do more deals on the balance sheet given kind of the overall macro environment? Dan Letter : This is Dan. I'll take that question. So the Crossbay deal closed last quarter, we, I think, first introduced that deal probably in February. We were able to -- when we first talked about this deal, the bid-ask was pretty far apart. But we were actually able to win that deal at a very favorable price. We actually got a couple of price reductions, and we really love the real estate. It's very complementary to PELF, and the team is very excited about bringing that on. As it relates to other portfolios, the way I think about deploying capital right now, I think about really disciplined, I think, about patients and I think about opportunity. We've always run a very disciplined deployment machine. And our team, boots on the ground are calibrated for that and are excited about it. We're being patient right now because we do expect to see opportunities that come from -- as a matter of fact, we're making money today based on decisions that we made in the depths of the GFC. So really excited about what opportunities could come. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll : I wanted to touch on an earlier question to see if we can get a little bit more information regarding the larger users with more mature supply pipelines. I know you touched on a few examples. But in general, how big is this bucket of these larger users slowing down? I mean, is it mostly Amazon? And I believe you mentioned FedEx, there are like a few other outside of that or is that about it? Hamid Moghadam : Everybody is running to catch up on their e-commerce supply chain because they're starting behind and they need to catch up. So the demand for e-comm space is broadening. But remember, e-com is just maybe 20% of the overall demand. At the same time that, that's going on, people are building resilience in their supply chain. So inventory levels have adjusted upwards like we predicted. We think half of that adjustment has already occurred, and there's another half of it to go. So I think you'll see all customers or virtually all customers building more resilience into their supply chain by taking up more space so that they don't get caught with the wrong inventory in the wrong place at the wrong time. But demand is definitely broadening. Mike, do you want to? Mike Curless : Yes. And I think I could just give you a sense on all customers are being certainly more introspective and cautious these days. That's natural in times of uncertainty. But if you look at our build-to-suit list, for example, it's a narrower list. Amazon is currently pausing. But the customers that are on the list are still following through with long-term supply chain reconfigurations that have been in place for a long time, and they are following through with those with the same effort that we've seen before. So I would say if you look at build-to-suits, it's a smaller, more active list of customers. And our competitive environment looks even better. There's fewer private competitors out there that are direct competition given the current market conditions. So I view that business as smaller but a deeper prospect list with a higher win rate possibility. So that's 1 perspective. Hamid Moghadam : Yes, the point Mike just made about the competition on the private side is a really, really important one. I mean, these guys depend on leverage. Leverage is not available. It's not just a question of the cost of it to a lot of these people. So we've already seen certainly layoffs in Europe with respect to some of the very aggressive private guys, and I think we'll see some of it in the U.S., too. So again, another reason why we have a good balance sheet is to use it when the opportunities are there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Mike Mueller : Is your 65% year-end lease mark-to-market expectation with or without Duke in it? Hamid Moghadam : That's with Duke. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers with Baird. Dave Rodgers : Hamid, thanks for the details on tenant credit that you provided earlier. I wanted to go back, and maybe this is a draconian question, but when you go back to global financial crisis, I think you lost 600 basis points of occupancy top to bottom. Some of that might have been credit loss, but even though it's not credit loss, then some tenants may leave just due to the same factors that we're talking about. I guess, how does today differ? And I guess, I'm just a little worried about the convexity of noninvestment-grade now above 10%, those types of things. I guess how does your portfolio differ? How do you think the market differs? And then maybe a follow-up to Chris. Last quarter, you had suggested a 75 basis point increase in vacancy for '23 for the market as a whole. Has that number changed? Hamid Moghadam : Okay. I'm not sure I understood the second part. But the first part, first of all, I don't know about Prologis, but I think there was 52 million square feet of spec space that they had built at that time. And the company at that time was, I don't know, 400 million square feet or something. It was a huge part of the installed base, and most of it was spec. So you went into global financial crisis with a collapse in demand and you were starting off with a 7% or 8% vacancy rate even before going into the global financial crisis, so it was different at least in 3 respects. One, level of spec development; two, the starting level of vacancy; and three, the impact of that on a much, much smaller company than today. So very, very different situation. But the numbers for AMB were that we went from mid-95% occupancy to 91% occupancy. And by the way, the exact same thing happened in the dot-com collapse, which was people had overcommitted to space. The difference is that the shadow space in this market is very low. That's why we look track utilization. We have 90th percentile utilization in the buildings in terms of history. So occupancies are high, utilization is high, there's a lot of ongoing demand and we're starting off at the 98% occupancy. Even if the global financial crisis were going to repeat itself, we'll be at 94% occupancy. That's just fine. There's no problem with that. We can get rent growth at those kinds of numbers. So I don't even think of those draconian scenarios. Of course, somebody launches a nuclear war somewhere, all bets are off, but I'm not capable of making those. Chris Caton : Dave, as it relates to the forecast we shared, you remember correctly but got the units wrong. So we had said we could see a supply demand gap of 50 million to 100 million square next year, which would only be 30 basis points of occupancy increase. Our latest view probably has it at the higher end of that range, say, 100 million square foot gap, which would lead to a high 3s or a 4% market vacancy, which again is below the low that prevailed during the decade before. And then also call out in Tim's script that based on the capital market landscape, we could have a gap in development starts that would ultimately translate to a gap in deliveries late next year and early '24. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Crow with Raymond James. Bill Crow : Two questions. First of all, any change in the lease-up time on new deliveries? And the second question is, you talked a lot about cap rates and cap rate increases over the last 6 or 7 months. I'm just wondering if you were to underwrite an acquisition today, how would that change from where you were early this year? Let's say, how much how much do you think cap rates have gapped out on a like-for-like deal? Tim Arndt : I can start on the lease-up times, and I think Hamid made reference to this just that compared to underwriting. We've consistently beat underwriting, and that would remain the case today. Maybe there's a month lower there, but we're continuing to beat underwriting in new development leasing. Hamid Moghadam : I would say on the cap rate side, you see it in our development portfolio in the supplemental. We moved our exit cap rates from 4.1 to 4.7. So that's demonstrative of the change that we're looking at across the board going forward. Hamid Moghadam : So if you -- I would say, for the last couple of years, we're looking at about a 6% unleveraged IRR in acquisitions using about an average of a 3% growth rate on rents and that gap is 300 basis points. By the way, that's the most important number that you look at, that I look at anyway, and replacement costs. So if you believe inflation is going to be higher at 4%, rents will grow at least [indiscernible] times inflation given what's happening to replacement costs and given the tightness of the market. So you could expect with the 4% growth rate that the IRRs would be 7%, 7.5% going forward. So the point I'm trying to make is that you just can't look at discount rate of those cash flows without considering the growth rate of those cash flows. And those 2 don't move perfectly in tandem, but generally move in line with one another in a market that has a vacancy rate below equilibrium. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Jamie Feldman : We were just thinking about how should we think about FX and how that goes into your calculus when you're thinking about investment activity given how strong the U.S. dollar is and your unique global platform? And then secondly, if you could just give us some thoughts on when you think the mark-to-market stops expanding. I think it's been surprising to us how it just keeps going quarter-after-quarter. I'd love to get some thoughts on when that might moderate. Hamid Moghadam : Yes. So FX are -- I'll give you the big picture theory, and Tim can give you the details. We do 3 levels of FX management. Number one, we want to have a global platform to serve global customers, but we do not want to have our capital equally in every place because we're a U.S. dollar dividend payer. Therefore, we use a higher percentage of private capital in our foreign jurisdictions than we do in U.S. jurisdictions. So that's the first step that we take. Secondly, we have a disproportionately higher amount of debt in foreign currencies matched against our equity or our share of the equity in those assets so that we are neutralized in terms of asset and liability movements with respect to the movement of interest rates.  In other words, $100 of equity and $100 of debt against it. By the way, the U.S. is much less levered. So our overall leverage is very good. So that's the second level that we manage the asset value, which is really the big dangerous thing in real estate. So on those, we're perfectly hedged. Perfectly hedged. Not overhedged, not under hedged. Perfectly hedged. Then there is the issue of how do you manage earnings, FX on earnings, which is more of a flow management, and that is by buying hedges that go out and protect earnings for 2-ish kind of years. Tim Arndt : Yes. And I would say even longer, we ladder into that strategy where the next few years are quite fully hedged, but we have hedges out to '26, '27 and we dollar cost average into it. I also think, Jamie, it sounded like underneath your question is how do we feel about sending dollars to Europe or to Japan. And frankly, that's not really how it works. In these other jurisdictions, we're typically recycling capital. That's when we're running the contribution model even at a time like this when the contributions at least in Europe are at a pause, we're funding that with debt in-country. So we don't really have the kind of issue, as I think you're trying to highlight there. Your second question was on the lease mark-to-market, I think, and how does it fall down over time. And I know you appreciate that's going to be purely a function of what is market rent growth from here. If there are no market rent growth, it will come down more precipitously. And if there's a reasonable level, say, high single digits, that's probably going to be paired with our same store growth. And that would say the lease mark-to-market is going to be pretty constant for a while. So you have to make a bet on market rent growth to really answer that question, and we're not doing that today over the long term, but it's got a very long tail to it, I think, is our view. Hamid Moghadam : By the way, I would also say that the FX rates being so favorable to the dollar, there will become a time where there will be compelling opportunities to deploy capital in Europe because you could catch the combination of good values in local currency and a great exchange rate. So we're not -- we don't expect to do that tomorrow or anything, but that's another consideration that we always keep in mind, which is the opportunistic side of all these changes that we're witnessing. Before I let you go, however, I'd like to take a minute to highlight our Groundbreakers Conference, which happens next Tuesday at Hudson Yards in New York. It will also be streaming online. This is an annual thought leadership event, which will feature some of the most innovative voices in logistics today, including Dave Clark, formerly CEO of Worldwide Consumer at Amazon and now the new CEO of Flexport, which is actually one of our portfolio companies, plus a host of others that you won't want to miss. We'll dig into all the questions that you've been asking about in terms of macro trends. And I think it will be a very different event than yet another recumbence or something of that kind. So if you're really interested about logistics and when it's moving in the next couple of decades, these are the people that we brought together. So I look forward to seeing many of you there. We've had a tremendous response. And I think you'll get a lot out of it. So please come. Take care. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference will be recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Jill Sawyer, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Jill Sawyer : Thanks, Diego, and good morning. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. I\u2019d like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates, as well as management\u2019s beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or other SEC filings. Additionally, our fourth quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures and in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation for those measures. I\u2019d like to welcome Tim Arndt, our CFO, who will cover results, real-time market conditions and guidance. Hamid Moghadam, our CEO and our entire executive team are also with us today. With that, I will hand the call over to Tim. Tim Arndt : Thanks, Jill. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Let me begin by thanking our global team for delivering an excellent quarter and year. We have had outstanding results despite challenging headwinds from the capital markets and the overall economic backdrop. In the face of this, our focus has been to serve our customers and investors putting our heads down and executing on our long-term plan. As you see in our results, our portfolio is in excellent shape, driven by still strong demand and a continued lack of availability. This foundation for our business not only drove our nearly 13% increase in year-over-year core earnings, but it also sets up the company for sustainable growth for years to come. Turning to results. Core FFO excluding promotes was $4.61 per share and including promotes was $5.16 per share, ahead of our forecast. In the fourth quarter, our operating results again generated several new records. Occupancy increased to 98.2%, with retention of 82%. The Prologis portfolio excluding Duke added 30-basis-point of the 40-basis-point increase over the quarter. While we tend to quote occupancy, it is notable that the portfolio is 98.6% leased, a record that underscores the tightness across our markets. Rent change for the quarter was 51% on a net effective basis. The step down from our third quarter rent change of 60% is a reflection of mix and not market rents. In fact, market rent growth exceeded expectations during the quarter, increasing our lease mark-to-market to a record 67%. These results drove same-store growth to 7.7% on a net effective basis and 9.1% on cash. The Duke portfolio having closed on October 3rd, is fully integrated in these results, with the exception of same-store growth, which will not be reflected until the first quarter of 2024. On the balance sheet, while access to the debt markets have remained challenging for many issuers, we successfully executed a number of transactions during the quarter, raising over $1.1 billion at an interest rate below 3%, including $700 million of new unsecured borrowings out of Japan and Canada. Our credit metrics continue to be excellent and we have maintained over $4 billion of liquidity at year-end with borrowing capacity across Prologis and the open-ended funds of $20 billion, expanded significantly due to our balance sheet growth from the Duke acquisition. With regard to our markets and leasing activity, the bottomline is that conditions remain healthy and there is little we see across our results or proprietary metrics that point to a meaningful slowdown. We see a normalization of demand and when combined with low vacancy, it continues to translate to a meaningful increase in rents. Across our markets, rent growth was nearly 5% during the quarter, driving the full year to 28%. Proposal activity for available space was consistent with our recent history, and given persistent low vacancy, there is simply a very small number of units to even propose deals on. As evidenced, over 99% of our portfolio is either currently leased or in negotiation. Utilization remains high at 86%, near its all time record and deal gestation ticked up over the quarter, indicative of more careful consideration and time being taken in leasing decisions. While we are watching e-commerce carefully, its share of overall retail sales have increased to 22%, which is 600 basis points above its pre-pandemic level. Putting the nuance of mix, timing and other factors aside, as measured by retention, occupancy or rent change, it is clear that customers need to commit to space to market conditions, which offer them very little choice. In terms of supply, the development pipeline across our market stands at 565 million square feet and our expectation for the year is that the pipeline will decline. Deliveries will put modest upward pressure on vacancies from 3.3% today towards 4% later in the year. However, new development starts are slowing in response to the market environment, which will reduce vacancies in late 2023 or 2024. In Europe, we expect deliveries to outpace absorption by approximately 30 million square feet, expanding the current 2.6% vacancy rate to approximately 3.5%. Finally, and as expected, our true months of supply metric grew to 25 months in the U.S. from 22 months last quarter. As a reminder, this metric has averaged roughly 36 months over the last 10 years. In capital markets, transactions continue to be slow in the fourth quarter, making price discovery challenging. That said, return requirements are trending to the low-to-mid 7% range. This expansion further affected appraised values in our funds, although continued rent growth has mitigated some of the effect. Our U.S. values, which were appraised by third parties every quarter, declined 6% this quarter and 7% over the entire second half. In Europe, values declined approximately 12% during the quarter and 16% over the half. Our open-end funds have received only modest redemption requests, less than 3% of net asset value during the quarter, totaling 5% across the second half. Our flagship funds have strong balance sheets with low leverage, largely undrawn credit facilities, cash on hand and undrawn equity commitments. While we believe the value declines over the second half reflect market, investors are still adjusting to a new environment. Because we strive to be consistent in our actions and fair to all investors, we will redeem units call equity and resume asset contributions when price discovery has run its course. We expect that to be one quarter to two quarters away likely sooner in Europe. This will ensure certainty, fairness and consistency to all of our investors. Turning to our outlook for 2023, while our macro forecast assumes a moderate recession, which may put headwinds on demand, our business is driven by secular forces and long-term planning by our customers that should limit the impact unless such a downturn becomes significant and protracted. As mentioned earlier, we believe vacancy will build in the market and our portfolio, both of which are unsustainably low. Putting this sentiment together with our outlook on supply and demand, our 2023 rent forecast calls for approximately 10% growth in the U.S. and 9% globally. We acknowledge that our rent forecasts have proven conservative in recent years, but we are comfortable with this starting point given the environment. Specific to our portfolio and on an our share basis, we expect average occupancy to range between 96.5% and 97.5%, roughly 50 basis points lower than the 2022 midpoint. Combined with rent change, we forecast to generate net effective same-store growth of approximately 8% to 9% with casting store growth between 8.5% and 9.5%. Given these assumptions, we believe our lease mark-to-market will be sustained or even increased over 2023, ending the year between 65% and 70%, and providing visibility to an incremental $2.9 billion of NOI after the more than $300 million that will become realized over the course of this year. We expect G&A to range between $370 million and $385 million, reflecting not only inflation in wages and other corporate costs, but also additional investments we are making in our Essentials business particularly in the energy teams. In that regard, we expect the contribution to FFO from Essentials to range between $0.07 and $0.09 this year. This reflects 70% growth in revenues and tax credits from 2022, but offset in the near-term by our higher Duke related share count and the G&A investments just mentioned. In terms of operational metrics for the business, we expect to add 115 megawatts of solar power over the year driving the portfolio to approximately 540 megawatts by year end. It\u2019s worth noting that we closed 2022 as the second largest on-site power producer in the U.S., a position we will build upon with our plan for 1 gigawatt of production and storage by 2025. We also forecast to have over 20 EV charging clusters installed and operational by year-end. In deployment, we will continue to be disciplined in our approach to new starts. We have over $39 billion of opportunities to select from in our land bank and between our expectations for build-to-suits and logical markets prospect, we see an active year of starts initially to range between $2.5 billion and $3 billion with a real opportunity to grow as conditions warrant. As mentioned earlier, we plan for redemptions to be cleared out over the year and private fundraising to resume. Accordingly, we forecast contribution activity to occur primarily in the second half and resulting in combined contribution and disposition guidance of $2 billion to $3 billion. Finally, in strategic capital, we forecast revenues excluding promotes to range between $500 million and $525 million, which is impacted by valuation write-downs across 2022 and the first half of 2023. We are forecasting net promote income of $0.40 based on an assumption that U -- that values in USLF, primary source of 2023 promotes will decline further from values at year end, every 1% change in asset value equates to slightly less than $0.02 of net promote income. Putting this all together, we expect core FFO excluding promotes to range between $5 per share and $5.10 per share. At the midpoint of our guidance, this represents approximately 9.5% growth over 2022. We are guiding core FFO including promotes to range between $5.40 per share and $5.50 per share. In closing, this guidance builds upon an exceptional three-year period of sector-leading earnings growth. At our 2019 Investor Day, we presented a three-year plan, targeting 8.5% annual growth, we achieved nearly 14% over this period, 550 basis points of annual outperformance. We expect 2023 to be a year where headlines continue to be disconnected from our business and ability to deliver strong growth and valuation. While there are many unknowns generally, there are more knowns in our business that are clear, such as our lease mark-to-market, significant and visible opportunity in our land bank, a need for excitement for -- a need and excitement for a new generation of sustainable energy solutions, and a dedicated team that is the best in the business and laser focused on delivering leading results. We will now turn the call over to the Operator to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Please state your question. Steve Sakwa : Yeah. Thanks. I guess good morning out there. Tim, I just wanted to clarify in your kind of going through your guidance, you throw out a lot of numbers. I just want to make sure on the mark-to-market numbers that are embedded in your same-store NOI growth of 8% to 9% GAAP and 8.5% to 9.5% cash. Just what are you expecting for cash and GAAP leasing spreads and I just want to make sure that\u2019s different than the kind of overall portfolio mark-to-market you talked about 65% to 70%? Tim Arndt : Yeah. They are going to be stronger. As you think about the lease mark-to-market, it\u2019s all of the leases, so it represents old leases and leases just done. So, clearly, everything that will roll next year is going to be above the 67% reporting today. It\u2019s a little bit flatter than you might expect as we have looked at it. I think leasing spreads next year are going to be in the high 70s to low 80s on a net effective basis and then as we know that the cash basis of that has trended towards about 1,500 basis points or so inside of that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Mailman with Citi. Please state your question. Craig Mailman : Hey. Good morning, everyone. I just want to hit on the capital deployment side of things, maybe a two-parter here. Just first on the stabilization, so just the kind of the -- what you guys have stabilizing the $2.8 billion at your share, can you just bridge that gap versus the $5.5 billion that you have on page 20 of expected deliveries or completions in 2023? And maybe just give us some sense of timing on that, I know I think about 30% of those are build-to-suits. So also how you are thinking about where the preleasing is on the balance of that as well and kind of how that layers into your occupancy assumption? Tim Arndt : Yeah. I will take -- Craig, it\u2019s Tim. I will take the first half and Dan can help with the second. This is really a date issue, I would say, not even an issue, but just a function of the date. We have a large amount of that group of stabilization we believe will occur in the first quarter of 2024 and I think there is a very real possibility that if we improve some of the leasing timing by just a month or two, we could see a decent amount of that actually fall back into 2023. So it\u2019s just a function of crossing over a calendar year to lay up the mix of all of our projects is landing. Dan Letter : And this is Dan. I will just pile on there. The pre-leasing in that portfolio, as you see, there\u2019s 29% of that that\u2019s in there as a build-to-suit. The pre-leasing is better than that 29%, and I would say, on track with historical averages even on a bigger data set here. So we feel really good about delivering our stabilization at this year and next. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Please state your question. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks and good morning. I was curious about the investment capacity that you show in your supplemental of $1.5 billion is down from $4.2 billion. I just want to understand what that actually represents? And tying that to your comments about contributions perhaps picking back up if conditions settle out, how does that comment compared to the $1.5 billion capacity and how much river room [ph] do you ultimately have an increase on that capacity? Thank you. Tim Arndt : Hey, Ki Bin. So what I would do with regard to investment capacity is relying more on the way I am describing it in our prepared remarks, the $20 billion and $4 billion or $5 billion across the funds. The number that\u2019s presented in the sup, which is what I think you are referring to is a bit technical about the current amount of equity that can be drawn in the funds and then that number is levered slightly, so that\u2019s why it\u2019s a bit understated. The number we supplemented with in prepared remarks is looking at the overall leverage of the fund and how much more capacity sits beyond just that of committed equity post-leverage. So, for example, our USLF venture is very low leverage, just about 10% and that creates an incredible amount of debt capacity, as you can imagine. And I think that winds up addressing your second question, which is the liquidity and the funds for contributions, there\u2019s a lot there for us to have over time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Please state your question. Derek Johnston : Hi, everyone. How are you doing? Can you give us an update on the markets in Europe, the mark-to-market there, any leasing trends? I think you touched briefly on the private market transaction backdrop. We definitely see the U.S. mark-to-market getting wider. I guess how do you view demand in Europe and the differences between the U.S. and Europe unfolding in 2023? Thank you. Hamid Moghadam : Yeah. Let me start with some general comments. Europe is generally a mild and more muted version of the U.S. both on the way up and on the way down and the market is -- has a lower vacancy rate than the UAE -- than the U.S., if you can believe it. So that\u2019s a general backdrop. That\u2019s very consistent with the way Europe has behaved in the last 10 years or 15years. As to the specifics on mark-to-market and alike, Dan, do you want to cover that? Dan Letter : Yeah. Sure. Mark-to-market -- lease mark-to-market in Europe is about 28%, and I would say, just overall, we feel very good about the leasing demand in Europe right now. We talked about at the -- in the remarks about an expansion in the vacancy, but overall, we feel really good about where it\u2019s headed. Hamid Moghadam : And the -- you might ask what about the U.K., because that\u2019s the one you hear about all the time, and actually that\u2019s really strong, too, so far. So we have actually been surprised on the positive side with the U.K. The other place that is really held up well is actually Germany, which you would have guessed with energy issues would be softer, it hasn\u2019t been and there\u2019s virtually no vacancy in Germany. And some of the manufacturing coming back, particularly autos, et cetera, are really strengthening Central and Eastern Europe the markets, particularly in Poland, where there\u2019s this perennial vacancy. It\u2019s sort of tightening up. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please state your question. Nick Yulico : Thanks. I want to dig in a little bit to the sectors that you are seeing driving leasing demand, let\u2019s say, in the fourth quarter and so far this year, whether you have seen any changes in types of customers taking space versus a year ago? And then, I guess, when we think about the broader retailer bucket, where you did see some retailers reporting year-over-year sales declines in the back half of last year, wondering if any pieces of that category are you seeing less demand? Hamid Moghadam : Yeah. The only category that is significantly below the trend and is likely to be that way is housing, because the starts are slowing. But with respect to other detail, Chris, do you want to take that? Chris Caton : Yeah. It\u2019s absolutely right. Generally, Nick, it was diverse. So whether we look at consumer products, whether we look at apparel, food and beverage customers, we have a diverse range of customers leasing space from us beyond the housing categories, which would include construction, it could include home goods and alike. Hamid Moghadam : Yeah. And retail sales on a real basis, notwithstanding the weaker for instance December and November are good. I think it\u2019s between 2.5% and 3% up compared to the year before. So, yeah, you do hear the headlines of the weaker with retailers, but I think if you look at it overall, it\u2019s actually pretty positive. It\u2019s more positive than the headlines. I wouldn\u2019t say, it\u2019s super positive, but it\u2019s much better than the headlines. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please state your question. Michael Goldsmith : Good morning. Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. You clearly laid out the building blocks of your same-store NOI growth of 8.5% to 9.5% in 2023, where you have a high level of visibility, obviously, a lot of macro uncertainty out there. Can you provide the specific assumptions you have used for your initial 2023 outlook and then just where and how a change in the macro environment could provide upside or downside to your initial guidance? Thanks. Hamid Moghadam : Macro environment other than, call it, defaults or something that has an immediate effect are not going to drive the numbers big time in 2023, because a lot of the leasing that needs to take place in 2023 is already in progress or been dealt with. We are dealing with very high occupancy levels. To start with, there is not a whole lot of space to lease and the real driver of those same-store numbers is the huge mark-to-market in the portfolio that already exists. So that\u2019s -- so don\u2019t expect, even if we change the assumptions by a lot, the numbers for 2023 are not going to move that much. They will, obviously, move as you get further along into the future. So that\u2019s one comment I would make. The second comment I would make is that in every year in the last three years or four years, we started the year with rental assumptions that we have exceeded sometimes by a factor of 3x to 4x. So I am not saying that\u2019s going to happen this year, but there is absolutely no reason in the world to go crazy on our assumptions with respect to rental rates, particularly they don\u2019t have an effect in 2023 anyway. So we will see how it plays and if we see evidence of stronger rental growth and my bet would be a surprise on the upside of our assumptions, not the other way around, then we will let you know and you can adjust the numbers accordingly. Tim? Tim Arndt : Yeah. Just building on that, Michael, if you, within the supplemental, you can see our lease expiration schedule. Out of that, you will see we have about 13% rolling and that\u2019s a mix of what is stated as expiring, which is another 9%, but also things that we have already addressed ahead of entering the year here. So the footnotes will tell you that. You get to 13% there. SME said, start with the 67% lease mark-to-market. You have got 10% market rent growth for the year. You assume we will get that halfway through the year. One thing we see people get wrong is that will take you to a certain amount of rent change. You actually get half that rent change this year, you get half of 2022\u2019s rent change as well. There is a mathematic thing that you need to be mindful of given the quantum of rent change we are talking about lately. That will all get you to close to 9% and then we backed off an assumption on occupancy loss, which we couldn\u2019t point to right now, but just feels prudent in the environment, so we have taken our guidance down there a bit. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please state your question. Vince Tibone : Hi. Good morning. How should we think about the organic same-store NOI growth for the legacy Duke portfolio in 2023, given them that\u2019s outside of guidance? Is it lower than guidance for the legacy PLD portfolio in the same ballpark, just given the thought that you do any color you could share would be helpful? Hamid Moghadam : Well, it will be lower for one reason anyway, which is that they started at a higher level of occupancy. So putting even rent aside on a same-store basis there\u2019s less opportunity. They generally had longer term leases because they generally have bigger spaces. So that affects the mix, but Tim? Tim Arndt : Well, I think, an important thing to remember here and we have seen some people not have this entirely correct modeling is just understanding that on a GAAP basis there will be very little same-store. There\u2019s potential for some, but because we mark the leases up to market now at the close on a net effective basis there will be very little same-store growth, that\u2019s contemplated in our guidance. On a cash basis, I expect it would look quite similar to Prologis. Vince Tibone : That\u2019s really helpful. Hamid Moghadam : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from... Hamid Moghadam : By the way, if I can continue that. One thing that you didn\u2019t ask, but it\u2019s important in this context, and Dan can elaborate, is that the rental performance of the Duke portfolio on the few spaces that have come up for releasing or were in progress during the time we were doing the transaction are trending significantly higher than what we had underwritten. Dan, can you quantify that? Dan Letter : Yeah. I actually go as far as saying we expect to outperform the operating portfolio to 11% to 13%, call it, now 8% of that is going to come from market rent growth, so really 3% to 5% of that comes from just operating that portfolio in the Prologis platform. Operator : Next question comes from Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Please state your question. Tom Catherwood : Thanks. Tim, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that the outlook for 2023 assumes a recession and if we look back to previous recessionary cycles, usually we get declines in consumption, which drives lower demand for industrial space. But we have also never started a cycle with kind of persistently low vacancy like we have right now or tailwinds from e-commerce and supply gain reconfiguration. So kind of within that backdrop of assuming a recession, how do you think it could be different this time and kind of what do you have baked into your numbers for that for 2023? Hamid Moghadam : So given that Tim was in kindergarten when cycle started, Tim and I are a little bit different than our recession outlook, but I don\u2019t think it matters. I think Tim would tell you that if there\u2019s a recession, there\u2019s a very mild recession and my bet would be that we wouldn\u2019t have a recession, but it would be close to zero GDP growth for a while. So call it recession or no recession, but the same outcome. I think what\u2019s different about other cycles and I say that with a lot of dislike for the phrase that\u2019s different this time is that, there were really two situations where we had negative absorption in the U.S., which is where we have data. One was on the hill of dotcom and there you had a high vacancy rate. On top of it, you had a very low utilization rate because there was a lot of capital for these dotcom, particularly e-commerce retailers and they were taking space way ahead of demand, so there was a lot of shadow space too. So when you add those two, it was a very, very high vacancy type of market during that time, so 2000, 2001 timeframe. The next time you had a pretty significant negative absorption with 2008, 2009, and we all know the reasons for that. And there, you also started with a significantly higher vacancy rate. I think it was 7% or 8% before the music stopped and all I can tell you is that, Prologis -- the old Prologis with the funny LA loan [ph] had 52 million square feet of vacant spec space that they had to lease. I think AMD at the time have like 8 million square feet or 9 million square feet. So nothing like you are talking about here, particularly given the different scale of the company and how lease we are starting out. Now even in that situation where we are normally at about 95% occupancy, we went down to about 91% in both cases. So I don\u2019t see anything near that. I mean it\u2019s mathematically impossible. Even if absorption goes to zero right now, we don\u2019t lease any more of the under development spec space and absorption goes to zero, I mean, you will be under 5% vacancy, which used to be considered a great strong market. And the capital up, we didn\u2019t have this kind of mark-to-market. I mean the mark-to-markets in those days were in the mid single-digit range and now we are talking about 70% almost. So a very different picture. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc. Please state your question. Todd Thomas : Yeah. Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I just had a question about market rents actually, so the 10% market rent forecast in the U.S. Can you just discuss that or break it out a little bit for us in terms of coastal versus non-coastal in terms of your expectations just in the context of supply growth that you are seeing and the demand backdrop in general? Chris Caton : Yeah. Hey. It\u2019s Chris Caton. So indeed we expect 10% in the U.S. that\u2019s going to vary. Typical spread between coastal, non-coastal is 300 basis points to 500 basis points, at least that\u2019s where it was running, say, pre-pandemic and we expect a wider spread in the current environment. So whether you look at vacancy, whether you look at the under construction pipeline, whether you look at the momentum in pricing in the back half of last year including fourth quarter that leads you to conclude on the coastal outperformance continuing at a greater than historical average in 2023. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question. Ronald Kamdem : Hey. I just want to go back to some of the comments on the third-party management. I think you talked about valuations being down 7% in the back half of last year and potentially continuing into this year and the redemptions potentially ending in the first two quarters of the year. I just want to get a sense, any more color how are you thinking about that, is it because the valuations have been repriced that you expect sort of the redemptions to stop? What should we be looking for to get more confidence in that? Thanks. Hamid Moghadam : Yeah. There are two things that usually drive redemption requests. One is sort of the denominator effect and people needing and two is some folks want to arbitrage the lag between the -- how quickly the public markets adjust and the backward looking appraisal process. In our experience in past downturns, the second has taken about three quarters to be fully reflected in appraisals. So we really don\u2019t want to disadvantage one group of investors. By the way, the vast majority of our investors, 95% of them, because a couple of points of people want to arbitrage that difference, so we want to make sure the valuations are right before those things transact. We think Europe has actually adjusted quicker than the U.S. and that\u2019s why we think there\u2019s maybe another quarter to go before Europe fully adjust. So we are committed to taking care of those redemptions in the next quarter. And we think the U.S. may take another quarter to adjust and we will take care of those in the second quarter. Here is what\u2019s important and people don\u2019t get about the structure of our funds. First of all, our leverage is in the low 20% range on these funds. So there\u2019s oodles of liquidity in these firms to basically be able to handle any redemption requests -- any reasonable redemption request. And secondly, we started with the Q and we started with some cash on hand. So, again, there are lots of sources for addressing those redemption requests. I think you should assume that redemptions that have been effective as of the end of this quarter will, by and large, be taken care of by the middle of the year and sooner in Europe. So you can model that math beyond that. Now I will tell you one other thing, which is kind of interesting. Prologis could be a buyer up in these fronts, and in fact, even in the global financial crisis, where the old AMB was in a tighter spot with respect to leverage, we actually stepped up and bought on very attractive terms with adjusted values, a couple of hundred million dollars of real estate and we actually offered it to our outside investors first and then we stepped in and bought it. And you know what, the next quarter, all the redemptions went away, because people realized that the people who know the most about this portfolio are buyers at these prices. So it\u2019s really about getting the values, right? And we started writing down these portfolios a quarter or two ago and our appraisal process is independent. We have nothing to do about it and that\u2019s very, very different than some of the redemption situations that we have all been reading about. Operator : Thanks. Our next question comes from Camille Bonnel with Bank of America. Please state your question. Camille Bonnel : Hi. Good morning. On your development guidance, can you give us some color on how much conservatism is built into your development starts? And also you are expecting another year of strong stabilization, what assumptions are you making in terms of timing of these projects and is any of the increase in guidance driven by projects from last year taking longer to complete due to longer construction time lines? Dan Letter : This is Dan. Let me start with this year\u2019s development start guidance. We are coming off our largest year of starts ever, and just given the macro headlines, we decided to take a little bit more balanced approach where we slowed our starts at the end of last year. We don\u2019t expect to start up in earnest until the last half of this year. We think the build-to-suit business will pick up at the same time. So call it conservatism, I call it discipline and just feel really good about our approach, given the volumes over the last year or two. And then stabilization next year, stabilization this year, Tim mentioned it earlier, we think we can outperform. What we have in the books right now, demand continues to be strong. We talked about the development starts plummeting in the marketplace in the fourth quarter. We think they are going to be slower in the first half of the year and we think that bodes well for absorption in the last half of this year into next year. So we feel very good about our guidance. Hamid Moghadam : Yeah. There has not been a material delay in any of our construction project, if you look at them on an aggregated basis. So that is not -- that has not shifted stabilizations from 2022 to 2023 or anything like that. Yeah, I can\u2019t even think of an example that comes close. And even on the cost side, because we have been thoughtful about procurement and securing some of these type supplies ahead of time. That\u2019s been actually something that we use as a competitive advantage in marketing to build-to-suits, because we have got a bunch of steel and we have got a bunch of air conditioning units and electric panels and things that are insured supply are already sitting in our warehouse waiting to be deployed into our land bank. So no, there\u2019s nothing funny going on about that, and by the way, the stabilizations are not just a function of completion of construction, but also leasing being stabilized at 90% or more and that factor hasn\u2019t delayed stabilizations either. We have been leasing actually ahead of plan to this day and I think we will -- I expect to continue to do that. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please state your question. John Kim : Thank you. On the subject of fund redemptions, there are some unlisted funds or non-traded REITs with a different leverage profile than yours, different investor base that are seeing a significant amount of redemption requests and I was wondering if you anticipate this will lead to increased asset sales on the block and potentially some more opportunities for you on the acquisition side? Hamid Moghadam : I hope it does. I am not optimistic that it will, because if you look at even the denominator problem for most institutions and the fact that they generally have to reduce their exposure to real estate, they are likely not going to want to reduce their exposure to industrial. So I think and with these -- most of the open-end funds, where it would be -- where their mix, they are different property types, the industrial is what\u2019s holding up their performance. So for them to disclose those would put them in even a more difficult situation. So I don\u2019t think there will be a lot of for sellers in industrial, because to the extent that you are dealing with a leverage issue or a liquidity issue, if you sell your highest yielding assets, you keep tightening the coverage and noose around your neck. So as much as I\u2019d like to, I don\u2019t think we will see a lot of that. I think where we could see opportunity is actually within our own open-end fund availabilities. If the redemptions continue and we think the values are good, first, we will offer that to all the third-party investors and then we will step in them buy and we like that real estate. We know it well, and we operate it, and if it\u2019s priced right, we are all buyers, no problem. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC. Please state your question. Michael Carroll : Yeah. Thanks. I guess, Hamid, I understand that PLD in the industrial space in general are pretty well positioned in the current environment despite the uncertainty, but is there anything that you are watching out for any specific risks that you foresee for this space here in the next year plus or so? Hamid Moghadam : Yeah. We are watching everything really carefully. I mean I am not -- believe me, we have been through enough cycles and enough where things can happen that none of us predict that we want to be vigilant. That\u2019s why we are starting out the year with very conservative assumptions and things that we can deliver. I mean, I think even on this basis, we are going to, I think, put up unbelievably good numbers. I mean, who can think of almost a digit kind of returns or growth off of such strong growth, 14% per year earnings growth consistently for the last three years. So I think the arrow is up. But, yeah, I mean nobody predicted Putin going into Europe last year. It\u2019s usually the stuff that you don\u2019t -- you can\u2019t predict. I mean, am I worried about inflation really thanking our numbers? No. Am I really worried about recession thanking our numbers? No. Am I worried about e-commerce going out the window and people going back to shopping deals the way without that percentage going up? No, I am not worried about those things. But I am worried about things that I don\u2019t even know what to worry about. You get my drip there, anyway. So, yeah, there\u2019s always bad stuff that can happen that are out of the realm of normal projections. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please state your question. Mike Mueller : Yeah. Hi. What are the anticipated yields for your 2023 development starts? Dan Letter : Anticipated -- this is Dan. The anticipated yields are actually up slightly, but still in the low 6s, 6.1-ish, 6.2-ish. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please state your question. Anthony Powell : Hi. Good morning. Question on utilization, which increased in the quarter, what drove that growth given all the headlines we see about port volumes were not declining and how big of a driver of the higher utilization is for your outlook for this year given the strong outlook this year? Hamid Moghadam : Yeah. I don\u2019t think utilization actually moved that much. I mean the peak utilization ever all time was 87%. And I think that 1 point is well within the sampling bias that can take place, because it\u2019s not a perfect data set. It\u2019s a sample of large data sets. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a meaningful trend in certainly not a decelerating trend in utilization. With respect to port volumes, I think, port volumes are pretty meaningless in the last -- really since COVID started, because there were so many fits and starts and play things being in the wrong place and all that. And yeah, the West Coast ports have lower volumes today than they did before, but the East Coast and golf ports are getting a lot more volume than they did before. So on an aggregate basis, port volumes are just fine and if you look at the lag that it takes too many empty containers on one side of the ocean, and factories shutting down on the other side of the ocean and all that. I think until the market normalizes, you can\u2019t really draw any conclusions from port volumes. So I don\u2019t see either one of those two trends affecting demand. Chris, do you want to? Chris Caton : Yeah. I will just build on that by saying two things are also happening. One is market vacancies in the U.S. are 3.2%, 3.3% lower in Europe. That, in its own right creates some pent-up demand and so there\u2019s a need to push utilization within the facilities. And then second, look, inventories are up 15% on a year-on-year basis -- on a nominal basis and 9%, 10% on a real basis. So there is real structural demand, lifting new demand, as well as in-place customers. Hamid Moghadam : Yeah. Notwithstanding that increase in real inventories, we still think we are less than halfway towards equilibrium level of inventories about 45% of the way there. So we think there\u2019s a lot of tailwind behind inventories, too. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Please state your question. Blaine Heck : Great. Thanks. So related to that last question, and Hamid, your comments on that progress towards equilibrium inventory, can you just talk about your recent conversations with customers? What\u2019s your sense for how they are balancing this investment need and CapEx spend against concerns about the economic slowdown or recession and higher overall cost of capital? Hamid Moghadam : Yeah. I will pitch it to Mike for more detailed comments on this. So my sense is that customers are -- don\u2019t have quite as much fomo as they did before. In other words, they are not in the hard mentality of let\u2019s go get this place, because if we don\u2019t, somebody else will and all that. I think the market has rationalized with respect to pace of leasing demand and people are being more thoughtful about how they go about their thinking space, because forget about what they pay us in rent. I mean every time you open a new large warehouse, there\u2019s a lot of CapEx that goes into it and all that, real estate is the least of your worries. It\u2019s all the other stuff that you have to put in. So I think people are cautious, but they also realize, particularly on the e-comm side that this was a theoretical threat before the COVID. Now they see what really happened to their business during COVID. So they are very anxious to build out their full e-commerce supply chain, which is oftentimes a different one than their bricks-and-mortar supply chain. So I would say, demand has broadened, it\u2019s much less all about Amazon, it\u2019s much broader than that. But it\u2019s pretty strong. Is it the strongest it\u2019s ever been? No, it\u2019s not as strong as 2021. But compared to any 10-year period you want to look at, it\u2019s -- we would consider this a very strong market. Mike? Mike Curless : Yeah. I would just to pile on. I mean, on a net basis, the activity is still very strong, decision time line is definitely have stretched out of people to be more cautious. But remember, these structural configurations we have been talking about for two year or three years continue to march on, perhaps, at a bit of a slower rate, but ultimately, it comes down to the fear of not having the right space when you needed to hear from now is overwriting, taking space that\u2019s a little bit too early. So broadly we feel pretty good about this overall activity. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Craig Mailman with Citi. Please state your question. Craig Mailman : Hey, guys. I just want to follow up on these demand discussions, because this is a constant question I get from clients here and maybe it\u2019s more of a Chris question, but Hamid feel free to jump in, too. Just in terms of in these era of low vacancies were really not in the least, so net absorption is not necessarily the best leading indicator of demand. I mean what are you guys using at least to kind of use as your forward-looking indicator on and destruction or something that the market could look to, because it just seems like retentions are still high, availability is low, construction could fall off, but everyone is talking about inventories big higher, utilization will be higher, so people needing less of the space, but it\u2019s just from your commentary, it seems like this is not really filtering through what you guys are seeing and just some thoughts there. Then related to that, Chris, I mean, what would it take for market rents to actually turn negative, because that\u2019s a question I get a lot as well and I am just kind of curious in your modeling kind of what inputs with that to really turn to get that from the positive 10% you are seeing to somewhere below zero? Hamid Moghadam : Okay. Let me start. I am sure Chris can give much more color. I would state this, in 40 years ago on this, this is the biggest disconnect that I have seen between the macro economy and the prospects for our business. Usually, those things -- two things are much more aligned and this time around, they just appear to be completely disconnected for a variety of reasons that we talked about at nauseam. So I think where pricing goes away is, vacancy is going to 7% to 8% and staying there. And if you do the math on that, you need another in the U.S., I don\u2019t know, 2 billion, 3 billion square feet of unleased construction coming online and you can\u2019t do it overnight, maybe 1 billion something median. We can do the math. But it\u2019s a big number and you are not going to keep doing that if space that -- if the first 100 million feet doesn\u2019t lease, you are not going to do that. And by the way, this cycle, you have a couple of big players in the business that have much more to gain from the fundamentals of the business being stronger, rents being stronger than a few bucks they may make on additional development. So there is an economic incentive to be disciplined. In prior cycles, mostly driven by merchant builders and private developers, they don\u2019t really care what their rental market was. They just wanted to build the product and sell to somebody else and that will be their problem. Today, those two sites are connected to one another. So I think that the motivations are really different and absent the nuclear work type of scenario. I just don\u2019t see vacancy rates going to a level that will lead to a reduction in rents. It\u2019s either going to be a demand collapse or a supply explosion and I don\u2019t see either one of them happening. The other thing I would say is that we are -- we leased 1 million square feet on a daily basis. Just -- let\u2019s get our heads around that, 1 million square feet on a daily basis. We throw these big numbers around without really fully appreciating what the scale of that is. I mean that is 10x the amount of space than anybody else in leases in any sector in real estate. So by watching these customers and their behavior, obviously, we will figure out if some back stuff is about to happen and won\u2019t be waiting for the quarterly report to analyze that. So, Chris, do you have specifics? Chris Caton : Yeah. A couple of specifics, I would lead with our proprietary data leads us to these conclusions. So for example, our sales force pipeline, if we look at the vacancy that we do have, 46% has deals working. That\u2019s in line or above the average that we have experienced through COVID to say nothing of the conversations that Mike and Scott and our customer led solutions team have. In terms of public data, which I think I heard you ask about, Craig. We do publish our IBI survey and our utilization data and so figures like 60, on our IVI, it\u2019s a diffusion index. So that\u2019s consistent with this good or great tone that the team has struck and 86% on utilization, which was discussed earlier are ways that you can see that in the marketplace. And then as it relates to what it would take for rents to fall, Hamid described it very specifically. And I\u2019d add one piece of data that, I don\u2019t see commonly discussed in the marketplace, but it\u2019s important to know, which is development starts rather than development completions. Starts in the U.S. were off by a third in the fourth quarter relative to their 2022 trend and on the Continental Europe, they were off by 45%. So we are seeing a sharp marking to market at the capital market environment, the valuation environment and what those buildings might be worth for some of those other folks building buildings. Hamid Moghadam : By the way, banks are a lot more disciplined, because now they have risk-based capital requirements. So putting out a lot of construction loans on buildings that don\u2019t lease like used to happen in prior cycles less likely to happen. So I think the market is generally smarter. There\u2019s a lot more data. Conversations like we are having today never used to take place two decades ago. So the cycles were much more amplified. I think it\u2019s pretty hard for that to happen. But something can come out of left field. I am not discounting that possibility. Something really bad to come out of left field and change all this, but I just can\u2019t think of what that thing would be. But none of us predicted the pandemic I don\u2019t think. So things can happen. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please state your question. Vince Tibone : Hi. Thanks for taking my follow-up. I just want to get any color on recent market rent growth and how that may differ between suite size, like are you seeing any differences in performance between bulk buildings and smaller more infill facilities? Hamid Moghadam : I would generally tell you that the smaller spaces are having a tougher time to the extent of anybody having a tougher time, but Chris is looking up the specific. They are not radically different, but why don\u2019t we do this, why don\u2019t we go to the next -- you got it. Chris Caton : Okay. Hamid Moghadam : Yeah. Chris Caton : Right. No. Glad to help you out here. First off, market rent growth had great momentum at the end of the year with 5% growth in the U.S., 3% in Europe. When we look at rent change, which is a great way to understand performance in suite size, it\u2019s strong across the board. But in fact, late in the year, we saw an improvement in those smaller units, when -- which might be where you are your question is coming from, so it\u2026 Hamid Moghadam : Oh! Yeah. Chris Caton : \u2026adverse. Hamid Moghadam : Okay. That\u2019s different than I would have guessed and I bet you it\u2019s because there was more available space to absorb in those categories. Those categories were less leased. And by the way, we have them, too. I mean we have some smaller than 100,000 square foot unit. So I would say, occupancy was a little bit lower, so there was more room to lease product at the higher end. Chris Caton : If we flip it to submarkets and we look at, say, infill which tend to have those smaller units, infill outperformed in the U.S. by 500 -- 400 basis points last year, so say, 34% and in the U.S. in the infill submarkets versus 30% for the whole of the United States. Operator : And our next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please state your question. Jamie Feldman : Great. Thank you. Just a quick follow-up from Blaine and myself. So where do you expect to make the most progress on the Essentials business in 2023 and how does that factor into your guidance and earnings? And then also if you could just say where you think cap rates are today versus the peak of the cycle, how much they have moved? Thank you. Hamid Moghadam : So two things. I think the Essentials business, in terms of percentage growth, I think, our mobility business would be the biggest, because it\u2019s the smallest right now to start with. So any growth will be the biggest. But in terms of dollar contribution, I would say, solar and storage are coming on the strongest today and operations is to close second behind. I will pitch it to Gary if he has any more to say about that after this. Second part of the question was -- oh, cap rate. So cap rates are really misleading. So we got to be careful about that. Cap rates at market, assuming that you had a building a year and a half ago at market and you have a building at market today, I would guess it\u2019s 50 basis points to 75 basis points maybe 100 basis points, okay? It\u2019s -- call it, 50 basis points to 100 basis points. But you have had all this rental growth in between. So the observed cap rates for the same building this year versus last year with rents that are higher by, I don\u2019t know, 10%, 15% or something, would not have moved as much. So, and if you get into weird situations, like some building that was leased five years ago when it comes on the market and it\u2019s -- and the in-place rent is less than half of what market is, that building could have a lower cap rate than it would have had a year ago. IRR is what\u2019s really important based on reasonable assumptions and my guess is that if I were going to pick a number, I would say, low to -- low 7, 7.25-ish in the U.S. and maybe a little bit lower than that in Europe with growth of, say, 4%-ish percent across a 10-year projection, something like that, approximately. Gary, anything on. Gary Anderson : I think you got it exactly Hamid. I mean to say, in 2023, our mix is going to be about 50% operations and about 50% energy and mobility. The growth rate, obviously, mobility is going to be much higher because it\u2019s coming off of basically a zero base. Where are we investing? We are investing in our energy and mobility businesses. And that\u2019s where we are doing the capability, because actually see the most significant growth of 2025 and beyond. But I mean, just to put a set of stake in this, we are very, very convicted about the potential for these businesses. We are on track to generate our $300 million in revenues and tax benefits by 2025, which we have talked about before and that is going to deliver about $0.25 per share in FFO. And that would be a little bit above our -- that will be about 100 basis points of growth per year compared to our 2019 Investor Day estimates of about 50 basis points. So net-net, look, we are in great shape, that business is growing right on plan and we are going to continue to make investments in that business and this year it\u2019s going to be in mobility and energy. Hamid Moghadam : By the way, that 2025 number that Gary just mentioned, it\u2019s going to be recapturing maybe 15%, 20% of the total opportunity within our portfolio. So there will be a huge runway for growth, and frankly, we are beginning to see more deals out of our own platform, because customers are taking us to buildings that they lease from other people to do the same level of service to them in those other situations. So I can\u2019t even begin to quantify that out of platform opportunities. So we are really excited about our Essentials business. Okay. Jamie Feldman : Thanks. Hamid Moghadam : I think we are at the top of the hour. I know we have one more question, but maybe we can take that outside the call, Anthony, with our apologies. But thank you for your interest in the company and we look forward to seeing you next quarter. Take care. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a great day.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce to you Jill Sawyer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Jill. You may begin. Jill Sawyer : Thanks, Sean. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates, as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or other SEC filings. Additionally, our fourth quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures and in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. I'd like to welcome Tim Arndt, our CFO, who will cover results, real-time market conditions and guidance. Hamid Moghadam, our CEO and our entire executive team are also with us today. With that I hand the call over to Tim. Tim Arndt : Thanks, Jill. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. We began the year with results and conditions that remained strong. Market rents have continued to grow, demand has been consistent and we're seeing sharp declines in new construction limiting future supply. While logistics real estate is very healthy, the macroeconomic picture continues to be a concern and we anticipate it could weigh on customer sentiment over the balance of the year translate into some demand that could be delayed into 2024. However, this will overlap with a slowdown of new deliveries, creating a sustained dynamic for high occupancy and continued rent growth into next year. Beginning with our results, our core FFO excluding promotes was $1.23 per share and including promotes was $1.22 per share. Our results benefited from higher NOI in the quarter but offset by approximately $0.02 of higher insurance expense from an unusually active storm season experiencing a year's worth of claims activity in just the first quarter. In terms of our operating results, both ending and average occupancy for the quarter were 98%, holding average occupancy flat for the fourth quarter. Rent change was 69% on a net effective basis and 42% on a cash basis each a record. The unusually wide spread between the two is reflective of lower free rent and higher escalations in our new leasing. Despite the step-up of in-place rents, our lease mark-to-market expanded to 68% during the quarter as market rent growth remained strong and slightly ahead of expectations. With the remaining lease term of roughly four years, this lease mark-to-market represents over $2.85 per share of incremental earnings as our leases roll the market, providing visibility to future income and dividend growth. These results drove record same-store growth 9.9% on a net effective basis and 11.4% on a cash basis. During the quarter, our efforts on the balance sheet were focused on liquidity, raising over $3.6 billion in new financings for Prologis and our ventures at an interest rate of 4.6% and a term of nearly 14 years. This fundraising total does not include $1 billion of additional capacity from a recast of our global line-of-credit, which closed in April, and brings our total borrowing potential under our lines to $6.5 billion. As mentioned, fundamentals in our markets remain strong, but we expect that a more cautious outlook will weigh on the pace of demand. This is not a new perspective as our forecast 90 days ago prepared for a weakening sentiment and how the top-down view for some occupancy loss over the year. We haven't changed that outlook, but we also haven't upgraded it despite the quarter's outperformance. As an update on proprietary metrics, our proposal activity ticked up in absolute terms and is in line with strong market conditions as a percent of available space. Approximately 99% of the units across our 1.2 billion square feet are either leased or in negotiation. Utilization ticked down to 85%, which is normalizing to a level that our customers view as optimal. E-commerce leasing increased during the quarter to 19% of all new leasing. We avoid drawing conclusions from a single quarter of activity on most metrics, but it's notable here, that e-commerce leasing picked up meaningfully back towards its five-year average. As we've said before, we ultimately look at retention, pre-leasing and rent achievement as the best real-time metrics of portfolio health, and on that basis, our results are certainly very strong. We expect that the current 3.5% vacancy rate in our US markets will build to the low 4s toward the end of the year, before turning back to the mid-3s by late 2024, due to the lack of incoming supply and accounting for moderating demand. We anticipate a similar path in our European markets, and of course, even a 5% vacancy rate is historically excellent and supportive of strong rental growth. We expect this pattern to play out in our true months of supply metric, which was a very healthy 30 months in the US and should decline into the 20s next year. We are launching markets that have large development pipelines such as a few in the Sunbelt in the US, but so far that supply also seems manageable. In Europe, most of our focus is on the UK, where development starts have continued even as demand has moderated, which will lift market vacancies and may pressure rents. And Japan is also a market which is expected to see larger increases in vacancy over the year, but similarly, expects a slowdown in new supply due to surges in land and construction costs. Taking all of these movements into account, we are holding our market rent growth forecast for the year at 10% in the US and 9% globally. In capital markets, transactions continue to be few and far between, but the pickup in activity suggests, we will see a busier second quarter. Appraised values in our funds declined 1% in the US and 2% in Europe during the quarter and 8% and 18% respectively from the peak. It's worth noting that our view of public market prices and NAVs that they have adjusted much more than is warranted for these levels of write-down. Redemption requests and our open-ended funds have slowed significantly with the redemption queue nearly unchanged around 5% of net asset value. This is reflective of both a slower pace of new redemptions as well as rescissions of prior requests. Combined with over $150 million of new commitments made our net queue is essentially unchanged from last year. Last quarter, we described our approach to fulfilling redemption requests, which is based on an overarching objective to be consistent and fair to all investors, requiring a few quarters for valuers to catch up. In that regard, as appraisal seem to be nearing fair value, we plan to redeem units in this quarter, given the swift response to value changes in Europe and expect to do the same in USLF next quarter. In turn, we view this as an excellent time to invest more of our capital into the vehicles, which we'll be doing over the coming quarters and some meaningful numbers. Turning to guidance. We are tightening and increasing average occupancy to range between 97.25% and 97.75%, a 25 basis point increase at the midpoint. Our same-store will benefit from this increase driving our net effective guidance to a range of 8.5% to 9.25%, and cash same-store of 9% to 9.75%. We are forecasting our lease mark-to-market to end the year close to 70%. Extracting the 2024 component of this suggests rent change should exceed 85% next year, even without continued market rent growth, which is a clear illustration of how our exceptional rent change will not only endure but continue to grow. We expect G&A to range between $380 million and $390 million and strategic capital revenues excluding promotes to range between $515 million and $530 million. We are maintaining our forecast for net promote income of $380 million, and given the size of USLF and the potential for small changes in value to have a meaningful impact, there is potential for upside here and we believe we have the downside covered. We had few development starts in the quarter, a reflection of our discipline, but our pipeline is deep and we are maintaining our guidance of $2.5 billion to $3 billion for the year. We expect the pace to remain slow in the second quarter, putting the bulk of the activity into the second half. It's noteworthy that following the belief that construction costs may decline in the coming quarters. We now see them as likely to increase mostly in line with inflation. As new fundraising has become visible, we forecast contributions to be concentrated in the second half totaling $2 billion to $3 billion when combined with forecasted dispositions. So in total, we expect GAAP earnings to range between $3.10 per share and $3.25 per share. We are increasing our core FFO including promotes guidance to a range of $5.42 per share to $5.50 per share, and further, we are guiding core FFO excluding promotes to range between $5.02 per share and $5.10 per share, with the midpoint representing 10% growth over 2022. I'd like to close with a few observations that we've made about our standing in the equity markets, which we found interesting and wanted to share. Today, we sit as the 68th largest company in the S&P 500 ahead of names like GE, American Express, Cigna, Citigroup, as well as Ford and GM combined. Also of notice that with our planned $3.3 billion of dividends this year, we ranked 42nd in terms of total cash return to investors. Of these top 42 dividend payers, Prologis has outgrown the group by 500 basis points per year over the last three years. And in fact, since our IPO, we have paid over $15 billion in dividends at a 15% CAGR, ranking 13th on growth in the entire S&P 100. While getting bigger has never been our objective, we thought the context would be eye-opening. So in closing, we feel great about the health of our business, even in the face of a slowing economy, most importantly, nothing we have seen alters the path of its underlying secular drivers for the long-term potential of our platform. In that regard, we're excited to tell you much more about that outlook and our platform later in the year. Last week, we announced our upcoming Investor Day to be held at the New York Stock Exchange this December. We hope to see many of you there in person and tuned into the live webcast, where we will showcase our deep bench of talents and the strong differentiators that define our company. More details on that to come. But with that I'll hand it back to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Caitlin Burrows : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Maybe on development. Tim, you touched on it briefly, but the earnings release mentions how the build-out of your land bank is a driver of growth, and this quarter, like you mentioned starts for only like $50 million versus recent quarters over a billion. And it sounds like that is expected to ramp up significantly to over a billion again in the second half. So just wondering what metrics or other things that you're looking at to drive the starts activity? And what makes you confident that increasing starts so significantly later this year is kind of possible and the right thing to do? Dan Letter : Hi, Caitlin. This is Dan. I'll take a stab at that. Maybe Tim can pile on then. But first of all, let me just say, our teams are very much on the offense out there. Every day our teams around the globe looking at new opportunities. We have over $38 billion of potential TEI embedded in our land bank, and we could flip the switch tomorrow and start $10 billion if we wanted to. We're going to continue to look at these deals on a case-by-case basis, but when you see the overall volatility in the market, you see the 10-year move 50 basis points, 60 basis points on a weekly basis like we have, we're maintaining the discipline, and we're disciplined because we can be. And we're ramping-up our starts towards the end of the year, while we expect to see the overall marketplace ramp down. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Please proceed with your question. Ki Bin Kim : Thank you. Good morning. So net absorption across the US in the first quarter was a little bit lighter than what we've seen in recent memory. So I was just curious what kind of risk do you see to occupancy or rent growth as a sector tries to in the near term absorb the new supply coming through? Hamid Moghadam : Hi, Ki Bin. This is Hamid. There's always a risk in this environment. I mean there's so many unknowables, but we've gotten spoiled to 350 million square feet of demand in the last couple of years. Let's just put this in a context. I mean in the past, we would have been very happy with even these lower levels of absorption, particularly when you consider that starts are way down and they're going to -- deliveries are going to really slow down as we go into 2024. So it's normalizing. That's the best way I can describe, but I wouldn't even be surprised if it falls further given all the stuff that we read in the papers. The CEOs that are making big CapEx decisions, basically push their people to see if they can start the week -- a quarter later or two quarters later. But that's all borrow demand, if you will, that is future demand that is getting deferred. So we're not that excited by one way or another. And just to finish the previous question that Dan started, our view, we don't have a forecast for development starts. We only have one because you guys asked us for one. We don't internally have one. We have a plan. We have entitlements on much of that land, about 80% of that land, we can start at any time. And we don't just look at our data at the end-of-the quarter. We see it every day as we lease a million square feet a day, so we can meter that development into the marketplace, as we see fit and make those adjustments. We're ready to go if we need to do more or less either way. At the end of the day, our company's story is about organic growth, and that's the high value form of growth and that's the one that we pay the most attention to, and actually, that's easier to figure out in this environment, given the very big mark-to-market which I've never seen in this business before. So in a way, our job is actually easier in terms of predictability of earnings and growth. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. Steve Sakwa : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to focus a little bit on the acquisitions, which is not a very large number in there, Hamid, but I'm just wondering what you're seeing from a distressed opportunity said, and then maybe tie into the comments Tim made about the funds and you know you tend to like you'd be putting more money into the funds as you redeem some of the partners. So just trying to put tie those two I guess capital uses together. Hamid Moghadam : Sure. I think there is very little distress in the marketplace. Industrial real estate has done really well. I assume other people have significant mark-to-market, although I doubt if there -- it's quite the same level as ours. But there is protection in terms of that mark-to-market and other portfolios, and there are no fore sellers because leverage in the industry is pretty low. So we're not looking for distressed opportunities, but we are looking for opportunities that reflect the increasing cost of capital compared to call it a year, year and a half ago. And you should know, we look at every deal that anybody does and reads in the papers. Not hard to figure out that if you want to sell something, you call Prologis. So, you know, our feeling is people are still stuck on the old values, and buyers are expecting a substantial discount for those values. I suspect that most of those numbers will move closer together in the next couple of quarters and the market will start transacting. The funds have always been a place where we either take capital out or put capital in, and depending on the cycle of the marketplace. And back even in the global financial crisis, when AMB was much smaller and the balance sheet was weaker, we stepped in and put a couple hundred million dollars in our funds, when I thought -- when we thought that the time was right. So we continue to do the same thing. I don't think it's a big deal one way or another, but it's a great place to buy a high quality real estate that we know and we like. So that's the way we think about it. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Blaine Heck : Great. Thanks. Good morning out there. Can you talk about demand related to near-shoring or on-shoring? Which markets are seeing an outsized impact related to the trend and maybe how Prologis is positioned to benefit from it? Hamid Moghadam : Sure. Let me start and then I'll pitch it over to Chris. The biggest impact is on Northern Mexico. Those markets along the border are literally on fire. There is no vacancy and we're seeing a lot of near shoring happening there as sort of a diversification move. We're also seeing some of the China manufacturing bleed out to the rest of Southeast Asia, but we're not really active in those smaller markets, but we do see that. And it's moving west in China and it's moving to other areas in Southeast Asia. But Mexico is the big story here. The on-shoring part, I mean, honestly, other than what I read in the papers, and the chip business which is real, the rest of it is wishful thinking mostly. So they're very isolated examples, but you look at the numbers and they are not that significant. Chris, do you want to add to that? Chris Caton : Sure. I think that's really well described. Blaine, I'd say there isn't great data on this, but that which we see is that it is a building trend in Northern Mexico. So it takes time for those supply chains to relocate instead of the ecosystems they need to really function properly and resiliently. And that is happening and will continue to happen, so I would expect it to grow in the coming years as well. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from the line of Craig Mailman with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Craig Mailman : Thank you. Maybe just a clarification and a follow-up question. Tim, I think in your prepared remarks, you said that the mark-to-market could end this year by 70% and be 85% by the end of next year in the absence of rent growth. So maybe clarify that if I misheard it. And then second question, just as you guys are seeing conditions on the ground, clearly, we saw some of the numbers you guys discussed it normalize here in the first quarter, but could you just talk about maybe how we should think about the cadence or anything incremental, what tenants are saying so that we don't get surprised the next quarter or two with some of the fundamental numbers here coming through as supply does deliver in some of the markets that have had more in the pipeline, like L.A., Inland Empire, Dallas sort of market. So then just also, you guys maintained your 10% market rent growth. Has that shifted dramatically within markets where some may have weakened significantly while others have grown? Or is it pretty consistent across the border? I apologize. I know that was a lot at once. Hamid Moghadam : Nice try unpacking all that in one question. Tim Arndt : I guess I will address all three of those. So I'll start, Craig, and I'm glad you asked if there was confusion on the point. You're right that we said we will -- we believe we will see a 70% lease mark-to-market of the entire portfolio at the end of this year, after we roll leases over the course of the year and we have some continued rent growth build. What I was trying to highlight there was that, if you just take out the component of that, that is rolling in 2024, to see have a sense of how this rent change is going to endure, that slice of the 70% on its own is 85% without any more market rent growth in the next nine months. So that just gives you very clear visibility on how the rent change is going to stay high, how it's going to translate to the same-store growth. So that was the intention there. Hamid R. Moghadam: Yeah. Let me take the second part and I'll pitch it to Chris for the third part of the question. Look, you'll be surprised if we're surprised. So -- and we really worked hard at not being surprised. And the best indicator of what's happening is the ongoing leasing and proposals and all that stuff that we're involved and you guys don't really see directly other than at the end of the quarter. So I would say -- I would describe market conditions as very good to excellent. They are not exceptional like they were a year and a half or two years ago, but they are very good to excellent. The markets you mentioned LA and Inland Empire, not worried about those at all. I mean, those markets are in the one percentage -- one percentage to two percentage vacancy rate. When you get to Dallas and particularly South Dallas and some other markets like Atlanta, way down the South, et cetera, those markets through all the cycles have been prone to over-development and softening of demand when a business was down. So we're watching those very carefully, but I wouldn't characterize any of them as watchlist markets now, otherwise, we would have classified them as such. The 10% rental growth is an overall number, but there is a very wide dispersion around that 10%. And Chris, do you want to elaborate on that? Chris Caton : Yeah, indeed, there is a wide dispersion. And we've been a customer over the years talking about outperformance on the coast and lower growth and lower barrier markets. Historically, that outperformance has averaged 250 basis points to 500 basis points on -- in any given year. This year, that 10% sees more at the lower end of that range, more like 200 basis point, 250 basis point outperformance on the coast versus the lower barrier markets. And so that is where we saw the resilience, and I would also point to other global markets outside the United States. We talked about Mexico on an earlier call. It's probably one of the hotter parts of the world from a logistics real estate perspective. We're also seeing resiliency in Toronto and Northern Europe, Germany and the Netherlands. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Derek Johnston : Hi, everybody, and good morning. The dislocation between public and private market logistic asset values obviously is weighing on possible M&A. But as Fed policy nears peak rates and currently projects a pause, do you see valuations converging between public and private assets, and secondly, thus a pickup in capital recycling? Hamid Moghadam : Yeah. I definitely do see a convergence over time, and private markets are always slow to adjust on the way up and on the way down because it's all backward looking appraisals and people look for comps. And -- but we don't really view the market that way and we view that disconnect as an opportunity because look, we have a very clear view of what the capital markets tell us in terms of the new cost of capital, and we're interested in deploying capital at above that new higher number. And private values are not yet there that's why we see some continued erosion on private values in the next quarter particularly in the United States. On the other hand, I think the public values are over-discounted and we see those actually picking up as there is more evidence in the private market that the world is not falling off the cliff. So I think you'll get a conversion from both sides and this is not at all unusual compared to past cycles. I would say every cycle gets a little better, but there is still a pretty significant disconnect. And of course, private values can be, whatever you want them to be if you're trying again to prove a point or trying to make a statement. So we are actually, our moat with appraisals -- appraisers that we work with is to continue to point them to the cost of capital as opposed to comps that don't exist. So we are on the other side of that argument. We're trying to get this market to get unlock and to transact and trying to get these appraisers to be realistic about their valuations. But I can tell you, based on conversations with them, they're getting a lot of pressure the other way from a lot of other people. So they find it somewhat unusual that we want to see a more aligned set of values that will unlock market and liquidity. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks for taking the questions. So just maybe going back to your comments about more unevenness or maybe just some upward pressure on vacancy across the US. Can you just sort of give us your latest view on -- you said not worried about SoCal, but how would you rank sort of SoCal across your other coastal markets today? And if there is a sort of additional or some softening that you may see, does the Duke acquisition sort of change the overall prospects for the PLD US portfolio? Hamid Moghadam : Well, I don't know for sure how to predict the direction of markets, but I can tell you, I don't lose any sleep over SoCal at all. I think that market is extremely tight and some of the shift in demand or softening of demand is to adjacent markets because the space just doesn't exist in Southern California. So if we had more space, I think we would have more absorption in Southern California as well. The Duke acquisition, as we've described many times, it's very aligned with our portfolio, so fundamentally doesn't change in any way our view on markets or desired allocation of our capital to those markets. It's very much aligned with the pre-merger Prologis portfolio. So the only thing I would tell you about Duke is that I -- generally speaking, based on the leases that we've done, since we acquired portfolio, we are kind of on the order of 4% to 5% higher than we thought we would be in terms of the performance of that portfolio. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. John Kim : Good morning. Tim, you mentioned the fund redemption requests were unchanged at 5% of NAV. Do you still expect the redemptions to go basically down to zero in the back half of the year in light of I think you mentioned weakening sentiment on tenant demand? Tim Arndt : Hey, John, we didn't hear any of that. Are you on a cell phone? And if you are, can you get closer to it or something because you were cutting in there? John Kim : Is that better? Tim Arndt : It's better. Yeah. John Kim : Okay. Sorry about that. Tim Arndt : So can you start all over? John Kim : Sure. You mentioned the fund redemption requests were unchanged, but I was wondering if you expect those redemptions to go down to zero in the back half of the year as previously stated in light of weakening demand that you're seeing on the tenant side. Tim Arndt : I don't know. I can't really predict the portfolio decisions of well over a couple of hundred different investors making those decisions differently. I would say to the extent that there is -- there are redemptions. They are generally not because of the performance of the real estate assets that are invested with us. They are either have to do with denominator issues on their other asset classes, private equity, stock bonds, et cetera, because everything has gotten hit with increased interest rates. Bonds have not been a safe place to be either. So it's because of them getting over allocated to real estate because of the decline in the value of the other asset classes more than real estate. And among real estate, if you want liquidity, where are you going to go? You're going to go to industrial. You're going to go to apartments, et cetera, et cetera. You're not going to go to office buildings because you're not going to be able to get any liquidity out of those. So that's what's driving all this. It doesn't -- I wouldn't look there for learning anything about what's going on with the industrial market because that's a reaction to a lot of different things that have nothing to do with industrial demand with supply. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed with your question. Vince Tibone : Hi. Good morning. Have you seen any material changes in tenant demand or industry-wide development starts activity since the banking crisis? And then on the latter point, has the availability of construction loans changed significantly in the last few months? Hamid Moghadam : I'm sorry the last part was the availability of loan. Tim Arndt : Constructions loan. Hamid Moghadam : Construction loan. The answer to that one is -- Vince Tibone : Construction loan. Hamid Moghadam : Yes, the answer to that one is absolutely, yes. I think there's been a significant pullback in the availability of construction loans. On the rest, I mean, what do you think? Tim Arndt : Yes, you were talking about customer demand. We're seeing broad-based customer demand really even looking at our e-commerce, we had 40 unique e-commerce users last quarter alone with Amazon actually being a small size of that very, very small. So overall, broad-based demand, no particular pockets of softness. Hamid Moghadam : I would say housing is probably the only, the only aspect that's a little below normal. But again, if you look at the overall numbers, these -- if you sort of forget about 2021 and early '22, and you saw these numbers that we're seeing now, you would feel really good about them. It's just that in the context of those exceptional years are a little bit softer, but they're still considered to be really good markets, Chris. Chris Caton : Hey, Vince, I think I heard in the middle of your question, what is the trend in development starts in the wake of SVB. So it's worth knowing the numbers, which is in the first quarter in the United States development starts were off 40% from their peak across our markets and 45% in Europe. And based on the comment I made earlier around construction debt availability, these numbers are going to -- you're going to continue to see starts to curtail in the marketplace. Hamid Moghadam : I mean, I've never seen such a fast slowdown such a sudden slowdown in construction volume in our business. It's just been -- and I'm not sure it's only -- it was related to Silicon Valley Bank. It was already happening before that, and SVB just made it worse. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Yulico in Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. Nicholas Yulico : Thanks. I just want to go back to some of the commentary about demand may be spilling into 2024 as companies take a longer time and make financial decisions. I guess what I'm wondering is, how much is that an outlook or just broader corporations taking longer times to make financial decisions versus some of the larger categories of leasing like 3PL, general retail, but it may be expecting consumer slowdown and perhaps not fully utilizing their space. And so that's creating some delay in taking space this year. Hamid Moghadam : The utilization rate peaked all time at 87%. And today, it's at 85%. And there is a couple of points of margin error on those numbers anyway. But -- so I would say utilization is really high. If it were -- if utilization were in the high 70s, I would tell you there's a lot of shadow space and people are going to wait to grow into that space or put it on the market for sub leasing, but we're not seeing that. So I don't think there's a lot of excess slack in the system. And even if you look at the well over publicized Amazon stories that a lot of people waste a lot of time on. I mean, they basically haven't given anything space back, maybe 7 million or 8 million square feet. Yet it's taken half the airtime on all these costs for the last year. It just has not been material. I mean, we're looking for something that just doesn't exist. Will it exist? I don't know. I'm not clairvoyant. But so far, it doesn't appear that customers are giving back material amounts of space or anything like that. It's totally within the normal band of how our business works across the cycle. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Michael Goldsmith : Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. My question is on your view for the balance of the year and what has changed, if anything, on a qualitative and quantitative basis? So you provided some commentary on your cautious outlook on demand and that wasn't new, but at the same time, you took up the same-store NOI guidance, maintained your rent forecasts. Just trying to understand if there's been an evolution in your thinking on how the rest of the year plays out? Thanks. Tim Arndt : Hey, Michael, it's Tim. Now, look, I think you heard our comments correctly and I like that you pointed out, they're relatively unchanged. The same-store move is largely a function of an occupancy move. We just retained a decent amount of occupancy in the first quarter. We think that's going to extend throughout the year, so that's two-thirds of our increase in our same-store guide. The remainder of it is frankly some outperformance in the first quarter, that's more one time in nature, deals with seasonal expenses. We had very little bad debt in the quarter, out of interest, but we don't forecast that to continue. So that's some of the one-time items, but that combination is what is impacting same-store from here. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Nick Thillman with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Nick Thillman : Hey, good morning. Retention remains pretty elevated here, but at 80%. But maybe on the tenants that don't resign, what's like their primary reason for not resigning? Is it them outgrowing their current footprint or a case of them just getting priced out of the market? Trying to tie that really to your occupancy in the sub 100,000 square foot area, it's been a little bit lighter than the rest of the leasing categories. Hamid Moghadam : So the reason for non-renewal are either good reasons or bad reasons. The bad reason is that the company goes broke or the company -- so the neutral reasons are the company decides to go somewhere else out of one market into another market. The bad reasons are, sorry, the good reasons are that we just don't have a space that fits the growing need of that customer to be accommodated or the shrinking need of that customer to be accommodated. So they have to go somewhere else. We do track the reason for non-renewal of every single lease that doesn't renew. And one of the things that we track very closely is that we lose the space to a competitor because of pricing. And that statistic is like in the 2%, 3%, 4% range, and I think it's too low because it means that we're not pushing rents hard enough. So it's -- we're not losing tenants because of rent. We're losing tenants because we just can't accommodate them or they go broke or they move somewhere else. And those have been the reasons for the last 40 years I've been doing this. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Camille Bonnel with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Camille Bonnel : Hello. Following up on an earlier comment about the vacancy in Southern California region being below 2%. I think the growing concern is actually on the availability rate or how much sublease activity has picked up which is something we really haven't seen in the past. So I understand, at least within the Southern California region, the supply seems manageable given how difficult it is to build in this market, but could you share your thoughts on how you think this might evolve in upcoming months? And whether or not this is a potential risk you're tracking closely? Chris Caton : So two ways to approach that. First, I'll give you the -- this is Chris, by the way, Camille. First is the sublease data, and the second is our true months of supply data. So sublease nationally in the United States is on an availability rate basis, 60 basis points in the first quarter. The 10-year average, 60 basis points. The recent low indeed was 40 basis points, so it's moved up 20 basis points. Now the pre-COVID average or the pre-COVID low was 50 basis points and the peak in the global financial crisis was 1.1%. If you just summarize all that, first off, I'd offer that it's not a lot of availability. And the second is we're at the low end or at a normal level in sublease. And then I'd also point you to our views on true months of supply that Tim described in our earnings transcript, which said that at 30 months today, we have a very good market environment, consistent with 10% market rent growth. And as supply decelerates and slows, we think that will go back down into the 20s, improving the market landscape. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ronald Kamdem : Hey, great. Just one quick one and so on the expected vacancy rate, you talked about 3.5 currently rising throughout the year and then going back down by the end of '24. I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on the supply and the demand assumptions that are going into that? How much is sort of demand normalizing, how much supply normalizing to get back to that 3.5. And the corollary to that would be, if you're expecting 10% market rent growth this year, historically, if you find yourself at that vacancy level at the end of '24, what sort of the market rent growth experience that we should have? And then the other quick one, sorry, on the 85% mark-to-market GAAP mark-to-market for '24, can you talk about what that number is for '23? Thanks. Chris Caton : Thanks for the question, Ronald. So thank you for the opportunity to clarify our market statistics. I want to be very clear. So let's talk about net absorption in the 30 markets where Prologis operates in the United States. Last year, net absorption was 375 million square feet. We call that at 275 this year, and we expect a similar or perhaps higher numbers of macro environment clarifies and some of the decisions that get delayed this year land into '24. So that will be on the demand side completions. We have a bit of a clearer view as we look out to '24. So but starting with 2022, 375 million square feet of supply as well, that's deliveries. We expect 445 million square feet of deliveries this year as a supply pipeline empties and that will fall sharply, perhaps by half or more into 2024. And so when you put these numbers together, you'll see the vacancy rising from low 3s last year to 4 or a bit higher later this year and then back into the mid-3s. Hamid Moghadam : The way to think about it is that demand is normalized from exceptionally high levels and the supply response has been in excess of that normalization of demand because of banking crisis and sort of macro constraints. So I think the supply response has been much more dramatic than the effects on demand. And that's why the market is going to tighten up again. Of course, absence, a calamity or something like that. Tim Arndt : One important point to keep in mind is what is a normal vacancy rate because we have been years away from a normal vacancy rate. The historical range for our business is 5% to 10% with pricing power occurring in the 6% to 7% market vacancy rate. So we're talking about 3.5% to 4% market vacancies, half of what is typically seen as a way to see pricing power. Chris Caton : And I would just pile on your third question there on the '24 component of our lease mark-to-market. This year, the same metric is in the low 80s. I think I intimated that last quarter on the call, just as a measure of what we expected our rent change would be this year. Those are -- I'm really talking about the same thing in that context. So roughly in the low 80s for '23. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Michael Mueller : Hi. I dropped for a minute, so I apologize if this was asked. Can you talk about like the full year development start yield expectation is compared to the high 7% plus yield that you had in the first quarter. Dan Letter : Yes. Hi, Mike. This is Dan. The yield that you saw in the first quarter was a couple of build-to-suits, really small volume. And what I would say is I would just look to last year and doing better than last year's yield on our starts this year. Hamid Moghadam : I think the vast majority of the starts are in the 6s. And I would say the cap rates are up 75 basis points. So margins have gone from 30%, 40% to 20%, 30% something like that. I mean, those are some rough numbers. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Please proceed with your question. Thomas Catherwood : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I want to touch on tenant health for a bit. Obviously, we talked about higher cost of capital and less availability of debt when it comes to real estate but it's also impacting operating industries across the board. With your expectation of slower economic activity this year, are there any industries where you would be concerned about increasing your exposure at this point in time. Hamid Moghadam : Let's talk about credit loss as a measure of customer stability. Bad debt ratio and all that. It's historically, in our business has been in the tens of basis points. Even when you had the lapse in demand in the immediate aftermath of COVID that number got to 60 basis points. So -- and Chris, what would you guess our number is going to get to in the cycle when it's all over in terms of bad debt. Chris Caton : I'd say 20, I'm jumping in here. I think 20 will be on average. Hamid Moghadam : Yes. So I mean, we don't see it in the numbers and the number of bankruptcies, et cetera, et cetera, that we're monitoring and working on are really not unusual in fact, I would say, that's somewhat unusual. I was expecting more of them than we're seeing in this point in the cycle. And honestly, we would like to see more of them because, frankly, there's so much mark-to-market in those leases that those kinds of tenant departures are actually an upside. So if anybody sort of has problems with their business or is looking to downsize. We look at that as an opportunity to do a buyout and actually be able to extract higher rents in the marketplace. So really not a concern. And that number -- those numbers that I talked about are out there. You can go look at them and plot the curve. They've been coming down substantially as opposed to from very low levels, but they're still coming down. Tim Arndt : I might add on to that one final thought, which is I think the 20 that I'm throwing out is a reflection of some mix shift on credit, I think, in the last five years with the markets this tight, we've not only been able to push rents, keep the portfolio occupied, but we've been greatly enhancing the credit profile of our rent roll, and we think we've got a really strong customer base. Hamid Moghadam : Yes. One final statistic that you guys don't have visibility to, but I'm reading off my sheet of stats here. Historical average of credit watch tenants for us, long-term historical average has been 4.9%. We just watch them. By the way, the average actual default has been 0.15. So we worry about a lot more things than we should. That credit watch number today is at 3.35. So it's down substantially. And so is the actual bad debt ratio. So we worry about a lot of things, but most of them don't actually happen and the numbers are actually quite healthy, not just -- not even adjusting for the cycle and the fact that it's a softening cycle, but just even in the best of markets, these statistics would show up as very good. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc. Please proceed. Todd Thomas : Hi. Thanks. I wanted to follow up on the demand environment and your comments about a more challenging macro in relation to the development starts. I guess, how much visibility do you actually have on starts in the second half of the year as it pertains to the full year target of $2.5 billion to $3 billion? How quickly can that ramp up? And then development yields for what's under construction, they were higher by 20 basis points versus last quarter on the '23 and '24 under construction pipeline. Is that due to improved economics around rents or moderating construction costs which I think you mentioned or really a combination of the two? And do you expect to see further improvements in development yields as you look out in the future? Hamid Moghadam : Yes. Most of our land is entitled and entitlement is a pretty broad definition. I mean, fully entitled means that you pulled the building permit on this specific building that you can start but you might have entitlements and you haven't pulled the specific building permit because you don't exactly know how big a building you're going to build or in what configuration. But 80% of our land is entitled in terms of discretionary entitlements and about 20% to 30% of our land is really good to go with building permits pulled. So that is not a limiter on our ability to start development. So we can start whatever development we want to as we monitor the marketplace. The reason for development yields going on -- going up is that rent growth has been higher than we forecast. And the costs are essentially the same because we've locked in some of those construction values on the buildings that are starting today. The comment about construction cost has nothing to do with what you're seeing on the starts today. It will affect yield on starts down the road. Our view has changed. That's one area where our view has changed materially. We thought there would be some softening of construction costs to the tune of 5% to 10% and because of IRA and all this new fiscal stimulus going into the construction industry, I mean, it uses the same labor, same materials and everything. Contractors still have pretty good pricing power. So that -- what we thought was going to be a 5% to 10% decline, it's going to be inflationary increase. So the swing is actually pretty material. Having said all of that, the rental growth more than makes up for it. So I think our yields are trending up. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please proceed. Anthony Powell : Hi. Good morning. Quick one for me, I guess, any change in the tenor of conversations with your lending partners or underwriters after the SIVB collapse? Or are you seeing just increased confidence from your partners that you seek to do financing in the future? Hamid Moghadam : They're asking us a lot of money. No, it's not really. I mean where that balance sheet is bulletproof. I mean, frankly, we have better balance sheet than most of our banks. So no and we're not really a bank borrower per se, we tap into the capital markets all the time. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC. Please proceed. Michael Carroll : Yeah, thanks. I just wanted to follow up on your planner potential willingness to invest into the property funds. And can you quantify how much you would like? Or are you willing to invest in those funds? And are there any particular ones that you would want to invest in like USLF or PELF or is that still a TBD right now? Hamid Moghadam : Well, we're going to invest in PELF sooner than USLF because we think the value adjustments in Europe have been quicker than they have been in the U.S. But I suspect we're only a quarter or so away from even the U.S. adjusting to a normalized value at least we hope. So look, it's a $140 billion balance sheet. So even if we just wanted to allocate 1% of it, and I'm not saying we're going to allocate 1%. I'm just kind of size the issue for you, that could be $1.5 billion. We're probably not going to invest $1.5 billion, but it's got to be like a small portion of our overall balance sheet. But we love that stuff because we know it. We like it. It's exactly the kind of property we want to have. And redemptions give us a really good opportunity to do that without affecting the strategy of the fund. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please proceed. James Feldman : Great. Thank you. I thought your commentary on credit was pretty interesting in terms of how low it is. I guess you have such a wide view of what's going on in the world. Can you just talk through maybe across your regions, some of the data points you're seeing that either give you some confidence in where the economy is heading or give you some concern about where the economy is heading and how that factors into where you want to put capital to work? Hamid Moghadam : I'll just take two things. This is more a global comment than US comment. Japan is having more supply than it normally has, but demand is actually still pretty strong. I'm a little worried about vacancy rates in Japan going up into the mid-teens. So that's one place we're seeing it. The U.K. has actually been pretty surprisingly good on the industrial side. If you look at the headlines for the U.K., you would expect more trouble than what we're seeing in the industrial market. In the U.S., it's -- I can't think of a trend that it's worth talking about that. The markets are generally pretty good. I mean can you guys think of anything? Chris Caton : Hey, Jamie, it's Chris Caton. There's been a lot of economic news over the last few weeks, and I think there are probably three takeaways. The first is consumers are stable, notwithstanding all the noise in that. And it seems to be treading towards perhaps GDP growth of 2%, if not a bit higher. Second, I think quite clearly, e-commerce is reaccelerating with online shopping, now back on trend taking 100 basis points of share from in-store. And the third is, indeed, inventories are rising but they have not yet risen to pre-COVID level, little on a higher level for resilience. Hamid Moghadam : With Jamie's question, that's the last one in the queue. I wanted to thank all of you for participating in our call. We're excited over here because it's our 40th anniversary that we'll be celebrating in June. And there are going to be lots of opportunities between the investor meeting later on in the year and also GROUNDBREAKERS where we will be speaking to you. So I look forward to seeing all of you and take care. Operator : And that concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a great day.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Jill Sawyer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Jill Sawyer : Thanks you, Adel. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates, as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or other SEC filings. Additionally, our second quarter results, press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures and in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. I'd like to welcome Tim Arndt, our CFO, who will cover results, real-time market conditions and guidance; Hamid Moghadam, our CEO and our entire executive team are also with us today. With that I\u2019ll hand the call over to Tim. Tim Arndt : Thanks, Jill. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. We had a very good quarter with outstanding results across our uniquely diversified business. It was highlighted by record rent change, a ramp up in development starts roughly half of which were build-to-suit and the acquisition of over $3 billion of real estate at accretive returns deepening our scale in key markets.  We also earned record strategic capital income and raised $1.2 billion in new equity across the vehicles. We are watching markets closely and we\u2019ve been clear that we expect vacancies to arise over the course of the year from a normalization of demand and elevated development deliveries.  We\u2019ve indeed seen vacancy build and expected to reach the mid-fours in the US by year end but continue to believe that fundamentals will regain momentum in 2024 with the outlook for new supply declining as development starts continue to fall this year. In short, our outlook is completely unchanged and we feel great about our business.  Turning to our results, core FFO excluding promotes was $1.25 per share and including promotes was $1.83 per share, both ahead of our forecast. Our promote income was generated from both USLF and FIBRA Prologis and meaningfully exceeded our guidance.  USLF generated promote revenue at Prologis share of over $635 million. In its three year performance period, assets grew by over $10 billion and the fund delivered an IRR of over 20% net of all fees and with very low leverage. In terms of our operating results, average occupancy for the quarter was 97.5%, down 50 basis points from the first quarter and in line with our expectations. Rent change on starts was a record on both a net effective and cash basis, 79% and 48% respectively. Net effective rent change on signings of more forward-looking build was an impressive 87% with notable rent change from Phoenix at a 137%, Northern New Jersey at 150% and Southern California at a 181%.  Global markets also contributed to strong signings with Mexico at 34%, the UK at 36%, Central Europe at 51%, and Canada at a 150%. Bottom-line rent change has been both robust and broad based. Market rents continued to grow albeit at a slower pace increasing a little over 1.5% in the quarter. In-place rents grew by approximately 2.5% over the quarter, the net of which translates to a lease mark-to-market of 66%, down from 68%. We explained last quarter that our lease mark-to-market would generate $2.85 per share of incremental earnings as leases roll over time without any additional market rent growth.  Interestingly, that future upside is virtually unchanged at June 30th, even though we crystallized rental increases over the quarter. This is because a lower lease market-to-market is now being applied to a larger base of in-place NOI. Ultimately, same-store growth is our most important operating metric and this quarter remained exceptional at 8.9% on a net effective basis and 10.7% on cash.  I'd like to highlight that even with $4 billion of investment during the quarter, the balance sheet remains in impeccable shape, with liquidity of approximately $6.4 billion and debt-to-EBITDA of 4.2x. We raised approximately $7 billion in debt financing across four currencies at an interest rate of 4.9% and an average term of eight years.  Turning to our markets, the trend to normalization, which we've been speaking to for some time continues. Proposal activity, gestation and pre-leasing of vacancy are all within a few percent of their pre-COVID levels, a period which we\u2019ve highlighted many times was itself historically strong. Our IDI sentiment index ticked in the quarter to over 58 indicating a continued strong backdrop for demand as described by our customers and further supported by utilization increasing to 85.5%.  Unsurprisingly, customers have been more deliberate in their decision-making amidst the uptick in vacancy. We continue to believe that this will be a short-lived reprieve as construction starts have indeed declined significantly for our expectations. Starts in the second quarter were down approximately 40% across our US markets and 50% in Europe.  We see deliveries in 2024 falling short of demand, reducing vacancy over the course of next year. Significant attention has been given to Southern California in recent months, while our portfolio is over 97% leased and we are achieving record rent change, vacancy has grown partially due to port operations that have not yet returned to normal.  Additionally, some customers are re-evaluating expansion in the Inland Empire diversifying operations to other Southwest markets. With all this in mind, we've reduced our rent growth forecast for Southern California in 2023.  However given what is still low vacancy together with structural headwinds to new supply and a huge consumption base, we believe strongly in this market. The global nature of our portfolio means that we will see markets contribute to growth in different periods evening out peaks and troughs. We see this playing out in a number of markets across the globe, where our rent growth forecast is increasing this quarter such as Las Vegas, Texas, Europe and Mexico to name a few.  All this together with the more than 5% rent growth to-date has us re-forecasting the full year to a range of 7% to 9% on a global basis. What matters more than what will transpire in the next six months is what we see over the medium term, which is growth that will be fueled by escalating replacement costs, growing barriers to new supply and ongoing secular drivers of demand.  Late in the second quarter we announced and closed on the acquisition of over 14 million square foot portfolio in many of our best US markets. We estimate an 8% unlevered IRR simply at the property level, exclusive of additional return driven by property management synergies, essentials opportunities, including solar and the upside we expect through revenue management. While this was the largest transaction in the quarter, overall activity increased slightly bringing additional price discovery to the market.  In Europe values have been relatively stable, experiencing a 1% decline over the second quarter. Latin America saw an increase in values with write-ups in Brazil and Mexico of 2% and 5% respectively and write-downs in the US were in line with expectations approximately 5% driving the cumulative decline over the last year to 12%.  With this move, we view the values as fair and are proceeding on redemption in USLF for the third quarter.  New redemption requests in the quarter totaled approximately $800 million and was concentrated in USLF and our China venture where values have held up better. Together with other activity the net redemption queue stands at approximately $1.6 billion. Outside of open-ended funds, the company raised an incremental $1.2 billion comprised of $500 million in the FIBRA and NPR, as well as a new $700 million commitment for a complementary vehicle in Japan, PJLF, which is detailed in our supplemental.  Before turning to guidance, I'd like to mention a few updates across our Essentials business. We added 45 megawatts of new solar production and storage in the first half of the year, bringing our platform total to 450 megawatts, nearly 50% of the way to our 1 gigawatt goal for 2025.  Additionally, Prologis Mobility, our EV business has more than 65 lead charging sites in the pipeline across the US and Europe. In terms of our outlook for the balance of the year, we are guiding average occupancy to range between 97% and 97.5%. We are increasing our same-store guidance eight three quarters to nine and a quarter percent on a net effective basis and 9.5% to 10% on a cash basis.  Net effective rent change propelling same stores will continue to accelerate in the next two quarters and average approximately 80% over the year. We are maintaining our G&A guidance to range between $380 million and $390 million and are increasing our strategic capital revenue guidance excluding promotes to range between $520 million and $530 million. As a result of the outperformance in USLF\u2019s promotes, we are increasing our forecast for net promote income to $475 million. Year-to-date, we are in excess of this amount, but the amortization expense will continue over the back half of the year.  Development starts picked up during the quarter with commencements of 12 projects around the globe and while we remained very selective on new spec starts, we are maintaining our guidance to $2.5 billion to $3 billion for the year. We had over $550 million in contribution in disposition activity during the quarter concentrated in Japan and Mexico and are maintaining guidance of $2 billion to $3 billion.  Putting it all together, we are increasing guidance for GAAP earnings to range between $3.30 and $3.40 per share. We are increasing core FFO including promotes guidance to a range of $5.56 to $5.60 per share and increasing core FFO executing promotes to range between $5.06 and $5.10 per share with the midpoint representing over 10% annual growth marking our fourth consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth. The quarter highlighted many ways that Prologis has diversified itself across geographies, business lines and capital sources, while rents in some markets decelerate, others with different demand drivers are now accelerating. We're seeing the same balance with property values as demonstrated over the quarter. Further, we generate incremental cash flows and value creation outside of the pure rent business in closely related and synergistic platforms, namely Strategic Capital development and now Essentials. Our fundraising efforts also demonstrate the value of having alternatives. Clearly, our wide access to debt capital has been a tremendous advantage, but we also benefit from access to varied equity sources for our ventures by utilizing open end vehicles, JVs and public structures, we have the ability to be opportunistic and proactive in changing capital markets. As we close, I'd like to remind you of two upcoming events of Prologis later in the year. Our Groundbreakers Thought Leadership Forum on September 27th, right here in San Francisco, and our Investor Forum on December 13th in New York. Additional information for each is available on our website.  With that, I will hand it back to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]  Our first question comes from Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Please state your question. Tom Catherwood : Thank you, and good morning all. Tim, appreciate your commentary around guidance on projected rent growth. Kind of a two-part question on that first. Have you adjusted your projection for US rent growth? I think it was previously 10% and you mentioned it globally now. And then, can you provide some more detail around those markets or regions where as you said you've seen you know rent growth and values kind of exceed expectations and then conversely are there others like Southern California that have somewhat lagged your expectations? Tim Arndt : Hey, Tom, I'll start and probably pitch it to Chris here for some help on the market detail. But the U.S. at this point, I would put in a similar range, really given the weight of the U.S. and the notion that we're going to put these things in ranges probably from here, it's going to be very similar to the globe. So I would just think of them as essentially the same. And then, in terms of markets, clearly, I mentioned in my remarks that Southern California is the market that we've downgraded. That's broadly the base of our change and pretty much the only market and it is matched by various markets as are also detailed many in Southeast US, but it's pretty broad around the US, as well as globally that are picking up the slack and holding the average pretty close when you put it in a range. Operator : Our next question comes from Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Please state your question. Blaine Heck : Great. Thanks. Good morning. So we noticed lease proposals trended downward throughout the quarter and gestation increased towards the end of the quarter. Can you just talk about what factors might be driving those trends? And whether you think we'll continue to see lease proposals trend down or should we expect an inflection in the second half? Chris Caton : Hey, it's Chris Caton. So, really when we look at that data, the right way to look at that is against our open availabilities. And when you put those proposals against our open availabilities they are actually in line or above the historical average, 48% is that number, it's something we've used in the past on these calls. And so how we do make the proposal numbers you're talking about tie with that view, well, there are two or three drivers.  The first is that the availabilities just, the role that we have in the next 12 months are low relative to history. The second is those proposal volumes do include, sometimes multiple proposals on a single unit and that has declined over the last year as we've discussed previously. And then, third, there's some seasonality where June would be a soft month. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Mailman with Citi. Please state your question. Craig Mailman : Yes. Thank you very much. Maybe it's open two questions here, I guess, maybe Tim and Chris to follow-up on Tom's question around the market rent growth. It looks like the U.S. dropped about 200 basis points. And if could you give us some more numbers around what the biggest moving parts of that were from a market perspective? And then, separately on, on occupancy here, you guys seemed at 80 BPS sequentially on ending core occupancy and then you're 50 basis points on average.  But, Secaucus, New Jersey, Central Valley, Atlanta, all kind of came down here. Just curious if there's, if that's where you're seeing the more supply or if you had any incremental impact from the Blackstone acquisition that was laid some of those numbers? Tim Arndt : Yeah, so, on the, on the rent piece, we're not going to go through market rent growth at a market level for a variety of reasons. I think the takeaway we want you and everyone to be left with is just how it can all come into a balance and we're very pleased to see that we're able to hold the forecast at least in a pretty tight range to where we were previously.  And on the occupancy side, you're right about where the ending pieces. I would just comment that that's in line with our forecast. If you look at our average same-store, average occupancy guidance that we have previously and that we have this quarter, it's unchanged. So, the decline that we have expected over the year remains and everything that you see in this quarter is in line with those expectations. Hamid Moghadam : Yeah. The one thing I would add to that is that, I think we mentioned to you last quarter that we would be continuing to push rents pretty hard and would like to see occupancies a bit lower than 98%. So, what you think is consistent with what we're planning to do and actually we accomplished what we wanted to do in that we tracked a number of leases that we lose because of price and how hard we were pushing. And we modulate around that to figure out the trade-off between rents and occupancy.  So we did see as a result of our efforts, an uptick in basically the percentage of deals lost due to price. It went up from about 10% to about 20%, which is kind of where we would like to have it. So it\u2019s [Indiscernible]. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question. Caitlin Burrows : Hi, good morning, everyone. Maybe like to mention there has been a lot of discussion about Southern California. So ask another one there, but I guess just thinking about the idea that it might be lagging now, can you give more details on what could be causing the change in that market? Kind of how long it could last in which market could potentially face similar issues? Chris Caton : Sure. Let me take a stab at that, because I've seen this now a couple of times over the last 30, 40 years. Southern California is really being adversely affected by two things. One, ports volumes. I think this labor strike has gone on longer than most people anticipated. And the timing of it was such that people have to make decisions about the Christmas season and they've shifted volumes to other ports. And that affect Southern California and honestly, the longer disclose out, I believe the worse it will be for Southern California in terms of doing permanent damage.  From now from everything we hear and we're not an expert on this, things are apparently heading in a positive direction with respect to a resolution. But you read the same things we do. So, I don't have any unique perspectives on that.  The other, the other difference with Southern California is just pricing. I mean, you had between \u201820 and \u201822, about an 130% increase in rents in Southern California, that compares to less than half of that for the overall markets that we operate in. So, there is more price sensitivity now because it's a very, very expensive market. So to the extent possible, people will shift to adjacent markets. And combined, it's not just price, but up until a quarter ago, occupancies in the Inland Empire was 99 point something percent. So people couldn't even get the space that they wanted. I think with the more normalized vacancy level and we're still not at normal.  I mean, normalized in my experience is 95% occupancy and that would have been great for the last 15 or 20 years. I think with more normalized occupancy, you'll see, Peep and a resolution of the labor strike. I think you see a more normal pattern from which you can draw some conclusions. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Please state your question. Steve Sakwa : Yeah. Thanks. Hi, good morning. I guess, really kind of a two parter. Just, Hamid, if you could just maybe talk about demand by size of tenant and knowing of whether you're seeing any real disparities in sort of the under 250 or under 100 and anything kind of on the bigger side? And then, just I guess your confidence level around the level of development starts. It's obviously a very back-end weighted sort of hockey stick figure for the second half of the year.  So, how much of those projects are currently teed up. And what do you think that split of starts looks like between the third and the fourth quarters? Hamid Moghadam : Yeah. Let me start on the development volume and then pitch it over to Dan for the other commentary. We do not care about development starts. We do not care about acquisition guidance. We will - we make all these decisions one-by-one and only when it makes sense to pull the trigger on these. They're buying large already more or less and we could, on a discretionary basis, start all of them today.  But that would not be a wise thing to do and we're not going to do it just to meet some artificial guidance. I think the main driver of earnings in this company, which is what we all care about is rental growth and same-store growth. And all I can tell you is that with mid-60s mark-to-market, you can model whatever scenario you want, including zero rent growth from here on out.  And for the next four years, five years, you're going to get same-store NOI increase of 7.5% with no rental growth from this point forward.  You put in our normalized forecast for a rental growth our best guess and that same-store growth will be at 8.5%. Both of those numbers are consistent with low-double-digit earnings growth, while maintaining our leverage, which is, which is so low. So, I don't - we don't need development starts to drive anything, and we're not going to get in a position of \u2013 or jeopardizing our pricing power by virtue of wanting to meet an artificial development goal. Now having said all that, we will start the ones that we think we can lease efficiently and economically and quickly. And the land is there. The approvals are there. And our ability to put buildings up is there. So, there is no benefit in front end loading that stuff and pushing it ahead of where it needs to be. Dan, do you want to address the site question? Dan Letter : Yeah. Sure. So, we have - we're seeing continued broad-based demand across all size ranges. Now there certainly are pockets of - in certain markets that there's some risk and maybe the bulk. And those are markets we've talked about historically. South Dallas, North Fort Worth, Indianapolis is getting a fair amount of bulk built out. But, and then I would say West Phoenix, as well. But what I would say with our portfolio overall, we're really isolated from any of this bulk risk and we're really confident in the demand across all site ranges. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Please state your question. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. Tom, turning to your capital deployment, $3 billion Blackstone deal at a 5.75 stabilized cap rate. Can you just discuss how you viewed the attractiveness of this deal versus some other opportunities that you might have had such as spot buybacks or development? Or do you simply think the value per square foot, price shouldn't decrease much further from here on out? Dan Letter : Yeah. I mean, certainly, portfolios that we would acquire would be at a discount to replacement cost. And replacement costs has moved up tremendously in the last couple of years by virtue of - forget about the land piece, because that's a squishy piece that's related to rent and all that. But the construction piece has really, really escalated. So to buy standing inventory in our best markets is always a really great thing that we look at.  The quality of the portfolio was quite high, I would say very close to our own portfolio. The percentage that we would dispose of is zero. So it was hand selected to meet our requirements. I wouldn't call it a steal. We didn't steal anything. I think it's a market rate transaction and with the upside built into the rents, you know, 8% IRR in a world that I think is going to be a sub 3% inflation rate.  And then, all the added things we can put on top of it and with Essentials and all that, I've developed capital at those rates all day long. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please state your question. Michael Goldsmith : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. The lease percentage of the development pipeline has been dropping pretty materially kind of back to 2019 levels. What are the factors there? And does this impact your ability that hate your yields expected on these developments? Hamid Moghadam : Yeah, I think maybe the best way I\u2019ll summarize in this call would be, we are back to 2019. Okay. We are getting at it in 25 different ways. But the easiest way to think about it is, demand, supply, rental growth, all of those things that are trending back to 2019 pre-COVID.  And if you take \u201820 to \u201822 out of the picture and imagine, that in 2019, somebody would tell you that in 2023 you are still talking about the dynamics of 2019 market, I would be jumping up and down happy about that. So, that\u2019s where we are and almost to any question, I am not trying to avoid your question. But it would be the same answer on 20 other parameters, as well. We're back to 2019. Operator : Our next question comes from Nick Thillman with Baird. Please state your question. Nick Thillman : Hey, good morning. Hamid, kind of touched on you guys competing on price by 20% of tenants not renewing because of that. But retention is dropping down to 70%. So, are those tenants are renewing or do they not? Where do they end up going? Do they go to a new supply or a new product that's being delivered? Or is it more sort of a scenario where they're just completely priced out of the market? Hamid Moghadam : No. They go somewhere else. I mean, those are real needs and at the end of the day, warehouse rent is - as a percentage of total logistic cost is relatively small. So they are not going to go out of business because of that. I mean, frankly, the pressure on energy prices, on fuel prices, on labor prices and all that, if you are going to worry about something those are more significant than their ability to pay rent. 70% is not a unusually low retention rate. I mean, if you, again forget about the last three years where there was no space and people had no choice, that would be a very normal rate of retention for us, going back and looking at it over 10, 20 year timeframe. So, and we are trying to find out what the efficient point is for losing customers because of price.  We can make that number be zero, but that would not be wise because that means we're not pushing rents as hard. So, 20% is definitely still below where I would start worrying about dial and get the other way. If it got to about 30%, we may want to moderate on that. But still, generally speaking, the bias is towards pushing rents and not occupancies. Now markets where that is not the case, we\u2019ll dial it back some. But that's a decision we make day-to-day based on the data that we see. It\u2019s not a top down type of decision. Operator : Our next question comes from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question. Ronald Kamdem : Hey. Just a couple quick ones. Just going back to the market rent growth forecast and also Southern California, can you give us some context in terms of what was the first half growth on the market rent growth? Number one. And then, number two, when you talk about sort of Southern California, decelerating, is there a way to get some context on \u2013 is it just a deceleration or should we be bracing for things to potentially turn negative in that market? Tim Arndt : So, couple things. First of all, the most important thing about Southern California is the gas in the tank. Not rental growth going forward. I mean the gas in the tank in the Southern California is \u2013 I don\u2019t know the exact number, but it\u2019s probably over a 100% on your average lease. So, whether you think rents are going to grow 3% or negative 3% or 10% or whatever, it's not going to affect that number one Iota.  Are there markets in Southern California and elsewhere where you could see rental growth sliding? Sure, of course, there are. When something has escalated by 150%, I wouldn't be surprised if it backslid some. Do I worry about Southern California becoming a difficult market? No. I would like to have more Southern California, because that means we have more cars with more gas in the tank.  So, there's some markets that may continue to escalate, but they're still not going to be as good as a market that has embedded growth of well over a 100%. So I'm not trying to duck your question. But we're a global company, it's a 1.2 billion square foot portfolio and I think it would not be a productive use of my time or anybody else as your time to drill down into sub-market or individual rents. Because frankly, we don't spend a lot of time ourselves looking at that. We look at it bottoms up a deal-by-deal. And then, we make our long-term investment decisions based on some macro bets. And what I'm telling you is that we like Southern California because of its embedded mark-to-market. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question. Michael Carroll : Yes. Thanks. I guess just direct it to Tim. I believe last quarter that you indicated the 2024 lease expirations had an 85 plus percent mark-to-market. I mean, can you touch on what is included in that estimate? Does that reflects expected market rent growth in 2023? And if so, does that 85% target in stats still hold today? Tim Arndt : We would be in the 80s. Let me put it that way right now, and that would contemplate market rent growth from here. So, we feel good about still hitting that kind of number, but we will give full guidance on it later in the year. Chris Caton : Yeah, I don't think we know anything that suggests a different number than when we told you before. So, so it's essentially the same number. Operator : Your next question comes from Camille Bonnel with Bank of America. Please state your question. Camille Bonnel : Good morning. So, to clarify on Hamid\u2019s comments around the portfolio's embedded NOI growth, if rents grew another 5% as you're projecting in the back half of this year, are you expecting core NOI growth to be tracking above that 7% mention or more closely to the growth you projecting this year? And Tim, from your opening remarks, it sounds like market rents have grown in line with expectations to-date but moderated into 2Q. Can you just comment on how the pace of growth looks like for the remainder of the year based on your teams\u2019 projections? Tim Arndt : Well, I'll take the first one. I think I want to be sure we're not conflating a couple things on same-store. So Hamid\u2019s illustration earlier was about a four year horizon what we think will unfold in terms of market rent growth. That would be that roughly 8.5% coverage. And I'll go\u2026 Hamid Moghadam : But the average same-store NOI growth, not the rent growth, same-store NOI growth. Tim Arndt : Sorry. Hamid Moghadam : I don't even have the number for rent growth because frankly, I don't really spend a lot of - that's a very volatile number. Tim Arndt : Yeah. So, and that number by the way incidentally incorporates what will happen in due confirms of its fair value lease adjustments and what we think will happen in occupancy. So that's kind of fully baked and that's a four-year discussion. In terms of this year, there's going to be very little that could change in any direction on market rents that would affect this year's same-store growth. Just too much of the lease mark-to-market and the year frankly are now baked that we're going to land pretty tightly in the range that I\u2026 Hamid Moghadam : For next years. Tim Arndt : Yeah, true. Chris Caton : And then as it relates to the rent growth detailed, Tim\u2019s script included a way for you to kind of reconcile that. And I think within the numbers, the main thing to know is, many It's both in the US and globally continued to have really healthy pricing power and meaningful move in market rents, but the aggregate number is adjusted downward based on the disease on Southern California that we've discussed here. Operator : Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. John Kim : Thank you. Just a follow-up on the $3 billion acquisition you made. How much of that did it contribute to your full-year guidance raise if at all? And can you comment on the pricing just given, 4% going in cap rate, not many buyers have Prologis use cost of capital. So I was wondering how you came to that level and how many competing bids or buyers there were at that level? Tim Arndt : Yeah, I'll pick up on the on the earning side. It's about a $0.05 roughly of our are raise would be attributable to that. The remainder would be the same-store component. Hamid Moghadam : Yeah. And on the number of competing buyers and all that, we don't know but we actually work collaboratively with the seller to pick a portfolio that makes sense for them and make sense for us. So it wasn't like there was a package and a competitive environment. But look, I would argue that two of the largest players in this space kind of know what's going on in the market and they don't need to know a lot of third-party validation of where pricing is. And we came to an agreement reasonably quickly on that.  So, we're really pleased about it because we don't have to go through the brain damage of cleaning up the portfolio. We bought what we wanted to buy at the price that we wanted to buy and presumably they got the price that they wanted. And everybody was very happy about that and we'd love to do more of that. Operator : The next question comes from Nicholas Yulico with Scotiabank. Please state your question. Nicholas Yulico : Thanks. Just a question in terms of, what you're seeing with activity in the 3PL space. I mean, some commentary we were specifically about, LA and 3PL was that it was a market very tight to tenants took as much spaces they could get. In many cases took some excess space in recent years. And now that those same tenants in some cases are putting sublease space on the markers and then you also have less demand from the user group. Maybe it's a port issue in the near term.  But I guess I'm just wondering, broadly on 3PL what the activity of that tenant base looks like in - across your portfolio? Chris Caton : Yeah, I'm going to make a general comment and it applies maybe a bit more to 3PLs, but it applies to everybody. Southern California is a market were embedded mark-to-market is well over 100%. The 3PL business is a very low margin business. Very thin margin business. If you've taken ten percent more space than you would needed and now with the changed outlook you think you need 10% less than you need it before that's a 20% swing in how much space you're going to need the over the over the longer term.  If you can make three or four x what you would make at a year - in a year, moving boxes around by subleasing that space, you would do that. So, the propensity to adjust your space to your needs is much greater in this cycle because of this significant mark-to-market that's in better than some of these leases. Now, if you're in a market where - and I can't think of a market like that.  But let's say you were in a market where you're essentially a market or 10% below, by the time you pay a leasing commission and encourage the downtime and maybe put some TI's in the space, you're not going to make money on that space. So it's more of a cost avoidance and therefore not much of that happens. Southern California is actually viewed as a source of profit for these guys to sublease their real estate. So they're going to do it much quicker than before and that's in fact what we\u2019ve seen. So and - it all goes back to having less than 1% vacancy in this market not too long ago. So, look, Southern California has been a crazy rent growth market for the for as long as I remember, whether you look at 30 years or five years or three years, but the last three years have been have just been ridiculous. And for anybody to think that that would continue forever, I - we certainly don't make our investment decisions based on that and we don't operate our portfolio like that. So, we're not surprised about what's going on in Southern California. Operator : Our next question comes from Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please state your question. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks for taking the question. There is do two questions. One, just looking at the lease proposal chart, correct me if I'm wrong, I think this is all in square feet and I'm just wondering how this would compare, whether you look at it as a percent of expirations or the portfolio just because you're a much bigger portfolio today with Duke in there and other acquisitions. So as a percent of the portfolio is, there something unique in terms of the trend downward it would seem as a percentage it's probably much lower. So if you clarify that number one.  And then, just number two, bigger picture, Hamid, if you're talking about normalization in trends to still healthy levels but that's just in normalizing to 2019. Where do you think the risk premium should be for public private warehouse space? Should it be higher? Is it fair as it is today? Thanks. Hamid Moghadam : Yeah, let me start with that. In 2009, there was a big difference between now and 2019. 2019, I don\u2019t remember the exact number, but I think vacancy rates were north of 5%, maybe even north of 6%. Today and the outlook in 2019 was that we had a long run of improving market conditions and I think as calls like this we are all worrying about for the sixth year in a row whether supply would exceed demand okay?  That today - it's a same market except the vacancy rates are substantially lower than they were at that time. And we have less of a concern about supply beyond this year that is than we had in 2019. So, it's a slightly different market but the dynamics are not that unusual.  With respected public to private, I continue to believe that - I don't know about the sector, but I continue to believe that we trade at a modest discount to NAV and private values. And I think once capital flows start up again, once the denominator effect starts going the other way because of improvements in public markets, I think that will be validated.  So, I do think private values in general are slightly higher than public values where these companies are priced. Hamid Moghadam : And then Vikram on the proposal volumes, yes as square footage and as to reconciling it I'd point you to the answer earlier to the same question and happy to go through it offline if that's not sufficient for you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please state your question. Todd Thomas : Hi, thanks. Just the number one on market rent growth. You've previously talked about a 300 to 500 basis points spread in market rent growth between coastal and non-coastal markets. In light of your comments around Southern California, can you just talk about how you expect that spread to trend as you look ahead to 2024? And are there other coastal markets that you would include in the discussion with Southern California as you think about the labor strikes and the impact that that's having at the ports? Hamid Moghadam : Yeah, I want to be clear about what we said. If you look at all the markets that we operate in, Southern California is going to have the highest rent growth of all, not market rent growth, maybe the market rent growth will modulate, but because of the mark-to-market Southern California for the foreseeable future. And by that, I mean five years plus is going to have the highest growth rate of any market that I can think of five. Chris, do you? Chris Caton : Yes, 100%. Hamid Moghadam : Yeah, and that can go on literally for five to ten years. So, because the mark-to-market is so huge. Now, in terms of the market rent growth, I don't know, we'll find out, but it's our view has moderated. But that really doesn't matter. It's kind of like adding 2% to 3% in one direction or the other to a number that's north of 100% percent. So I think we're focusing on the wrong issues. I don't I don't really know the answer to your question. If I did I\u2019d tell you. Operator : Our next question comes from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please state your question. Anthony Powell : Hi, good morning. Just a question on contributions. It looks like you restarted in this quarter with Japan, and Mexico. Is there still to plan to restart contributions in the US or Europe later this year. And how \u2013how they're progressing overall? Hamid Moghadam : Yeah, I\u2019ll start it and pitch it over to Chris then. Look, the reason we stopped contribution is not because we didn't have the capacity to buy these assets in our funds, we did because they're very low leveraged. The reason we did is that we couldn't really look our investors in the eyes and say that we all have clarity around the values for the fund, for \u2013 for the properties that are being contributed. So we're not in a rush to do that.  There were some companies that force these decisions back in the last cycle that that - and we didn't, and we fared much better than those companies that force, - forced the contributions. So as long as there is clarity on valuations, we will contribute assets at least we would be willing to contribute assets. But I remind all of you, at the end of the day, the independent advisory board for each fund makes a decision of whether they want to accept those contributions or not.  It's not a must put, must take kind of a situation at all. So, but, we couldn't very much look them in the eyes and say that this is the value because there was uncertainty around it. In the markets that you mentioned, there is clarity around the values. Europe, we felt that it reached a point of clarity at the end of last quarter and we believe the U.S. is not becoming very clear too.  And the whole process took about three quarters from the downturn, which is what we expected this to say based on experience. So you should expect contributions to continue at the sort of a normal or maybe somewhat modulated pace. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Mueller with - go ahead. Hamid Moghadam : Caton, do you have anything to add to that? Chris Caton : No, I think that's right. I mean, we will probably look at contributions in Q4. No rush as you said going through that ordinary course of business and split it between both in Europe and the US. Operator : Thank you. And our next question from Mike Mueller with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Mike Mueller : Okay. Thanks. I guess following up on that contribution question, are you seeing any traction yet in the third quarter with dispositions? Hamid Moghadam : We are not trying to dispose of a whole lot because remember, we're almost through all the liberty ones and Duke had very little dispositions associated with. We sold a couple of them of late and the latest Blackstone portfolio has zero dispositions in it. So, I mean, other than the normal sort of Bluebird dispositions we're kind of reaching the end of cleaning up the portfolio.  There are few deals here and there, but then what would you add to that? Chris Caton : I would say the transaction market is opening up and we're very confident. We're going to be able to dispose of what we want when we want. Hamid Moghadam : But it's not a material amount. It\u2019s not going to move the need on our company. Operator : Next question comes from Craig Mailman with Citi. Please state your question. Nick Joseph : Thanks actually, Nick Joseph here with Craig. Just going back to the comment you made earlier on the Blackstone portfolio deal you said you worked with the seller, kind of what would work the both sides and obviously they are lot clearly there was a lot to choose from. So, what were you focused on, is there from a portfolio or strategic perspective in terms of the assets you\u2019ve acquired? Tim Arndt : Well, the markets that we like in the long term. And I can tell you that during the course of those that analysis and that thinking, what the market rent is going to do in the next six months to the last decimal point was not a consideration. I mean, it\u2019s - those are markets that we really believe based on daily interactions with customers as to where demand is going to be where we see that trends in supply which are by the way let\u2019s, we haven't talked about that in a couple of quarters.  But Supply is becoming extremely difficult to bring online in places like California. In fact, I'm kind of worried about it because some of these places are shutting down. I mean, we spent a lot of time with the legislature trying to defeat A B 1,000 which was a proposal to basically stop all warehouse development in Southern California. So in selecting those assets we focused on the markets that we liked a lot and we were prepared to pay - accept a lower yield for those markets because they have more embedded growth. Operator : Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please state your question. Jamie Feldman : Thank you and thanks for taking my question. So, I want to get your thoughts on just the different regions coming out of what should be a recession if we get a recession. There's a lot of talk about European wages really lagging the U.S. obviously, that's a big driver of retail spending in your business. Can you just talk about what might be different as you think about putting capital to work across Europe, Asia and the US or North America given what, might some of these macro trends we're seeing? Hamid Moghadam : Yeah. U.S. has got the highest rent growth over time of any of these markets because it's a more dynamic economy, bigger GDP growth I think than Europe certainly. But Europe has always been a sort of more muted market in terms of supply. Vacancy rates are always lower in Europe and land is metered out by usually government authorities. It\u2019s not so much of a free market. You go buy from the former land.  So, it's a more muted growth pattern than the US one. But we mitigate that because we employ more of a fund structure in Europe. So the combination of the earnings on the fund management business plus the growth in the underlying real estate business makes up for the - makes up for that difference. Asia, China used to be a powerhouse in terms of economic growth. It frankly has surprised everybody coming out of it with respect to how slow it's been to turnaround. I'm not smart enough to know whether that's a, that's a long-term trend, or a short-term trend. But that market has gone from basically 10% per year type of GDP growth to more like a 5% rate of growth. Japan, probably the best long-term market for us, from a development point of view has always had low rent growth. 1% to 2% rent growth would be great. But boy!! there's no CapEx. There's no turnover. There is, - and yields have maintained themselves in Japan, better than anywhere else. There's been no cap rate expansion in Japan at all. And remember, there's hardly any mark-to-market. So there is no cap rate expansion. And in fact, I would say there's probably 10, 15 basis points of compression in the last 12 months.  So it's a good development market and from an operating point of view, we talk cap rates. But at the end of the day, the cash flows in Japan are very strong. There's very little of it leaks out to CapEx and other things. So, each market is different and each market when you look at it as a portfolio plays its role within our overall business. Operator : Thank you. And our final question for today comes from Camille Bonnel with Bank of America. Please state your question. Camille Bonnel : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Does the valuation of your USLF fun take into account the recent portfolio acquisition you announced or is that more of a comp for next quarter? Hamid Moghadam : Good question, Camille. I don't know. We bought that portfolio on balance sheet. So it's not a fund investment, so. But I honestly don't know how long it's going to take the appraisers to reflect that. But it's - we bought it at the very consistent level of valuation to what we thought valuations would be this quarter. And I think we were right about that. So I think the market has adjusted in terms of understanding where values are going, I think we're at the tail end of those adjustments.  You were the last question Camille. So thank you all for your interest in the company. We certainly feel very good about our business going forward. And hope that we will have the opportunity to speak to you more over the summer. Thank you, everyone. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's conference of parties. All parties may disconnect. Have a good day.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Jill Sawyer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Jill. You may begin. Jill Sawyer : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. I\u2019d like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates, as well as management\u2019s beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or other SEC filings. Additionally, our third quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP and in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. I\u2019d like to welcome Tim Arndt, our CFO, who will cover results, real-time market conditions and guidance. Hamid Moghadam, our CEO and our entire executive team are also with us today. With that, I will hand the call over to Tim. Tim Arndt : Thanks Jill. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call. The third quarter marked a continuation of themes we have been anticipating for more than a year, namely; growing supply translating to increased market vacancy; continued moderation of demand; and market rent growth that will slow until the low levels of new starts drive reduced availability over-time. We have operated in accordance with these views in both our approach to leasing, as well as timing of new development. What\u2019s incremental to our forecast is that continued hawkish posture from central banks and the impact it\u2019s had on rates is delaying decision-making and willingness to take expansion space early. The geopolitical backdrop has clearly become more troubling as well amounting to a lack of clarity that will likely weigh on demand. In the meantime, and also playing out to our expectations is that our existing lease mark-to-market will drive durable earnings growth as it did in delivering record rent change this quarter, as well as strong earnings and same-store growth. We remain focused on the fact that we own assets critical to the supply chain with long-term secular drivers that remain intact. Further, the outlook for future supply will continue to face structural barriers, ultimately driving occupancy, rents and values. In terms of our results, we had an excellent quarter with core FFO excluding net promote income of $1.33 per share. This result includes approximately $0.03 of one-time items related to interest and termination income, as well as the timing of expenses, which we can address in Q&A. Occupancy ticked up over the quarter to 97.5%, aided by retention of 77%. Net effective rent change was a record 84% at our share, with notable contributions from Northern New Jersey at 200%, Toronto at 187% and Southern California at 165%. Same-store growth on a net effective and cash basis was 9.3% and 9.5%, respectively, driven predominantly by rent change. We saw market rents grow roughly 60 basis points during the quarter, the slower pace embedded in our forecast. In combination with the strong build of in-place rents, our lease mark-to-market recalculates to 62% as of September. We raised approximately $1.4 billion in new financings at an average interest rate of 3.2%, comprised principally of $760 million within our ventures, as well as a recast of our Yen credit facility increasing our aggregate line availability. In combination with our cash position, we ended the quarter with a record $6.9 billion of liquidity. Finally, it\u2019s noteworthy that our debt-to-EBITDA has remained very low and essentially flat all year, hovering in the mid-4 times range, despite our increased financing activity, a demonstration of the tremendous growth in our nominal EBITDA. Turning to our markets, while rising, vacancy remains historically very low in the U.S., Mexico and Europe. Market vacancy increased approximately 70 basis points during the quarter in the U.S., driven by low absorption, as well as recently delivered but unleased completions. Europe experienced similar dynamics with an overall increase in market vacancy of 50 basis points. At the macro level our expectations for the U.S. are for completions to outpace net absorption by a cumulative 150 million square feet to 200 million square feet over the next three quarters. Then, over the subsequent three quarters, we see that trend reversing with demand exceeding supply and recovering the net 75 million to 125 million square feet. That trend may extend further into 2025, as we believe development starts over the next several quarters are likely to remain low. Whatever the precise path, we expect that as vacancy normalizes over the long-term, our portfolio will outperform the market due to both its location and quality, as well as the strength of our relationships and operating platform. In this regard, our portfolio has been largely resilient to moderating demand. Our teams would describe the depth of our leasing pipeline as consistent with the last few quarters. In coming fresh off of one of our customer advisory board sessions, it\u2019s clear that our customers have plans to continue to expand their footprint, increasing capacity and resiliency. However, what\u2019s also clear is that they are slowing such investments until there is more clarity in the economic environment. In the U.S., rents increased in most of our markets with the strongest located in the Sunbelt, Mid-Atlantic and Northern California regions. Europe and Mexico were also bright spots for growth in the quarter. Rents across our Southern California sub-markets declined approximately 2% as it continues to adjust to higher levels of vacancy. While the markets and outlook are mixed, we remain confident in continued market rent growth in the U.S. and globally over the coming year, albeit at a slow pace while the pipeline continues to get absorbed. From our appraisals, U.S. values declined approximately 3% while European values remain stable, in fact, having a very modest write-up. The difference isn\u2019t too surprising as the Fed\u2019s language around inflation and the economy has had more effect in the U.S. capital markets, driving the 10-year up 100 basis points since our last earnings call, compared to the bund [ph] at just 50 basis points. We believe that this is likely another instance, as we saw one year ago, where U.S. appraisals at the end of the quarter have not had sufficient time to react to the increase in rates and we are thus pausing on appraisal-based activity in USLF for at least one quarter. Elsewhere, values in Mexico are up 8.5%, while China experienced its first meaningful decline of 6.5%, a write-down that we don\u2019t believe has fully run its course. Our funds experienced their first quarter of net positive inflows with approximately $180 million of new commitments versus new redemption requests of $115 million. Given other activity in the quarter, the net redemptions have been reduced from their height of $1.6 billion to approximately $700 million or roughly 2% of third-party AUMs. In terms of our own deployment, development starts ramped up during the quarter, crossing $1 billion, over half of which is related to a data center opportunity in our central region, a testament to our higher and better use strategy and strategically located land bank. Also notable is the acquisition of $118 million of land, including a strategic parcel in Las Vegas, which will build out an additional 10 million square feet over time and brings our total build-out of land globally to over $40 billion. We are laser focused in identifying and executing on value creation in our core business, our energy business, and their adjacencies. Combined with the debt capacity and liquidity we have worked hard to build and preserve, we see the environment as rich with opportunity. Moving to guidance, we are increasing the average occupancy to a range between 97.25% and 97.5%. As a result, we are increasing our same-store guidance to a range of 9% to 9.25% on a net effective basis and 9.75% to 10% on a cash basis. We are maintaining our strategic capital revenue guidance, excluding promotes to a range of $520 million to $530 million and adjusting G&A guidance to range between $390 million and $395 million. Our development starts guidance is increased to a new range of $3 billion to $3.5 billion at our share, driven primarily from the data center start mentioned earlier. We have $500 million of contribution and disposition activity during the quarter and given our commentary on USLF valuations, we are pausing our planned contributions into that vehicle this quarter and reducing our combined contribution and disposition guidance to a range of $1.7 billion to $2.3 billion. In the end, we are adjusting guidance for GAAP earnings to a range of $3.30 per share to $3.35 per share. We are increasing our core FFO, including promotes guidance to a range of $5.58 per share to $5.60 per share and are increasing core FFO, excluding promotes to a range between $5.08 per share and $5.10 per share, growth of nearly 10.5%. I know that many of you are focusing on 2024, so I\u2019d like to take an opportunity to remind you that the Duke portfolio will be entering the same-store pool in 2024, which will widen the recently observed delta between net effective and cash same-store growth. This is, of course, because Duke rents were mark-to-market at close one year ago, so its contribution to net effective same-store growth and earnings will be minimal, even though the cash rent change will be on par with the rest of the Prologis portfolio. In closing, we are navigating the current environment, assured that whatever the economy brings in the short-term, we are positioned to outperform over the long-term. This stems from not only the premier logistics portfolio and customer franchise with one of the best balance sheets amongst corporates, but also highly visible earnings and portfolio growth ahead of us. We know that turbulent times can bring opportunity for those who are prepared and that\u2019s been central to our strategy and management as a company. I\u2019d like to also remind you of our upcoming Investor Forum on December 13th in New York, our first in four years. We are looking forward to spending the day with you, sharing more about our business, outlook and opportunities ahead. Additional information is available on our website and in our earnings press release. And with that, I will hand it back to the Operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Michael Goldsmith : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. I mean, Tim, can you help us reconcile some of the comments from the prepared remarks? You talked about maybe softer demand, but then there\u2019s -- you are calling for accelerating the number of build-to-suit developments. At the same time, occupancy has been stronger than anticipated and that\u2019s before the lower development starts hit the market. So how should we think about all of these moving pieces and just the trajectory of the supply-demand dynamics as we exit 2023 and into 2024? Thanks. Tim Arndt : Sure. Demand is definitely softer. It\u2019s closer to normal, maybe even a little bit below normal at this instant. There is a lot of latent demand that large companies having large requirements are continuing to talk to us about build-to-suits, but they are reluctant to pull the [Technical Difficulty] Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Craig Mailman : Hey, guys. Let me know if you are having trouble hearing me, because I am having trouble hearing you. But I just wanted to touch on the data center build-to-suits in the quarter and see if you guys could break out what the yields on those were relative to the blended yields on the overall development starts? And maybe just give a little bit more color about the opportunity with your partner on this one, the plan on whether you are going to hold this or anticipate selling it upon completion of that and just a little bit more about the capacity within the land bank to do more of the data center sales? Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, please remain on the line. We are just having a difficulty here. Thank you. Please remain on the line. Tim Arndt : I am sorry. We are having some technical difficulties here and I can\u2019t really explain it. Craig Mailman : Hello. Tim Arndt : Can you guys hear me? You can hear me again. Okay. So let me finish the first question and then I will go to the second question. To the extent I heard it, which wasn\u2019t great. On the first question, what I wanted to say is that, the data centers account for a pretty significant volume of the build-to-suits and that\u2019s why they are higher. But industrial logistics build-to-suits are kind of in par and in line with our expectations. The reason occupancy is higher, it\u2019s unique to the quality of our portfolio and just the natural role of leases, but market occupancy is slightly lower. So we are outperforming the market by more than we did before. I think that covers the first question. The second question was how should we think about the build-to-suits in terms of its effect on our going in yields and the like, and for that, I am going to turn it over to Dan here. But generally, we -- the build-to-suits strategy of ours is an extension of our higher and best-use strategy. We own a lot of high quality land in markets that are in the path of development and are popular data center markets. And while we may occasionally buy land for data centers, our primary strategy is converting our existing portfolio to data center products to the extent they have power availability. We are getting a lot of people knocking on our door for those opportunities and we think going forward, it\u2019s going to be a pretty significant part of our activity, although it\u2019s lumpy and less prone to precise predictions like the logistic business, but you will hear more about that. Now, strategically, this is important to understand. We funded our business without issuing any equity basically since 2012. The last 10 years or 11 years we have not issued any equity. How we financed our business is by disposing of real estate that was non-strategic to us, logistics real estate and we have done a lot of dispositions. You can think of the data center strategy as a way of funding our growth. That\u2019s where the growth capital is going to come from. We are not at the moment interested in being in that business in terms of long-term ownership, it\u2019s more of a development and harvest strategy and that capital that comes out of the margins of those deals will be a substantial contributor to our growth going forward. Dan, you want to talk about the initial yields on the data center? Dan Letter : Well, what I would say is, on this particular data center, we are under a strict confidentiality. So we can\u2019t be speaking about any particular yield points by any means. But what I would say is, we have been building capabilities internally to ensure that we hit the market for these deals and you will see those play out as we announce more data centers going forward. Tim Arndt : What I would say, generally, though, without getting specific on this opportunity, we think the margins that come out of our data center business, by definition, based on our historic cost of land or even the market value of land, will be orders of magnitude higher than they would be under logistics build-out. So multiples of a normal margin. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Steve Sakwa : Yeah. Thanks and good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the development and just make sure I understand on the fourth quarter, I think, you have got something like $1.9 billion of planned starts, given that you have done about $1.4 billion year-to-date. So just curious, does that include other data centers or is that all traditional industrial? And if so, what is the mix between spec and build-to-suit on that fourth quarter starts volume? Thanks. Dan Letter : Sure, Steve. This is Dan. So the lion\u2019s share of our Q4 starts are logistics starts. We have one, maybe two smaller data center starts that we have forecasted. But overall, it\u2019s about 50-50 build-to-suit and spec. And let me just highlight that we have been calling for a back-end loaded forecast for about four quarters now. As we talk about market development starts now at 65% -- I guess down 65% from the peak, this is playing out exactly as we expected and we have been gearing up all year for a really heavy Q4 start volume. Tim Arndt : Yeah. The portion of build-to-suit is obviously a lot higher than that if you include the data centers. What Dan meant was a mix of logistics and logistics spec versus build-to-suit. Dan Letter : Correct. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Todd Thomas : Hi. Thanks. Question, as you think about 2024, Tim, you mentioned that market rent growth increased 60 basis points relative to last quarter. That\u2019s down from 2.5% last quarter. I think you indicated that market rent growth is expected to be positive in the year ahead. As we think about the trajectory of rent growth and what you are anticipating, do you see potential for sequential or year-over-year decreases in market rents in the U.S. or globally over the next few quarters as deliveries outpace absorption or do you expect rent growth to stay positive throughout that period during that timeframe? Chris Caton : Hey, Todd. It\u2019s Chris Caton. Thanks for the question. Yes. We expect rent growth to remain positive throughout that time period. Market conditions are stable and there are a handful of markets that we have talked about that are softer, but by and large, markets are proving resilient with rent growth in line or ahead of inflation. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Caitlin Burrows : Hi, everyone. Maybe we could talk about property acquisitions a little. I know it\u2019s not as large of an activity as developments, but guidance for this year increased while transaction volumes at an industry level are down significantly. You did the $3 billion acquisition mid-year. So what sorts of acquisitions are most interesting to you today? Could you talk a little bit about who you are buying from, maybe why they are selling and how you get comfortable on what the right price should be? Hamid Moghadam : Sure. It\u2019s a dynamic market and I think that\u2019s the essence of your question. It\u2019s really hard to get a handle on what the returns should be and how we look at acquisitions. But here\u2019s a model for thinking about it. First of all, we are even pickier than we have been with respect to quality and fit with our portfolio. We are not -- before you had to buy the good with the great in portfolios and we had to go through the massive exercise of disposing of the properties that we didn\u2019t want, which we did actually quite successfully in a declining cap rate environment and we actually made money on it, but we don\u2019t expect that to be the case going forward. So we are really being picky about what we buy. The portfolios that we are going to buy are almost virtually 100% whole portfolios. Secondly, if you really think that, look at where treasuries are, 150 basis points have gone to, call it 4.5%, 300 basis points increased. Those kinds of properties, core properties, we are trading in the high 5%s, low 6% IRRs. Let\u2019s stay away from cap rates because of a market-to-market complexity of talking about cap rates. But call it 6%. So just adjusting for the change in treasury yields, simplistically, you would have to see a 9% on leveraged IRR and that\u2019s if supply and demand of capital were sort of in equilibrium. We get a sense that there\u2019s going to be more opportunities coming our way and it is in a capital-constrained environment and we happen to be in the fortunate position of having a really good balance sheet and able to take advantage of those. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be distress in the terms of a post-savings and loan crisis or any of the downturns, but I think the opportunity set is going to exceed the available capital and I think we will be taking advantage of that. So I would say on leveraged IRRs that have a 9% handle on them, maybe as much as 9.5% depending on the circumstances. And we are seeing that supply loosen up and come to the market. So expect to see more transactions in the next six months. Dan, do you have anything to add? Dan Letter : The only thing I would add is, our teams around the globe are literally turning over every stone daily. And this is land acquisitions, this is core acquisitions, it\u2019s value-add acquisitions and the teams turn to opportunistic right now. So it\u2019s really hard to peg exactly where we are going to land our acquisition volume for the year, which is why you saw us move it up a couple hundred million after this Phoenix transaction. But overall, I think our teams are going to continue to find opportunistic transactions consistent with what Hamid just said on the returns. Operator : And the next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. John Kim : Thank you. I just wanted to clarify, so you are expecting over the next few quarters a significant demand shortfall. And I am wondering if during that time period, are you planning to be more aggressive on rents and concessions to try to hold occupancy or are you going to hold rates just given supply is going to start to come down after that? And also if you could provide an update on the market rental forecast for 2023. Hamid Moghadam : Yeah. On the rental forecast, I am afraid you are going to have to wait for that when we issue guidance and we get into that. And one thing we are going to stay away from is quarter-by-quarter forecasting of rents. It\u2019s hard enough to guess what it is on an annual basis, much less on a quarter-to-quarter forecast. So what was the first part of the question? Oh, occupancy trade-off. Tim Arndt : Occupancy. Hamid Moghadam : It depends on the actual markets. There are about 20% of the markets that I can see us driving for occupancy and about 80% of the markets that are still in equilibrium or tighter. But the key to your question is what you asked in the middle of it, which is, how do you expect that to change? And the reason we are not going to get super aggressive on rents is because we have a belief that, I mean, just look at the starts. They are down 65% and even with moderating demand, we are going to get something like 60% or 70% of that shortfall that we are going to encounter in the next three quarters shortfall of demand, we are going to get it back in the subsequent three quarters. So there\u2019s no sense really going cheap, it\u2019s just. But I would say 20% of our markets, we are going to be more focused on occupancy. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Nicholas Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. Nicholas Yulico : Oh! Thanks. Just a two-porter on Southern California. So I guess, first, I wanted to see if you are seeing any benefit in your portfolio since September in terms of the port being resolved, the worker strikes impacting LA Basin or Inland Empire, if you are seeing any benefit there and pick up any activity. And then, secondly, just wanted to hear latest thoughts on why you think some of the weakness that you have cited there in rents in Southern California, what that dynamic is out there that would be different than other markets, meaning that Southern California is not a leading indicator for other parts of your portfolio? Hamid Moghadam : Well, Southern California is very geared towards basically inflows, 40% of the inflows into this country came through Southern California and that number dropped dramatically because of the labor issues. It\u2019s too soon to see any recovery because we are also going into the Christmas season and anything that\u2019s going to be in a store for Christmas has already been on the water and through the ports and all that. So I think you are going to see the effects of that next year in terms of recovery of flows. About half of what used to come through LA used to stay in the LA Basin, Southern California and half of it was shipped elsewhere. We think the half that stays in Southern California for sure will stay there or come back and some of the rest will also revert back to Southern California. I am not smart enough to know whether we are going to get half of it back or three quarters of it back, but we will get a pretty substantial portion of it back. It will be more into the first quarter or second quarter of next year before you see it in the numbers. Chris, do you want to add anything? Chris Caton : Yeah. I will build on that by saying as the market is digesting the demand and supply picture that Hamid described. We are beginning to see some differentiation in submarkets where LA, Orange County is proving more resilient and the Inland Empire is a bit softer. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Camille Bonnel with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Camille Bonnel : Good morning. First, a clarification that I want to get your thoughts on guidance. Can you clarify if the SoCal market rent change in the opening remarks is on a sequential or annual basis? And then appreciate majority of your leasing for 2023 has been addressed and there\u2019s little that could change your core outlook from here, but want to better understand the level of conservatives being factored into guidance looking into your end. What could change your views more positively or negatively? Thank you. Tim Arndt : Hey, Camille. It\u2019s Tim. Yeah. Just a clarification on the first part, that was a quarter-over-quarter number in SoCal, the 2% decline. And then in terms of what could change the fourth quarter, the answer is very little at this point. Certainly on the rent change side of things, most all of that leasing is already inked. We could have some surprises, very moderate I would say on the occupancy side, but I actually don\u2019t expect that. We have a pretty tight range on occupancy as you know. So I don\u2019t think you will see anything take us outside of our guidance. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Ron Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ron Kamdem : Hey. Just a quick two-parter follow-up. Just one on the development starts and the data centers, which is intriguing. Any way to put some numbers on that on how many starts can be done annually? Is it $200 million, is it $500 million, like how big can this get is the follow-up number one. And then number two on sort of the rent growth, appreciate we want to stay away from sort of specific numbers, but as you are sort of thinking about next year, what are sort of the key markets, Southern California being one, potentially being sort of a headwind? Maybe can you talk about what are some of the neutral or potential tailwinds in terms of markets for next year? Thanks. Hamid Moghadam : Okay. Your first question was great advertising for our Investor Day because that\u2019s what we are going to devote the time to is understanding our essentials business, our data center business and all those things. So let me defer answering that question to that date. And by the way, even on that date, you are not going to get as specific an answer as you would like. I just tell you that in advance, because these are very lumpy and it depends what quarter or what year a deal lands in. Chris, do you want to address the second part? Chris Caton : Yeah. Absolutely. I might start by just saying one way to think about rent growth going forward is to think about the replacement cost math. We have really seen construction costs prove resilient and replacement costs prove resilient. And the interest rate dynamic that Hamid described earlier translates to the rents that are required to warrant new development. So over a medium-term horizon, a couple years, that\u2019s going to play one of the most important factors into evaluating rent growth. As it relates to different markets, which was your question, I think, it\u2019s probably fair to point to Tim\u2019s comments on the markets that have proved the strongest so far this year. Mid-Atlantic, Sunbelt, Northern California are markets that stand out in my mind in the U.S. and there is a range of them globally, whether it\u2019s Toronto, Mexico, Germany and the Netherlands. So that\u2019s what I would look to. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Anthony Powell : Hi. Good morning. I guess one more on market rent growth. I think last quarter you gave a 2023 forecast of 7% to 9%. I don\u2019t know if you updated that today and are you going to be providing those kind of updated on a quarterly basis going forward? Tim Arndt : So, hey, the view is 7% in United -- globally and in the U.S. We are about mid-6s so far this year, so that implies growth in the fourth quarter as we described earlier. And then as it relates to forward guidance, I\u2019d like to underline our upcoming Investor Day in December as the time to look for new information. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Michael Carroll : Yeah. Thanks. How does the 150 million square feet to 200 million square feet gap between supply and demand over the next three quarters compare to your expectation for all of 2023? Now, correct me if I am wrong, I believe that you highlighted that there\u2019s going to be about 150 million square foot gap in 2023. I mean, is that still a fair assumption or has this delay in demand due to the market uncertainty has kind of widened that out a little bit? Chris Caton : Hi. Thanks for the question. Again, it\u2019s Chris. So, just to give you the total numbers, we are on pace to see 490 million square feet of deliveries in the United States this year against 195 million square feet of net absorption. So that gap is wider. And some of that relates simply not so much to the softness in demand that you are describing, but the timing of deliveries of the pipeline. If anything, our view of where the pipeline\u2019s going has come down, not gone up over the last 90 days related to the trend in starts and so really it\u2019s really timing as it relates to that gap. Hamid Moghadam : Yeah. But I would say, our previous forecast did not anticipate the sudden jump in rates that has come in the last month and a half. We thought that treasuries were going to settle in the mid-3s, not mid-4s, maybe mid to high 3s and not mid-4s or approaching 5. So that I think has taken and shifted some of the demand out. But the thing that encourages me and we will have to see -- wait to see this, is that companies are not shutting down their dialogue with us in terms of their long-term needs and are build-to-suit discussions are every bit as good as they have been across most cycles. But they are not pulling the trigger just yet, given that those things generally involve major capital expenditures and those are all being scrutinized by the C-suite pretty tightly these days. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks. I just wanted to get a better sense of, you talked about deferring growth, I guess, across SoCal -- in rent growth across SoCal, Mid-Atlantic, I think, you referenced Sunbelt. Can you just give us a better sense of the magnitude of this dispersion? And I guess, Chris, do you expect this dispersion to continue over the next, call it, six months to months? Chris Caton : So the magnitude of the dispersion, so just to be clear, in terms of strengths versus weaknesses, because I want to be sure that wasn\u2019t conflated, the strong markets include the Mid-Atlantic, Sunbelt, Northern California and really there are only a handful of soft markets. SoCal, we have talked about in these market that\u2019s been flat all year. In terms of dispersion, there is a fair amount of sameness in the trend, whether you look at it on a quarterly or a calendar year basis. So rents are trending in the annualized rate from the third quarter that Tim discussed, with some markets moderately ahead, like the strong markets I described and then just really one or two markets that are notably weaker. So I guess I suppose there\u2019s that dispersion. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Mike Mueller : Yeah. Hi. I know you have used land in the past for higher and better uses, but do you think you would be looking at these development, the data center developments to the same degree that you would be looking at them if you weren\u2019t seeing a normalizing of a traditional industrial demand? Hamid Moghadam : Absolutely. Because the margins embedded in the data center development, Mike, are orders of magnitude higher, certainly on the basis of market value under industrial use or purchase price under industrial use. So we would be doing that even if the market was tight as a drum. And by the way, let\u2019s not get carried away. The market is in the high 4s occupancy, I mean, vacancy, sorry, that is absent 2021 and 2022 I would have said that would be my Christmas present would be vacancy rates that are sub-5 in any part of the cycle other than the last couple of years. So the markets are strong, but the data center opportunities, if you can get the power, the demand is there and it\u2019s been boosted by AI and a bunch of other things. So we see sort of a rush of data center opportunities and the large players and they are all big credit players into the business and they can\u2019t get enough of this stuff to keep up with demand. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Bill Crow with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Bill Crow : Yeah. Thanks. Two quick questions. First of all, on the economy, I am wondering if you are seeing any changes to your watch list among your tenants or any sectors in particular that are starting to show weakness. And the second question is really in order to get the kind of 9% ROE returns on acquisitions, do you have to target longer waltz or how do you get that if we don\u2019t see distress among current holders or owners? Thanks. Hamid Moghadam : So our credit issues are fairly modest and they usually involve retailers and we have a build-in 85% plus mark-to-market on those leases that we have identified as potential risks. And we have actually captured some of those spreads and already improved our position by buying out those leases or just getting them back and releasing the space in a short period of time. So I don\u2019t think credit is a particularly important consideration in this cycle. Tim Arndt : And then the second question on the waltz, extended waltz being necessary for the kind of IRRs we are targeting in acquisitions. Hamid Moghadam : We are using the same lease terms in acquisitions than we always have been. There is not -- I mean, if you look at 30 years of history, I mean, our waltz have been between four and a half years and six years or something like that on average in our leases. So it doesn\u2019t move around that much. Tim Arndt : Yeah. I would just pile on there that we look at these opportunities of whether it be one year to three years or four years of negative leverage as an opportunity, really. We look at total return on every deal. And again, we take it through our filters of quality, mark-to-market and whether we want to hold it long-term or not and then we layer that on with our potential essentials, revenues and synergies and otherwise. So while it\u2019s one consideration, so are all these other factors. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Blaine Heck : Great. Thanks. I just wanted to follow up on guidance. You touched on this a little bit, but guidance implies a decrease in FFO in the fourth quarter. Can you just talk a little bit more specifically about some of the moving pieces there and one-time items that are influencing the numbers in the third or fourth quarters and whether any of that noise is going to persist into 2024? Tim Arndt : Yeah. To answer the last part, no, I don\u2019t expect anything into 2024. Basically, of the $0.03, a couple of pennies that were related to termination income from some leases that were canceled and then higher interest income. There\u2019s about $0.02 there I would call that, that\u2019s permanent to the year and then the other penny in the quarter I would say is more of a timing issue, specifically in taxes. We will see some lower taxes in the third quarter, but higher again in the fourth quarter. So if you take that with regard to the rule, if you take that $0.03 out, you are basically rolling from, let\u2019s call it $1.30 million to $1.28 million in the fourth quarter is what\u2019s implied in our guidance. And basically, you would roll NOI forward. We are going to add -- probably add $0.02 from just base same-store growth quarter-over-quarter. And then the declines are going to come from mainly ramping of development. We see much more investment and land and CIP starting to build. And you should be aware in your models, our cost of funding development in the short term is essentially 6%. Think of that as SOFR plus our line rate. We are capping interest at our in-place debt is how this works. That\u2019s at 3%. So in the short-term, that\u2019s a drag on core FFO seen mainly in interest expense. Obviously, over the long-term, the margin in value creation is there. But we will see that drag pick up as development\u2019s ramp. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. Good morning. Two quick ones here. First, on the utilization rate that picked down a little bit this quarter, I was wondering if you can provide any more color around that. And second, if you look at the larger development landscape and look at competitors that are developing, I would assume that the pressure for them to lease up space and maybe they have to pay back the loans to banks probably increases as we move forward. I am not sure how big these developers are or how much capital they have behind them. But is there any risk that as these developers look to secure tenants that could drive rental rates lower going forward? Chris Caton : Hey, Ki Bin. I will take the utilization question. Thanks for it. As you see on the page in supplemental, there are multiple metrics on the page and we look at all of them in totality and additional ones that are not included in the supplemental. So we have a range of proprietary data, whether it\u2019s our IBI survey, tenants in the market, customer decision-making timeframes, our sales pipeline. Specific to the utilization data, that lags. That does not lead economic and real estate cycles we have seen that over time. And so what I think this is best understood in the context of today\u2019s retail sales numbers, which shows a resilient consumer that is outperforming expectations and leading to lower utilization levels. Hamid Moghadam : Yeah. On the second issue of opportunities, there are a lot of merchant developers that are bank financed and active in the market and they are just about completing their projects now. They have some interest reserve built into their lease-up plans, but their lease-up plans are going to get extended. So actually, I think, what\u2019s going to happen is that they can\u2019t really be afford to rent the space at the lower rate. I think they are more likely to sell their positions to people with stronger balance sheets and we have already seen and taken advantage of a couple of instances like this. So don\u2019t be surprised to see us buy some vacant completed shelves at discounts to replacement costs, because -- it\u2019s -- because of our view on demand and supply, with 65% decline in supply, we think if you get into late 2024, early 2025, we are going to be in a pretty strong market. So this is where balance sheet matters. This is where quality of location and product matters, and we are going to be very selective about the projects that I described. But that\u2019s why we have been building our balance sheet and keeping our leverage around 20% all this time. This is when we put it to work. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed with your question. Vince Tibone : Hi. Good morning. I have a follow-up on an earlier comment about 20% of your markets you are managing for occupancy not pushing rent. So what are those markets where industrial landlords have less pricing power today? Tim Arndt : Sure, Vince. We covered a couple of them. I talked about Southern California. I point to Houston, Indianapolis, and then outside the U.S., the softest market might be Poland. Hamid Moghadam : And China. Tim Arndt : And China and I think I\u2019d offer now that market vacancies are beginning to gap out again, I think we are going to see quality make a bigger difference in terms of portfolio mix. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Vikram Malhotra : I just wanted to get your thoughts to just clarify one thing more broadly. Two trends, I guess, one, just the whole reshoring team that we are hearing more and more about. And then second, just Amazon as they have put a lot of capital into the coast and across the country. I am just wondering sort of when you marry those two things together, is there sort of greater investment moving towards the Midwest or more manufacturing pockets? Is that an opportunity for PLD going forward? Hamid Moghadam : So, generally speaking, I would say, on where manufacturing is taking place, in Asia, there\u2019s a lot of manufacturing still in Asia. It\u2019s not all in China and it had been gradually declining in China in the last couple of years anyway. It was first moving to western China and then it was spreading to other places in Southeast Asia. But there are going to be strong flows still from those places. It\u2019s just not going to be all from China. But the container doesn\u2019t care whether it\u2019s coming from somewhere else or China. It lands in the same ports. Secondly, demand in our product is mostly driven by consumption and not manufacturing. In manufacturing, the finished product ends up in a container and on a truck or a ship. So the warehouse is a truck or a ship. So that manufacturing per se doesn\u2019t generate a lot of demand. When those containers land in places where consumption takes place, that\u2019s when the demand is generated for deconsolidation. Now those markets happen to be in populous parts of the country, because that\u2019s where the consumption is and those markets tend to be high barrier to entry markets. So we don\u2019t think the dynamic of on-shoring to the extent that it exists is going to change things around all that much. The biggest beneficiary of on-shoring has been actually near-shoring and it\u2019s been in northern Mexico. Northern Mexico markets are 100% occupied and there\u2019s insatiable demand for product in those markets and most of that is for distribution buildings that are used for manufacturing purposes. So that\u2019s where we have seen the material demand. If there\u2019s more demand coming for manufacturing in the U.S., A, we haven\u2019t really seen it and if we do see it, we will be the beneficiary of it because we are well positioned in those central markets as well. Operator : And our last question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Blaine Heck : Great. Thanks. Hamid, just a bigger picture question for you. Can you talk about how you are thinking about managing exposure to geopolitical risk and instability and maybe to what extent the latest turmoil in the Middle East could impact your operations, if at all? Hamid Moghadam : Yeah. I think the effect is going to be indirect, because the Middle East is not obviously a source of product or exports or we are not active in any of those markets. So it will be a second order effect on the macro economy. And if the Fed remains very aggressive on rates, if you believe their talk and all of a sudden we have some drop off in demand, because that conflict expands and the nightmare scenario would be that a couple of tankers get sunk in the Persian Gulf at the narrow end and oil goes to $200 a barrel. I mean, the bets are off. But boy, if we see that scenario, I can\u2019t think of a better business to want to be in and I hate to see that scenario happen. But actually on a relative basis, it should be good for our business, because it will mean that people will, first of all, inventory becomes really important and it means that -- it\u2019s yet one more uncertainty like the pandemic, like the earthquake, like all these other disruptions that we have seen that will push the general posture of companies from just in time to just in case. So I hate to say it would be good because it\u2019s an awful situation that\u2019s going there and before this is all over, a lot of innocent people are going to get killed and I don\u2019t want to see this happen. But I don\u2019t think its impact on the business on a relative basis is going to be terrible. I am honestly more worried about the Fed overdoing it than that conflict escalating. But those things are very hard to predict. I think that was our last question. So we really appreciate your participation. Really look forward to seeing all of you at our upcoming Investor Day and I promise it will be really good. So take care. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the Prologis Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce to you, Jill Sawyer, SVP with Investor Relations. Thank you, Jill. You may begin. Jill Sawyer : Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates, as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or other SEC filings. Additionally, our fourth quarter earnings press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP and in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. I'd like to welcome Tim Arndt, our CFO, who will cover results, real-time market conditions and guidance. Hamid Moghadam, our CEO and our entire executive team are also with us today. With that, I'll hand the call over to Tim. Tim Arndt : Thanks, Jill. I'd like to start our call by recognizing and thanking our team for the incredible effort given over 2023. While it was a turbulent year in many ways, we ended it by delivering nearly 11% earnings growth and driving our 12-year earnings CAGR since merger to 10.3%. We deployed over $7 billion into new investments, raised nearly $2 billion of strategic capital in a very challenging environment and delivered excellent operating results while serving and growing customer relationships. We're also appreciative of the opportunity we had at our Investor Forum last month to share our vision and outlook for the company over the coming years. The environment is setting up in line or better than our expectations with development starts across the market continuing to decline by two-thirds from peak and an improvement in customer sentiment that appears more constructive than just 90 days ago. That said, we still see challenges in some submarkets as near-term outsized deliveries are met with still recovering demand. But our thesis remains the same as we've been describing for over a year and detailed last month in New York, which is that the supply cliff will converge with normalized demand later this year, delivering an environment conducive to strong market rent growth. We believe that annual market rent growth will average between 4% and 6% over the next three years, with 2024 being modestly positive and ramping thereafter. Turning to our results. We finished the year strong with quarterly core FFO, excluding promotes of $1.29 per share, bringing the full year to the top end of our guidance $5.10 per share. While market occupancy declined by approximately 100 basis points, our portfolio gained 10 basis points to end the year at 97.6%. Net effective rent change over the quarter was 74%, bringing the full year to a record of 77%, with another impressive results out of Southern California at over 150%, a reminder that it remains the strongest market for cash flow growth despite near-term choppiness given the large quantum of its lease mark-to-market. In the end, same-store on a net effective basis was 7.8%, while cash was 8.5%. We started over $2 billion of new developments in the quarter across 46 projects in 27 markets with nearly 50% of the activity in build-to-suit. In Energy and as seen in our new supplemental disclosure, we stand at year end with approximately 515 megawatts of solar and storage in operation with an additional 70 currently under construction. We had a quiet quarter on the financing front, raising approximately $300 million, but our full year of activity closed out at over $12 billion at a weighted average rate of 4.5% and term of 10 years. Our total debt portfolio remains at an overall in-place rate of just 3% with more than nine years of average remaining life. Turning to market conditions. The increase in fourth quarter market vacancy was in line with our expectations and driven by demand that remained moderate as customers exercised caution in their spending, while completions hit an all-time high. Development starts, however, have continued to fall across the U.S. and Europe, extending and deepening the future supply shortfall. On the ground, our teams are seeing revived customer interest with healthy showing activity to start the year. This includes build-to-suit inquiries, which we expect to remain active for Prologis following a strong year in 2023. Our proprietary metrics point to normal levels of activity with proposals and gestation timing in line or a bit better than historical norms. Utilization declined in the quarter to approximately 83% and keeping with this morning's report a decrease in the inventory to sales ratio. We view this positively because utilization also increased from here as stronger than expected retail sales over the fourth quarter and holiday season drove lower inventories, which will need to be replenished. Turning to market rents. Our global view is that rents declined this quarter by 90 basis points, but predominantly impacted by an estimated 7% decline in Southern California. Our full year view is that global market rents grew by 6%, just below our expectations, ultimately driving our lease mark-to-market to end the quarter at 57% after capturing approximately $100 million in realized NOI growth from leases rolling up to market. The outlier on rent growth is clearly Southern California. While our portfolio was only 2.6% vacant at year end, growing availability has made leasing very competitive. Combined with a 110% increase in rents since 2020, the rent retracement is understandable. Historically, there has never been a market where the delta between expiring and market rents has been so large that it provides ample room for property owners to deviate from market in order to attract customers. But looking ahead, the positive news is that we are launching two trends reverse. The first is that the supply pipeline is clearly emptying with little in the way of new starts. And the second is that the escalating issues in both the Suez and Panama canals together with the resolution of the West Coast labor negotiations are moving shipment volumes back to the West. While this bodes well for SoCal and still early, we are watching East Coast port markets more closely. In any event, all of these disruptions are reiterating the underlying need for resiliency and the just in case approach to inventories. Summing this all up globally, we recognize the high volume of near term deliveries that need to be absorbed into our markets over the next few quarters. But we are very pleased with our ability thus far to build occupancy, drive rents, and illustrate more differentiation in our portfolio as market vacancy grows. As for Strategic Capital and Valuations, we saw U.S. values decline approximately 5.5% during the quarter, which was our expectation and the reason we paused our appraisal based activity, which includes calling and redeeming capital as well as asset contributions. We run an industry leading franchise in which we aim to set the standard for governance, including timely, accurate, and independent valuations. Calling out when pronounced lags and valuations emerge has protected investors and demonstrated how we stand apart as a responsible partner. With this quarter's value declines in a more stabilized rate environment, we'll resume activity in USLF including the funding of our $250 million commitment announced in the second half of '23. Turning to guidance and all at our share. In terms of operating metrics, we are guiding average occupancy to range between 96.5% and 97.5% with occupancy likely to step down in the first quarter and rebuild over the course of the year. Cash same-store will range between 8% and 9% and net effective same-store growth will range from 7% to 8%. We are forecasting net G&A to range between $420 million and $440 million and Strategic Capital income to range from $530 million to $550 million. We have a very big year of stabilization activity ahead of us with a range of $3.6 billion to $4 billion, and expected yields of approximately 6.25%. On the new deployment front, we are guiding development starts to range between $3 billion and $3.5 billion with the estimated build to suit mix of 40%. And we plan to take sale portfolios to the market over the year with expected proceeds to range between $800 million and $1.2 billion and additionally forecast $1.75 billion to $2.25 billion in contributions to our Strategic Capital vehicles. In the end, we are forecasting GAAP earnings to range between $3.20 and $3.45 per share. Core FFO excluding promotes will range from $5.50 to $5.64 per share, while core FFO including net promote expense will range between $5.42 and $5.56 per share, each a bit higher than our preliminary guidance at the Investor Forum. While we do not forecast any promote revenue at this time, there are some small opportunities that do exist in FIBRA Prologis and our new PJLF vehicle in Japan. In closing, we know that the market is not yet out of the woods with regards to incoming supply, but the combination of a stronger backdrop continued low level of starts and a calmer capital markets environment has us optimistic that 2024 will be another great year. As you know from our Investor Day, we have many initiatives in flight designed to add value beyond our real estate and because of our real estate. We look forward to continuing to execute on our plan and providing you updates throughout the year. And before we move to Q&A, I'd like to get ahead of questions which have grown a little more frequent in recent quarters surrounding market rent growth. Unintentionally, we set an expectation that we could forecast market rents to a single point of accuracy in increasingly short time periods, and honestly, we're just not that good. We've gotten away from a practice that was originally aimed at being high level and directional. So what we've elected to do in order to help investors without perpetuating the issue is to simply provide high level rent growth expectations on a rolling 12 month forward view. As mentioned earlier, in terms of our three year CAGR of 4% to 6%, we believe we'll see modestly positive rent growth aligned with inflation over the next 12 months and we'll continue to update this rolling view on our future calls. With that, we will now take your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Please proceed with your question. Thomas Catherwood : Excellent. Thank you. Kind of, maybe taking a look at your leasing spreads, obviously very strong performance during the quarter, but also a big spread between Prologis share and the kind of overall portfolio performance, which suggests a stronger performance out of the U.S. Going forward in the '24, are you expecting this gap in performance to tighten at all or should the U.S. continue to lead the way as far as spreads go this year? Tim Arndt : I'll take that. I think, Tom, that it will actually be relatively similar. There's a pretty long tail on how the lease mark-to-market is going to affect quarterly rent change. It will sustain for quite a while in other words. And since it's much more pronounced in the U.S. than anywhere else in the world, I would expect we do see that continue to stay wide. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ronald Kamdem : Hey, just two quick ones from me. So one, we've been looking at a lot of the broker reports talking about rising availability rates. You guys have flagged it as well. So just curious what you guys are seeing in sort of the Sun Belt markets versus sort of the Coastal. And if that's trending sort of in line or with your expectations and so forth, would be the first. Thanks. Chris Caton : Hey. It's Chris Caton. I'll take that. So the year is -- or the year closed out with market vacancy rates at mid-5%, just like Tim described, and the vacancy rates remained lower on the coast, excuse me, so both East Coast and West Coast and higher in the Sun Belt. What we are seeing as it relates to pricing is there was better pricing, better rent growth in the Sun Belt markets outperforming the Coast in 2023. Ronald Kamdem : Great. And if I could just follow up on the market rent growth comment. I think you said, rolling 12 months sort of inflationary plus or minus. So, clearly, that's implying sort of an acceleration in '25 and '26, as supply comes down to that. Is that sort of how you guys are thinking about it? Tim Arndt : That's exactly right. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Craig Mailman : Great. Thanks. Two quick ones here. I guess, first question would be, could you guys just go through what the uptick in property improvements in the CapEx section were? There's a pretty big jump in 4Q versus prior quarters. And then just second, Tim, you had kind of touched on this that tenant sentiment is improving here and there may be better traffic going back to the West Coast with everything going on the Red Sea, and the realization that just in case maybe a more prudent inventory method. But I'm just kind of curious because big tenant leasing has been kind of slower over the last 12 months to 18 months. Are you seeing any early green shoots on that improving as you guys are talking with customers? Tim Arndt : Yeah. I'll take the first part here, Craig. On the CapEx, if you take a look at the supplemental, I'd first start by widening out on overall CapEx before staring at property improvements and there is just a good example here of the need to look at annual or trailing numbers as this can be a pretty volatile number quarterly. Here, you can see on the full year as a percentage of our NOI, we are about 14%, roughly 15% the prior year. And yeah, focusing in on property improvements, I'd suggest the same that you have to look at a trailing basis. We do tend to see higher levels of property improvement activity in the fourth quarter, just by nature. But we are catching up on the full year. You can see we averaged $0.12 on the year versus the $0.21 that we had in the quarter. So that's really just a timing issue. One more thing that you can see here is the year-over-year averaged on that basis $0.12 versus the prior year $0.10, and I'd explain that differential as just some inflationary piece. And then, the second would be some deferred maintenance and work that we're executing on the Duke portfolio. Dan Letter : And maybe -- this is Dan. Craig, on the second part of your question related to tenant sentiment, I would say, at the Investor Day, we had talked about a marginally better tenant sentiment from the Q3 earnings call. And I would say, it's even marginally better than that in the last 30 days. This is fueled by our healthy proposal volumes. Customer dialogs have been strong. 45% of our available space is in discussion right now with active proposals. We've anecdotally had just a number of conversations with our customer-led solutions group. Our build-to-suit conversations are improving as well. Our overall build-to-suit pipeline has grown quarter-over-quarter. So, whether that be some of the issues related to the Red Sea issues and the Canal issues or not, I think Chris will have some comments on that. Chris Caton : Yeah. I'll just go further, Craig, as it relates to port activity. We went out on a limb in September with the published research report calling for recovery in market share and that is really, really playing out in the port activities. In November, West Coast ports were up 24% year-on-year, inbound shipments are up even more and that will translate to leasing over time. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Caitlin Burrows : Hi. Good morning, team. Tim, earlier you mentioned how development starts are down maybe two-thirds from the peak, and that you're seeing little in terms of new starts broadly. When we look at your own build-to-suit split of development, it is up year-over-year and then that earlier question just on customer sentiment. So, I guess, combining all of those pieces, how do you think that impacts your decision to do spec development versus build-to-suit over the course of this year? Dan Letter : Caitlin, this is Dan. I'll respond here. A few thoughts for you. First of all, we started just over $1 billion worth of spec in the fourth quarter. So, we had talked over the last several quarters about the decline in starts in the marketplace and that's when we wanted to come out of the gate here with some starts and that's what you're seeing us do right now. We have a pretty healthy guidance here for the 2024 starts, at owned and managed of about $4 billion. And if you think about it, that's 25 million square feet or so of starts that we could be doing this year. And we have a development portfolio right now of about 50 million square feet. So, we've got an appetite for spec. Our build-to-suit volume we think is going to shake out in that 40% range as we've projected. And then keep in mind, we talked about this plenty at the Investor Day, we have $40 billion worth of opportunities in our land bank. And we have the ability to make decisions on a quarterly basis where we're going to build. We own this land in 50 markets around the globe, 300 different sites. So, plenty of opportunities there. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks, and good morning. I just wanted to touch on the development start guidance of $3 billion plus this year. Can you just help us break that down versus -- so traditional industrial versus like data centers or other property types? And does the pre-lease percentage that you're expecting differ a whole lot? And sorry to add a third here, typically, how long would the data center developments take to cash flow? Dan Letter : Sure. Ki Bin, this is Dan, I'll hit that. First of all, we gave some guidance on our data center business 30 days ago at Investor Day. We talked about over the next five years, 20 or so opportunities, 3 gigawatts of data centers, $7 billion to $8 billion worth of investment. Those numbers have not changed. As a matter of fact, one thing we couldn't disclose at Investor Day was, we started over $500 million worth of data centers in the fourth quarter alone. You won't see us guide to data centers. These are very lumpy deals. And if you think about our data center opportunities, we own over 5,500 buildings. We own or control over 12,000 acres globally. So we have one of the most important components of data centers. We control the land, right? We talked about power applications at Investor Day. We talked about a number below 50, that number is now approaching 60. Our team is very active growing that data center pipeline. Then the third component of it would be customers and we're talking to the big hyperscalers on a regular basis. And we think it's prudent for us to be careful on how we project out what our data center volume will be because there is a competitive nature to this as well. We're negotiating with these customers and we think it's important for us. So we will absolutely share with you, when these projects are on the horizon. But right now, our start volume is largely industrial. And then keep in mind, our data centers business is a part of our long -- higher and better use business we're going to build. We're going to merchant build these and we're going to recycle that capital into the business we love so much which is logistics. Tim Arndt : Yeah. So your question about how long it will take them to cash flow and there is a wider range than traditional industrial. But I would say on kind of powered shell, it's more in the 12 month to 15 month range from start. And on turnkey, depending on who does it and whether the customer does it or we do it, it could be longer than that by about a year, because since the installations are pretty complicated to get these going. But all of that is built into the budgets and the economics of the transaction. And this point that Dan made on the negotiating posture is really important. I mean, the last thing we want to do, there are four or five customers out there and it's pretty obvious given the scale of the numbers they can figure out which project is in our guidance for the next quarter if we wanted to go in that direction, and that basically reduces our leverage. So we're just not going to do that. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Jay Poskitt with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Jay Poskitt : Hey, thanks. Good morning. I was wondering, if you could just provide a little bit of commentary on the supply and demand trends over the next couple of quarters. You previously said that you think deliveries will outpace demand for the next couple of quarters and then the inverse will happen after that. So just any update on that would be great. Chris Caton : Hi, Jay. It's Chris Caton. So we project 250 million square feet of net absorption in the calendar year and 285 million square feet of completions. And yeah, that's going to be front-end loaded, particularly on the supply side. And so we think you'll see the vacancy rate rise by another 50 basis points to 75 basis points here in the first half of the year, peaking at 6% maybe 6.1%, and then making a meaningful move through the subsequent rest of the year and into 2025 and 2026 based on the trend in starts that we've profiled for you. Tim Arndt : Let me just punctuate that, the vacancy rates will go up through the second quarter. So don't be surprised by that. But we're pretty confident they'll come back down after that. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Nicholas Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. Nicholas Yulico : Thanks. I just wanted to go back to the space utilization comment you made, Tim, about feeling that at this point retailers like we have to restock inventories. So this is actually a good sign where space utilization is. I guess, I'm wondering, if you could give us some reminder sort of seasonally how this may play out historically in terms of leasing demand picking up from 3PL or retailers because of that issue of restocking? And then, as well in terms of the lease proposals picking up in the fourth quarter, if you had any benefit already from that industry, or even anecdotally, you could talk a little bit about the discussions there. Thanks. Tim Arndt : Yeah. So the easy way of thinking about this is -- is this -- basically absorption and demand for our product follows a one, two, three, four scenario, as you move through the quarters, it's back end loaded towards the fourth quarter. And that's historically been the relationship because so much of the activity occurs in the fourth quarter and so much of that activity would have been based on anticipation laid earlier in terms of the Christmas season, so much of the sales are in the Christmas season, that volatility is the most in the fourth quarter. This year, our retail sales and in particular e-com sales were better than people's expectations. And the retailers were cut short in '21, they were a little overstocked in '22 and now they were back to being very careful with inventories. So they got cut in short of inventories again. That's why utilization is done. They're schizophrenic. They always have too much or too little. You can never get it right. And the good news is that this Christmas season was stronger than everybody anticipated. It's going to take for that to work its way back to normal. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Blaine Heck : Great. Thanks. Can you just talk broadly about valuations in cap rates? And given the continued movement in the 10 year, I guess, do you think that pricing is adjusted correctly or could we see continued volatility in the near term? And I guess does that potential volatility present you with any investment opportunities? Tim Arndt : Yeah. We don't think the real pricing and real returns have really changed because a return expectation should have been higher six months ago because the higher treasury rates. But nobody was trading based on those higher return requirements. So nothing really happened. So it was a theoretical decline in values. I think with the treasuries now having come down, I know they've gone up a little bit just most recently, but net-net, they're down. I think the reality is the expectations of the market participants and the theoretical pricing of assets is converging. Bottom line, we think we're seeing the near bottom valuations, both in the U.S. and Europe. And I think with this level of stability and sort of bottom forming, you'll see more volume coming through in terms of real deals. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Michael Goldsmith : Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Another supply demand question, but just as we think about the cliff of new deliveries coming online, it sounds like that, that drops off in the second quarter. Is there an extended period of time where we're going to need to lease these up? And so the inflection when supply gets better and then combined with what you're seeing on the demand side, does that mean that -- does that happen through the third quarter and into the fourth quarter, or is that kind of happening just as soon as the deliveries slow? Thanks. Chris Caton : Hi. It's Chris. So I'll start off by offering, look, the vacancy rate is going to go up to 6%. Hamid and I are very clear or the whole team is clear on that. Bear in mind that's a very low level in the context of history. And so, yes, it will take -- there'll be time for vacancy to decline to soak up that availability, but it's going from a low level to an even lower level. So it's a bit like the vacancy rate is going to go from 6%, it's going to move to 5.5% and likely to 5%, given the supply cliff that we see. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Camille Bonnel with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Camille Bonnel : Hi. Good morning. Your outlook for development stabilizations is quite positive despite the supply environment remaining elevated for the first half of this year. So could you just expand on what the expected timing is around for this? And then, if you can just follow up a little bit more on your comments around tenant inventory. What are they telling you in terms of how they plan to adapt to any persisting disruption around East Coast ports? Thank you. Dan Letter : Camille, this is Dan. I'll start with your question on stabilization. It is a big year on stabilizations for us. We actually started the year out with some good news. Late December, we actually pulled in for stabilizations that we had expected to happen in the first quarter of 2024. But overall, the timing of those stabilizations, it's spread out pretty well throughout the year. And one number I would just point to is, that 2024 stabilization volume is 46% leased already, which is actually 300 basis points, 400 basis points above the average at this point over the last several years. Chris Caton : Hey, Camille. It's Chris. I want to jump in on the disruption of the ports. We are really just now seeing the diversions, as it relates to disruptions in both Panama and the Red Sea and Suez. And so, it's a bit early for us to see real medium term leasing decisions in response to these disruptions. But number one is the clarification or the ratification of the labor agreement on the West Coast is providing a clear landscape for decision making and engines of growth are beginning to kick in in Southern California. Dan Letter : Let me make that point a little stronger. I think all this concern about LA is over, and it hasn't shown up in the numbers yet, but it will in the next six months. So, I don't think we'll be sitting here on calls like this worrying about LA and its absorption. Now, will we worry about something else? I'm sure we will. I don't know whether that's going to be the East Coast or Houston or whatever. But yeah, I mean, you've seen two big movements. It's not just Suez, it's also Panama Canal and the water issues there. And the expense of shipping stuff through the canal is leading to more reversion back to the normal way of doing it, which is getting it to LA and then land, bridging it over, but there could be other disruptions. It could be something can blow up in the Persian Gulf. So it's very hard to predict those things. The big message is this, we can spend a lot of time guessing as to what the share of West Coast is, East Coast is, all of that. The point is, people thought COVID was the big unknown factor. And now that COVID is over, the world is going to go back to a stable, predictable, just in time type of inventory strategy. I think each one of these things, whether it's Panama, whether it's Suez, whether it's -- or in the Middle East, whether it's something in the Persian Gulf, will remind people that they generally need to have a more conservative inventory strategy. And that's the big long term driver which is going to be a tailwind for demand that we haven't really seen play out just yet. We're pretty confident that will. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Michael Mueller : Yeah. Hi. Do your comments about seeing revived customer interest apply to big-box leasing as well? Tim Arndt : Yeah. In fact, I would say, some of the largest customers that we talk to, are to -- use an overused word. There are definitely some green shoots. Their posture is changing from that of let's hold off. And they've held off as long as they can because they're building out their networks, particularly on the e-com side. And I think given that the economy hasn't tanked like everybody thought it would a year and a half ago, I think they're tiptoeing out there, and with the first couple of doing it, I think the rest will follow. So, I think, yeah, the big-box guys are coming out of the shadows and taking up some space again. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. John Kim : Thank you. On your commentary on Southern California coming -- rents coming down 7%. Can you give the same color on New York, New Jersey? That's a market you've seen a larger decline sequentially in occupancy, and not you're discussing issues with port volumes and the canals. Tim Arndt : We are not going to get into quarterly rent forecast and we're not going to get into market-by-market forecast. We run a 1.2 billion square foot business. And I think we already, in terms of a company of our size and disclosure and details, are definitely in the 99th percentile. And we just don't have that ability. So we're not going to put some numbers out there that we can't be certain of. So, if you don't mind just let's stay away from that fine level of dissection beyond our ability. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Nick Thillman with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Nicholas Thillman : You guys touched on a little bit on the [Technical Difficulty]. At your Investor Forum, you kind of mentioned that you expected ex-U.S. to outperform U.S. in a market rent growth standpoint. It's still -- is that still the case? And then maybe could you just highlight some markets that you're a little bit more incrementally positive on over the last 30 days of activity? Thanks. Chris Caton : Hi. It's Chris. Yeah. Indeed, we saw international outperform in the fourth quarter. Our view is that it'll outperform in 2024. And there are wide range of international markets that are enjoying really strong market rent growth. Latin America, both Brazil and Mexico. Turning to Europe, probably Northern Europe is the strongest, and then here in North America, Toronto is a market that's also enjoying outsized growth. Tim Arndt : Yeah. UK is outperforming too. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Vikram Malhotra : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just two quick ones. So, just first of all going back, Chris, I guess to your comment around 250 million in demand, if I heard that correctly in '24. Can you just give us what's the actual number in '23, you're comparing that to? And with your leading indicators just how long does the -- do the leading indicator sort of take in terms of conversion to leases? So, that's just the first one to understand the comparison of the trajectory. And then second, do you mind just giving us some specifics on what you're baking in for numbers for cash rent spreads and where portfolio mark-to-market is? Thank you. Chris Caton : Hey. It's Chris. Thanks for the question, Vikram. I'll take the first one. So, 250 million square feet of net absorption in 2024 compared to 192 million square feet of net absorption in 2023. And we consult a wide range of leading indicators, some of which are contemporary and some that have a nine months to 12-month lease. Tim Arndt : Vikram, I'll take on the -- excuse me, it's Tim, on the lease mark-to-market. I'll just say again, I don't particularly value the cash view of the lease mark-to-market. I think it's fraught with a few issues. But to answer the question, we saw that 49% at the end of the year. And I would expect, we've seen a pretty wide divergence in cash to net effective of rent spreads because of a few things, the absolute level rents has been so high and the bumps has been pretty large around 4% as you've known. So the roughtly... Chris Caton : And also Duke. Tim Arndt : Duke is a factor as well, of course. So, the roughly 20, 25 points that we've been seeing lately, I expect we'll see mostly continue into next year. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Todd Thomas : Hi, thanks. Just wanted to ask about capital deployment, two questions actually. First, can you talk a little bit more about the acquisition pipeline today and whether you are seeing an increase in seller interest to transact more deals coming to market and more product hitting the market? And then second, the spread between stabilized yields and cap rates for both development stabilizations and new starts narrowed in the quarter, can you talk a little bit about that trend in spreads and what we might expect in '24, particularly as you move forward? Just given the mix of build-to-suits in spec developments and some of the higher and better-use projects that you're ramping up on. Dan Letter : Todd, this is Dan. I'll respond to your questions here. First of all, yes, is the quick answer to your first part of the question regarding the acquisition pipeline. Our teams are out there, turning over every stone, but it was a low-volume year in the marketplace last year and I expect that to be much, much higher this year. So, very strong acquisition pipeline. And then spreads on the stabilized yields in our development portfolio, yeah, we've been talking for the last several quarters about that tightening. I remember five, six quarters ago talking about cap rate expansion and that spread tightening and what that would do to impact overall development portfolio. And that really just has to do with the cost of capital, volatile capital markets and who knows where that's going to go from here. It's certainly going to have something to do with the tenure and what the tenure does and the volatility in the capital markets. But overall, we build in forward risk in our overall development portfolio for the numbers that you actually see in that spread. Go ahead, Tim. Chris Caton : Yeah. I'll just highlight, I think if we look at the development portfolio, see the margin they are estimated at 22. Historically, that's still a very good margin. And under conservative, underwriting assumptions, I would remind everybody we've got an inflated cost to carry. And there we've got longer lease-up times and things that we expect that will be. So I am pretty confident will be several points above that estimated margin anyway. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Michael Carroll : Yeah. Thanks. I guess, maybe Chris, can you provide some color on tenants' mindsets to adding more inventory? I mean, is it fair to say that tenants, or at least some tenants have delayed these decisions over the past year, just due to the macro uncertainty? And what does this change may have customer discussions changed at all given the holiday season that you kind of highlighted and how they didn't have enough inventory levels. I mean, has that been changing, are they ready to make those investments today? Chris Caton : Hey, Mike. It's Chris. I think you might have answered your own question, totally agree with the sentiment in the direction you're taking it. And there's likely to be a different posture going forward. And then I'd also look, propose that you can also reach out to them and get their feedback. Tim Arndt : Yeah. I bet you that answer is, they have no idea. I mean, it's just been since 16 days, right? 16, 17 days since the end of the year. Many of them haven't even added up their numbers and I think those guys don't come out with earnings releases until much later. So with Michael's question, that was the last one. I wanted to thank you for not only this call but also attending our Investor Day, we got a lot of great feedback from you and we'll make these things better and better over time and look forward to talking to you next quarter, if not before. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Natasha Law, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Natasha. You may begin. Natasha Law : Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates, as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance, and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or other SEC filings. Additionally, our first quarter earnings press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP. And in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. I'd like to welcome Tim Arndt, our CFO, who will cover results, real-time market conditions and guidance. Hamid Moghadam, our CEO, and our entire executive team are also with us today. With that, I will hand the call over to Tim. Tim Arndt : Good morning and thank you for joining our call. We've had a good start to the year in terms of our operating and financial results in the first quarter. We delivered strong rent change, drove occupancy slightly ahead of our forecast, raised nearly $5 billion in capital, including $750 million in strategic capital, and made important headway in our Energy business. That said, as we evaluate the market, persistent inflation and high interest rates have kept more customers focused on controlling costs. The resulting delay in decision making, easily observed through the first quarter's below average net absorption, will translate to lower leasing volume within the year. Accordingly, we've opted to adjust our guidance early, getting ahead of what looks like a period of occupancy below our forecast in the near term and its effect on same store in a number of our higher rent markets. This is punctuated, of course, by a more pronounced period of correction still underway in Southern California. New starts, however, continues to be surprisingly disciplined, adding to the expectation for limited new supply in the back half of '24, but also extending deeper into '25. When considered alongside muted demand, we arrive at a view that the operating environment has only changed modestly in aggregate, and that demand is simply pushing out by a few quarters. The outcome of this may simply mean moving towards a long-term occupancy expectation more swiftly this year, which sets up for a better next year. Turning to our results for the quarter. Core FFO, excluding promotes, was $1.31 per share and including net promote expense was $1.28 per share, essentially in line with our forecast. Occupancy in the portfolio ended the quarter at 97%. For context, the US market declined 310 basis points since its peak in the summer of '22, while our portfolio's occupancy has only declined 80 basis points, resulting in vacancy today for Prologis that is less than half of that in our markets and reflective of our portfolio quality. Net effective rent change was 68% based on commencements and 70% based on new signings. Following this in-place increase and changes in market rents, our net effective lease mark-to-market stands at 50%, representing over $2.2 billion of rent to harvest without any additional market rent growth from here. Rent growth captured just for the single quarter was approximately $110 million on an annualized basis and at our share. Our same-store growth on a cash basis was 5.7% and on a net effective basis was 4.1%. The same-store from rent change alone was strong at approximately 9%, but is impacted by a 130 basis point change in year-over-year vacancy, as well as 150 basis points from fair value lease adjustments with the Duke portfolio's inclusion in our same-store pool. Additionally, there were approximately 175 basis points of items specific to the quarter, including one-time reconciling items from 2023, as well as unfavorable comps from low expenses last year. We started over $270 million of new developments in the quarter, bringing our portfolio to approximately $7.5 billion at our share, with estimated value creation of over $1.7 billion, a number we feel increasingly confident in with value stabilizing. In our Energy business, we've made meaningful progress on this year's deployment, including the signing of 405 megawatts of long-term storage-related contracts with investment-grade utilities. We also delivered the largest EV fleet charging project in the United States, less than 15 miles from both the ports of LA and Long beach. Finally, we raised $4.1 billion of debt across our balance sheet and funds at a weighted average rate of 4.7% and a term of 10 years. Our debt portfolio has an overall in-place rate of just 3.1%, with more than nine years of average remaining life and liquidity at the end of the quarter of over $5.8 billion. Turning to market conditions. Most broad economic data from unemployment to retail sales to the health of the consumer remain very strong. And while our tour proposal and other proprietary metrics are similarly positive, overall leasing activity and net absorption are running below expectations. Net absorption in the US, for example, was very low this quarter at just 27 million square feet. So while the macro landscape and supply chains continue to generate a need for space, we think it's prudent to expect continued headwinds on overall absorption over the next few quarters. The interest rate environment and its associated volatility have weighed on customer decision making, especially as the 10 year has increased 70 basis points from its level just 90 days ago and expectations for Fed rate cuts have moved from potentially six to now possibly zero. In parallel, sublease and space utilization rates highlight that some customers have available capacity, driven in part by the high rate of absorption through the pandemic. This dynamic of available space intersecting with the desire for cost containment is what leads to lower absorption and is playing out at different rates across submarkets and customers. For example, while slow leasing has persisted so far this year for less capitalized customers and 3PLs, we see a handful of large e-commerce and retail customers further along in this process, such as Amazon, who voiced caution two years ago, but is now active in several global markets and has openly discussed plans to commit to significant amounts of new space. The overall leasing slowdown is most felt in only a handful of markets. Southern California and the Inland Empire being the most acute. In fact, rents in most of our US markets are generally flat, several are up, and it is mainly elongated downtime affecting near-term occupancy and NOI. While Southern California leasing has been challenging, it has not slowed the tremendous uplift we realize every single quarter from rent change on rollover, which was 120% for the market in the first quarter, with the Inland Empire at 156%, nearly the highest in our portfolio. In Europe, rents grew overall during the quarter, which we believe will remain the case over the balance of the year. And of course, LATAM continues to impress with very high occupancy and market rent growth that has led the globe in recent quarters. Overall, global market rents declined slightly over 1% in the quarter, driven mostly by Southern California, and would have been slightly positive if excluded. I'd like to spend a moment on Baltimore, where we own over 18 million square feet and has been a dynamic market of ours for decades. Our employees, customers and properties are all safe following the bridge collapse last month and our customers expect to be able to withstand the disruption with little impact to their businesses. Shifting to capital markets. Valuations increased in all of our geographies, except for China, which saw a very small decline. Over the last 1.5 years, global values have decreased despite increases in cash flow due to cap rate expansion. As cap rates have stabilized, cash flow growth now has the ability to translate to value growth. Even though modest, the value uplift in the US and Europe are important as strategic capital investors have been looking for values to not only bottom, but actually turn upwards before committing new capital. With Europe a bit ahead of the US in this regard, it is indeed where we've seen stronger fund-raising interest in recent quarters. We also had a successful equity raise in FIBRA Prologis, raising over $500 million for deployment into both assets to be contributed from our balance sheet, as well as pursuits of third-party acquisitions. Transaction volumes and activity have ticked up in recent weeks and pricing has certainly improved. As always, we are actively looking at acquisition opportunities across all of our markets, but our focus remains on the development of our land bank, which provides an opportunity for over $38 billion of build out with a return on incremental capital of approximately 8.5%. In terms of guidance, in light of our views on demand and leasing pace in the coming quarters, we are reducing our average occupancy guidance to range between 95.75% and 96.75% of the 75 basis point adjustment from the midpoint. It's important to understand that approximately two-thirds of this change stems from our higher rent markets, meaning they create a disproportionate impact on same store in 2024. Same-store growth on a net effective basis will range between 5.5% and 6.5%, a reduction of 150 basis points, which accounts for the average occupancy decline, slightly lower rent change for the year as well as 30 basis points of annualized impact from the one-time items in the first quarter mentioned earlier. Our revised range on a cash basis is now 6.25% to 7.25%. We are maintaining our guidance for strategic capital revenue, excluding promotes, to a range of $530 million to $550 million and reducing our G&A guidance to a range of $415 million to $430 million. We are adjusting development start guidance for the year to a revised range of $2.5 billion to $3 billion at our share, reflecting our discipline in speculative starts and the timing impact this has in the calendar year. As we've always said, we don't consider our guidance to be a target internally and each deal ultimately needs to be rational and accretive on its own. In the end, we are forecasting GAAP earnings to range between $3.15 per share and $3.35 per share. Core FFO, including net promote expense, will range between $5.37 per share and $5.47 per share, while core FFO, excluding promotes, will range from $5.45 per share to $5.55 per share. Our updated guidance calls for core earnings growth of nearly 8% at the midpoint. As we close out, I'd like to underscore the message of the call, which is that while we have only a modest change of view in the intermediate term, our confidence in the long term is intact. And putting timing aside, we are encouraged by the outlook for supply in the back half of this year and '25, have tremendous lease mark-to-market to harvest in the interim, and are pleased to see valuations, fundraising and transaction activity all picking up. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Caitlin Burrows : Hi. Good morning, everyone. It seems like, I guess, occupancy and maybe pricing are coming in a little lower than you had previously expected. So I was wondering, could you go through how much or what pieces might be more macro driven and how much is certain markets weighing on the outlook? Tim, you did mention how some of the high rent markets are having an outsize impact. So wondering if you could just go through what might be more macro versus market specific. Thanks. Chris Caton : Hey, Caitlin. It's Chris Caton. I'll start by saying I think it's a combination of factors. For sure, as Tim described, Southern California and a handful of other high rent markets, the leasing velocity has been subdued and rent growth has been a little bit below expectations. So there is that softness. But we also want to point to a couple of quarters of deferred decision making leading aggregate customer demand across the United States to be a little bit below what we previously expected. The other thing I might add, Caitlin, would be just nominally in the sense of dollars and the impact in same store. We do see about half of our adjustments as coming from SoCal. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Steve Sakwa : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning out there. I guess, for Tim or Hamid, can you maybe just help kind of flush out sort of maybe the timing of when some of these things became a little bit more evident? I guess I'm thinking back to some of the conferences and the like in March, and my sense was the tone and concern about the business maybe wasn't as acute as it is right now. And I know you have confidence in the long term, but it sort of feels like there's a sea change in your outlook in maybe the last 30, maybe 45 days. So I guess, what is prompting that other than maybe saying hard data? But maybe just help flush out kind of the timing of this. And are there other factors at work here? Tim Arndt : Steve, let me take a stab at that. If you are sensing any acute change in our outlook, you're not reading our call correctly. We have picked a three-year window, I think, in our Analyst Day to give you our expectations. And the first year of that window has moved around. So our outlook for the back period of second and third year essentially the same and could be even better given how much deferred demand is building up. If our proposals were down, if our tours were down, I would be more concerned. But companies are out looking at this space. And if you think nothing has changed in the last 45 or 90 days with respect to the Fed outlook, you must be reading different newspapers than I am. So I would tell you that people are just scared of pulling the trigger until the Fed gives the all clear sign with the first rate cut. So, yes, we are not instantaneous in our data transmission to us and to you, but I can assure you that you will always hear our views immediately as we form them and as we get them from the marketplace. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Michael Goldsmith : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. It sounds like demand has been pushed out or the rebound in demand has been pushed out of a few quarters. So I was wondering what evidence do you have that would support that? And then how do we compare that to some of the proprietary metrics that you put together, which seem to indicate that things are actually pretty positive or accelerating? Thank you. Chris Caton : Hi, Michael. Chris Caton. Thanks for the question. As we've kind of covered in the script, and I think we are pointing out here, whether it's consumer resilience as revealed by economic indicators like the labor metrics or retail sales, whether you look at our own customers and supply chain momentum as revealed by our RBI volumes through the ports and our proposal volumes. The broader economy is generating a normal amount of demand. A couple of things to consider though. One is as you can see in utilization data and in sublease space, some customers have spare capacity that they are utilizing to accommodate some of this growth. We also have these leading indicators. We needed to simply see customers convert space requirements into signed leases. So just the simple conversion of investigation into signed leasing. And indeed, we already are seeing the front edge of some leading global e-commerce companies and other retailers begin to make space. It's just not broadly yet occurring across the whole marketplace. Tim Arndt : Yeah. The only thing I would add to that is that the effect is not uniform in all markets. And I think what's going on -- and this is a theory. This is not a fact. It's a theory, but it's based on 40 years of looking at this stuff. Southern California has over 30% share for 3PLs and the rest of the US market has a little under 20% share of 3PLs. 3PLs are serve two purposes. One, they provide outsourcing of for logistic activities, but they also create surge space. In other words, companies use 3PLs as a way of flexing up and down. So markets that have a bigger exposure to 3PLs are likely to feel the impacts of shifts in sentiment sooner than other markets on the way down and on the way up. Also, there are certain customers who have instantaneous access to sales data and activity. And I would say the e-commerce players, the big ones, have the best data on that, because they see the trends on a daily minute-by-minute basis. Those guys were early in terms of curtailing their demand. And I got to tell you, they're out there pretty aggressively and don't listen to what we say, listen to what they say in their own annual reports, in their own interviews with the press. And I think you'll see that they feel pretty confident about their business and they're a bit ahead of the curve. Now, all of this is subject to missiles not flying in the Middle East and the Fed not going crazy and God knows what else can happen in this world. So but as far as we see, the indications are really good. And this certainly does not feel like any of the other downturns that I've been part of. So again the word huge sounds a little bit of an overreaction to me. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Craig Mailman : Hey guys. Maybe coming at this from another way, and Hamid, I know you don't like the word acute, but maybe this seems a little bit more preemptive, because if you guys are seeing a lot of the metrics in line with your budget, retention was kind of in line with where you guys have been the last couple of quarters. It feels like this is an anticipation of maybe slower takedowns that you're seeing. I mean, is there anything else on the expiration side of the equation that you guys have a couple bigger known move outs now that are going to skew numbers? I'm just trying to get a sense of how much of this is actually what you're seeing real time versus just giving yourself a little bit of cushion so that you don't have to kind of readjust later in the year. And also, just a question on development. How much of this kind of occupancy decline is just developments coming out a little bit less leased than maybe you had thought? A couple of months ago, we noticed your development margins were pretty -- were single-digit this quarter. I don't remember the last time I've seen that. And is that a reflection of this? Or is there something else going on as well? Tim Arndt : Okay. Let me start that, and then I'll turn it over to Chris and then to Dan to talk about development margins specifically. We like to be early and thoughtful in outlooks that we share with you, and we've always prided ourselves in doing that. And in some cases in the past, as you know, you've been following us for a long time, we've taken pretty bold statements on the way up and on the way down and actually been proven pretty right about it. So for us to be late on this stuff is not something that we look forward to. So we always try to be on the lookout for trends that may be interesting to our investors and to you, who are looking at our company on a real-time basis. So I'm not smart enough to assign percentages of how much of this is preemptive and how much of it is. But I can tell you there's nothing going on in the portfolio. There's not some news embedded deep in our customer behavior or some market that we're not sharing with you. This is just looking at the tone of the marketplace and sharing with you what we see playing out in the next two to three quarters, nothing beyond that. And the outlook for the long term is very much the same as it was before. Dan, do you want to talk about the margins? Dan Letter : Yeah. The margins this quarter, it's actually an isolated event here. We had about 15, 17 projects stabilized. We had one project that just had a confluence of events take place, whether it be weather, some infrastructure, municipal requirements. And it just came in at a pretty negative margin, weighing down the overall average margin for the quarter. If you pull that out, our margin for the quarter would actually be more reasonable 15%, 16%. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Camille Bonnel with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Camille Bonnel : Hi. Hamid, you mentioned how the company likes to be early on calling things, but I noticed that you only updated your outlook on operations and guidance. So can you help us understand how conservative guidance levels are? Or could we see more downward revisions, for example, if you start to pull back on the capital deployment front? Thank you. Hamid Moghadam : Well, on capital deployment specifically, you may remember that I'm always saying the only reason we provide guidance is because you ask us. We actually don't have a budget or a plan for deploying capital. We look at every investment opportunity one at a time. So all our elements of our guidance. And this doesn't go for just this period. It goes for any period. I would take that one with a grain of salt. We are not afraid to deploy a lot more or a lot less capital if the market conditions warrant it. With respect to conservatism, I would say, we call it as close to the pin as we can get it with a very slight bit of conservative. Not a lot, just a bit. So that, in the majority of the cases, we are pretty confident of what we are saying, but we are not 100% confident. There could be downside beyond that. But I would say we try to call it as we see it and be careful that we don't -- we don't want to disappoint 50% of the time, which is really calling it right on the pin. We'd like to be a little more conservative than that. Now, we don't always get it right. So let's admit that. Tim Arndt : And Camille, it's Tim, I might build on your first -- the first part of your question as well, which is that at prevailing cap rates and the cost of debt and everything else, there's very little you could actually do in deployment in the year to affect earnings in year one or two. I find that deployment changes tend to have kind of a push effect on earnings. So you should probably have that in your thinking as you watch our guidance. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Nikita Bely with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Nikita Bely : Good morning, guys. The $150 million of other real estate investments. Curious, what exactly was that on the sales? And maybe also, if you could talk about the reduction in development starts. So any color on that, geographic focus or spec or something else? Hamid Moghadam : That's basically -- the $150 million is some non-core assets. And we could not hear the second part of your question. Could you repeat that? Nikita Bely : Reduction in development starts for this year. Any additional information you could provide on what drove that, whether it was geographic based or asset specific or built-to-suit pullback? Dan Letter : Yeah. Thanks. This is Dan. I'll -- I got a couple of thoughts on that point there around development starts. We adjusted our guidance on development consistent with the adjustment in the occupancy and the operating pool. So as we see demand shifting out, we just expect that we are going to start fewer buildings. We reduced it by about $0.5 billion. That's about half build-to-suit, half spec. We are raising the bar on spec. As Hamid said earlier, we put that guidance out there because you ask for it. We don't need to start these projects. We own the land. We have $38 billion worth of opportunity embedded in that land bank. We have entitlements. We have the teams. They're all geared up, ready to start. We can literally pull the trigger on $10 billion, $12 billion of that tomorrow. So we just look at that. We are just trying to be consistent and tie it to our overall outlook on demand. And there's no particular location or otherwise that we -- that drag that down. Hamid Moghadam : Yeah. And the only thing I would add to that is that even though we made the adjustment on both the built-to-suit and the spec part, the bias is greater on the spec part. We actually feel pretty good about our built-to-suit volume going forward. So it's really the spec which is discretionary, and we can, as Dan said, write that at any time. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Blaine Heck : Great. Thanks. So you've called out Southern California as being soft again. Can you just talk about any specific segments of the market that are particularly weak whether that's by submarket or size? And what makes you confident in the recovery even as it seems it might be delayed kind of relative to your original expectations? And secondly, just curious if you can expand on which other high-rent markets might be weighing on the outlook. Thanks. Chris Caton : Hey, Blaine, it's Chris Caton. Thanks for the question. So Southern California is a market that continues to soften, vacancy rates are continuing to rise, yes, after different submarkets. The softest area of Southern California is midsized and smaller units in the Inland Empire. The strongest area is probably Orange County. And Los Angeles, while subdued, has a 4% market vacancy rate, so as demand comes into that marketplace, bear in mind, demand has been negative over the last year, a very rare occurrence, as demand comes back in that marketplace, you're likely to see the vacancy rate make a difference in Los Angeles as well. In terms of other markets where we're watchful, the soft markets in the US include New Jersey, Seattle and Savannah. Hamid Moghadam : Yes. The other thing I would say about Southern California is that don't discount the effect of the port labor issue that was resolved. That took longer, a lot longer than most people thought. And that affects a lot of the people -- a lot of the users in the South Bay immediately adjacent to the ports and the like. So that market can get tight real quick if that port volume comes back. I think that the small to medium spaces in the Inland Empire are kind of a mismatch. They're, by and large, the older buildings that were built there when the market was not really designed for the big 500,000 million square foot buildings. And those are -- somebody who wants a lot of space has to go to the Inland Empire. Somebody who wants 100,000 to 200,000 feet has more choices. So that's where the softness is in the Inland Empire. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed with your question. Vince Tibone : Hi. Good morning. Could you discuss the markets of relative strength in your portfolio in terms of demand and market rents? And also, are you seeing any different levels of demand by building size, more broadly? We noticed that occupancy fell the most on a sequential basis, for buildings less than 100,000 square feet, but actually grew for buildings 250,000 to 500,000. So just curious if those trends on occupancy are kind of a fair representation of the demand profile today. Chris Caton : Hi, Vince. It's Chris Caton here. So first, in terms of strength, there is a wide range. And speaking of the benefits of diversity, the strongest markets in the world include Mexico, Texas, parts of the Southeast US, Pennsylvania, but also looking out to the Netherlands, Germany and Brazil, Toronto as well, as a strong market. You also have stable markets, Chicago, Southern Florida, Baltimore, D.C. And then really at Southern California alone is really the main weak market. So that would be the range. In terms of size categories, what you see -- what you hear in the marketplace in terms of tours and, in fact, some leases that are getting made, is there's a bit more activity, particularly among self-performing e-com and retailers at the larger end of the spectrum. That would be the main, I'd say, new news in the last 90 days. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question Ki Bin Kim : Thanks and good morning. So going back to your comments about the softer environment. I'm curious if you've seen any changes in CapEx or concessions that might be -- that might not be so apparent in the headline face rents. And second question, going back to your comments on strategic capital. Where do you think cap rates are selling out at for good assets and good markets? And does that change your view on the level of contributions that you might make going forward? Thank you. Tim Arndt : Hey, Ki Bin, it's Tim. I'll take the front half of your question just on free rent. We have seen an increase in free rent. I think what's important to remember there is we've had exceedingly low amounts of free rent granted in the last few years. And I would say the current rates that we've seen in this last quarter, and what we're bracing forward this year, would still not really be on par with long-term averages. I would say that concession is not fully back to normal. But it is turning up logically in this environment. Hamid Moghadam : Yes. In terms of where deals are being priced out, I would say nine months ago, a year ago, there was very little activity, and we were pricing deals in good markets in the US in the low nine IRRs, albeit not much was happening at those kinds of return expectations. Today, I would say those are 100 basis points lower and there's a lot more volume in that a lot of transactions happening in the marketplace in the low 8s. Europe, that number -- those numbers would be in the mid-7 IRRs. The reason I'm answering in IRR and not cap rate is that the mark-to-market in different locations is significantly vary. For example, for the same IRR, you would be a lot lower cap rate in Southern California than you would be in a market that is leased at market rents. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Please proceed with your question Thomas Catherwood : Thank you and good morning, everybody. Hamid, I appreciate your comments on rates and the Fed's actions or inaction serving as the key governor of customer activity and leasing right now. But how are you seeing supply chain disruption, like in Baltimore, and geopolitical risks impacting customer behavior, if at all? Hamid Moghadam : I don't think Baltimore has been a big deal in terms of its impact on our business. It's obviously been a big deal to the people who died in the accident and the like, but -- and to traffic patterns. But not to the customer. The customers have enough optionality that they can deal with those kinds of disruptions. I do think the geopolitical stuff has people a little wigged out, more -- definitely more than last quarter. And look at the interest rates, I mean, we're up a good 70, 80 basis points since the last time we all met. And I think that didn't happen evenly throughout the quarter. I think in the last month that sentiment has changed pretty dramatically. So I think both of those things are weighing on decisions, particularly if the decisions are discretionary. And people, when there are no choices like they were no choices in Southern California, they always lease more space than they need because they don't want to be held short. And when the opposite is and they have some choices, they take their time because they expect better deals if they wait. And that difference, even if it's minor, even if it's 5% to the upside and 5% to the downside can be a 10% swing, which are sort of the kind of numbers we're talking about here. So that's very much what happens in the short term. In the long term, demand has to match supply and they can't keep doing that forever. So now if you're going to ask me exactly what that point is, I can't really tell you. But we think it's a matter of quarters, not years. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Jon Petersen with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question Jonathan Petersen : Great. Thank you. Maybe one more question on the port of Baltimore. I know it's not a big container traffic port, but have you seen any knock-on demand show up in other East Coast markets given the dislocation that's created? And then also, maybe a part two, but I know SoCal has been weak over the past year, you've talked about that a lot, and the resets already happened. I guess I'm curious if you could help us contextualize, from where we stand today, if you compare the strength of like SoCal versus the East Coast markets like New Jersey and Pennsylvania, like from where we stand today, which one looks the best over the next year? Chris Caton : Hey, Jon, it's Chris Caton. First on Baltimore, you're right. The container traffic there is typically 50,000 TEUs a month. The time horizon of necessary diversions is not thought to be more than a couple of months. By comparison, New York, New Jersey is a 300,000, 350,000 TEU port. And a lot of these diversions have gone to Norfolk. So you've seen some leasing in Norfolk. It's not a market where we operate. So no, there are not knock-on effects. As it relates to Southern California versus the East Coast, the SoCal market remains fluid, and I believe -- we believe it will underperform. This is a six-month, 12-month view. Naturally, New Jersey has a completely different set of factors as it relates to rent growth that it's experienced over the last several years in terms of the level of demand that we see in that marketplace as well as sublease trends. Now it's not the moment to get bullish on New Jersey. Let's see the port agreement, the IOI port agreement get made. But over time, both will be very strong performers after this period of fluidity and uncertainty. Hamid Moghadam : Yes. The way I would answer that question is that if you limit it to the next 12 months, I would go PA, New Jersey, SoCal. And if you ask me for the longer term, I would go SoCal, New Jersey, PA. And I would put all three of them in the upper 1/3 of markets across cycles. Maybe the upper 20% of markets across cycles. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question Ronald Kamdem : Hey, good morning. Just hoping we could put some numbers on the soft demand that you seem to be messaging. So previously you were forecasting 1.5% of stock of net absorption this year. I'm just wondering what that number has shifted to given what's happened over the past 30 to 45 days. And if you can tie in where you see sort of availability rates and next 12-month market rent growth. Thanks. Hamid Moghadam : Yes. Let me take -- we have taken demand down for this year internally from 250 million feet in the US to 175 million, and fundamentally have kept demand at the same level going forward. What we debated that we were going to do is whether we add the 75 million that we missed this year into the subsequent two years, and that's where the bid and ask is in our shop. And we're not clairvoyant, so that's -- I'm just giving you the range of how we think about it. Now you answer the second part of your question, Chris. Chris Caton : Yes. As it relates to market vacancies, we look at vacancies, not availabilities. Availability is a range between 150 and 250 basis points above these figures, depending on the cycle. We have vacancies peaking in the mid-6s later this year. So that's up about 20, 30 basis points versus what we discussed last year. I think what's important to understand in the cycle is the recovery potential in 2025 related to each of the constituent pieces. Hamid walked you through the demand picture. But what's important to recognize is the supply picture. That was a big factor over the last year, 18 months. And the meaningful falloff in supply is marked. It's off 80% from peak. It's off about 1/3 from pre-COVID levels. So we're talking about 35 million square feet of starts in the first quarter. That annualizes to about 160 million, 170 million square feet. So you're going to actually see this snap later this year and into next year, and those vacancy rates moving noticeably down, likely to move noticeably down from mid-6s towards 5% over the course of next year. Hamid Moghadam : One other thing I would -- your response has triggered this. Vacancy rates do not linearly affect pricing power. I think when you're operating under 5%, you've got a lot of pricing power. Now whether that's 2% or 3%, doesn't matter. You have a lot of pricing power. And even though you might have two customers that really need the space, four are looking for the space because they just don't want to be cut short down the road. So it just sort of feeds on itself. When the market gets to sort of around 6%, you're at equilibrium. When it gets too much above that, you get into a soft market. And that's a macro analysis, obviously, you've got to apply that market to market in each situation. But that's the way we look at it. We don't think we're getting into those levels of vacancy that we've seen in other cycles, even during the good times. The worst that we're projecting in this period is almost as good as the best we've seen in other cycles. So that's a key distinction. And we've just been spoiled by market in three years where vacancies have been lower than they've ever been. And I think you've heard me say at times that, if the normal range of a market is 1 to 10, we've been operating in a 12, 13, and more recently, I've said we're in an 8 or 9. And today, I would say we're in probably 6.5, 7. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question John Kim : Thank you. I just wanted to get some additional color on the weaker net absorption due to tenants becoming more cost conscious. I'm wondering if this test-the-thesis that industrial rent is somewhat inelastic given it's a small portion of the overall transport and logistics costs? And also, where are tenants going in your view? Are they simply not expanding, or are they downsizing or going to less expensive markets or submarkets? Hamid Moghadam : So we've actually tried to test that theory by looking at whether Southern California's loss has translated into an equal gain in adjacent markets like Vegas and Phoenix. And the answer is, while absorption has increased in those markets, it doesn't fully account for the drop-off in Southern California. So some of that demand has just been deferred. And the question is when will deferred demand convert to real demand. And that's the $64 million question. Is it one quarter? Is it two quarters? Is it three quarters? Don't know. We think it's a couple of quarters. But it will happen. And particularly the port coming back, that part accounts for over 30% of imports in the US, and it's been basically down. So we think it's going to -- that's going to have a dramatic effect. Now we may have missed it already for this Christmas season, I don't know. But certainly, next year, that market is going to come back absent a recession or some kind of geopolitical blow-up. Tim Arndt : And John, I might just add, I guess, the way you're putting the equation together, it is what we see that, yes, the rate environment causes this consternation. But as Chris has been highlighting in a number of his answers, as we look at where utilization sits and some of the capacity that's available, it's just the first place that customers can look in terms of finding a way to continue to operate in the short term. That would ostensibly end, and we'll watch for that as utilization rises, and that's what would add to new demand. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question Vikram Malhotra : Thanks for taking the question. Just two quick ones. First of all, just on the three-year outlook. So it sounds like you're saying '24 is a bit lower than you predicted, '25 and '26 is similar. Does that essentially mean the three-year outlook is kind of adjusted down somewhat? And then secondly, just to be -- just to give us some numbers. I think what you were saying is the rest of the market rent growth is now, I guess, flattish, but SoCal is down. Do you mind just putting some more numbers on that? Like just how much is SoCal down Q-over-Q or year-over-year versus what other markets in the US are doing? Thanks. Tim Arndt : Hey, Vikram, it's Tim. We're not calling anything on '25 and '26. In my prepared remarks -- or maybe I should say, I think our view would be that our views are upheld. And what I tried to highlight in the opening remarks is that if we get to a little bit lower average occupancy this year, recognizing that our three-year forecast called for a more normalized level of occupancy in the end anyway, that's where this concept of, well, maybe the adjustment to same-store from an occupancy change is coming a bit more this year than it would otherwise next year. But right now, we would hold out our view for '25 and '26 in terms of aggregate NOI and same store. Now rent change in this very immediate term, I'm sorry, market rent growth is a little bit below expectations. That will have some effect, but that will be relatively muted through same-store over the period. Hamid Moghadam : Yes. Let's just put some numbers since you asked on it. I think in the Analyst Day, we talked about a three-year forecast for '24, '25 and '26 rental growth of -- sorry, 4% to 6%. I would say we're at the lower end of that range and maybe a little bit lower than that when you look at it over a three-year period. My number, and this is not the official number, my number would be north of 3% and around 4% probably, just shy of 4%. Chris Caton : And then just on the detailed question on what's happening in market rent growth in the first quarter. Southern California, down 6%, and US down about 1%, 1.2%. So when you multiply it through, you can see all other markets are flat. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Nicholas Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question Nicholas Yulico : Yeah, hi. I was just hoping to get a feel for, again, going back to the occupancy guidance, if there's a way that you can give us a feel for how much decline in new leasing commencements you have been embedded in the number this year. Because it sounds like the retention ratios have been better, so leasing velocity on the new side seems subdued. You talked about that leasing demand forecast being down, I think it was 30% on the numbers you gave, the 250 million to 175 million in the US. How much is like new leasing in the portfolio going to be down this year for the guidance? Tim Arndt : Well, this is Tim. I'll give it to you in this way. And this might help some of the folks who have struggled looking at the supplemental and some of the stats there, and our messaging. Because what you don't see in the supplemental would be things like, well, how much lease signing occurred in the first quarter. And that was down. Even though you see strong occupancy, that's on commencements, signings were off about 12% in the first quarter. So that's down. You can see that when you look through our pages in our leasing versus occupied statistic where there's only about a 10 basis point difference in those versus a more historical norm of 40 to 50 basis points. So those are the pieces a little bit underneath the surface that are guiding our view that the pre-leasing that we're normally looking for at this point, which is ranging four to six months ahead of commencements is shy and why we think the average occupancy is ultimately going to be lower. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question Todd Thomas : Hi. Thanks. Two questions. I guess, first, can you discuss your rent change expectations for the full year and whether anything has changed there as it pertains to the revisions to your outlook? And it looked like rent change on signings was trending in the low 70% range through February, which was higher than the rent change in the quarter. I guess, any thoughts about rent change -- trends relative to this quarter and for the year? And then my second question, in terms of the occupancy breakout by unit size and your comments about larger and smaller spaces earlier in the call, do you expect a recovery later in the year to be broad-based from a space or unit size? Or do you expect to see more strength or maybe more persistent weakness in either the larger or smaller unit size as conditions tighten up in a few quarters? Tim Arndt : Hey, Todd, it's Tim. Yes. On rent change, so as mentioned, we had 67% start in the quarter. The signings were 70. So you do get a sense that it can move up and down each quarter. You may also recall, we had very strong rent change on signings in Q4, which may leave you wondering why didn't that show up here in Q1 on the commencements? And that's speaking to just how long this pre-leasing period can be. It can be more than just three months. And for that reason, I expect we'll probably see rent change right now, my view would be it's going to be above Q1, in Q2, and then also higher on the full year, in the low to mid-70s, over 2024 is our current view. Chris Caton : As it relates to the contours, I think I'd first point you to the market color that was given earlier as illustrating the shape of the recovery going forward. As it pertains to different size categories, there is more vacancy and more availability in the over 500,000 category, but that's also where, in the last 90 days, we've seen a little bit of a pickup. So I think we'll see size categories advancing at a similar pace over the course of the year, and there'll be real differentiation across the different markets. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed with your question Vince Tibone : Hi. Thanks for the follow up. I was just curious, are you seeing any other landlords gain to offer more free rent or tenant allowances to try to attract tenants to their vacancies? Hamid Moghadam : A really interesting question. So this is what has really surprised me from this cycle. We are getting calls from merchant developers that have had financing, have completed projects and are getting panicked. And for us to look at those opportunities. Boy, we're looking at those opportunities. Because that's where a good balance sheet and that's where being on your front foot is all about. I think there were a lot of people in this business that thought, we'll just get some financing at zero cost and throw up some buildings and it will lease. And I think that's what accounted for some of that over-exuberance on the development side. And I think we're going to end up being beneficiaries of that, and I'm seeing that real time. So, yes, I think people who are merchant developers and do not have the financial wherewithal are acting in a somewhat distressed way sooner than I would have guessed. And we're happy about that. Hamid Moghadam : So that was the last question, Vince. So with that, I want to thank you for your interest. And this is part of a long story and we'll be there next quarter to tell you about the following chapters of it. Take care. Bye-bye. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

I would now like to turn the call over to Justin Meng, Senior Vice President, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Justin Meng : Thanks, Daryl. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com, under Investor Relations. I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates, as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance, and actual operating results maybe affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or other SEC filings. Additionally, our second quarter earnings press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP and in accordance with Reg-G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. I'd like to welcome Tim Arndt, our CFO, who will cover results, real-time market conditions, and guidance; Hamid Moghadam, our Founder and CEO; Dan Letter, our President; and Chris Caton, Managing Director, are also with us today. With that, I'll hand the call over to Tim. Tim Arndt : Thank you, Justin, and thank you all for joining our call. We had solid execution against our second quarter plan, which showed improvement over the first quarter, underpinned by a pickup in overall market activity. In fact, we leased 52 million square feet in our portfolio, a 27% increase over the first quarter and one of our highest quarters in the past few years. This helped in delivering occupancy, which outperformed our forecast and more importantly at rent change well over 70%. This was achieved in an environment where decision making has remained slow as many customers optimize existing footprints before committing to new space. As a result, we expect many property owners to continue to prioritize occupancy in select markets with higher availability, keeping pressure on rents. That said, the bright spot continues to be the depletion of the supply pipeline and successive quarters of very low development starts. We believe we are near peak vacancy and this dearth of new supply is setting the stage for more favorable conditions in 2025. As evidenced by very strong rent change this quarter, our lease mark-to-market is serving to sustain meaningful growth through this transition. In terms of results for the quarter, core FFO, excluding promotes, was $1.36 per share and including net promote expense was $1.34 per share. We earned promote revenue within our FIBRA vehicle in Mexico, marking the seventh year of such achievements since its IPO and speaking to the high quality of our portfolio and team in that market. Global occupancy at our share ended the quarter at 96.5%. Our U.S. portfolio continues to outperform the market by over 320 basis points, a meaningful spread that has widened from our historic norm of roughly 175 basis points. As vacancy normalizes in our markets, we expect this flight to quality to continue. We crystallized $100 million of our lease mark to market during the quarter. As of June, we estimate that the net effective market rents are 42% above in-place rents, representing $2 billion of potential NOI. Over 40% of the decline in our lease mark to market ratio is due to this quarter's mark-to-market capture. Net effective rent change was nearly 74% based on commencement and is 64% based on new signings. This metric can be volatile between quarters due to mix, but we continue to expect full year net effective rent change to be above 70%, illustrating the outsized mark to market opportunity that will remain in the near and intermediate term. Our same-store growth was 7.2% on a cash basis, 5.5% on a net effective basis, each strong despite the impact of over 100 basis points of decline in average occupancy year over year, as well as the effect of fair value lease adjustments on net effective growth from the Duke acquisition. We deployed over $700 million into new development projects and acquisitions during the quarter and also closed on over $1 billion in dispositions and contributions at values exceeding our initial expectations. We continue to grow our solar energy business with the installed capacity of our operating portfolio now at 524 megawatts, with an additional 134 megawatts currently under construction, the total of which will generate approximately $55 million of NOI once stabilized in line with our forecast. Finally, we raised $1.2 billion of debt across our balance sheet and funds at a weighted average rate of 4.4% and a term of 11 years. Outside of this total, we also launched our $1 billion commercial paper program, which has thus far saved an average of 60 basis points on our short-term borrowing costs in the U.S. In terms of our markets, there are several encouraging signs for demand, including port volumes on both the East and West Coast, as well as increased volume of proposal activity we've seen across our portfolio. While overall leasing has increased since the first quarter, the tone of our conversations with customers warrants continued caution in the near term. Even though space utilization sits at near a normal range, approximately 85%, we find that many customers simply lack urgency, still prioritizing cost containment in light of an uncertain economic and political environment, both of which will be clearer soon. In the meantime, development starts remain muted and below pre-COVID levels. Quarterly completions peaked last year at 140 million square feet and are projected to approach 50 million square feet by the fourth quarter of this year. We estimate vacancies in our U.S. and European markets will peak over the next few quarters, likely creating a shift in tone as customers assess the requirements heading into 2025. Until then, rent growth will be anemic in most markets and down modestly in some. Southern California remains its own story, where demand remains sluggish and vacancy continues to drift higher. While we've observed some green shoots over the last 90 days, we expect soft conditions to persist over the next 12 months. Globally, we estimate that effective market rents declined 2% during the quarter, with 75% of the decline attributed to SoCal. Because there is so much conflicting data available to investors, it's worth mentioning that we measure market rent growth by evaluating effective rents achieved, not asking rents before concessions, a difference that can be as wide as 5% to 10%. We'd summarize by highlighting that most of the puts and takes across our global portfolio have provided conditions that are largely stable with reason for intermediate-term optimism due to several quarters of low starts and subdued but positive demand. Turning to capital markets. Value saw modest increases in the second quarter for our U.S. and European funds. There's greater depth amongst buyers of logistics properties and lenders are more active, together reducing yield requirements. In particular, buyer pools for well-located core product are growing now with multiple bidders back in the mix. We saw this very clearly in a large portfolio sale we closed this quarter, which was originally brought to the market last fall. Interest was reasonable at the time, but we felt pricing was off, elected to wait, and achieved 28% higher value in the end. I'd like to provide a brief update on our data center business, where we are having very good momentum across our pipeline. As you know, access to power is the key to unlocking value, and our dedicated energy and sustainability teams are leveraging our expertise in net-zero carbon solutions, solar generation, and battery storage to ensure that we're in the pole position with all of the major utilities. To date, we have secured 1.3 gigawatts of power. Of this, 450 megawatts is currently under construction in $1.2 billion of TEI. 300 megawatts is in active pre-development with an expected $700 million of TEI, leaving 550 megawatts as available and currently undergoing build-to-suit discussions. Beyond all of this, we are also in advanced stages of procurement for an additional 1.5 gigawatts, which is key to delivering on our five-year outlook for $7 billion to $8 billion of total data center investment. Overall, we've made significant progress growing this business and are optimistic about the targets we laid out at our Investor Day. Turning to guidance. We are making few changes as the year is playing out to our expectations. As such, we're maintaining our forecast for average occupancy, same-store, G&A, development starts, and stabilizations. There are only a few small changes otherwise. We are lowering our guidance for strategic capital revenue by $10 million only to account for the impact of FX rates, which are hedged elsewhere under P&L and will not affect overall earnings. Due to the increased activity we're seeing in the capital markets and deals completed year-to-date, we are increasing our acquisitions guidance to a new range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion and similarly increasing our guidance for overall dispositions and contributions to a range of $2.75 billion to $3.65 billion. Ultimately, we are increasing our GAAP earnings to a range of $3.25 to $3.45 per share. Core FFO excluding net promote expense will range between $5.46 and $5.54 per share, while core FFO including promotes will range from $5.39 to $5.47 per share, a slight increase at the midpoint from our prior guidance attributed to the FIBRA promote. Our core earnings guidance calls for nearly 8% growth at the midpoint, which ranks in the 87th percentile of S&P 500 REITs. We've been unique in our ability to generate leading growth over a long period of time, not only through a superior business model and portfolio, but also from our commitment to leveraging all that comes from our scale, including adjacent verticals strategic to our core business. Our focus is simply to continue to deliver on this industry-leading and durable growth. As we close, I'd also like to highlight an upcoming event, our annual GROUNDBREAKERS Thought Leadership Forum on October 2nd in London. The program is taking shape as our best yet, exploring the surprising intersection of logistics and health, energy, and even fashion. Additional information for the forum is available on our website, and we hope to see you there or online. With that, I'll hand the call back to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Blaine Heck : Thanks. Good morning out there. It looks like your occupancy and rent spreads improved as the quarter progressed just looking at results versus the NAREIT update. Can you just talk about whether that momentum has continued into the third quarter, and if there are any specific markets that might have driven that improvement? And related to that, on occupancy guidance, the maintained guidance implies some downside during the second half of the year. Can you just talk about what's driving that trajectory, please? Tim Arndt : Hi, Blaine, it's Tim. I'll start with the first part, and I may ask you to repeat the second. I'm not sure if I understood the question. But coming into the first few weeks of the third quarter, I think we are maintaining the momentum that I guess you're inferring was picked up between NAREIT and the end of the quarter, which is that proposal activity is strong, leasing activity is strong. We see it more in renewals, a little less so in new leasing. We're achieving our rents outside of the drag that we discussed in SoCal just continues to be the market that we watch most. But I think when I put that all together, what we think is we're pleased to see the way the second quarter executed. I think it executed pretty much precisely as we expected from our discussion 90 days ago and feel good about the year. Justin Meng : Thank you, Blaine. Operator, next question. Operator : Next question. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. It's Nick Joseph here with Craig. Maybe just on the demand side. Obviously, it sounds like you're seeing and feeling an improvement there, but I was hoping you could talk about some of the demand differences across different size ranges and geographies? Chris Caton : All right. Thanks for the question. It's Chris. I'll start with the geographies. The healthiest part in the U.S. is the southeastern US. But I'd also really point out. Latin America as well as Europe as being areas that are a boost to the overall global picture as it relates to size categories the story remains the same relative to what we discussed on our last earnings call, which is to say sizes above 100, maybe even certainly over 250, and 500, that's where demand momentum is the best, but there's also more availability there. Demand is stable below 100, but that's where vacancies are especially low. Justin Meng : Thank you. Operator, next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Kamden with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ronald Kamden : Great. Just a quick question on sort of the rent growth conversation I think you talked about down 2% in 2Q after being down 1% in 1Q '24. Maybe if you could just provide some commentary on what the expectations are for the back half of the year and the 4% to 6% sort of rent growth targets long term. How do you guys think about that going forward? Thanks. Tim Arndt : Hi, Ron, thanks for the question. It's Tim. Yes, and let me start. I'll. Just reemphasize we're talking about effective rents here from all the distortion we see out there in quotation method. So this is ultimately taking rents incorporating in all concessions starting with the next 12 months. I'll do it that way, as we've described we would. We talked about at NAREIT, we basically would divide our portfolio into SoCal as its own special case and then everything else. And within everything else, there are strong, stable and weak markets, and I would put all of those other non-SoCal markets around flat. Maybe modestly negative on market rent growth over the next 12 months which is a long way of saying it's really going to be a function of what do we think SoCal does in the next 12 months when we put that all together, inclusive? Of SoCal, we would probably put that. In a range of something like 2% to possibly 5% down in the next 12 months before inflecting. And this is a good place to just remind everybody that even in light of that, I mean, we've had three quarters now of some negative market rent growth, 1% down in the fourth quarter of last year, 1% down in the first quarter, 2% down, this last second quarter. In the meantime, we're putting up very significant rent change. And growth within our NOI 74%, one of our highest quarters. Just this last quarter. So it's very fortuitous the position we're in where we have this large lease mark to market carry us through this transition period. Justin Meng : Thank you, Ron. Operator, next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Steve Sakwa : Yes, thanks. Tim, I think you commented on the lease proposals, but I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more detail. Obviously, that green line is up strongly and to the right. And I'm just curious how much of that is for new activity, for vacant space or development, and how much of that might be for renewal activity, just to frame it out, because that number is up quite a bit, even from the past couple of years. Tim Arndt : It is. And thanks, Steve. The chart that you're looking at in the supplemental is new leasing, just to be clear. And you highlight something that I'm glad you did. We do see the very big uptick in nominal proposals, 112 million square feet, meaningfully above where we've been. That's a function of a few things. One is just more space to lease. We have some increased vacancy in the portfolio. And this is also a function of just how the next 12 months of overall looks. And there's a little bit more there as well. This is why we added, for those who've noticed, a new line just this quarter, which puts that proposal activity in the context of what is available to lease. You see that measured 42% this last quarter, which we would characterize, and you can see when you look at the chart, as normal. Justin Meng : Thank you, Steve. Operator, next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Camille Bonnel with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Camille Bonnel : Good morning. The pace of development stabilization seems to be tracking ahead at this halfway point of the year. So, was wondering, how does this compare to what was budgeted in your guidance? And out in the West Coast, it looks like you've made some good progress stabilizing some of these developments. So, can you talk to some general terms on rents versus underwriting and how much of that was new leases signed in the quarter? Thank you. Dan Letter : Yes, thanks for the question, Camille. This is Dan. I'll handle the question here. So it was a big stabilization quarter for us. Certainly development leasing has slowed a bit. I think the best way to look at our development portfolio is look at the whole book of business. Don't look at it necessarily on a quarter-by-quarter basis. So if you look at that, the whole $6 billion development portfolio, all $35 million feet we're trending to our long-term margin of 24% to. 25%. So if you look at our 20 year average, it's in the high 20s. So feel really good about. Our development portfolio. Justin Meng : Thank you, Camille. Operator, next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Peterson with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Jonathon Petersen : Great. Thank you. So I was looking at your top tenant list. It looks like an increase in square feet lease to Amazon and Home Depot. We're hearing from other people that Amazon is more active this year. Whether you want to talk about them specifically or maybe we can frame it. In the context of what impact is some of these larger players in the market being more active in leasing have on the overall market. Like are people waiting for them to make decisions before we start to see an uptick in activity. Is that kind of what's happening right now? Dan Letter : Yes Jon. This is Dan. Thanks for the question. So what you're pointing to is our top 25 list where. You saw some big completions come into the operating portfolio. Those were decisions that were made a year ago. And sure, we've had some success with Amazon this year. I would actually talk about the e-commerce segment overall. E-commerce has been very strong. We talked about this happening multiple quarters ago, before it was a story, and it's played out as exactly as we expected. E-commerce continues to be strong. Amazon was a little quiet for us this last quarter, but at any given time, they're are our top customer. We've got a lot going on with them, and it's a very strong segment for us. Justin Meng : Thank you, Jon. Operator, next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Caitlin Burrows : Hi, everyone. Maybe just on the transaction market, I think Tim, earlier you mentioned how the depth of buyers is deeper and the disposition you did was at a materially higher valuation now versus. 2023. So I guess. What are you guys seeing from an acquisition potential on your side who is selling and kind of your opportunity there in the near term? Dan Letter : Hi, Caitlin. Thanks for the question. Yes, we have seen the transaction market open up. I would say normalize. We're hearing from the brokerage community that they're doing. A lot of broker opinion of values, so we expect to see. The transaction market continue. We've had a lot of success in the disposition we've outperformed across the Board. In our disposition business which is why you saw us move our guidance up. We definitely want to take advantage of the market as it's opened up. And we have also been turning over all sorts of interesting opportunities. And many markets around the globe, and we're really excited about our acquisition volume for the year. Hamid Moghadam : Yes, the other thing I would add to that, Caitlin, is that you have closed end funds that are coming to the end of their lives, and those portfolios need to be liquidated. And the investors generally because of what's going on in their portfolio not just in real estate, but also in other private asset classes need liquidity because they have outstanding commitment. So there's pressure from those guys to realize these sales and industrial real estate has been one of the places that their performance has been really great and crystallization of those values is important. So it's a natural course of things. And you have some deferred sales volume. That was put on suspended animation for the last 24 months. That's now coming through. But generally, I would say the transaction market is very good right now, with multiple offers for good portfolios and the sweet spot is a couple of $200 million, I would say. Not mega deals and not timing deals, but sort of in the $100 million $200 million range. Justin Meng : Thank you, Caitlin. Operator, next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nick Thillman with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Nick Thillman : Hi, good morning out there, Tim. You kind of mentioned the uptick in new lease proposals. Maybe just wanted to dig in on retention for the next 12 months. Are you expecting that to be historical averages and then also continue to see kind of free rent uptick as the elevated concessions. Does that spur demand a little bit. Just want a little more color on that. Thanks. Tim Arndt : Sure. Nick. Thanks. On the retention front, we typically forecast between 70% and 80%. Think of it as 75, and that's a good number, and I would characterize that as our expectations over the coming several quarters and then free rent. I think we may have discussed this recently. I would view free rent as. Just reverting to mean levels. We had kind of is another area where we had some surge pricing, if you will. Some much lower free rent over the last few years. And now the market normalizes as at different pace in different places. It's coming back to a more normalized level as well. Justin Meng : Thank you, Nick. Operator, next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question. Vikram Malhotra : Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. So I guess just two parts. One, Chris could you just update us, sort of, your view on the, I think, $175 million. Of net absorption, sort of what you anticipate for the second half, and then, I guess. You also mentioned sort of the rolling rent growth projection. Could you expand upon that in context of your three year view that you provided at the Investor Day on occupancy and term NOI growth? Chris Caton : Hi, Vikram. Thanks for the question. It's Chris. So as it relates to demand, just for those following along, net absorption in the first quarter was $26 million square feet, 27 million square feet. We have it at $43 million square feet in the second. And so, we expect 40 to 50 million square feet in net absorption. I think that's the tone that Tim had in his script and that we have here on the call for you. That'll leave - us with a full year net absorption on 160 million to 170 million square feet. Tim's going to take the rest. Tim Arndt : Yes, Vikram, in terms of the three years, the way we think about that, we clearly have an environment now where the window of time that, we think about the three years in has shifted. We've highlighted that we think rents are going to continue to fall modestly in the coming 12 months, grow thereafter. But the time that is then left, to measure up to the end of 2026 has, of course, been shortened. If we look at that same period, the end of 2023 to the end of 2026, our sense is that rents are going to be flat then, to modestly positive over that entire period. But we would couch that as rent that's really been deferred, that the window's moving and not ultimately lost. Hamid Moghadam : Yes, one other perspective I might provide to you is that the big change since our 4% to 6% three-year forecast, has actually been in concessions. So those concessions have, I mean, in other words, if you had two forecasts, one for asking rents and one for effective rents, the effective rent one has been affected more since our Investor Day when we laid out that assumption. Not all of it. The face rents have come down in Southern California, certainly, but most of it has been expansion in the concessions. And we see those burning off over the next 12 months as markets come into, even the weaker markets come into balance. Just to give you a sense of something that Chris mentioned before, Southern California accounts for about 23% of our rents over the next 12 months. What we categorize as sort of the weakest market, are another 21% of our rental profile for the next 12 months. And only 56% of the rents rolling over in the next 12 months are in stable or healthy markets. So, this is really a Southern California problem where it's both an expansion in concessions and a reduction in face rent. Fortunately, and this is really important. Southern California is the market with the largest mark-to-market in the next 12 months, even with the declines that we're projecting. So there is pretty good downside protection, in fact, upside protection, if there's such a word, on those expiring rents in Southern California. So, ironically, the weakest markets have the most mark-to-market, certainly in the near term. Justin Meng : Thank you, Vikram. Operator, next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. John Kim : Thank you. I wanted to ask about the occupancy trajectory for the remainder of this year. At NAREIT, there was some discussion that this would dip below 96% in the near term and then recover. Is that still on the table, or are you now past that risk given the end of the quarter at 96.4%? Hamid Moghadam : Thanks, John. And I realize this was also Blaine's question that I missed earlier, so thanks for coming back to it. The 96% comment was very specific about where we thought the second quarter was going to land. I would say that the year-to-date average that we have so far, we're around 96.6% year-to-date. The midpoint of our guidance is 96.25%. That just reflects some tougher roll and so a little bit longer lease-up time that we see in new leasing. I hope it's conservative. I suppose there's that possibility, but we feel good about the range that we've established. Chris Caton : One other way of - and I think this was in Tim's prepared remarks. I think the quality of the portfolio manifests itself in two ways. It manifests itself in terms of a premium in occupancy, which if anything has expanded in this market environment, because when markets are really tight, people don't have a choice. They can't be picky about the quality of space. Pretty much everything leases. But as markets get more normalized, softer in some cases, business goes towards the higher quality businesses. So it's hard to predict the absolute level of occupancy, certainly quarter-by-quarter, because one or two leases, even as large as our portfolio is, can really move around the numbers. But I can tell you our premium, I'm very confident of our premium in occupancy, compared to the rest of the market. I think it's going to expand even further. Justin Meng : Thank you, John. Operator, next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed with your question. Vince Tibone : Hi, good morning. Cap allocation guidance implies an acceleration of starts in the back half of the year. Are these all mostly planned logistics starts, or are there some data centers in there as well? And related to all this, kind of what markets would you be comfortable starting a spec project today in the current environment? Dan Letter : Vince, hi, it's Dan. Thanks for the question. So I think, well, first of all, your question around what's in our start volume. That is entirely logistics that you see there. And the better way to think about where we're going to build, is look at the sheer amount of opportunities we have. We have $40 billion worth of opportunities in dozens of markets around the world. We've raised the bar on spec. We take it through a rigorous process, pay attention to the market fundamentals, and look at every deal on a deal-by-deal basis. So, we have many markets around the world that we'll be building in this year. And I think decisions that we make, on a deal-by-deal basis may change between now and when we start. So it's hard to peg anything, certainly, right now. Hamid Moghadam : But if you're asking for specific names of markets, I would say Mexico is super strong. Nashville, Houston, the Southeast, pretty strong and demand there. Northern Europe is very strong. So those are the places you're most likely to see spec development starts. Justin Meng : Thank you, Vince. Operator, next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks, good morning. I wanted to talk about your data center business. Given the updates you provided, at least from outside looking in, it seems like you're ahead of your five-year plan for three gigawatts of deployment. I'm not sure if that's correct, but maybe you can just comment on incremental changes in demand you're seeing in that business? Hamid Moghadam : We are more optimistic about our data center business, since the time of our Investor Day. I think where some of those numbers come from, Ki Bin. Part of it is, we've done some excellent recruiting in terms of specialists in the sector that, have joined the team and are very excited. And secondly, the energy team that we have, the renewable energy team that we have, has excellent relationships with utilities. And that's something that oftentimes is missing, in a lot of data center companies that have just got the real estate component. And obviously we know the five hyperscalers really well. And in this environment, the ability to finance and deliver and execute becomes super important. These are mission critical deployments for these companies. And it is increasingly difficult for private players that don't have a balance sheet, to compete in that market. So, we think the competitive position for a lot just both, because of talent and balance sheet, are just going to get better and better going forward. Justin Meng : Thank you, Ki Bin. Operator, next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Michael Mueller : Yes, hi. Where do you think we are in terms of 3PLs resetting their footprints? Hamid Moghadam : Hi, Mike. Thanks for the question. So the 3PL market is really an interesting dynamic right now. What we're seeing is certainly slack in the system, more acute in Southern California, where there are simply just more 3PLs, almost double the average across the U.S. And that's where they took up a lot more space during COVID. Now, you can't deliver for a customer in a market that you don't have space. And a lot of the excess space that 3PLs have, is scattered throughout their networks. By way of example, one of our top 25 customers came to us recently and said, we have six to seven percent excess space in our network. Yet a 750,000 square foot need emerged in a major market, which led to a long-term, very large lease for us. Chris Caton : Yes, one way to think about the 3PL market is this, that 3PLs basically serve two purposes. Some 3PL business and volume comes from players that just want to outsource that activity to somebody else, because they want to focus on their own business. And what I consider that to be base-load business, it doesn't act any differently than leases that are directly entered into by those companies, those principles. Then there is sort of the surge component of 3PLs. That is the component that is likely to be more volatile. On the way down, when markets are becoming softer, you expect that component, to actually suffer more. And when the markets are in the upswing, that's where you see the excess activity. The base part stays pretty consistent, with the rest of the portfolio. Southern California, to be specific, has in the low 30% range, in terms of 3PL share of the business. Now, a lot of that is base-load business, but some of it is search business. Versus the average of the U.S., which is about 18% of the total portfolio, is leased by 3PLs. So obviously those markets with bigger exposure to 3PLs have more of this problem on the search component. Justin Meng : Thank you, Mike. Operator, next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Michael Goldsmith : Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. You continue to remain confident on the intermediate term outlook, particularly on the demand side. So maybe just to sum everything up that we've heard already today, what evidence do you see today that gets you excited? And then can you kind of walk us through, how you see the timing of the recovery playing out? Thanks. Hamid Moghadam : Look, predicting market cycles, particularly when you've got a couple of wars going on, you've got a Fed that's at an inflection point, with respect to interest rates. And you've got a Presidential election coming up, which is, obviously with the events of this weekend, and are that are highly volatile. You've got three major things going on. And to the extent that you're asking us for very specific forecasts. Let me tell you, we're not that good. And you should know that. But what gives us confidence? We can argue whether the full recovery of the market is six months or 12 months or 18 months. I frankly think this is just my sense, having done this for 40 years that, the Southern California markets that are the softest are going to stabilize the latest in about 12 months out. And the other soft markets are a matter of between now and 12 months. And more than half the markets are actually, they don't need to recover, because they've never unrecovered. They've been going straight up. So, I think you're talking about the next 12 months as various markets sort of turn the corner. If I were going to pick a number, and I think if you kind of get your head into January of next year. The Presidential uncertainty will be gone. I'm pretty sure that the Fed uncertainty will be gone. So, we'll be down to the political starts. And what we know for a fact, which is not a prediction, is that start volume is very low. And replacement costs have continued to go up. Construction costs have moderated, but exactions on land and approvals and entitlements, those continue to go up. So, I'm super confident about the long-term, strength of our business. And calling it over quarters or even couple of quarters is really difficult, but if you want an answer, you have it. Justin Meng : Thank you, Michael. Operator, next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Todd Thomas : Hi, thanks. Hamid, just following up on that a little bit, I'd be curious to get your thoughts on another maybe uncertain item, the potential impact tariffs might have on trade and industrial real estate in the U.S. And just, whether conversations you're having today with tenants, or prospective tenants might be impacted as a result. And really, does that change anything, potentially, how you think about allocating capital globally? Hamid Moghadam : Yes, that's a really good question. So, first of all, I think there's a race between both parties on tariffs. So, I'm not sure which outcome is going to lead to more tariffs. Probably the Trump outcome, which is a higher probability at this point, is going to lead to more tariffs, specifically on China. But at the end of the day, I think what you need to remember is that we are in supporting the consumption side of the supply chain. We've never focused on the production end of the supply chain. So the same amount of goods, volume of goods, needs to get - consumed in these markets. With respect to specific tariffs on China, all that business as part of China Plus One strategy of a lot of suppliers has already moved to other markets. Most of them are in Asia. A lot of them are in Southeast Asia. Some of it has shifted over to Mexico, particularly on the Northern border. But at the end of the day, they're going to get consumed where the people are in the U.S. So, we don't see a radical demand shift between markets or in terms of overall need for our kind of product. So that's the main driver. The second order effect is, to the extent there are tariffs, Economics 101, you're going to have higher inflation and that could cause the Fed to relax slower. And that will have obviously a headwind effect on the overall economy, which in turn will affect demand for industrial real estate, and everything else. So, I'm not worried at all about the primary effect, the direct effect of China, the way people think about this China-LA connection, and the fact that that's somehow going to be under pressure, because the containers are going to land in LA. We don't really care where they come from. But the second order effect, which most people don't think about, I think is kind of important. But, that will be a problem in everybody's earnings calls if it were to materialize. Justin Meng : Thank you, Todd. Operator, next question. Operator : Thank you. Our last question will come from the line of Nicholas Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. Nicholas Yulico : Oh, yes. Hi, thanks. You talked earlier about the transaction market pricing improving. Can you relate that to the strategic capital revenue? How should we think about kind of where the funds are valued right now, whether there could be upside potential revenue for that versus on the fund flow side, what you're seeing? Hamid Moghadam : On our fund valuation, I can confidently tell you that we have turned the corner in both U.S. and Europe. We were early adjusting our values, and I think we're now on the good side of the cycle. I think in a lot of other people's funds, they've been dragging their feet in adjusting the real values part of it - parts of, some of it intentionally and some of it not intentionally, because the appraisers are always backward-looking. And until there's data and it takes time for data to reflect itself in the comp set, those values haven't adjusted. So I think the market will continue to experience the decline in values that really occurred six, nine, 12 months ago, but are just now being acknowledged. I think we've already passed that, and our funds will be going up in values, because of a more direct link between our valuation process which is, by the way, independent. That's really important to also understand. A lot of these funds don't do independent appraisals and others. So you may hear mixed messages on that, and that's just, because we've been ahead of the curve. As to the second part of your question, which is fund flows into industrial real estate, there is a tremendous amount of money that has been raised and not spent in acquisitions and by investment managers. And my experience tells me that that money is going to get spent. And so, I think that's going to be the source of capital for a lot of transactions going forward. In terms of new allocations to industrial real estate and everything else, remember these portfolios are under a lot of pressure, because they've had office buildings that have declined in value 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, which has been the biggest component of their portfolios. So, they're under pressure and they're looking for more liquidity as opposed to being in a front foot forward investing mode. So I think, the volume of new capital allocations to all kinds of real estate will be slow coming back, but it is on the upswing. It's just slower coming back then most other cycles. Justin Meng : All right. So I think that was the last question. Thank you again for your interest in the company and everybody enjoy the rest of the summer. We'll see you pretty soon hopefully at Groundbreakers. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the Prologis Q3 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce you to your host, Justin Meng, SVP, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. Justin, you may begin. Justin Meng : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or other SEC filings. Additionally, our third quarter earnings press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP, and in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. I'd like to welcome Tim Arndt, our CFO, who will cover results, real-time market conditions and guidance. Hamid Moghadam, our CEO; Dan Letter, President; and Chris Caton, Managing Director, are also with us today. With that, I'll hand the call over to Tim. Tim Arndt : Thank you, Justin, and welcome to everybody joining our call. Before diving in, I'd like to share our concern for those affected by the recent hurricanes in the U.S. and Europe that impacted our employees, customers and communities. Thankfully, our teams are safe and their proactive customer outreach and assistance has been outstanding. Our property sustained limited damage for such strong storms. Overall, we are pleased with our operating and financial results as the third quarter played out to our expectations. While occupancy and rent softened against the backdrop of positive yet subdued demand, we continue to deliver impressive net effective rent change due to the still powerful lease mark-to-market embedded in our portfolio, which bridges us through this soft patch to the next cycle of rent growth. Turning to the quarter, core FFO, excluding net promote expense, was $1.45 per share and included in net promotes was $1.43 per share. These results were slightly ahead of our forecast and the quarter included approximately $0.03 of income from the Prologis Ventures' exit. Period-ending occupancy was 96.2% [at our share] (ph), nearly 300 basis points above the market as the flight to quality continues. Net effective rent change was 68% and cash rent change was 44%. We captured over $90 million of NOI by rolling leases up to market. The portfolio produced net effective and cash same store growth of 6.2% and 7.2%, respectively. Revenues were impacted by approximately 35 basis points of bad debt, which is elevated from our normal 15 to 20 basis points. While bankruptcy filings are on the rise broadly, the good news is that the space we've taken back as a result has had embedded rental upside of over 60%. Our overall portfolio lease mark-to-market finished the quarter at 34%, representing $1.6 billion of potential NOI. Finally, on the balance sheet, we raised $4.6 billion of new debt across Prologis and our funds at a weighted average rate of 4.6% and the maturity of approximately nine years. In terms of deployment, we had a very active quarter. We started over $0.5 billion in development projects, including incremental capital to an existing data center development now pre-leased to a hyperscale customer with a turnkey buildout. We expanded our land bank, driving our potential development opportunity over $40 billion, which now includes our first two projects in India that support over 5 million square feet of new development. We deployed over $1.4 billion in third-party acquisitions. Year-to-date, we have acquired over 14 million square feet of strategic assets at an estimated 20% discount to replacement cost. We started development on 54 megawatts of new energy systems. Our momentum here is building, and we continue to have and we expect to have generation capacity well over 600 megawatts at the end of this year, with good line of sight to our 1 gigawatt goal by the end of 2025. As mentioned, Prologis Ventures had a successful exit of an early round investment in the Japanese workforce solution, [indiscernible]. This produced a 9-times multiple on our investment, realizing a 65% IRR. Beyond the economics, our strategy and supply chain venture investing has delivered valuable insights for Prologis and our customers. Finally, FIBRA Prologis, our strategic capital vehicle in Mexico, successfully closed a tender for the shares of Terrafina, of which it now owns nearly 80%, enhancing its leadership position in one of our best-performing and highest-growth global markets. Turning to the operating environment, conditions remain soft in many of our markets, and as we've described over the last few quarters, this is despite healthy GDP and consumption growth. We ascribe the weaker relationship between economic output and industrial absorption to the availability built into the supply chain through COVID, originally earmarked for resiliency, but now available to operators as a source for cost containment. But ultimately, the ability to rely on this [excess] (ph) is diminishing as utilization reaches a level that will force decision making and expansion, the pace of which will vary by market. Many customers are making progress in reducing this capacity through growth, while others are gaining efficiencies through consolidation. In the end, it's all serving to hold net absorption below pre-COVID levels, impacting rents. Globally, we estimate that market rents decreased approximately 3% this quarter and roughly half this amount when excluding Southern California. As we noted before, Southern California will take the longest to reach equilibrium. While activity has improved, the remaining amounts of excess capacity will simply take time to work through. That said, it's important to keep this context, our SoCal portfolio generated 84% rent change on commencements this quarter even as it led the globe in market rent decline, a great example of the interplay between the spot reduction in rents against our lease mark-to-market. This has us well positioned to navigate the cyclical downturn and taking it a step further, we see the structural investment case for SoCal as strengthening with new supply barriers that come into effect from recently enacted legislation and continued focus on carbon emissions. As always, the rent picture is mixed and there remain many markets that are either flat on rents or positive, such as Houston, Atlanta, Nashville, Northern Europe, and of course, LatAm remains very strong. Overall, bottoming process is underway, and we expect demand to remain soft in the near term. Looking ahead, market vacancy is at or near its peak and will hover there as utilization improves, and global rents will bottom sometime mid next year. It stands to reason then that the near-term growth will be affected by the path market rents and occupancy have already taken. We remain very positive on the outlook for our business, as vacancies are still low in the context of history, starts are down significantly, and supply deliveries are falling below their pre-COVID levels. Additionally, with replacement cost rents approximately 15% above today's market, even with land values marked down by a third from their peak, the long-term growth trajectory remains highly favorable. Moving on to capital markets, we've seen improved pricing and activity in the transaction market and values continue to grow. U.S. and European values, again, increased approximately 1% in the quarter, and Mexico saw an impressive 2.2%. With the bottom seemingly in, our strategic capital business had its most productive quarter in the last two years, raising a net $460 million. Overall, it appears private market sentiment is stronger than the public markets. During the quarter, transaction volumes increased and unlevered IRRs compressed another 25 basis points. In terms of guidance, which I'll review [at our share] (ph), we are tightening our forecast for average occupancy to a range of 96% to 96.5%, and also tightening our forecast for cash same store growth to a range of 6.5% to 7%. Our net effective same store growth is for a range of 5.5% to 6%, which has been tightened and reduced modestly at the midpoint for the increased non-cash write-offs we expect from higher bankruptcies in the balance of the year. We are tightening and slightly reducing our G&A guidance to a range of $415 million to $425 million, and tightening our range for strategic capital revenue to $525 million to $535 million. We are reducing our overall development starts guidance to a range of $1.75 billion to $2.25 billion, which reflects both slow decision-making in build-to-suits and discipline on our part in deferring new spec development amid stubborn demand. Of course, we are in the best position to react quickly as conditions warrant with approximately $8 billion of pad-ready development opportunities. We see attractive acquisition opportunities in the market and are increasing our guidance here, taking our range up to $1.75 billion to $2.25 billion. And finally, the forecast for our contribution and disposition activity is increasing to a new range of $3 billion to $4 billion, reflecting the improving transaction market and stronger fundraising and strategic capital. The positive spread between our buying and selling IRRs year-to-date has been approximately 100 basis points. Putting it all together, we are increasing our GAAP earnings to a range of $3.35 to $3.45 per share, core FFO, including net promote expense, will range between $5.42 and $5.46 per share, while core FFO, excluding net promote expense, will range between $5.49 and $5.53 per share, a $0.01 increase from our prior guidance. Core FFO, obviously, excludes our development gain guidance, but it's noteworthy to highlight our increase to a new range of $375 million to $425 million. In closing, we had a very productive quarter in which we delivered strong operating results, high occupancy, high rent change and meaningful same store growth in a challenging market environment. Alongside that performance, it's clear that we are focused on the future as evidenced in our very active deployment, spanning our global reach and product offerings. The company is well-positioned to capitalize on the structural demand for logistics real estate and our focus on operational excellence, customer centricity and value creation will continue to drive strong performance across all market cycles. Consistent with this drive for excellence, I'd be remiss to not highlight our annual GROUNDBREAKERS forum, which we just held in London. It featured some of the most innovative companies of our day, and we heard from the likes of the legendary Fred Smith of FedEx and Sir Tony Blair amongst many others. GROUNDBREAKERS deepens our customer relationships and builds upon our thought leadership across the supply chain and its emerging foundation for clean energy and digital infrastructure. It's great to see so many of you there, and a replay of the event is available on our website. With that, I'll hand the call back to the operator for your questions. Unfortunately, Hamid is feeling under the weather today, and while he's on the call, he may be limited in his responses. Operator? Operator : Thank you, sir. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Please proceed with your question. Tom Catherwood : Thank you, and good morning, everybody. So, Tim, you noted mixed signals in the industrial markets, vacancies are up, obviously, customers are taking longer to make decisions. And on the macro side, obviously, we see if the consumer continues to be stretched. But you also noted there was strong leasing activity in Q3. You've raised acquisition guidance now for the second straight quarter. So, kind of how do we square these two kind of seemingly divergent topics together? And what do you think it takes for customers -- what kind of catalyst you think it takes for customers to move from hesitant when it comes taking space to more active as we move into '25? Tim Arndt : Thanks, Tom. Thanks for the question. Look, if I just start with the acquisitions guidance, I would probably read that as our confidence in the long term for starters. We're very engaged in the business. We are very much looking at markets that we see to build additional scale and deepen our presence and our teams are scouring the market in that regard looking for opportunities. One thing implicit in my remarks that I'd like you to really hear is, we're not really a buyer at market IRRs. We are typically looking for unusual constructs, upmarket deals, deals that we source where we're looking for a premium to prevailing IRRs such as those we see in our appraisals. So, take that as you're looking at our activity in the acquisitions market. In the near term, we just recognized that utilization has really been the culprit of keeping a lid on demand. And the message we're trying to send here is that, that has an end to it. Ultimately, customers will work through what's available to them, and it's going to be sort of a spillover out of utilization into growth in occupancy. Justin Meng : Thank you, Tom. Operator, next question? Operator : The next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Vikram Malhotra : Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. I guess just, Tim, maybe another one to perhaps square. You talked about the bottoming process on the call and the press release. I guess, bottoming, not bottom. But do you mind sort of scurrying that with two things? One, just your updated view on market rent growth over the next 12 months? And two, just reducing development starts, I thought the plan originally was to keep starts high, so that when the market inflects in '25, you'd sort of have the product ready. Can you just square the bottoming in those two things? Thanks so much. Dan Letter : Yeah. Thanks, Vikram. Let me start with your first question, which was squaring the rent growth in the near term here. And let me highlight that we are near or in an inflection period right now. This is a time when forecast have very high variability. So, the quick answer to the near-term view on rents is pretty much in line with where we were 90 days ago. Customers are very engaged, but they are just not making decisions. So, we expect this softness in rents to continue throughout this period. But the way we actually think about this is for the long term. 90% of our leases roll after the next 12 months. So, even if rents fluctuate minus 3%, plus 3%, it doesn't really matter. It won't have significant impact on our long-term earnings nor the value of the business. And the real driver for rent growth is replacement cost rents, which Tim said in his script, replacement cost rents are 15% higher than today's market rents. So, the gap between the market rents and the replacement cost rents will ultimately lead to this rent growth. And so, if you think about us being at a peak vacancy or close to peak vacancy, which we expect to endure for a certain segment -- portion maybe throughout 2025 with a recovery in that vacancy emerging late next year and then accelerating thereafter. So, we know the trend and we'll capture that rent growth in the longer term. We just don't necessarily know the slope of that recovery and it's really hard to peg that. And honestly, when it comes down to it, guessing on the short term has never been one of our strong suits. We're running Prologis for the long term. And the second part of your question had to do with our development starts. Development starts, so we push those off. Tim talked about discipline in the script here. Build-to-suits, while the pipeline remains pretty strong, it's just flat. Feel like for the last four quarters, we've been talking about customers kicking the can down the road. That's continuing and those build-to-suits are just moving into next year. And then, from a spec perspective, we are going to maintain that discipline that we've always maintained. We don't want to be building into the market fundamentals in many of these markets today, but that's not categorical. So, for example, this quarter, we actually started two buildings in Atlanta. Atlanta's headline vacancy is 9%. But then, we look at the infill site that we have with no competition, we're only 150 basis points vacant. We don't have any spec risk. So, we decided to move forward to that. So, we move forward with that building or those two buildings, so we could be building into those [dirt] (ph) of completions a year out, like we've been talking about doing. So, it is happening here and there. We just see that accelerating more in the coming quarters. And then, let me finish with the fact that we have a very large development book right now, $5.5 billion underway on Prologis share, and that's 33 million square feet of development underway. And then, we also have $40 billion worth of opportunities right now in our land bank. And so -- and actually 30% of that land is entitled ready-to-go and then two-thirds of that is actually pad-ready, which means we really truncated the timeframes to go vertical with those sites. So, we're going to be able to execute the strategy just like we talked about over the last several quarters, we're just -- you're going to see that happen a little bit later. Justin Meng : Thank you, Vikram. Operator, next question? Operator : And the next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. John Kim : Thank you, and good morning. So, it looks like you had a $0.06 beat on a core FFO this quarter. I think, Tim, you mentioned part of that was the Prologis Ventures exit that you had. And also, on our numbers, you had better-than-expected currency gains and income taxes. I wanted to make sure that was the case. But also, why only raise full-year guidance by $0.01, given the beat you had during this quarter? Tim Arndt : Hey, John, thanks for the question. I would say, you see it as a beat, we don't see it as a beat. These were events that we were forecasting for the year and for the quarter. And I would also highlight that the FX gains I think you're seeing in the P&L might be better offline, but there's complication between unrealized and [on realized] (ph). You're probably seeing a lot of unrealized there and you have to flow through to the FFO statement to understand what's actually realized. Suffice it to say, very probably say you're never going to hear FX as variance item in our FFO as we hedge all of our FFO earnings as I think you know. There was an item in tax where we had some sale of investment tax credits in the quarter. We'll have fewer of those in the following quarter. But, once again, that together with the ventures gain were all previously contemplated in our guidance. Justin Meng : Thank you, John. Operator, next question? Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Steve Sakwa : Yeah, thanks. Good morning. I guess, on Page 12, you guys break out your ending occupancy by unit size. And I noticed, sequentially, there was a much bigger drop on the spaces that were kind of below [250] (ph). So, I'm just wondering if you can sort of speak to the strength of the bigger boxes, maybe the softness in the weaker. And then, just on the Southern California, I noticed that your lease percentage in SoCal went up about 120 basis points sequentially. So, any comments just around Southern California demand either by product type or LA versus Inland Empire would be helpful. Thanks. Chris Caton : Hey, Steve, it's Chris Caton. Thank you for the question. I'll start with Southern California and then I think a couple of us will jump in on different trends by size category. So -- and I think I'll answer your short-term question, but it's worthwhile to step back and look at the broader trends in Southern California and take a medium-term view. We think Southern California has a really bright outlook. Couple of legs to that stool. The first is, look, Southern California is a major consumption center. It's a $2 trillion economy, it's got 23 million people, and the region is growing. Employment is up in the last year, and jobs are up 3% since 2019. Second leg of the stool, Southern California is growing as a gateway for international goods. Container imports into the ports of LA and Long Beach are up 12% since 2019. Now, global manufacturing patterns are shifting, as I think you're aware, but they remain positive for Southern California. Asian imports in the United States are up 21% since 2019 on an inflation adjusted basis. Now, yes, I think you're aware China should be down and it is, but only 6% since 2019. And so, this is a testament to the China Plus One strategy that we and others have been talking about. There is significant growth in all other Asia. It's up 40% since 2019. Third leg of the stool on the outlook for Southern California, barriers to supply, they are high and rising. Southern California has had scarce land availability, onerous municipal requirements, and now there are state restrictions with the adoption of State Bill AB 98. These together restrict future new development. Now, Steve, as you're asking, I think it's important to recognize headwinds remain for Southern California, as Tim alluded to in his script. Customers are still working through spare capacity, having taken more than they needed when vacancies were zero, but these long-term trends will be more important over time. As it relates to the very short-term cyclical contours, as you're asking about, a couple of things have emerged in the last 90 days. One is demand remains soft in LA and there is a clear sort of upgrade cycle emerging there, where Class A is outperforming Class B. Generally demand is better in the Inland Empire, given the growth of the ports that I described earlier. And Orange County has a low market vacancy with -- and that position is better to recover earlier. Now, you asked after the first size -- the first question as it relates to size, I'm going to turn that over to Dan. Dan Letter : Yeah, just quickly on the sizes, certainly, we've had some impacts on the smaller size spaces in China that you see there, but when I look at this number quarter-over-quarter, the smaller size space is typically underperforming on an occupancy basis to the other three buckets. As a matter of fact, quarter-over-quarter, three of the four buckets were down slightly. So, nothing really specific as it relates to historical trends. Justin Meng : Thank you, Steve. Operator, next question? Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Michael Goldsmith : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. You talked a little bit about how the customer has remained engaged, but then, also, there remains a lot of sources of uncertainty and presumably that's related to the macro and interest rates and the election. So, I guess, the question is, within the context of maybe past cycles or other periods of uncertainty, how quickly, given that demand get pick up as that uncertainty has been released? So, said another way, like, when some of these factors stop weighing on the customer, does that translate to an almost immediate translation to demand or does it take a couple of quarters to ramp up from there? Thanks. Chris Caton : Hi, Michael. Yeah, I heard your question as how quickly can demand recover as uncertainty ebbs. So, a couple of thoughts on that. First, I think we should have a measured outlook on demand. Customers are engaged, but taking their time in terms of making decisions. And we really are focused on spare capacity in the supply chain getting used up, as Tim described earlier, and we're seeing that happening. So, utilization, early this year, at the beginning of this year, was below 84%, and it's mid-80%s -- 84%s now. So, it is indeed building, which will be a catalyst for our customers to take space. And indeed, there are these tailwinds of economic growth, of trade growth, of consumption growth, and the acceleration of e-commerce continues. So, I think it we should, just over the near term, have a measured level of optimism here. We just need to watch the market advance. Justin Meng : Thank you, Michael. Operator, next question? Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Craig Mailman : Hey, good afternoon. Maybe just circling back to capital deployment here on the development and acquisition front. I guess, on the development side, very helpful where you think replacement cost rents are relative to new starts. But from a land basis perspective, could you give us a sense of kind of what's in that ready-to-go bucket that actually kind of works from a basis perspective given where rents are today? I guess, that's one part of the question. And then the other part, just on acquisitions, you guys are talking seems like more bullish. You raised guidance here. Just curious kind of globally where you think the best uses of that or best targets are today? And how do you fund that, given, on a stabilized basis, your equity is probably up around 6% at least on my numbers? Are these more debt financed? Are these through the fund business? Can you just give us a sense of where and how you kind of want to put that capital out and whether you're interested in more bigger private portfolios or the historic bigger platform deals you guys have done in the past? Tim Arndt : Hey, Craig, it's Tim. Let me congratulate you on getting three questions in there at once. Let me just start on the funding and the balance sheet and pass it back to Dan on the capital deployment pieces. I would still view us as having a lot of capacity in our own balance sheet, which has been incredible, I'll say. We've raised a lot of debt proceeds over the last few years, while our normal capital recycling has been a little bit slow. But if you look at our supplemental, look at our credit ratios over the last few years, including this morning, they're very healthy and consistent and even quite strong for our rating. So, we've been able to tap into that. And the reason that's been occurring is that, EBITDA growth, as what really guides that capacity, remains very strong alongside the earnings growth. Alongside that, I would also say that, as mentioned in my remarks, strategic capital fundraising is improving, not just what we raised in the quarter, but I feel like the body language and call notes that we're getting suggest that it will continue to be strong. So, I think a resumption of more normalized levels of capital recycling via contributions is very close and that has been, as you know, our principal source of funding in any event. Dan Letter : Yeah. Then, Craig, on the deployment front, we own land in about 50 -- over 50 markets globally. The average vintage year is about 4.5 years old, 5 years old. And the mark on that book is about 120% of book. So, we have plenty of opportunities that pencil today. And then, keep in mind, a lot of that land, the other 60% or so is in its way through entitlement where we create a lot of lift ourselves as well over time. So, we don't have a shortage of opportunities. And keep in mind, as we underwrite these deals, we put them in at market value. So, we just have such a wide dispersion of where this land bank exists. And then, we also have a land bank that consists of covered land plays and options that you actually don't see in that land bank. So, again, not a shortage of opportunities. And it's tough to point to any place globally where we want to allocate more than others. It's not the way we've ever operated. We're at scale in virtually every market in which we operate. So, it really comes down to looking at every deal on a deal-by-deal basis and doing the highest quality deals. Justin Meng : Thank you, Craig. Operator, next question? Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Caitlin Burrows : Hi, good morning, everyone. The earnings release commentary mentioned how Prologis is a partner of choice to meet supply chain, digital and energy infrastructure needs. So, could you give an update on the digital and energy side? I know it's a pretty open-ended question, but with those business lines newer, what has been the focus year-to-date for them? Kind of what are the next near-term steps? And also, can you clarify what portion of the starts -- development starts in the quarter might have been data centers? Thanks. Tim Arndt : Hey, Caitlin, I'll just pick up the energy piece and maybe pass it to Dan for data centers. As we mentioned, we have a good run rate of new energy starts in the quarter, we're talking about the solar business, both generation and storage, over 50 megawatts in the quarter, which puts us at a really good pace run rate that has been accelerating in our solar program, which two years ago was broadly focused really just in the United States, has now expanded around the globe and is active in Europe, LatAm and Asia. So, we feel, as I mentioned, really good about the escalating pace of that activity and where it's ultimately going to get us over 2025 marching towards that 1 gigawatt goal. Dan Letter : Yeah, then, on the data center front, overall 2024 has been, call it, a bit of a plan -- exceeding the plan. We have focused on two things, building our pipeline and building the internal capabilities. Both are going extremely well. We have 1.6 gigawatts of secured power of which 490 megawatts is currently under construction. We have an additional 1.4 gigawatts in advanced stages where we have high visibility to that procurement. And then, another over 1.5 gigawatts of applications submitted in dozens of different locations around the world. So, very pleased with the pipeline we're building and the team we're establishing there. You asked about the third quarter start that you see there, that is a powered shell building that we started a couple of years ago with a few different customers we're working with that ended up turning into a turnkey deal. So, what you see there is a conversion from a powered shell to a turnkey. Justin Meng : Thank you, Caitlin. Operator, next question? Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed with your question. Vince Tibone : Hi, good morning. Could you share net absorption and supply completions in the quarter for U.S. portfolio? And then, also provide any update to your full-year outlook for supply and demand? It sounds like nothing big change or surprised too much during the quarter, but just want to confirm your outlook and get the recent actuals there. Chris Caton : Hi, Vince, it's Chris Caton. Thank you for the question, and your read on the quarter is correct. So, we saw 40 million square feet of net absorption in the quarter, 63 million square feet of completions. So, let's just zoom out and talk about the year and talk about how it's -- the direction it's heading, because we are progressing through this bottoming phase. So, net absorption, this year, will amount to 160 million square feet, and that's against deliveries that are 300 million square feet. So, naturally, market vacancies are rising. They're rising up to 6.8%. And it sounds like you're very familiar with historical data, so you'll know that 6.8% is a low number in the totality of history. But there's something that's happening in the background that's really -- that doesn't always get attention we're talking about, which is the emptying of supply chains. So, deliveries peaked a year ago at 135 million square feet per quarter, and they fall into that number I gave you 63 million here this quarter, so less than half in terms of the decline, and they'll continue to decline into next year. At work here, in the backdrop, also is starts are very low. We have them at 40 million, 42 million square feet in the quarter. So, when you put all this together, what you find is the under-construction pipeline, which is about 215 million square feet today, is at its lowest point since 2017. So, we're going to be going into 2025 with a relatively low level of supply and an opportunity for demand to improve as we progress through this uncertainty in the spare capacity. Justin Meng : Thank you, Vince. Operator, next question? Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ronald Kamdem : Great. Hey, just two quick ones, sort of following that last question in terms of asking in a different way. When are you thinking availability sort of peaks to the portfolio? I remember it was 4Q '24. Has that sort of changed at all, once that pushed out to? And then, the second part of the question, when you think about the same store cash NOI guidance for this year, are there any sort of one-timers, puts and takes or comps that we should be aware of as we start to think about 2025? Thanks. Chris Caton : Hey, Ron, it's Chris Caton. So, I think you said portfolio, but I think you might have meant market. So, I'm going to answer for the market in terms of vacancies. So, we still have vacancies peaking in the later part of this year, but just taking a cautious stance on the direction of demand and that uncertainty and that spare capacity that we've described, we think you should anticipate a measured pace of basically elongation of the peak over the course of the first part of next year. You'll see recovery emerge later next year and accelerate into 2026. I think that's something Dan described earlier. Tim Arndt : Hey, Ron, it's Tim. And then, just picking up the second part of your question, with regard to cash same store, the answer would be no. I can't think of anything that would be one-time in nature. As we report that metric, we exclude things like lease termination fees that might fall in that category. So, that's not there anyway. The only thing I could maybe think of is free rent is normalizing back to market norms. There could be a little more free rent next year than we want to see in the first half of this year, but that would be relatively small. If I widen out a little bit though and take the question further on same store out in the future anyway, it's probably a good opportunity to just level set people on. We've seen market rent declines thus far this year. We've been clear about them continuing a bit into next year. We've highlighted that occupancy is bottoming here and going to sit here for a handful of quarters. So, looking ahead to next year, it's probably best to think about just the things that we know. And what I would -- the way I would assemble a same store view going into next year would be to look at, for starters, the rent change either on a cash or net effective basis that we've had thus far this year. We know that that's got a half year effect going into 2025. And then, also make some assumptions about what rent change might be in 2025 similarly following the half year convention. I think if you put that math together today and think about a [roll level] (ph) at 10% or 11%, on a net effective basis, you probably find yourselves as -- at something like 5.5% to 6% component of -- for that component of same store. Now, net effective basis, of course, we would have the impact of the [indiscernible] from the Duke portfolio that takes something like 100 off of that. So, you're squarely somewhere around 5. And then, the last thing to think about is just occupancy trends. And again, things really murky to forecast occupancy from here, but you could at least take into account the fact that occupancies have been declining over the course of this year. So, with standard reason on at least an average basis this year to next, that would probably be an additional headwind on same store. Justin Meng : Thank you, Ron. Operator, next question? Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Blaine Heck : Great, thanks. Good morning out there. We've heard a lot recently about strong demand from Asian e-commerce and 3PL companies. So, I was hoping you could talk about whether you signed any deals with those tenants, and just your view on whether this is just a massive pull forward of demand ahead of potential tariff increases or whether you think those groups will continue to lease space into 2025 and beyond? Chris Caton : Hi, Blaine, it's Chris Caton. Thanks for the question. I'll give you a concise answer and then I'll provide you some context, because this is a growing category. And so, yes, we are leasing with these customers, and yes, we think they will continue to lease space into next year and beyond. And no, we don't really think it's much related to any sort of pull-forward as you asked. But let's just zoom out and understand kind of the broader context here. So, to understand really all these 3PL companies, it is productive to first start with the Chinese e-commerce platforms. They're enjoying rapid growth this year, last year. We're talking about 25%, 50% annual growth and more depending on the concept. And so, the Chinese 3PLs, obviously, are performing the logistics here and they're growing rapidly. I'd say they represent roughly 20% of net absorption this year. And what it also offers their businesses are diversifying as now they compete for all contracts, not just Chinese e-commerce. And so, many of these customers are positioned for growth. They're signing long-term leases and they're investing in their space. You ask after this concept of a pull-forward, and so it is natural to think about how might tariffs and changes in tariffs affect these customers. And a couple of ways to think about it. First, the growth of this ecosystem. This is one that connects Asian manufacturers with American consumers. And what they're doing is they're bypassing the traditional import distributors, and they're doing this in response to the past tariffs, the margin pressure brought about by those tariffs. So, in summary, of that point, some of the growth this year is simply a shift in business model in response to past tariffs. The second point, which I described earlier, is, look, Asian imports are up 21% versus 2019 on an inflation-adjusted basis, and this is really fueled by that China Plus One manufacturing model, and the growth of Asia ex China -- imports from Asia ex China, which are up 40%, as I said. And then the third, in the details of tariffs is something called de minimis provision. You may be aware, this is a provision that allows goods to come in and avoid tariffs under a certain value. These are likely to be wound down under a wide range of scenarios, but it's worth knowing that these are only 3% goods coming in under the de minimis provision, only 3% of Asian imports. And so, look, as the category matures, this is a growth category for sure, there will be winners and losers. And please know that we employ the same rigorous credit evaluation process here as we do with any and all of our prospective customers. Justin Meng : Thank you, Blaine. Operator, next question? Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Nick Thillman with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Nick Thillman : Thanks. Good morning out there. We noticed, in the past few quarters, there's been an uptick in lease commencements with term less than a year in the core portfolio, roughly like 50% of commencement. I guess, wanted to get some more color on those tenants specifically. Are these tenants opting for shorter-term renewals? These new tenants kind of looking for swing space given an uncertain macro? Anything you could provide there would be pretty helpful. Thank you. Tim Arndt : Hey, Nick, it's Tim. I think that's an element of it, some uncertainly on the part of the customer. I think more so it's recognition in certain cases we're being very strategic about the level of rents in some of our markets and what's being locked in now. And there's just bespoke certain situations where we see an opportunity to keep it on the shorter end, where we see some of the rent recovery happening sooner than the overall forecast. And so, there's a strategy in that part as well. Justin Meng : Thank you, Nick. Operator, next question. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Josh Dennerlein : Hey, guys. Thanks for this. I'm filling in for Jeff today. Just looking at the occupancy across the regions, it looks like Asia and LatAm kind of sort of stepped back. Any kind of trends to flag in those two regions versus like maybe what you're seeing in the U.S., where it looks like it's more stabilizing at this point? Dan Letter : Thanks for the question, Josh. Really this comes down to the impact from China. Japan certainly has some oversupply issues we're dealing with as well, but our portfolio is in good shape there, but it's really China is the impact. Justin Meng : Thank you, Josh. Operator, next question? Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Mike Mueller : Yeah, hi. Are there any specific pockets of the portfolio or regions that are driving higher development stabilization guidance? Dan Letter : Thanks for the question there, Mike. No, this development book is spread all around the globe. So, there's no trend to point to. Justin Meng : Thank you, Mike. Operator, next question? Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Nicholas Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. Nicholas Yulico : Thanks. I just wanted to clarify a couple of numbers. I think you said that the market rents globally were down 3% this quarter. And then, last quarter, the forecast was for the next 12 months down 2% to 5%. So, are those the same periods on measurement? I just want to -- because it would seem then that forecast was already hit this quarter alone based on the sequential decline, unless I'm confusing something here. Thanks. Chris Caton : Hi, Nicholas, it's Chris. Thanks for the question. So, the time periods are going to be different. You have the correct numbers. And as Dan described, we continue to see rents be soft in our view today is now a different rolling 12-month view, and we remain cautious on rents over that time period. And as Tim described in his script, rent softness should persist into the middle part of next year. Tim Arndt : Look, I might just add that it's fair to interpret the way you're looking at those two numbers that, yeah, we may be at the -- depending how you count at the north or south end of that range, maybe that will be closer to 5% over that preceding 12-month period that we described last quarter than not, given what we saw so far in the third quarter. Justin Meng : Thank you, Nick. Operator, next question? Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is [Aditi] (ph) on for Mike. I was just wondering what drove the jump in CapEx this quarter? Thanks. Tim Arndt : I'm sorry, I didn't hear the end of that question. What drove what? Unidentified Analyst : The jump in CapEx for this quarter? Tim Arndt : A lot of that is focused -- and you can see the components of CapEx in the supplemental between property improvements and leasing commissions, tenant improvements. There is a lot of leasing in SoCal, in particular. It's just a sort of a reminder that rents there are very high, the commissions wind up in turn being quite high. And then, as you -- it's quite clear from our supplemental as well where we have property improvements disclosure that can be pretty lumpy between quarters and it was a bit elevated here in Q3, but on a trailing 12-month basis, very normal. Justin Meng : Thank you, Aditi. Operator, next question? Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Todd Thomas : Hi, thanks. First, can you just talk about leasing demand and absorption trends throughout the quarter a little bit, how the quarter played out a bit, July through September? And then, also in terms of the space utilization and comments that you've made around capacity in the portfolio, which seems to be an important input into your forecast, your portfolio skews toward consumption and I'm just curious if you have any thoughts around the utilization metrics from inventory levels or I guess inventory build, ahead of the election and potential tariffs and also the East Coast port strikes and whether you might expect to see some volatility on utilization in the near term. Chris Caton : Hey, Todd, it's Chris Caton. Thank you for the questions. Answer on the first one is demand was steady through the quarter, so no meaningful acceleration or deceleration, which I think is what you're asking. As it relates to utilization, I think maybe we step back and cover some of the numbers that I alluded to earlier. So, there is an upward trend this year. The year started below 84%, like I think I mentioned, it's in the sup, I think you said 84.4%. And there is noise from quarter to quarter, which is a combination of goods coming in and coming out, as well as just the methodology, which is survey based. I think if you step back and consider some of the context, one thing I want to add to your consideration is, look, import activity really shows there's an effort to restock supply chains. But this is occurring amidst perhaps more resilient consumer than was expected. And so, those consumers are pulling goods out of supply chains and kind of keeping utilization a little bit below what we consider to be a normal level. Justin Meng : Thank you, Todd. Operator, next question? Operator : Next question comes from the line of Brendan Lynch with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brendan Lynch : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I'm hoping you can help us reconcile the guidance from the December Investor Day. It sounds like rent growth is around 0% through 2026 and vacancy is going to peak out a little bit higher than what you had been expecting. So, how should we think about your core FFO CAGR over the next three years? Tim Arndt : Hey, Brendan, it's Tim. I would probably just put that aside. I think there's been so much change right now in the markets that as I was doing earlier and describing the way to think about 2025 and just take a fresh look of where we are now with regard to the lease mark-to-market, a dip in rents over the next 12 months or whatever that period is before we start to see it accelerate again. It's really important to appreciate how much that 34% lease mark-to-market will sustain earnings. If you kind of map out that is where rents will start a bit of a decline for the next 12 months and then an increase thereafter, you'll see on rent change alone five, six, seven years of very strong mid-single-digit same store growth just out of the rent growth component by itself. So, that's the underpinning. Over the long term, you're going to think about the adders to that as you march down to the bottom-line between financial and operating leverage. Admittedly, there's some headwinds on the financial leverage piece in the near term as interest rates are rolling up, but over the long term, that will be productive to the bottom end again. And for Prologis, then you're really going to think about all the other things that we do, which is really growth in capital deployment, our higher and better use activity in data center, strategic capital, ventures, the energy business, these are all adders to our growth that are complementary on their own, but I would say synergistic back to the core business as well. And that's how you should think about long-term growth for us. Justin Meng : Thank you, Brendan. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Steve Sakwa : Yeah, thanks. Just wanted to clarify just two things. I think, Chris, you said something about 25% of, I think, the demand this year was from these Asian 3PL companies. I just -- was that your portfolio specifically or were you making a comment about the market or Southern California in particular? I just wanted to sort of clarify that. Chris Caton : Steve, thanks for the opportunity to clarify. That's broadly across the marketplace. Tim Arndt : Okay. Thank you. That was the last question here. I'd like to just wrap up by making a few points. First, the quarterly results met our expectations. Secondly, we think we're in a bottoming process that's underway, with completions very clearly in a downtrend. Lastly, capital values are increasing, fundraising has improved and we're actively investing in the future of our business and we're in this for the long run. With that, we look forward to speaking to you at the upcoming conferences and again next quarter. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a great rest of the day.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Justin Meng, Senior Vice President, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Justin Meng : Thanks, Jamali, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2024 earnings conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. I'd like to state that this call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance, and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K and other SEC filings. Additionally, our fourth quarter earnings release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP. And in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. I'd like to welcome Tim Arndt, our CFO, who will cover results, real-time market conditions, and guidance; Hamid Moghadam, our CEO; Dan Letter, President; and Chris Caton, Managing Director are also with us today. With that, I'll hand the call over to Tim. Tim Arndt : Thanks, Justin. Good morning, everybody and thank you for joining our call. I'd like to begin by recognizing the devastating wildfires still affecting Los Angeles. We operate a large portfolio there, but more importantly, we have colleagues, customers, and their communities struggling with the aftermath. It's too early to predict the full ramifications, but we'll continue to support the response and stay connected with local and state leaders as well as service organizations as the region works to recover. We have no doubt that a vibrant and dynamic Los Angeles will emerge from this crisis even stronger. In our business, the bottoming process across our markets continues to progress. Leasing in our portfolio accelerated following the U.S. election, and the pipeline has started the year at healthy levels. During the quarter, we signed more than 60 million square feet of leases, a company record, and saw interest diversify across customer profile, size requirements and markets. Looking ahead, we believe market vacancy is topping out and rents will inflect later this year. Turning to our results. Core FFO, excluding net promote income was $1.42 per share and including net promotes was $1.50 per share. Our full-year results ended at the top end of our guidance range, and in the end represent 8.4% growth over 2023, putting us in the 86th percentile of all REITs. Average occupancy was 95.8% for the quarter, 96.3% for the year. Net effective rent change during the quarter was 66% and on a full-year basis was 69%, activity which added over $340 million in annualized NOI. Our net effective lease mark-to-market finished the year at 30% and represents a further $1.4 billion of incremental NOI. And finally, net effective and cash same-store growth during the quarter were 6.6% and 6.7% respectively. In terms of capital recycling, we had another active quarter. Importantly, we contributed $2 billion of assets to our strategic capital ventures, bringing the full-year total to over $3.3 billion. While capital flows in 2024 remain challenging, we did raise over $1.7 billion across the platform, driving the growth in third-party AUM by over 7%. We disposed of over $900 million of assets in the quarter and acquired approximately $450 million. And stepping back, over the full-year, we disposed of over $2.1 billion and reinvested into a similar $2.3 billion of acquisitions at a positive IRR spread of 170 basis points, demonstrating our ability to self-fund and earn a return regardless of the yield environment. Included in our disposition activity for the quarter was the sale of our Elk Grove data center in Chicago. Elk Grove was a logistics asset that we converted to a powered shell before securing a build-to-suit turnkey transaction with a hyperscaler last Fall. We simultaneously identified a buyer and closed in the fourth quarter at very attractive economics. Because the property was owned by USLF for our structuring, procurement, leasing and monetization efforts, Prologis earned a value creation fee of $112 million, which was not included in our prior guidance due to the uncertainty and the timing of the transaction. Elk Grove is a great showcase of our data center development capabilities, which are more comprehensive than most. Today, we have 1.4 gigawatts of secured power and 1.6 gigawatts in advanced stages of procurement. Over the next 10 years, we see 10 gigawatts of development potential across our portfolio. As a platform, we have the team, customer relationships, development and energy expertise, advanced procurement capabilities and the capital required to create significant value for our shareholders. Turning to market conditions. As mentioned, quantitative measures of the market such as vacancy and changes in market rent met our expectations. More importantly, indicators in our pipeline and dialogue with customers have us encouraged that conditions are set for a recovery in net absorption, leading to a bottoming of global rents. It's worth highlighting that our non-U.S. portfolio fared better in rent growth over 2024, particularly in places like Japan, the U.K., Southern Europe, and Latin America, which all grew over the year. Customer engagement is improving and we saw a notable increase in activity amongst our larger global customers who often lead in the recovery of demand as we've seen in past cycles. The improvement in decision-making is reflected in our proprietary metrics where proposals increased earlier in the year, lingered for a period of time and then began converting more meaningfully after the election. That leasing pattern translated to elevated gestation also seen in our metrics. Our '25 forecast for net absorption calls for approximately 20% improvement over 2024, gradually building over the year. We also know that completions will decline significantly, contributing to a supply forecast that is approximately 35% below '24. As such, we expect a decline in vacancy over the year, which will pave the way for rent growth. Longer term, we continue to see the path for uplift from market rents to replacement cost rents, a dynamic that will build upon our already significant lease mark-to-market. Today, we see replacement costs as 50% higher than in-place rents. The capital markets were active with fourth quarter transaction volumes that put the year in total back to pre-COVID levels. Unlevered IRRs have compressed to the mid-7% range, and valuations as reported in our third-party appraisals had the globe marginally up this quarter. Capital raising in our open-end vehicles was more muted in the fourth quarter as investors paused to take in changes in the yield environment, but we remain confident in our expectation for growing capital raises in 2025 as the pipeline is solid and conversations are active. In terms of guidance, which I'll review at our share, we are forecasting average occupancy to range between 94.5% and 95.5%, which contemplates a dip in occupancy over the next one to two quarters, some of which is seasonal before rebuilding closer to 96% by the end of the year. Net effective same-store growth is forecasted to be in a range of 3.5% to 4.5% and cash in the range of 4% to 5%, each driven by still significant rent change. Our G&A forecast is for $440 million to $460 million and our strategic capital revenue forecast calls for $560 million to $580 million. As for deployment, we are forecasting development starts to range between $2.25 billion and $2.75 billion. We will continue to be selective in our starts and clearly have a lot of capacity to grow this number as conditions, rents and returns warrant. As a reminder, data center starts are excluded from this guidance, given their lumpiness. That said, we do expect new projects to begin in 2025, likely in a range of 200 to 400 megawatts. Acquisitions will range between $750 million and $1.25 billion and our combined contribution and disposition activity will range between $2.5 billion and $3.5 billion. Our development portfolio now stands at $4.7 billion with estimated value creation of $1.1 billion, $450 million to $600 million of which we expect to realize this year. Finally, 2025 will be an important year for our energy business where our forecast is to hit our 1-gigawatt goal for solar generation and storage by year-end. In total, we are establishing our initial GAAP earnings guidance in a range of $3.45 to $3.70 per share. Core FFO, including net promote expense will range between $5.65 and $5.81 per share, while core FFO, excluding net promote expense will range between $5.70 and $5.86 per share. In closing, we navigated a challenging year in terms of an operating environment, clearly unwinding from the overbuilding of the COVID era. Our ability to generate over 8% growth in such an environment is a testament to the resiliency and breadth of our company. We're pleased with the increase in activity and improvement in sentiment that we've seen so far in the last two months. And working through great space amid the favorable supply backdrop will further establish the foundation to build occupancy, grow rents, and increase values, unlocking the full earnings potential in our core business. And finally, we're very excited with what the future holds for our data center and energy initiatives. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator? Operator : Thankyou. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your questions. Ki Bin Kim : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Can we flesh out the 2025 guidance a little further, please? And maybe you can touch on items like lease spreads, bad debt that you're assuming. And on the occupancy front, the 95%, which is a little bit lower, I'm curious how much of that is same-store versus, let's say development leasing or development projects coming into the pipeline that might not be leased up for some time of period. Thank you. Tim Arndt : Hey Ki Bin, it's Tim. So on rent spreads, we're going to see them in the 50% range this year, the five handle over the course of this year, still quite elevated from that lease mark-to-market, even with market rent growth a bit slower in the last several quarters. Bad debt, we normally are expecting something on the order of 20 basis points. Our history has been a little bit better than that. Our forecast is allowing for between 20 and 30 in this coming year as we enter the year with a few known tenants that we're watching. But we'll see that normalize hopefully by the end of next year. And then in terms of occupancy, it's -- the two pools are so large, the average occupancy and ending occupancy, that we're expecting broadly for the company are not very different than what we'll see in the same-store pool. Justin Meng : Thank you, Ki Bin. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Samir Khanal : Good afternoon everyone. Hey Tim, you guys made some positive comments around leasing. But when I look at the space utilization chart, it was a bit surprising that slipped from the last quarter. Maybe reconcile the trends you're seeing there with the term of some of the comments, you're talking positivity around leasing inflection, et cetera. Thanks. ChrisCaton: Hey Samir, it's Chris Caton. I'm going to take it. Thanks for the question. Good to hear from you. So at the end of the day, we think there's some good news in this data and let me unpack that for you. As you look at the course of that material data over the year, utilization was largely ranged down in the low 84% range and we do think a more typical level is 85% or higher. Now recall, over the course of 2024 and in particular in December, look, consumption growth and holiday sales were unexpectedly healthy, and that pulled goods out of the supply chain. And it led to this dip in utilization that is not really representative of the true trend. Customers instead are telling us that their utilization is rising, and we're starting to hear reports of inventory building taking shape in 2025. Justin Meng : Thank you, Samir. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Vikram Malhotra : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So just on market rent growth, do you mind, A, just giving us what the actual realized market rent growth was across sort of the U.S. versus other regions, maybe even just coastal, non-coastal? And in the same view, if you can give your updated forecast for '25 or just the 12-month rolling number you gave. Thanks. Chris Caton : Hey Vikram, Chris Caton. Thank you for the question. So we had rents decline roughly 2% in the quarter. And yes, there was a differential between coastal and non-coastal although it had narrowed in the fourth quarter. As it relates to 2025, Tim described an outlook. Look, most markets are stable but we expect modest further decline from here in a handful of soft submarkets. Later this year, we expect an inflection in positive growth to emerge, excuse me. Now how that comes together for a view on 2025, there are scenarios where rents are flat, down, or up. And look, calling an inflection point within a single 12-month window is difficult and we do not want to offer that sort of sense of false precision. Dan Letter : This is Dan, let me pile in on that. One thing to keep in mind is it's a point I made on the call last quarter is 90% of our leases actually roll beyond the next 12 months. So to his point on whether rents fluctuate up or down two points throughout the year, it's not going to impact the long-term earnings for this company or the value of the business. And as Tim mentioned in the script, replacement cost rents are actually 15% higher than market rents, and that's 50% higher than in-place rents. And it's the gap between the market rents and replacement cost rents that are really going to be the ultimate driver of rent growth into the future. Justin Meng : Thank you, Vikram. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ronald Kamdem : Hey, just going back to the dev starts, obviously picked up this year versus last year. I guess I'm curious if you're thinking about commentary of leasing accelerating, positive absorption. What do you need to see for us to see that number start to ramp back up to the $4 million to $5 million zip code? And do you think you could see it this year? Dan Letter : Yes. Thanks, Ron. What I would say is our starts last year, we deliberately slowed those starts. We continue a very disciplined approach to our spec program. We also saw a number of very large build-to-suits push into 2025. So what are we looking at right now? We're looking at the market conditions improving so we do expect completions to come way down. They're actually down 70% from the peak -- excuse me, starts are down 70% from the peak as well. So the market itself is heading in the right direction, and we're waiting for that rent to improve, for the returns to improve. One thing to keep in mind is we do have $5 billion under development right now and 30 million square feet. We do have this very large land portfolio with $41.5 billion worth of opportunities, and that's in literally hundreds of sites around the globe. And we've been making infrastructure investments, site work investments so we can really narrow the vertical build time and flip the switch when the time is right. Justin Meng : Thank you, Ron. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Michael Goldsmith : Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. You stated in your prepared remarks, leasing in your portfolio accelerated following the U.S. election, and the pipeline has started the year at healthy levels. Are you able to frame the magnitude of improvement? And from your conversations with tenants, what is driving that improvement? Is it more certainty? Is it more willingness to spend? Is it the deals that were dying on the CFO's desk are now getting put through? Any helpful commentary -- any commentary there would be helpful. Thanks. Dan Letter : Yes, Michael, I'll start on this and maybe Tim or Chris will pile in. What we saw last quarter was really kind of a tale of two different markets. The first part of the quarter, first five, six weeks, it was very quiet. And we did hear from customers, they're waiting to see what was going to happen with the election. That was coming off five, six quarters of delay in decision-making due to cost of capital or geopolitical concerns. And then post-election, it really was this boom, that we've had really 10 weeks of very solid decision-making and it's unlocking previously stalled deals. So we're seeing resiliency from e-commerce, general goods, electronics, food and beverage. Really, it's pretty broad-based where we're seeing this activity and what we're hearing from these customers. We're also hearing from these customers -- we still have a group of customers saying that they're working through gray space. They're focused on cost containment. But then I'll tell you, 3PLs last quarter broke the record that they had in the third quarter of 25 million square feet of leasing. So 3PLs in the back half of the year leased nearly 50 million feet. So kind of a tale of two markets and some really robust leasing from several customer segments. Chris, go ahead. ChrisCaton: Yes. Just in terms of the specific quantification, Tim already discussed record lease signings. And in terms of pipeline, the pipeline is up 17% January-to-January, specific response to your question. TimArndt: Yes. The only thing I would add is that actually the end of the fourth quarter and the beginning of the first quarter are usually slow times. So I think the bump was even more important or different than history. Justin Meng : Thank you, Michael. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Craig Mailman : Hey, good afternoon guys. Just on the occupancy piece, just a few follow-ups. Tim, maybe you mentioned a couple of tenants that you're monitoring for bad debt and then you also mentioned seasonality. Could you frame up, within that range of 100 basis points at 94.5% to 95.5%, how much of that's sort of seasonality driven versus how much of it is potential bad debt that may not materialize? And then that was helpful on the pipeline update. But I'm just kind of curious here also how you guys are managing the portfolio with an expected market rent inflection potentially by the end of the year. Are you guys prioritizing occupancy over rate at this point to kind of run the portfolio? Or are you holding back at all kind of holding on price? So just kind of curious how much toggle there is in that occupancy guide on kind of what you know versus how you're managing the portfolio. Tim Arndt : Hey Craig, let me start by unpacking it this way. As we look at our outperformance to market on occupancy historically, and I'm talking maybe 10, 15 years now, we have a history of outperforming the market maybe 100, 150 basis points. And I would just put a side note on that, that over that period of time, that portfolio has been improving greatly and we expect that outperformance will grow. And in fact, in the recent quarters, it has or even years now, we've seen that outperformance level nearly double. If you put the elements of our forecast together with not only for our own portfolio but also what we see in the market, we think we're actually going to see this level of outperformance that we have today, which sits in the high 200 basis points, probably where we end the year. What we do see is that in our own portfolio, just again circumstances to particular leases, that our average will be a little bit lower. So my point here is you can almost ascribe that difference that you observe in average occupancy to those rolling leases that are going to take a little bit of time to backfill, but we do think we'll rebuild that overall outperformance level by the end of the year. And then in terms of managing for rent growth or occupancy, as you can imagine, it's not just a market or submarket conversations even down to the lease level, given our revenue management capabilities. And we have a lot of markets and submarkets at different stages of recovery. So those are really one-off decisions. Hamid Moghadam : Yes. The only thing I would add to that is that credit loss averaging under 20 basis points across the cycle. The highest it got was in the global financial crisis, which was crazy. It was almost 100 basis points. But even in the beginning of COVID when the world was in a panic, it got to 50, 60 basis points and then went right back down. So the credit loss issue is never going to be the big -- I shouldn't say never but it hasn't been a big explanation for that change. And one other thing. We actually track a statistic which is the value pickup on credit loss. And because there's such a big mark-to-market, on anything that we lose to credit loss, we need to lease it within the next 15 months before we are worse off. In other words, if the space remains empty for less than 15 months, given the mark-to-market, we actually make money on that space. Sure, it's a short-term earnings impact but it's actually a long-term value driver. Justin Meng : Thank you, Craig. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Caitlin Burrows : Hi, everyone. Maybe for a while now, it has seemed like the new leasing was a tougher part of the business but that renewals were doing well, so high retention, maybe slightly less price sensitivity. How would you describe that renewal business now? Is there anything changing in the trends that you've noticed and when leases come up for renewal or tenants staying, and if not, why not? ChrisCaton: Hey Caitlin, it is Chris Caton. Thanks for the question. When we look at our pipeline, we still have many of our customers interested in renewing and that trend continues. But there are more new requirements coming to the market, customers looking to grow. And so we also have seen an expansion in our new leasing pipeline. So both things can happen at once. They are not mutually exclusive. Hamid Moghadam : Hey Caitlin, customers move because they may need more space or they may need less space, or they may need space in a different location. And oftentimes, that actually occurs within our portfolio. But when you're sort of 95% leased, the options are limited in the portfolio. So sometimes we lose them for that reason. But the preference of most customers in a stable environment is to renew. It's just less costly to do that. Justin Meng : Thank you, Caitlin. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. Nicholas Yulico : Thanks. Just turning back to the guidance. I guess, Tim, I was wondering if there's any way you could quantify a little bit more some of the impact on what feels like is going to be lower development NOI from stabilization this year versus last year. I mean, you do have the stabilizations and guidance at $2.5 billion. Last year was over $4 billion. So I imagine there's some NOI drag there. And then also if there's also a capitalized interest issue to think about? And I guess with the starts also having now picked up and planning for this year, is 2025 sort of at a worse point in terms of that year-over-year delta on how like development might be weighing on FFO growth this year? Thanks. Tim Arndt : Yes. Thanks, Nick. Look, you've got the right elements, of course. And the way I might even examine this question, if we look at same-store in '24 compared to bottom line earnings and then do the same embedded in our guidance for '25, pardon me, that delta between the top line and the bottom line is apparent. It's due to the factors you described. I would throw in that interest rates as well, even though nominally, when we move from 3.0% to 3.2% interest, doesn't sound like much, but on a percentage basis, that's a driver. The development start volumes being a little bit low to our capacity is starting to be seen as well. What I feel good about is that all the things we're describing here are normalizing, in some cases, below trend in others but are going to reset themselves to a new foundation for growth from here, which we're very confident is going to be back up in the levels that we've seen this company historically provide. Justin Meng : Thank you, Nick. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed with your question. Vince Tibone : Hi, good morning. Can you discuss rent trends at the market level in a little more detail? Specifically, could you provide how much rents increased during 2024 in your better markets and how much they fell in 2024 in your weaker markets? Chris Caton : Hey, Vince, Chris Caton here. So I think I'd start by saying let's not go market-by-market, detail-by-detail that we're a large global international business, but a couple of touchstones that we've had that I think are worth coming back to. So number one, if it's not clear, it should be that international markets outperformed in the domestic markets. Tim enumerated them on the -- in his script, but whether it's Japan, whether it's Europe broadly, and in particular, some of the geographies there as well as Latin America, that was a clear outperform. And then within the U.S., really talked about this dynamic of Southern California and the rest of the business. In Southern California, we had rents down 25% on a net basis so a meaningful reset in rates there. And so then by contrast, when you look at sort of U.S. ex SoCal, it was only down modestly in the year. Hamid Moghadam : Yes. And the best performing markets would be in single-digits up, and the worst performing markets other than SoCal would be in single-digits down. And just while we're on the subject of SoCal, just there are two issues that I think the market is not focused on. One is this whole discussion about immigration and its impact on labor supply and the impact of that on construction costs; and secondly, the pressure that the rebuilding efforts are going to put on material supplies and labor. I think all of those things are going to drive replacement costs significantly higher. And so that spread that you've heard us talk about, the 50%, I would bet that, that spread is going to widen significantly. Justin Meng : Thank you, Vince. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Blaine Heck : Great. Thanks. Can you give an update on your overall mark-to-market throughout the portfolio? And secondly, I guess, how should we think about the cadence of same-store NOI throughout 2025? You're coming off a fourth quarter at 6.7% cash same-store NOI. So should we expect it to gradually come down throughout '25 and end the year somewhere below that 4.5% cash midpoint? Or is there more nuance and seasonality in the forecast, given that you mentioned, I think that occupancy would build back up towards the end of the year? Any commentary there would be helpful. Tim Arndt : Hey, Blaine, it's Tim. For the first part on the lease mark-to-market, I described that it's about 30% at the end of '24. We really don't break that out for you in a very significant geographic detail. You can certainly take it away that it broadly is representing the United States and you know the state of rents in places like SoCal. So I'll leave it to you to unpack from there. In terms of the cadence of same-store growth, I would -- I think rent change is going to be relatively level over the quarters for that part of it, so it's really going to be a function of what's going on in occupancy. And I described that we think in the next coming quarters, we'll see a little bit of give back on occupancy is our expectation. I hope to outperform that, but that's followed by a rebuild. So you would see some lower same-store potentially in the front half and then it would grow in the second half. Justin Meng : Thank you, Blaine. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Please proceed with your question. Tom Catherwood : Thanks and good afternoon, everybody. Tim, if memory serves me, you previously talked about, I think, $7 billion to $8 billion of data center spend over the next five years. I think you mentioned 10 gigawatts of data center opportunities in your prepared remarks, which is likely above the top end of that previous range. Are we thinking of that correctly? And if so, what are your thoughts on data center spend as we look out over the next three to five years for Prologis? Dan Letter : Hey, Tom, this is Dan. I'll take that one. So yes, that's -- you're thinking about this correctly. You should think about 10 gigawatts over the next 10 years. We've built internal capabilities over the last one year, 1.5 years, and we've been just getting deeper on our pipeline and have a lot more confidence in the numbers that you've heard. Like we said, we've got 1.4 gigawatts secured power. We've got 1.6 gigawatts in the advanced stages of procurement. We've got another 1.5 gigawatts of applications that are right behind that. But all in, it's 10 gigawatts over the next 10 years. And that doesn't even touch upon the universe of opportunities. This is coming from a portfolio of 6,000 buildings and 15,000 acres of land that we own or control. So the universe of opportunities is much greater than that. Tim? Tim Arndt : Yes, I'll just come back to maybe what was also underneath your question there on the sheer amount of spend. And you see this quarter, Elk Grove, as I mentioned, a great example of the playbook that we have at the moment is to recycle and monetize back out of these assets. That may take a different form over time, but the point is we will free up capital. We have an internal risk budget set up for this business that is sufficient for the team to execute. Hamid Moghadam : Yes. One other thing, it's always not easy to translate megawatts into dollars. For example, Elk Grove started out being a powered shell and ended up being a turnkey. So that will maybe increase the capital spend by a factor or two. So we're more comfortable projecting megawatts than dollars, but regardless, we can handle it. Justin Meng : Thank you, Tom. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nick Thillman with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Nick Thillman : Hey, good afternoon. Maybe digging in a little bit more into the development starts and kind of maybe geographic mix and build-to-suit sort of mix of the two. I know you guys have tilted a little bit more ex U.S. on the development starts here in '24, but as '25, are you expecting to start more in the U.S. or what's the mix shake-out there? And then you noticed the pickup in the build-to-suit side. So is that still going to be a strong proponent of that start this year? Dan Letter : Yes. Nick, this is Dan. Last year was a slow year for development starts in the U.S. I do see that picking up. Hard for us to give you a mix at this point, because as I said in some remarks earlier, we have so many opportunities, literally hundreds of opportunities. And most of this land is ready to go. So we're going to pay attention on a deal-by-deal basis, market-by-market and make decisions that way. We do see build-to-suits improving year-over-year as well. Our long-term average on build-to-suits is about 40% of the overall development starts. Hoping to hit that number. We definitely had some big build-to-suits that moved from '24 to '25 so we're hopeful that those make it. Justin Meng : Thank you, Nick. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Michael Mueller : Yes, hi. What was the solar FFO contribution in '24? And what are you assuming for '25, given the growth that you're seeing in that business? Tim Arndt : Hey, Mike, in '25, across the Essentials businesses, I'll provide that in a little detail. We see probably $0.10 to $0.14 of overall FFO contribution from the three businesses, solar. It's pretty limited in mobility right now, to be honest. It's predominantly coming from solar and the operating essentials business. Across 2024, that number was $0.07 to $0.08. Justin Meng : Thank you, Mike. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Spector : Great. Thank you. I know Hamid touched a bit on some of the executive orders or discussions from yesterday's transition. I wanted to just follow-up on the latest discussion around tariffs, and if there's anything else to add to some of the executive orders that were executed yesterday? Thank you. Chris Caton : Hey, Jeff, Chris Caton here. So look, on tariffs, we follow the news just like you do, and it's really too early to speculate to how these policies will land and be implemented and the customer response. Couple of considerations. Number one is, look, our business revolves around consumption. 90% or more of the customer base is really serving consumers so that's really the critical area to track. Now as it relates to trade, we do think the historical precedent is instructive, and we stand by the views that we shared on our last call as well as the white paper we published in November. A couple of highlights there. Over the last eight years, trade has grown 30% on an inflation-adjusted basis, and supply chains adapted to changes in trade policy. So trade with China is effectively flat over those eight years, whereas Asia ex China is up nearly 75%. Mexico is up 40%. At the same time, over the same time period, U.S. domestic production rose only 3%. And really, the U.S. just doesn't have the labor to produce more goods here and so tariffs are inflationary. So trade policy earlier was crafted to accomplish industrial goals, while minimizing the risk to consumers, and the administration will be guided by having a strong economy and tariffs are counter to that. Hamid Moghadam : Yes. I would add just one comment. I think that Mexico and let's drag Canada into that because it's usually used in the same sentence, it's primarily an immigration discussion. Because at the end of the day, the combination of deporting people and wanting to put tariffs on, I don't know where the labor is going to come from, it's either going to come from China Plus One or it's going to come from Mexico. And my bet is that it's going to come from Mexico but under new immigration controls and policies. I think with respect to China, container doesn't care whether it's coming from Vietnam or China. It's going to be pretty much the same dynamic. And it's driven by geopolitics. It's not really driven by economics. At the end of the day, I think the new administration and the old administration were smart enough to understand that tariffs are highly inflationary. Forget about the narrative. But at the end of the day, given the limitations on labor, tariffs are going to be extremely inflationary. We're going to have them, for sure, we're going to have more of them. But I think they're going to be more moderated once the other political objectives are achieved. Justin Meng : Thank you, Jeff. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brendan Lynch with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brendan Lynch : Great. Thank you for taking my question. That was very helpful color on the tariffs and how we should think about them. Maybe you could just relay what the discussions you're having with tenants are about how they're viewing tenants or -- excuse me, how they're viewing tariffs. Are they pulling inventory into the U.S. faster than they would otherwise or taking more of a wait-and-see approach? Hamid Moghadam : I think some of the de minimis people have pulled more trade into the U.S. in anticipation of some of this. But that is only shifting volumes maybe a quarter or two. It's not going to be able to affect the long term. So there's going to be some noise in the numbers that you'll see in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year. But I think that the fundamentals are going to take over starting in the second quarter. Justin Meng : Thank you, Brendan. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Michael Carroll : Yes, thanks. I wanted to touch on the promote income recognized during this quarter. Is there something different with the data center sale that allowed PLD to earn this promote? And correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought the USLF didn't have a promote opportunity until the second quarter of 2026. So I guess, did this pull this forward? Tim Arndt : Hey, Mike, well, all of our funds beyond the three year recurring promote events or sometimes incentive fees can be earned at the end of the life of a closed-end funds. Our vehicles typically provide for promote opportunity upon completion of some kind of successful development. Now in funds like USLF or PELP, which are typically operating vehicles, you don't see very much of that. But here, we had a large development, redevelopment opportunity in Elk Grove that we frankly, I have to think of it this way, Prologis is building a business here. We're bearing all of the G&A and cost of this data center business that our funds are going to enjoy the benefits of. So we are structuring and have structured ways to get compensated for those activities, and that's what's reflected in this quarter. Hamid Moghadam : Yes. It's not just development. Remember, one of the big advantages that we have in this business over other people is that we can actually procure stuff ahead of time. And that oftentimes puts us in a position to be able to convert on leasing opportunities, because the time line for delivery becomes compressed. And obviously, to the extent we do that with our balance sheet, there's some value creation that comes out of that as well. So and we can do that because we have multiple data center opportunities. And as long as you're smart about procuring the right stuff that's fairly fungible, you can move it around. And all of that is done very transparently and working with the independent advisory councils of these funds. So yes, we have other opportunities to earn fees based on value we contribute. Justin Meng : Thank you, Mike. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. John Kim : Thank you. On data centers, given the amount of capital and capacity that you've highlighted today, any updated thoughts on establishing a data center fund or some kind of structure with recurring income? And then specific to this year, it looks like you have $100 million of data center developments that are your partners' share in your current pipeline. Should we assume some margin on this will be recognized this year as a promote income? Hamid Moghadam : Let me take the first part of that question and I'll let Tim take the second part. We have not yet made the decision as to what we're going to do with the capitalization of our data center business long term. Let me tell you what the current thinking is. The current thinking is that we are a developer, and that we'll monetize and sell these assets upon completion. And we use the capital that they generate as a way of expanding our core logistics business. That's the strategy today. We may expand that strategy to include a fund management approach, either a dedicated fund or possibly expanding the investment mandate of some of the existing open-end funds, obviously after talking to our investors about that, as a way of including some data centers within limits within those funds. That decision hasn't been made because right now, we're thinking about it as a funding mechanism for our core logistics development business. But we may change course that. One thing we will not do is hold 100% interest in data centers on our balance sheet because the capital requirements of that are going to be -- even for us, are going to be pretty significant. Tim Arndt : And John, it's Tim. Maybe I'll grab you off-line to see what you're looking at to believe some of the current activity is within funds. But it is not, it's on our balance sheet. Justin Meng : Thank you, John. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Todd Thomas : Hi, thanks. I just wanted to, first, follow-up on the comments about the post-election leasing that you've experienced. And thinking about the 2025 guidance, does the guidance and occupancy assumption assume that leasing interest or demand in '25 remains consistent with what you've seen in the last 10 weeks or so? And then also, not sure if I missed this, but can you provide what '24 net absorption was and what your expectation is for '25 and how that -- you expect that to trend throughout the year? Thanks. Hamid Moghadam : We actually prepare the business plan for this following year usually in the October, November time frame. So I would say the period was right bridging around the election. It was too early to see some of the activity that we've seen. I would say compared to where our head was at the time, we are more encouraged. But let's leave it at that and let's see whether this recovery has significant legs or not. But yes, we've put our plan together right before the election and have left it there. Tim Arndt : And as it relates to net absorption, we saw net absorption of 39 million square feet in the fourth quarter. That amounted to just shy of 150 million square feet in the year, and we are looking for 185 million, 190 million square feet of net absorption in 2025. And that is expected to build over the course of the year. Justin Meng : Thank you, Todd. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks for taking the follow-up. Just two quick ones. So you gave the GAAP NOI components. I'm just wondering if the cash NOI growth, I think you have like 3.5%, 4% bumps. Assuming the cash spread is probably in the 30s, but do you mind just bridging GAAP and cash NOI, number one? And then just number two on the net absorption view. I think Chris mentioned it will build through the year. But in the past, you sort of highlighted the rate environment is sort of crucial to that view. I'm wondering now what the offset is, given the view of rates might be stable. Maybe there's even a rate hike? Thanks. Tim Arndt : Hey, Vikram, that's for the cash same-store. As is always the case, the most kind of volatile difference that we can see between GAAP and cash ending the year is going to be what's going on in free rent. And we are seeing free rent levels grow back to, I'll say, normal amounts of the lease value. So that's our expectation for the year and reflected in our guidance. Chris Caton : Yes. And as it relates to net absorption, Vikram, Dan touched on the transition in customer engagement and thinking earlier in the call. And so as we look at 2025, that work, in our view, is really customers have been deferring decision-making. Now they see that the new administration is they have -- there's a decline in uncertainty, and that has translated to better decision-making and is part of the lift in net absorption that we expect over the course of 2025. Justin Meng : Thank you, Vikram. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed with your question. Vince Tibone : Thanks for taking my second question. How does the higher treasury rate impact your view of where unlevered IRRs and stabilized cap rates could head in the future? And ultimately, like how do you determine what is the appropriate yield for a new U.S. speculative development start? Dan Letter : Yes, Vince, I'll take that one. So first of all, there has been volatility in the 10-year for some time. And if you look at last year, the 10-year was bouncing 100 basis points up and down throughout the year, and we saw volumes actually grow back to pre-COVID levels. So deals are happening. I think there's this notion out there that there's this 1 :1 correlation between 10-year and value, which is just -- it's not the case when you look at the total return. There's many more considerations to take into investment decisions, replacement cost, the lease mark-to-market and what have you. So what does that mean for values for the year? I mean, we saw three of the last four quarters values uptick in our open-ended funds. We've not seen deals die, whether -- we had a big disposition year last year. We did not see any deals re-trade because of it. And we're seeing deeper buyer pools right now. Logistics is still a very attractive investable category for investors out there. And so we feel strongly that we'll see a pretty strong year on the transaction market, maybe a slow start to the year. As it relates to appropriate yield for spec, like I've said so many times in this call, we have just such a large universe of opportunities. We're always going to be looking for that spread, that 125 to 150 basis point spread from a market cap rate to our yield. Hamid Moghadam : Yes, let me add a little color to that. Look, and you can go back to calls a couple of years back when money used to be free. We always talked about the market not having price real estate with 0% or 1% treasury costs. Historically, the treasuries have been trading at about 200 basis points over the implied inflation rate. That's been kind of -- other than when the Fed has been doing weird stuff, that's been the norm. So given that inflation expectations were then 2% and now they're more like 3%, heading back down to 2%, let's call it 2% to 3%, that means treasuries are going to be 4% to 5%. I mean, that is where they should be and that's where they will be, okay? 4% or 5% treasuries. That means 7% to 8% IRRs unlevered gives you anywhere between 300 and 500 basis points of real inflation-adjusted return. That's appropriate for real estate, which is somewhere between stocks and bonds. So those are the relationships. I think the market just got used to free money for too long. And -- but the real estate market never priced assets as if that money was going to be free forever. Some of the leverage buyers may have had a different math on this. But in terms of institutional capital and what return it takes to attractive to real estate, those are the numbers. On the issue of margins, what's interesting is that Dan is correct. We look for about 125, 150 basis point premium over exit cap rates. We used to want that also when cap rates were 8% or 9%. It's just that with cap rates at 5% or 6%, 125 basis points is a lot bigger margin. So ironically, margins actually have increased even in this area in this period where there's been some weakness in the past year. Still our margins are way above our expectations and the way we underwrite properties. So I can't really explain that one, but the margins have been very healthy. And I think it's because it's so difficult to bring on land in some of these supply-constrained markets. Justin Meng : Operator, final question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Blaine Heck : Great. Thanks for taking the follow-up. Hamid, just taking a step back, I wanted to see if you could talk about your relative level of visibility into the operating environment, as you all were kind of formulating your outlook and commentary for this call. It just seems like there are a lot more moving pieces, with Trump taking office, the wildfires in L.A., tenants who have been taking longer to make decisions, the prospect of tariffs, deportation, amongst other things. So I guess how did you take all of those variables into account? And do you think there's maybe a higher level of conservatism built in because of all that? Hamid Moghadam : Look, let's be very frank about this. This company has never reduced guidance in the last 12 years. Last year, we reduced guidance as we saw the softness going in. Can I look you in the eyes and tell you there is not a degree of confidence -- conservatism built into our projections when you work through everybody in the system that's involved, all the way from the person who is leasing the space in the market all the way up to Tim? I can't look you in the eyes and tell you that. So there is a bit an ask even internally within the company, to be quite frank with you. My view is that the market is going to surprise people in the back half of the year. That's my view. I've been wrong before, but that's my view. I would say the rest of the team -- I shouldn't say the rest of the team. I would say the real estate people are generally there and some of our financial people are a bit more conservative. And there is no point to answer. There is a wide range of views on this. So you're smart. You figure it out. Dan Letter : Thanks. So that was the last question, and thank you all for joining the call today. As we wrap up, we have a few thoughts we'd like to leave you with. First, we're very optimistic about the recent activity and the improving customer sentiment, and we have expectations of stronger momentum throughout the course of the year. Second, we're making great progress in our data center business. We have a growing pipeline, a very skilled team. All of this is highlighted by this Elk Grove Village transaction. And then lastly, we're very confident in the long-term earnings power of this company. Looking forward to connecting at the upcoming conferences here or during the next quarter's call. Thanks for joining. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
